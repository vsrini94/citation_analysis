TI	-	The Changing Epidemiology of Invasive Fungal Infections.
PG	-	17-65
AB	-	Invasive fungal infections (IFI) are an emerging problem worldwide with invasive
		candidiasis and candidemia responsible for the majority of cases. This is
		predominantly driven by the widespread adoption of aggressive immunosuppressive
		"therapy among certain patient populations (e.g., chemotherapy, transplants) and"
		the increasing use of invasive devices such as central venous catheters (CVCs).
		The use of new immune modifying drugs has also opened up an entirely new spectrum
		of patients at risk of IFIs. While the epidemiology of candida infections has
		"changed in the last decade, with a gradual shift from C. albicans to non-albicans"
		"candida (NAC) strains which may be less susceptible to azoles, these changes vary"
		between hospitals and regions depending on the type of population risk factors
		"and antifungal use. In certain parts of the world, the incidence of IFI is"
		strongly linked to the prevalence of other disease conditions and the ecological
		niche for the organism; for instance cryptococcal and pneumocystis infections are
		particularly common in areas with a high prevalence of HIV disease. Poorly
		controlled diabetes is a major risk factor for invasive mould infections.
		Environmental factors and trauma also play a unique role in the epidemiology of
		"mould infections, with well-described hospital outbreaks linked to the use of"
		contaminated instruments and devices. Blastomycosis is associated with
		"occupational exposure (e.g., forest rangers) and recreational activities (e.g.,"
		camping and fishing).The true burden of IFI is probably an underestimate because
		of the absence of reliable diagnostics and lack of universal application. For
		"example, the sensitivity of most blood culture systems for detecting candida is"
		typically 50 %. The advent of new technology including molecular techniques such
		as 18S ribosomal RNA PCR and genome sequencing is leading to an improved
		understanding of the epidemiology of the less common mould and dimorphic fungal
		infections. Molecular techniques are also providing a platform for improved
		"diagnosis and management of IFI.Many factors affect mortality in IFI, not least"
		"the underlying medical condition, choice of therapy, and the ability to achieve"
		"early source control. For instance, mortality due to pneumocystis pneumonia in"
		HIV-seronegative individuals is now higher than in seropositive patients. Of
		significant concern is the progressive increase in resistance to azoles and
		"echinocandins among candida isolates, which appears to worsen the already"
		significant mortality associated with invasive candidiasis. Mortality with mould
		"infections approaches 50 % in most studies and varies depending on the site,"
		underlying disease and the use of antifungal agents such as echinocandins and
		"voriconazole. Nevertheless, mortality for most IFIs has generally fallen with"
		"advances in medical technology, improved care of CVCs, improved diagnostics, and"
		more effective preemptive therapy and prophylaxis.

AB	-	"Considered to be an emerging endemic mycosis in Latin America,"
		paracoccidioidomycosis is characterized by a chronic course and involvement of
		multiple organs in immunocompromised hosts. Infection sequelae are mainly related
		to pulmonary and adrenal insufficiency. The host-parasite interaction results in
		"different expressions of the immune response depending on parasite pathogenicity,"
		fungal load and genetic characteristics of the host. A few controlled and case
		series reports have shown that azoles and fast-acting sulfa derivatives are
		useful treatment alternatives in milder forms of the disease. For moderate/severe
		"cases, more prolonged treatments or even parenteral routes are required"
		"especially when there is involvement of the digestive tract mucosa, resulting in"
		poor drug absorption. Although comparative studies have reported that shorter
		treatment regimens with itraconazole are able to induce cure in
		"chronically-infected patients, there are still treatment challenges such as the"
		"need for more controlled studies involving acute cases, the search for new drugs"
		"and combinations, and the search for compounds capable of modulating the immune"
		response in severe cases as well as the paradoxical reactions.

AB	-	Endemic deep or systemic mycoses are common in specific geographical areas of the
		"world. Coccidioidomycosis is present in semi-desert areas, histoplasmosis and"
		paracoccidioidomycosis in tropical regions and blastomycosis belongs to temperate
		climates. The two former are widely distributed in the American continent and
		some tropical regions of the world; the third is limited to Central and South
		"America, and the last to North America and Central and East Africa. These mycoses"
		"all have a similar pathogenesis, as the inoculum enters the host through the"
		respiratory tract. Cutaneous manifestations are secondary to lymphatic and
		hematogenous dissemination. These deep mycoses are exceptional in Europe. Most
		"cases are observed in returning travelers from endemic areas, aid workers,"
		"archaeologists, speleologist and immigrants. However, there have been some"
		autochthonous cases of histoplasmosis due to Histoplasma capsulatum var.
		capsulatum reported in European countries such as Italy and Germany. In this
		"article, we provide up-to-date epidemiological, clinical, diagnostic and"
		therapeutic data on the four most important imported systemic mycoses in Europe.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Paracoccidioidomycosis is a systemic mycosis considered endemic and
		limited to Latin America with the majority of registered cases originating from
		Brazil. The purpose of this paper was to report a case of a female patient with
		paracoccidioidomycosis mimicking inflammatory bowel disease and to systematically
		review available cases of the intestinal presentation of this infectious disease.
		"CASE REPORT: Female patient, 32-years old, previously asymptomatic, presenting"
		"with acute pain in the lower right abdomen, associated with signs of peritoneal"
		"irritation and abdominal distension. Urgent surgery was performed, which"
		identified a severe suppurative perforated ileitis. The anatomopathological study
		revealed fungal structures shaped as a ship's pilot wheel in Grocott-Gomori's
		"staining, suggestive of Paracoccidioides spp. METHODS: Studies were retrieved"
		"based on Medical Subject Headings and Health Sciences Descriptors, which were"
		combined using Boolean operators. Searches were run on the electronic databases
		"Scopus, Web of Science, MEDLINE (PubMed), BIREME (Biblioteca Regional de"
		"Medicina), LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature),"
		"SciELO (Scientific Electronic Library Online), Embase, and Opengray.eu. Languages"
		"were restricted to English, Spanish and Portuguese. There was no date of"
		publication restrictions. The reference lists of the studies retrieved were
		searched manually. Simple descriptive analysis was used to summarize the results.
		"RESULTS: Our search strategy retrieved 581 references. In the final analysis, 34"
		"references were included, with a total of 46 case reports. The most common"
		clinical finding was abdominal pain and weight loss present in 31 (67.3%)
		patients. Most patients were treated with itraconazole (41.3%) and amphotericin B
		(36.9%). All-cause mortality was 12.8%. CONCLUSIONS: Paracoccidioidomycosis
		"should be suspected in endemics areas, specially as a differential diagnosis for"
		inflammatory bowel disease. Endoscopic tests and biopsy are useful for diagnosis
		and treatment with antifungal drugs seem to be the first treatment option to
		achieve a significant success rate.

AB	-	Paracoccidioidomycosis is an infectious disease caused by Paracoccidioides
		brasiliensis and is endemic in South America. A patient can be infected via
		fungus inhalation in the mycelium phase. Oral manifestations of
		"paracoccidioidomycosis are often the first clinical sign of disease, but their"

		"frequency, demographics and clinical characteristics of central nervous system"
		"PCM (NPCM) and PCM in an endemic region, and the impact of human"
		immunosuppression virus (HIV) co-infection. This was a retrospective study of
		autopsy and biopsy reports from the Medical Pathology Section of the Hospital de
		"Clinicas, UFPR, Curitiba, Southern Brazil, between 1951 and 2014. PCM was present"
		"in 0.1% of 378,323 cases examined, with 5.7% being NPCM. Infection was prevalent"
		"in working-age men, agricultural workers and rural residents. Numbers of HIV"
		"autopsy cases increased over time, while those of PCM cases decreased. Prevalence"
		"of co-infection of HIV/PCM and HIV/NPCM was 1.6%, and 0.4%, respectively."
		Adrenals were affected more frequently in the NPCM group compared with the PCM
		group. Mortality was higher on NPCM group. The clinical course of PCM in HIV
		patients resembles an acute/sub-acute infection. Association of NPCM and HIV is
		"rare, while diagnosis of NPCM is difficult, it should be considered a"
		"differential diagnosis in HIV patients who live in, or have visited, endemic"
		areas and present with neurological symptoms.

AB	-	Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a severe disease caused by the dimorphic fungus
		"Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, which is characterized by granulomatous pulmonary"
		"and systemic lesions, affecting mainly men between 20 and 60 years of age."
		"Reports of PCM disease in animals are rare, but the disease has been described in"
		"armadillos. On the other hand, PCM infection of domestic and wild animals"
		detected by serological or cutaneous tests in the absence of apparent disease has
		been frequently reported. We present here the case of a female adult Doberman
		that developed cervical lymphadenomegaly. Histopathological examination of a
		"cervical biopsy specimen revealed active PCM, with an epithelioid, granulomatous"
		"inflammation containing numerous yeast-like, multiple budding fungal forms. The"
		diagnosis of PCM was confirmed by immunohistochemistry using a specific antibody
		anti-gp43 and by nested PCR using primers for the amplification of the gp43 gene
		"region. This is the first report of PCM disease occurring in a dog, an animal"
		that has been shown to play an important role in the natural history of North
		American blastomycosis.

AB	-	"A systemic and endemic emerging mycosis in Latin America, paracoccidioidomycosis,"
		is characterised by its chronicity and by the severity of the disseminated form
		"in healthy individuals, as well as in immunocompromised individuals co-infected"
		"with HIV, resulting, in the latter, in a mortality rate in the range of 30 - 45%."
		The long (several years) duration of treatment results from the immunosuppression
		induced by the disease or from the survival capacity of the fungus in tissue. A
		few controlled studies and case reports have shown that fast-acting azolic and
		sulfa derivatives are useful treatment alternatives for patients presenting
		"milder forms of the disease. However, when using such drugs, treatment regimens"
		of longer duration are required for the maintenance of patients with more severe
		forms. The search for new alternatives for treating the most severe forms is an
		"ongoing challenge. Novel treatments may be found among new classes of drugs, drug"
		"combinations, or agents capable of modulating the immune response, such as a"
		peptide derived from the 43-kDa Paracoccidioides brasiliensis glycoprotein.

TI	-	ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY CAUSED BY PARACOCCIDIOIDOMYCOSIS: THREE CASE REPORTS AND
		REVIEW.
PG	-	e238-e243
LID	-	10.4158/ACCR-2018-0632 [doi]
AB	-	"OBJECTIVE: Fungal infections can affect the adrenal glands, causing primary"
		"adrenal insufficiency (PAI). Although endemic to South America,"
		"paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), which can lead to PAI, has gained global relevance"
		with the increase in international travel and migration. METHODS: The present
		report describes 3 patients with PAI caused by PCM. RESULTS: Patients in cases 1
		"and 2 both reported indisposition, asthenia, nausea, hyperpigmentation of the"
		"skin, hypotension, and weight loss. Complementary exams confirmed PAI due to PCM."
		"Case 1 was serologically diagnosed. In contrast, the definitive diagnosis of case"
		2 was only reached by computed tomography (CT)-guided adrenal biopsy after
		"negative serologies for PCM. Case 3, with diabetes mellitus, had a history of"
		"asthenia, nausea and weight loss after persistent sinusitis. Initially, serologic"
		results were negative for PCM and the patient's CT-guided biopsy resulted in
		insufficient tissue to obtain a definitive diagnosis. Contrary to the initial
		"hypothesis of invasive aspergillosis, since the only etiological evidence for the"
		"patient's clinical condition were positive serologies for Aspergillus fumigatus,"
		histopathologic examination of the specimen provided by a left adrenalectomy
		finally confirmed PCM as the etiology for PAI in this case as well. CONCLUSION:
		The 3 cases illustrate the necessity to investigate PAI whenever there are
		suspicious clinical findings. They also show that fungal infections should be
		considered among the diagnostic hypotheses during the etiological investigation
		"of PAI. Finally, they teach us that definitive diagnosis of PCM may require"
		direct visualization of the pathogen.

TI	-	A multicentre study of oral paracoccidioidomycosis: Analysis of 320 cases and
		literature review.
PG	-	1492-1502
LID	-	10.1111/odi.12925 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To investigate the frequency of oral paracoccidioidomycosis from
		representative geographical regions of Brazil and to compare the data with a
		literature review. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on
		"108,304 biopsies obtained from 1953 to 2016 at six Brazilian oral and"
		maxillofacial pathology services. Demographic data and clinical and
		histopathological diagnosis of oral paracoccidioidomycosis were evaluated. A
		literature review of oral paracoccidioidomycosis studies published in three
		electronic databases was carried out. Data were analysed descriptively. RESULTS:
		A total of 320 cases of oral paracoccidioidomycosis were surveyed (0.3% of the
		oral lesions at the centres studied). The lesions were more frequent among male
		patients. The gingiva/alveolar ridge was the most affected site. Mean age of
		affected individuals was 51.3 years (±11.7). The literature review showed a
		higher incidence of oral paracoccidioidomycosis in the south-east and south
		regions of Brazil. Male individuals and individuals between 50 and 59 years were
		most affected. CONCLUSIONS: Oral paracoccidioidomycosis is an uncommon lesion
		observed in oral biopsy samples. The differences in the relative frequency of
		oral paracoccidioidomycosis are related to geographical variations. Men between
		50 and 59 years are more affected. This study provides helpful information for
		clinicians in the diagnosis of oral paracoccidioidomycosis.

		relapse. The control of cure was performed by clinical and serological evaluation
		using the double agar gel immunodiffusion test (DID). In the diagnosis of
		"relapse, DID, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblotting assay"
		"(IBgp70 and IBgp43) were evaluated. Out of 400 patients, 21 (5.2%) went through"
		"relapse, 18 of them were male and 3 were female, 6∶1 male/female ratio. Out of"
		"the 21 patients in relapse, 15 (4.8%) showed the CF, and 6 (6.4%) the AF"
		(p>0.05). The sensitivity of DID and ELISA before treatment was the same (76.1%).
		DID presented higher sensitivity in pre-treatment (80%) than at relapse (45%;
		"p = 0.017), while ELISA showed the same sensitivity (80% vs 65%; p = 0.125). The"
		serological methods for identifying PCM patients in relapse showed low rates of
		"sensitivity, from 12.5% in IBgp70 to 65.0% in IBgp43 identification and 68.8% in"
		ELISA. The sensitivity of ELISA in diagnosing PCM relapse showed a strong
		tendency to be higher than DID (p = 0.06) and is equal to IBgp43 (p = 0.11). In
		"sum, prevalence of relapse was not high in PCM patients whose treatment duration"
		"was based on immunological parameters. However, the used methods for serological"
		diagnosis present low sensitivity. While more accurate serological methods are
		"not available, we pay special attention to the mycological and histopathological"
		"diagnosis of PCM relapse. Hence, direct mycological, cytopathological, and"
		histopathological examinations and isolation in culture for P. brasiliensis must
		be appropriately and routinely performed when the hypothesis of relapse is
		considered.

PG	-	227-34
AB	-	Lobomycosis is a deep fungal disease of the skin without involvement of internal
		organs or mucous membranes. The disease is characterized by skin nodules and
		"plaques resembling keloid involving the earlobes, distal parts of the upper and"
		"lower extremities, and buttocks. In severe cases, large skin areas can be covered"
		by disseminated or grouped and confluent nodules. Most cases are reported from
		South and Central America. The fungus Paracoccidioides (Glenosporella) loboi is
		abundant in lesions but is extremely difficult to culture. Lobomycosis is
		"resistant to chemotherapy, but in some cases it can successfully be treated by"
		"excision. Although the diagnosis is easily established by its typical clinical,"
		"histologic, and microbiological features, it is often misdiagnosed by physicians"
		not familiar with the disease. We describe here five patients and present an
		overview of this rare disease.

AB	-	CONTEXT: Paracoccidioidomycosis is a systemic form of mycosis that spreads
		"hematogenously, secondarily to reactivation of lung infection or infection at"
		another site or to new exposure to the causative agent. Few cases of bone
		involvement have been reported in the literature and involvement of the spine is
		extremely rare. CASE REPORT: We describe a case of a 68-year-old male patient
		with spondylodiscitis at the levels L4-L5 caused by presence of the fungus
		"Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, which was diagnosed through percutaneous biopsy."
		"The patient was treated with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim for 36 months,"
		with complete resolution of the symptoms. CONCLUSION: Spondylodiscitis caused by
		"the fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis is uncommon. However, in patients with"
		"chronic low-back pain who live or used to live in endemic regions, this infection"
		should be considered as a possible differential diagnosis.

		Correct diagnosis was delayed due to overlooking the abnormal lung roentgenograms
		and the history of previous disease in a different localization. The fungus was

		necropsy confirmed the diagnosis. None of the patients responded to amphotericin
		B or cotrimoxazole. A 10 year English and Latin American literature review on
		neuroparacoccidioidomycosis was performed through a MEDLINE and LILACS (Latin

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Pulmonary mycoses resemble clinically and radiologically chronic
		"pulmonary tuberculosis. Studies describing the prevalence, etiology and clinical"
		features of pulmonary mycosis are of crucial importance in the Brazilian Amazon.
		AIMS: To estimate the frequency of pulmonary mycoses in smear-negative
		"tuberculosis patients; to describe their demographic, epidemiological, and"
		clinical characteristics; and to evaluate diagnostic methods. METHODS: A
		cross-sectional study was conducted at two tuberculosis reference institutions in
		"Amazonas, Brazil. We included 213 patients and collected clinical data, blood and"
		"induced sputum to perform serological, direct microscopy, microbiologic culture"
		"and PCR-based assays to identify infections caused by Aspergillus fumigatus,"
		"Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, Histoplasma capsulatum, Cryptococcus, and HIV."
		Chest computed tomography was also performed. RESULTS: Pulmonary mycoses were
		"diagnosed in 7% (15/213) of the cases, comprising ten aspergillosis cases, three"
		cases of paracoccidioidomycosis and one case each of histoplasmosis and
		"cryptococcosis. Among the patients with pulmonary mycoses, 86.7% were former"
		tuberculosis patients. The most significant clinical characteristics associated
		"with pulmonary mycoses were cavity-shaped lung injuries, prolonged chronic cough"
		and hemoptysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirmed the high prevalence of pulmonary
		mycoses in smear-negative tuberculosis patients in the Brazilian Amazon.

AB	-	Paracoccidioidomycosis is a systemic fungal disease caused by the dimorphic
		Paracoccidioides species endemic to South America. Infection classically presents
		"with pulmonary, mucosal, or reticuloendothelial involvement, though other organs"
		"can be involved. Central nervous system involvement is rare, and almost"
		universally reported within the endemic area for the fungus. We present a
		"60-year-old Brazilian male who complained of occipital headache, ataxia,"
		"dysmetria, and dysarthria for two months, diagnosed with"
		"neuroparacoccidioidomycosis in Houston, Texas. The patient had a cerebellar mass"
		and a left pulmonary spiculated apical mass suspicious for a lung metastatic
		malignancy and a preliminary histological report consistent with invasive
		cryptococcosis. The patient's work and travel history were paramount in achieving
		the final diagnosis.

AB	-	Case report from French Guiana of an atypical keloid in a Brazilian man:
		"Lobomycosis. Lobomycosis is a rare fungal skin infection, endemic to the Amazon"
		"basin. Its clinical manifestations are slow-growing keloid-like nodules, with a"
		"granulomatous reaction on histopathology. The etiological agent, Lacazia loboi,"
		has never been isolated in the environment or cultured in a laboratory. Diagnosis
		"is based on the typical appearance on microscopy. Treatment is disappointing,"
		with a high recurrence rate. We report a new case in French Guiana and review the
		"literature. Only 10 cases have been reported outside of the endemic area, 2"
		involving no travel; the mean time to diagnosis was 21 years. Phylogenetic
		analysis has recently proved that lobomycosis in dolphins is caused by a fungus
		more closely related to Paracoccidioides brasiliensis than to L. loboi (two very
		closely related species). Molecular diagnosis is possible in a few centers.
		Climate change may result in spreading lobomycosis to currently disease-free
		areas of the world.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a systemic infection caused by the
		fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. PCM is considered one of the most important
		"systemic mycoses in Latin America. METHODS: This is a clinical, epidemiological,"
		"retrospective, quantitative study of PCM cases in patients attending the National"
		Health Service in the State of Rondônia in 1997-2012. The examined variables
		"included sex, age group, year of diagnosis, education level, profession, place of"
		"residence, diagnostic test, prior treatment, medication used, comorbidities and"
		"case progress. RESULTS: During the study period, 2,163 PCM cases were registered"
		"in Rondônia, and the mean annual incidence was 9.4/100,000 people. The"
		municipalities with the highest rates were located in the southeastern region of
		"Rondônia, and the towns of Pimenteiras do Oeste and Espigão do Oeste had the"
		"highest rates in the state, which were 39.1/100,000 and 37.4/100,000 people,"
		"respectively. Among all cases, 90.2% and 9.8% were observed in men and women,"
		"respectively, and most cases (58.2%) were observed in patients aged between 40"
		"and 59 years. Itraconazole was used to treat 91.6% (1,771) of cases, followed by"
		sulfamethoxazole in combination with trimethoprim (4.4% [85] of cases). One
		hundred thirty-one (6%) patients died. CONCLUSIONS: The State of Rondônia has a
		"high incidence of PCM, and the municipalities in the southeastern region of the"
		state were found to have the highest incidence rates of this disease. Our
		findings suggest that Rondônia is the state in the northern region with the
		highest mortality rate for PCM.

AB	-	"Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is an endemic fungal infection in Latin America,"
		which manifests as an acute or chronic form and is more frequent in adult males.
		"It is caused by Paracoccidioides brasiliensis or Paracoccidioides lutzii, which"
		are thermodimorphic fungi. The disease can present as a severe and disseminated
		"form involving the lungs, skin, lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and lymphoid organs"
		"of the gastrointestinal tract. Most of the primary infections are subclinical,"
		and the cell-mediated immune response contains the infection. It is rare in
		"transplant patients, and there are few cases described in the literature. In"
		"solid organ transplant patients, it usually results from the reactivation of a"
		"latent infection, manifesting itself after a few years of transplantation with"
		frequent pulmonary and skin involvement. PCM is an endemic infection in Brazil;
		"however, as it is not classified as a notifiable disease, there is no accurate"
		"database on its incidence, and case reports are important sources of information."
		Clinical disease in kidney transplant patients is rare and has a high mortality
		"rate. In this scope, the present clinical case reports the challenges of the"
		clinical management of disseminated PCM caused by Paracoccidioides brasiliensis
		in a kidney transplant recipient who used immunosuppressive drugs and was treated
		with Itraconazole.

AB	-	AIM: The shape-based virtual screening was used for the identification of new
		compounds anti-paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM). MATERIALS & METHODS: The study was
		performed according to the following steps: collection and curation of a dataset
		"of quinolinyl N-oxide chalcones with anti-PCM activity, development and"
		"validation of shape-based models, application of the best model for virtual"
		"screening, and experimental validation. RESULTS & CONCLUSION: Among 31"
		"computational hits, eight compounds showed potent antifungal activity and low"
		cytotoxicity for mammalian cells. The checkerboard assay showed that most
		promising hit (compound 3) displayed additive effects with the antifungal
		"cotrimoxazole and amphotericin B. Therefore, the shape-based virtual screening"
		allowed us to discover promising compounds in prospective hit-to-lead
		optimization studies for tackling PCM.

PG	-	915-919
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-017-0152-6 [doi]
AB	-	Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a neglected systemic mycosis endemic to Latin
		America caused by dimorphic fungi of the genus Paracoccidioides. The acute
		juvenile PCM is a severe type of presentation that usually affects young
		"vulnerable patients and rarely progresses to portal hypertension. Here, two cases"
		of liver disease and portal hypertension as complications of acute juvenile PCM
		are reported. Diagnosis of PCM was performed by isolation of the fungus and
		molecular identification of the strains provided through partial sequencing of
		"two protein encoding genes, arf and gp43. Genotypic analysis revealed that"
		Paracoccidioides brasiliensis S1 was the phylogenic species involved in both
		cases. Patients presented a good clinical response to amphotericin B and
		sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. These results highlight the importance of the
		interdisciplinary approach in patients with severe forms of PCM to avoid and
		"treat complications, and the necessity of further investigations focusing on"
		host-pathogen interaction in order to explain the broad clinical spectrum in PCM
		as well as the severity and poor outcome in some clinical cases.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Pulmonary sequelae (PS) in patients with chronic
		paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) typically include pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema.
		Knowledge of the molecular pathways involved in PS of PCM is required for
		treatment and biomarker identification. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This
		non-concurrent cohort study included 29 patients with pulmonary PCM that were
		"followed before and after treatment. From this group, 17 patients evolved to"
		mild/ moderate PS and 12 evolved severe PS. Sera from patients were evaluated
		"before treatment and at clinical cure, serological cure, and apparent cure. A"
		nanoACQUITY UPLC-Xevo QT MS system and PLGS software were used to identify serum
		"differentially expressed proteins, data are available via ProteomeXchange with"
		identifier PXD026906. Serum differentially expressed proteins were then
		categorized using Cytoscape software and the Reactome pathway database.
		Seventy-two differentially expressed serum proteins were identified in patients
		with severe PS compared with patients with mild/moderate PS. Most proteins
		"altered in severe PS were involved in wound healing, inflammatory response, and"
		"oxygen transport pathways. Before treatment and at clinical cure, signaling"
		"proteins participating in wound healing, complement cascade, cholesterol"
		transport and retinoid metabolism pathways were downregulated in patients with
		"severe PS, whereas signaling proteins in gluconeogenesis and gas exchange"
		"pathways were upregulated. At serological cure, the pattern of protein expression"
		reversed. At apparent cure pathways related with tissue repair (fibrosis) became
		"downregulated, and pathway related oxygen transport became upregulated."
		"Additionally, we identified 15 proteins as candidate biomarkers for severe PS."
		CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Development of severe PS is related to increased
		"expression of proteins involved in glycolytic pathway and oxygen exchange),"
		indicative of the greater cellular activity and replication associated with early
		dysregulation of wound healing and aberrant tissue repair. Our findings provide
		"new targets to study mechanisms of PS in PCM, as well as potential biomarkers."

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is one of the most important systemic
		mycoses in Latin America and the leading fungal cause of mortality in
		"non-immunosuppressed individuals in Brazil. However, HIV/PCM co-infection can"
		increase the clinical severity in these co-infected patients. This co-infection
		is rarely reported in the literature mainly because of the different
		"epidemiological profiles of these infections. Furthermore, PCM is a neglected and"
		"non-notifiable disease, which may underestimate the real importance of this"
		disease. The advent of molecular studies on the species of the genus
		Paracoccidioides has expanded the knowledge regarding the severity and the
		"clinical spectrum in PCM. In this context, the development of studies to describe"
		the association of the Paracoccidioides phylogenetic cryptic species in
		"vulnerable populations, such as HIV-infected patients, appears relevant."
		"OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical, epidemiological, therapeutic and prognostic"
		"aspects in HIV/PCM co-infected patients, along with the molecular identification"
		of the Paracoccidioides species involved in these cases. METHODS: The
		investigators performed a molecular and clinical retrospective study involving
		"HIV/PCM co-infected patients, from a reference centre for PCM care in the endemic"
		"area of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 1998 to 2015. Molecular identification of"
		the fungal strains was done by amplification of partial sequences of arf and gp43
		genes. FINDINGS: Of 89 patients diagnosed with PCM by fungal isolation in the
		"culture, a viable isolate was recovered for molecular analysis from 44 patients."
		"Of these 44 patients, 28 (63.6%) had their serum samples submitted for enzyme"
		"immunoassay tests for screening of HIV antibodies, and 5 (17.9%) had a positive"
		"result. All cases were considered severe, with a variable clinical presentation,"
		"including mixed, acute/subacute clinical forms and a high rate of complications,"
		requiring combination therapy. Paracoccidioides brasiliensis S1 was the species
		identified in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: HIV/PCM co-infection can change the natural
		history of this fungal disease. The authors reinforce the need to include HIV
		screening diagnostic tests routinely for patients with PCM.

		associated with solid organ transplantation. We report the second case of PCM in
		an adult after liver transplantation. A 47-year-old woman who had undergone liver
		transplantation was hospitalized for flu-like symptoms and multiple erythematous
		"ulcerated skin papules. There was lymphadenopathy, pulmonary compromise, and"
		quickly progression to septic shock. PCM was confirmed by skin biopsy and
		"serologic tests, and a satisfactory response to amphotericin B was achieved."

		importance in Latin America. Its occurrence in solid organ transplantation (SOT)
		"is rare, but with high mortality rate. In this report, we describe a case of PCM"
		in a liver transplant recipient 19 months after transplantation. The patient
		"presented with multiple skin abscesses, arthritis, osteolytic lesions, and"
		pulmonary and adrenal involvement. Despite the presence of disseminated disease
		"and the patient's immunosuppressed condition, the patient responded well to"
		"prolonged antifungal treatment with no sequelae, thus suggesting that early"
		diagnosis and correct treatment may lead to favorable outcomes in SOT recipients
		with PCM.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Paracoccidioidomycosis is a neglected tropical disease, endemic in"
		several countries of South America including Colombia. We report a case of a
		patient with Chronic Multifocal Paracoccidioidomycosis with long-standing
		symptoms and a delayed diagnosis caused by several barriers to achieve it. We did
		"a review of the papers published in Colombia about this disease, focusing in"
		clinical data and eco-epidemiology with the finding of a lack of new information
		on this topic since the 2000 in our region. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a
		"54-year-old man, farmer in his youth, with a chronic ulcerated lesion in the"
		"lower lip similar to a lip carcinoma, a deforming lesion in the nose, and"
		respiratory symptoms with emphysematous lung. Lip biopsy with silver methenamine
		"stain revealed small and large budding yeasts that resembles a ""mariner's wheel"""
		confirming Chronic Multifocal Paracoccidioidomycosis. He was treated successfully
		but subsequently lost to follow up. CONCLUSIONS: It is very important to focus
		"attention, reinforce the search and create networks for the study of neglected"
		"tropical diseases. The presented case illustrates a usual clinical presentation,"
		but with a delayed diagnosis due to the difficulties that still occur in some
		regions like ours for the early recognition of a case of chronic multifocal
		paracoccidioidomycosis.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Identifying clusters of acute paracoccidioidomycosis cases could
		potentially help in identifying the environmental factors that influence the
		"incidence of this mycosis. However, unlike other endemic mycoses, there are no"
		published reports of clusters of paracoccidioidomycosis. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL
		FINDINGS: A retrospective cluster detection test was applied to verify if an
		excess of acute form (AF) paracoccidioidomycosis cases in time and/or space
		"occurred in Botucatu, an endemic area in São Paulo State. The scan-test SaTScan"
		v7.0.3 was set to find clusters for the maximum temporal period of 1 year. The
		temporal test indicated a significant cluster in 1985 (P<0.005). This cluster
		"comprised 10 cases, although 2.19 were expected for this year in this area. Age"
		and clinical presentation of these cases were typical of AF
		paracccidioidomycosis. The space-time test confirmed the temporal cluster in 1985
		and showed the localities where the risk was higher in that year. The cluster
		suggests that some particularities took place in the antecedent years in those
		localities. Analysis of climate variables showed that soil water storage was
		"atypically high in 1982/83 ( approximately 2.11/2.5 SD above mean), and the"
		"absolute air humidity in 1984, the year preceding the cluster, was much higher"
		"than normal ( approximately 1.6 SD above mean), conditions that may have favored,"
		"respectively, antecedent fungal growth in the soil and conidia liberation in"
		"1984, the probable year of exposure. These climatic anomalies in this area was"
		"due to the 1982/83 El Niño event, the strongest in the last 50 years."
		CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We describe the first cluster of AF
		"paracoccidioidomycosis, which was potentially linked to a climatic anomaly caused"
		by the 1982/83 El Niño Southern Oscillation. This finding is important because it
		may help to clarify the conditions that favor Paracoccidioides brasiliensis
		"survival and growth in the environment and that enhance human exposure, thus"
		allowing the development of preventive measures.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Differential diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease is often very
		challenging. Paracoccidioidomycosis is a fungal disease that can mimic
		manifestations of Crohn's disease. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a
		13-year-old Caucasian boy with abdominal pain for 1.5 years associated with
		"nausea, diarrhea, and weight loss of 10 kg. He presented increased C-reactive"
		protein and an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate. A colonoscopy showed
		"deep serpiginous ulcers throughout his entire colon and rectum, which suggested"
		"Crohn's disease. He received one dose of infliximab, which is an anti-tumor"
		"necrosis factor-α, and showed no improvement. After the second dose, he got worse"
		and started to have bloody diarrhea. A new colonoscopy was performed and
		pathological examination revealed ulcerative chronic inflammation with
		non-caseating granulomas and fungal structures (budding forms) compatible with
		Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. He underwent intravenously administered and then
		orally administered trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole treatment. Due to drug
		"intolerance, he was treated with amphotericin B and itraconazole, then he showed"
		clinical improvement and mucosal healing with good outcome. CONCLUSION:
		Paracoccidioidomycosis must be part of the differential diagnosis of inflammatory
		bowel diseases in endemic areas and must be excluded before starting
		immunosuppressive therapy.

AB	-	"OBJECTIVES: Historically, the Brazilian Central-West region has had high numbers"
		of paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) cases caused by the dimorphic fungus
		"Paracoccidioides lutzii. METHODS: This epidemiological, observational,"
		"analytical, cross-sectional study was performed to investigate the clinical and"
		laboratory data of 44 PCM patients with a culture-proven P. lutzii infection. All
		"patients were referred to the Systemic Mycosis Center, Júlio Muller University"
		"Hospital, Cuiabá, Brazil, during January 2017 to March 2020. The neutrophil to"
		lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was calculated and dichotomized by its median value to
		include in the identification of factors associated with severity. RESULTS: At
		"admission, 13 (31.7%) patients showed the disseminated multifocal chronic form of"
		PCM and 16 (36.4%) patients met the clinical severity criteria. Treatment
		prescribed on admission did not follow the recommendations of the Brazilian
		Guideline for the Clinical Management of Paracoccidioidomycosis in 26% of the
		"severe PCM cases (prevalence ratio 0.26, 95% confidence interval 0.14-0.49; P <"
		0.0001). Patients with severe PCM had a higher NLR that was greater than the
		median (≥4.11). CONCLUSIONS: The NLR biomarker complements the criteria for PCM
		severity. Applying the low-cost NLR test can greatly increase the diagnostic
		sensitivity when screening patients for PCM and contribute to better control of
		"the disease, management of complications, and therapeutic strategies."

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Paracoccidioidomycosis is a systemic infection caused by the fungus
		"Paracoccidioides. It may present in two forms: an acute/subacute form, whose most"
		"frequent manifestations include weight loss, fever, anemia, and adenopathy, and a"
		"chronic condition with mainly respiratory symptoms. Digestive symptoms, although"
		"they may occur, are not frequently reported. Paracoccidioidomycosis usually"
		"affects adult male agricultural workers; thus, its presentation in children is"
		rare. CASE REPORT: We describe the case of a 9-year-old male patient diagnosed
		"with paracoccidioidomycosis, who showed abdominal pain and diarrhea as initial"
		manifestations of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: This case is reported not only
		because of the age of presentation but also due to the existence of digestive
		"symptoms from the onset of the disease, both infrequently reported in the"
		literature.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is an endemic disease in Latin America.
		"In immunocompetent hosts, PCM occurs in two main clinical forms: acute and"
		"chronic. However, in HIV-infected patients PCM may show up simultaneous"
		manifestations of acute and chronic forms. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a
		patient diagnosed with HIV who had disseminated skin lesions and generalized
		"lymphadenopathy, as well as respiratory and central nervous system involvement."
		"The PCM diagnosis was confirmed by direct KOH examination, double immunodiffusion"
		and the isolation of the fungus in samples of an abscess in the subcostal region.
		The isolate was identified as Paracoccidioides brasiliensis S1 by
		species-specific PCR using primers for protein-coding gene GP43 (exon 2) followed
		by PCR-RFLP of the alpha-tubulin gene. CONCLUSIONS: There are few data in
		literature reporting species-specific molecular identification of
		"Paracoccidioides in HIV/PCM patients. Therefore, this case report may contribute"
		"to improve the knowledge about this severe disease, its causative cryptic"
		"species, and its consequences to patients."

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Paracoccidioidomycosis is a systemic fungal infection that is
		"potentially fatal, and the most prevalent of its kind in Latin America. The"
		predisposition to infection appears to be related to abnormalities in cellular
		"immunity, given its low prevalence in endemic regions. The role of"
		myeloperoxidase deficiency has not been elucidated. CASE PRESENTATION: We present
		"a case of 48-year-old female patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, stem cell"
		"transplant candidate, who developed a fever with lymphadenopathy and lung"
		"nodules, consistent with paracoccidioidomycosis infection, in whom a"
		myeloperoxidase deficiency was later discovered. The treatment of the hematologic
		malignancy had a good impact solving the enzymatic deficiency and antifungal
		therapy achieve controlling the infection. CONCLUSIONS: This case lays out the
		"possible association between acute leukemia, an alteration in neutrophil function"
		(needed to fight fungal infections) and an infection due to Paracoccidioides
		brasiliensis.

		"Paraná (UFPR), Curitiba, Southern Brazil. PCM was predominant in male"
		agricultural workers. PCM cases predominated in areas with subtropical climate
		with hot summers in North West Parana state. NPCM cases were distributed
		statewide more frequent in rural than metropolitan area. There was no association
		"with climate, soil type, or coffee crop culture. Most of the PCM cases were in"
		"the metropolitan area of the capital, chiefly due to migration fluxes. Even"
		"though the history is predominantly agricultural, PCM cases were distributed"
		"mainly in the metropolitan area of the state capital, there was no association"
		with climate and soil. NPCM cases were numerically more frequent in rural than

PG	-	313-8

AB	-	Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a systemic fungal disease endemic to Latin
		"America and characterized by two clinical presentations, i.e., patients develop"
		either acute/subacute or chronic clinical manifestations. The differences in
		"clinical presentations are mainly dependent on the host immune response, but may"
		also be related to demographic characteristics of some patients. In this
		"retrospective study, 1,219 PCM cases treated between 1970 and 2009 in a"
		"university medical center, located in southeastern Brazil, were analyzed"
		according to their clinical and demographic features. The most affected
		"anatomical sites were lungs (63.8%) and oral mucosa (50.0%), with increasing"
		involvement of these sites in accord with the age of the patients. Generalized
		lymphadenopathy (28.1%) and skin lesions (29.6%) were more frequent on the first
		"decades of life. Involvement of the larynx (16.1%), gut (7.5%), spleen (4.7%),"
		"central nervous system (3.4%), bones and joints (2.2%), and adrenal (2.1%) were"
		also variable according to the age of the host. The acute/subacute form of the
		"disease accounted for 26.4% of PCM cases and, on a multivariate analysis, was"
		"inversely associated with aging (OR = 0.8 per year, P < 0.001), and directly"
		"associated with female sex (OR = 7.2, P < 0.001), mixed black and white racial"
		"background (OR = 2.3, P < 0.001) or black skin color (OR = 4.6, P < 0.001). Based"
		"on these findings, we have shown that host immune response, as well as age,"
		gender and ethnicity may influence the clinical presentation of PCM.

AB	-	Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a systemic mycosis caused by Paracoccidioides
		"brasiliensis, which is endemic in many regions of Latin America. We describe the"
		case of a 60-year-old man from a region endemic for PCM who presented with a long
		history of left hip pain. He had been treated over the past 3 years with
		"immunosuppressive drugs (methotrexate, leflunomide, and adalimumab) for"
		"rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A hip radiograph showed lytic bone lesions, and a"
		"chest radiograph showed an expansive excavated lesion in the left lung,"
		suggestive of a lung cancer with bone metastases. A left hip joint biopsy was
		"inconclusive, but histological analysis of a surgical lung biopsy specimen was"
		consistent with P. brasiliensis infection. Treatment with intravenous
		"amphotericin B (50 mg/day) and hydrocortisone (25 mg/day) was initiated. However,"
		"increasing hip pain resulted in the amputation of the left lower limb, and the"
		analysis of the surgical specimen revealed a diagnosis of bone sarcoma.
		"Postoperatively, the patient developed sepsis and died approximately 1 month"
		"later. To our knowledge, this is the first report of PCM in a patient with RA who"
		"had been treated with immunosuppressive drugs, in particular TNF-α blocking"
		agents. The atypical presentation (left hip pain alone) emphasizes the importance
		of considering PCM in the differential diagnosis of patients with pulmonary
		lesions and osteolytic lesions who live in a region endemic for PCM. This case
		report also demonstrates that health professionals in these regions must pay
		close attention to patients receiving immunosuppressive drugs because of the
		possibility of reactivating quiescent P. brasiliensis lesions.

LID	-	10.1093/mmy/myz021 [doi]
AB	-	"Paracoccidioidomycosis (Pm) is a systemic disease, endemic in the American"
		"continent. There are two different clinical forms, the infant-juvenile or"
		subacute form (PmS) and the chronic adult form (PmC). The human immunodeficiency
		virus (HIV) associated paracoccidioidomycosis (PmHIV) shares characteristics with
		both of the previously mentioned forms. The objective of this work was to
		"describe the epidemiological, clinical and laboratory features of the PmHIV and"
		to compare them with the ones of PmS and the PmC. A retrospective analysis of 119
		patients with paracoccidioidomycosis was performed. Ninety four suffered the
		"chronic form, 11 the subacute one and 14 were coinfected with HIV. Patients with"
		"PmHIV presented a CD4+ T lymphocytes median of 70.5 cells/μl, 71.4% had fever,"
		"64.3% had a miliary pattern on the chest radiography, 64.3% had"
		"hepatosplenomegaly, 64.3% had mucosal lesions and 50% had skin lesions. One"
		patient died during his hospitalization. The clinical presentation of Pm in
		"patients with HIV resembled the subacute form with fever, hepatomegaly and skin"
		"lesions. However, they also tended to present mucosal lesions, positive serology"
		for Pm and pulmonary parenchyma lesions as usually seen in PmC (9/14 PmHIV
		"patients had overlapping features, while 4/14 PmHIV patients clinically resembled"
		PmS and 1/14 PmC). The incidence of Pm has not changed with the burden of AIDS as
		it has happened with other fungal infections but it appears clinically different
		from the classic clinical forms of the disease.

		musculoskeletal system.
PG	-	1346-54
LID	-	10.1111/tmi.12552 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To describe magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in
		musculoskeletal paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM). METHODS: Retrospective case series
		study after IRB approval. Two musculoskeletal radiologists reviewed in consensus
		the MRI findings of 11 patients with microbiologically and/or pathologically
		proven osteoarticular PCM. The MRI evaluation included discrimination of
		"abnormalities in joints, bones and soft tissues. RESULTS: Mean age of patients"
		"was 29 years (10-55 years), eight men and three women. Musculoskeletal"
		involvement was the only or the primary presentation of the disease in seven
		"patients (63%). Osteomyelitis was the most common presentation, with seven cases"
		(63%). Primary arthritis was found in one patient (9%). Isolated extra-articular
		soft tissue PCM was found in three patients: myositis (2) and subcutaneous
		infection (1). All cases showed regions with signal intensity higher than or
		similar to the signal of muscle on T1-weighted images. Penumbra sign was present
		in five cases (45%). T2-weighted images showed reactive soft tissue oedema in
		eight cases (72%). Post-gadolinium images showed peripheral (8/9) or
		heterogeneous (1/9) enhancement. Synovial enhancement was present in all cases of
		joint involvement (6/6). Lipomatosis arborescens was documented in one case of
		"chronic knee involvement. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first case"
		series describing MRI findings of musculoskeletal PCM. Musculoskeletal
		"involvement was the primary presentation of the disease in most cases, and"
		"therefore, neoplasms were initially in the differential diagnosis. Osteomyelitis"
		"was the most common presentation, often with secondary involvement of joint and"
		or soft tissue.

AB	-	Paracoccidioidomycosis caused by Paracoccidioides lutzii is endemic in the
		Midwest of Brazil and its clinical spectrum is still little known due to the
		recent identification of this fungal species. A patient resident in Southeast
		"Brazil, but who had lived for many years in the Midwest region, presented with"
		"skin injuries, chronic cough and bilateral adrenal involvement. Paracoccidioides"
		spp. was isolated in culture from a skin lesion biopsy. This isolate was later
		identified as P. lutzii using gene sequencing. A favorable initial response to
		"treatment with itraconazole was observed, but a few weeks later, the patient"
		developed respiratory failure and worsening of lung lesions. Evaluation by
		computed tomography and echocardiography were suggestive of pulmonary arterial
		"hypertension, and a bronchoscopic biopsy showed peribronchial remodeling. The"
		patient completed the antifungal treatment but maintained the respiratory
		dysfunction. The reported case shows that P. lutzii can be isolated from patients
		"in a geographic area far from the place of infection acquisition and that, as P."
		"brasiliensis , it can cause adrenal injury and cardio-respiratory complications"
		as a consequence of excessive necrosis and fibrosis.

AB	-	"Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is an important endemic, systemic disease in Latin"
		America caused by Paracoccidioides spp. This mycosis has been associated with
		"high morbidity and sequels, and its clinical manifestations depend on the"
		"virulence of the infecting strain, the degree and type of immune response,"
		"infected tissues, and intrinsic characteristics of the host. The T helper(Th)1"
		"and Th17/Th22 cells are related to resistance and control of infection, and a"
		"Th2/Th9 response is associated with disease susceptibility. In this study, we"
		"focused on interleukin(IL)-12p35 (IL12A), IL-18 (IL18), and IFN-γ receptor 1"
		(IFNGR1) genetic polymorphisms because their respective roles have been described
		"in human PCM. Real-time PCR was employed to analyze IL12A-504 G/T (rs2243115),"
		"IL18-607 C/A (rs1946518), and IFNGR1-611 A/G (rs1327474) single nucleotide"
		"polymorphisms (SNP). One hundred forty-nine patients with the acute form (AF),"
		"multifocal chronic (MC), or unifocal chronic (UC) forms of PCM and 110 non-PCM"
		individuals as a control group were included. In the unconditional logistic
		"regression analysis adjusted by ethnicity and sex, we observed a high risk of the"
		IL18-607 A-allele for both AF [p = 0.015; OR = 3.10 (95% CI: 1.24-7.77)] and MC
		groups [p = 0.023; OR = 2.61 (95% CI: 1.14-5.96)] when compared with UC. The
		IL18-607 A-allele associated risk for the AF and MC groups as well as the
		protective role of the C-allele in UC are possibly linked to higher levels of
		"IL-18 at different periods of the course of the disease. Therefore, a novel role"
		"of IL18-607 C/A SNP is shown in the present study, highlighting its importance in"
		the outcome of PCM.

AB	-	"Paracoccidioides brasiliensis is the cause of paracoccidioidomycosis, one of the"
		most important systemic mycoses in Latin America. Human disease has been observed
		"in a limited geographic and ecological niche, and it is attributed to exposure to"
		"the fungus in soil. Most primary infections are subclinical, as the infection is"
		"contained by the host mainly through cell-mediated immune response. However, as"
		"the fungus has the ability to survive in a dormant state for long periods, an"
		impairment of the immune response may lead to reactivation and clinical disease.
		"Surprisingly, paracoccidioidomycosis has rarely been reported in transplanted"
		patients. The aim of this communication is to report a case occurring in a kidney
		"recipient in an acute clinical form immediately after transplantation, and to"
		review the available information on previously reported cases.

		ratio in the symptomatic and asymptomatic phases in severe cases.
PG	-	874-881
LID	-	10.1111/myc.13282 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: PCM is a neglected systemic mycosis endemic in Brazil. The
		middle-west region of Brazil has shown the highest number of PCM by
		Paracoccidioides lutzii (P lutzii) cases. Differentiating cases of severe PCM
		from non-severe ones should be a concern at the bedside. Diagnosis of severe PCM
		"by P lutzii is based on the subjectivity of clinical manifestations, which can"
		"result in a delay in starting its treatment and, consequently evolution to severe"
		sequelae. There is not laboratory biomarker available to support the early
		diagnosis of severe PCM that is feasible for all the realities that coexist in
		Brazil. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of
		"laboratory biomarkers as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein"
		(CRP) and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in the diagnosis of severe PCM.
		"PATIENTS/METHODS: ESR, CRP and NLR were analysed for 44 patients with PCM by P"
		lutzii and a Receiver Operation Characteristic (ROC) curve were generated to
		identify the NLR cut-off point and point out the presence of severe PCM. RESULTS:
		Sixteen (36.4%) had severe PCM and 28 (63.6%) had non-severe PCM. The mean NLR
		was higher and statistically significant among patients with severe PCM than
		among those with non-severe PCM. The area under the ROC curve was 0.859 for the
		diagnosis of severe PCM. The cut-off point for NLR for the diagnosis of severe
		"PCM was 3.318 (sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 77%). CONCLUSIONS: According"
		"to results, it is plausible to conclude that NLR represents a potential biomarker"
		for the diagnosis of severe PCM.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is systemic mycosis caused by the
		"thermal dimorphic fungus of genus Paracoccidioides, leading to either"
		acute/subacute (AF) or chronic (CF) clinical forms. Numerous CF patients after
		"treatment exhibit sequels, such as pulmonary and adrenal fibrosis. Monocytes are"
		cells that are involved in the inflammatory response during active infection as
		well as in the fibrogenesis. These cells comprise a heterogeneous population with
		distinct phenotypic and functional activities. The scope of this study was to
		identify changes regarding functional and phenotypical aspects in monocytes
		comparing CF PCM patients on antifungal treatment versus non-treated patients
		(PMC-p). METHODS: Twenty-three CF PCM composed of 11 non-treated patients (NTG)
		and 12 patients in apparent cure (ACG) were studied. Sixteen healthy individuals
		were used as control group (CG). Monocyte subsets were determined by
		immunophenotyping based on CD14 and CD16 expression. Cellular function was
		measured in vitro with and without stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and
		P. brasiliensis exoantigen (PbAg) for 24 hours. Independent samples were compared
		"using unpaired t tests, dependent samples were analyzed by paired t-test. Groups"
		"of more than two independent samples were analyzed using an ANOVA, with Tukey's"
		post-test. Significance was set up at p <0.05. RESULTS: Our results showed high
		counts of peripheral blood CD14+CD16+ and CD14+CD16++ monocytes in untreated
		PCM-p accompanied by intense production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and
		TNF-α) and profibrotic growth factors (TGF-β1 and bFGF) by monocytes challenged
		"with P. brasiliensis antigens. After the introduction of antifungal therapy, the"
		counts of CD14+CD16+ cells returned to baseline while CD14+CD16++ counts remained
		"high. Interestingly, counts of CD14+CD16++ monocytes remained elevated even"
		"52 ± 7 months after successful antifungal treatment. Furthermore, the"
		ACG-patients showed preserved pro-inflammatory activity in the presence of
		specific antigen stimuli and high spontaneous production of TNF-α by monocytes.
		CONCLUSIONS: Infection with Paracoccidioides leads to initiation of a specific
		proinflammatory response by monocytes of PCM-p during active disease and in the
		apparent cure. A profibrotic profile by monocytes was observed only at admission.
		"Furthermore, PCM-p with apparent cure showed high spontaneous production of TNF-α"
		"and high counts of CD14+CD16++ monocytes, probably induced by hypoxia duo to"
		fibrotic sequelae.

AB	-	"Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a systemic mycosis, endemic in most Latin"
		"American countries, especially in Brazil. It is caused by the thermo-dimorphic"
		fungus of the genus Paracoccidioides (Paracoccidioides brasiliensis and
		Paracoccidioides lutzii). Innate immune response plays a crucial role in host
		"defense against fungal infections, and neutrophils (PMNs) are able to combat"
		"microorganisms with three different mechanisms: phagocytosis, secretion of"
		"granular proteins, which have antimicrobial properties, and the most recent"
		described mechanism called NETosis. This new process is characterized by the
		"release of net-like structures called Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs),"
		which is composed of nuclear (decondensed DNA and histones) and granular material
		such as elastase. Several microorganisms have the ability of inducing NETs
		"formation, including gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, viruses and some"
		fungi. We proposed to identify NETs in tegumentary lesions of patients with PCM
		and to analyze the interaction between two strains of P. brasiliensis and human
		"PMNs by NETs formation in vitro. In this context, the presence of NETs in vivo"
		was evidenced in tegumentary lesions of patients with PCM by confocal spectrum
		"analyzer. Furthermore, we showed that the high virulent P. brasiliensis strain 18"
		(Pb18) and the lower virulent strain Pb265 are able to induce different patterns
		of NETs formation in vitro. The quantification of extracellular DNA corroborates
		the idea of the ability of P. brasiliensis in inducing NETs release. In
		"conclusion, our data show for the first time the identification of NETs in"
		lesions of patients with PCM and demonstrate distinct patterns of NETs in
		cultures challenged with fungi in vitro. The presence of NETs components both in
		vivo and in vitro open new possibilities for the detailed investigation of
		immunity in PCM.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Paracoccidioidomycosis is one of the most prevalent systemic fungal
		infections in Latin American countries. The incidence rate has been increasing
		and its detection has gotten increasingly common in travelers or immigrants from
		"endemic areas. It is characterized by respiratory symptoms, lymphadenopathies and"
		"skin lesions, which gradually progress and subsequently lead to death in some"
		untreated chronic disease cases. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical approach and
		diagnosis of an exotic tropical pathology in an urban area. CASE DESCRIPTION:
		Case description and extended literature review. We made a case report of urban
		"paracoccidioidomycosis in a young patient, with a clinical syndrome of fever for"
		"a month, widespread nodal involvement, cutaneous manifestations and weight loss."
		"During the physical examination, hepatosplenomegaly and a febrile episode were"
		"evidenced, whose diagnosis was difficult. Management started with itraconazole"
		"and trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole, with subsequent cessation of spiking fevers"
		and significant improvement of the skin lesions. We performed a comprehensive
		"literature review, with search criteria performed in PubMed and adapted for"
		different databases. The review was conducted based on the studies found in
		"Medline, LILACS, SciELO and Cochrane Library, from 1966 up to this moment."
		Studies were selected by the authors based on their relevance and scientific
		contribution to the discussion of this case. CONCLUSIONS: There are few cases of
		paracoccidiomycosis in the pediatric population despite the endemicity of this
		entity in Latin America. An increasing population influx from endemic areas makes
		suspecting of this disease a must.

AB	-	BACKGROUND Paracoccidioidomycosis is an endemic mycosis in Central and South
		America caused by the thermally dimorphic fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis.
		"Despite its self-limited course and usually asymptomatic infection, some patients"
		may present with a systemic illness mimicking multiple conditions and thus
		question the general state of their immune system. CASE REPORT A 28-year-old male
		"presented to the hospital with fever, dry cough, and non-pruritic rash with no"
		characteristic distribution for the past 10 days. Past medical history revealed
		"that the patient had worked as a farmer three years ago, had abused cocaine paste"
		"over the same period, and also had in the last month presented to the hospital"
		for acute appendicitis. Initial laboratory tests revealed hypereosinophilia
		"greater than 10,000 eosinophils/mL. Infection of P. brasiliensis was confirmed by"
		"lymph node, skin, and colonoscopy biopsies. After treatment with itraconazole,"
		the patient's eosinophil count returned to normal and his symptoms resolved.
		CONCLUSIONS Paracoccidioidomycosis may present as a systemic illness with only
		"marked eosinophilia on initial diagnostic tests. Furthermore, in our patient's"
		"case, the high degree of eosinophilia may have contributed towards the patient's"
		appendicitis in the weeks preceding the subacute infection. It is possible that
		the patient's history of working at a farm and abusing cocaine paste may have
		contributed to the initial colonization by the fungus.

AB	-	Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a systemic mycosis caused by pathogenic dimorphic
		fungi of the Paracoccidioides brasiliensis complex. It is the most important
		"systemic mycosis in Latin America, mainly in Brazil. Despite its severity and"
		"high mortality rates, it is considered a neglected disease. Species within the"
		genus Paracoccidioides present genetics and morphological variations with
		"probable clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic consequences. In fact, there are a"
		very small number of detailed case reports with molecular identification of these
		"fungal agents. Here, it is reported a case of PCM due to Paracoccidioides"
		brasiliensis PS2. Molecular identification of the isolate was performed by
		amplification and sequencing of the arf and gp43 genes. Clinical cases and strain
		reports with molecular identification in the literature are also reviewed. The
		case herein presented is the first autochthonous report of PCM due to
		"Paracoccidioides brasiliensis PS2 species in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,"
		an important endemic area. The patient presented a chronic pulmonary form of PCM
		and had a satisfactory response to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim although
		sequelae such as adrenal insufficiency and dysphonia were observed. This study
		"may contribute to improve the knowledge about this severe disease, its causative"
		cryptic species and their consequences to patients.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Leishmaniasis Mucosa (LM) is a tropical disease that affects the
		upper respiratory tract and/or oral mucosa. Its etiological agent is Leishmania
		spp. Paracoccidioidomycosis disease caused by the fungus Paracoccidioides
		brazilienses. The aim is to report a case of Leishmaniasis Mucosa in association
		"with Paracoccidioidomycosis. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A male patient, 24 years old;"
		"Intraorally, presence of a non-bleeding erythro-leucoplastic lesion that affected"
		the soft palate and oropharynx; 3 years of evolution. On the face Computerized
		"Tomography (CT) examination, it was possible to observe muco-periosteal"
		thickening in the soft palate region; immunohistochemical markings for
		Paracoccidiodes brasiliensis. He was diagnosed with Leishmaniasis by Montenegro
		intradermoreaction (MIDR). DISCUSSION: The predisposition to
		Paracocodioidomycosis after Leishmaniasis infection is justified by factors
		"already elucidated - hygiene, nutrition habits and immunodeficiency, but the"
		reason for the non-progression of the fungus after years of evolution could be
		related to its inhibition due to the presence of the protozoan in the same wound.
		CONCLUSION: This phenomenon may be explained by future studies that need to be
		performed to answer such questions.

AB	-	Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is an endemic disease of humans from Latin America
		"that is caused by Paracoccidioides brasiliensis and P. lutzii, with most cases of"
		PCM in domestic animals being associated with P. brasiliensis. This study
		"presents the clinical, cytological, mycological, serological, and molecular"
		findings associated with P. brasiliensis in a dog from Southern Brazil. Fine
		needle biopsies were collected from the skin and several lymph nodes of a
		5-year-old female Labrador dog that had enlargement of most superficial lymph
		nodes. Cytology of the skin and lymph nodes revealed pyogranulomatous dermatitis
		"and lymphadenitis associated with fine-necked, budding fungal structures"
		consistent with the Paracoccidioides genus of organisms; mycological culture
		derived from the lymph node aspirate demonstrated similar budding structures.
		Serological assays using exoantigens obtained from the fungal culture
		demonstrated that the fungal organisms derived from the lymph node were
		antigenically similar to P. brasiliensis by immunodiffusion and Western blot. A
		"PCR assay, using the fungal culture as input, amplified a partial segment of the"
		internal transcribed spacer 1 and 2 regions of P. brasiliensis; direct sequencing
		and phylogenetic analyses confirmed the PCR product as P. brasiliensis. The
		"combined cytological, mycological, serological, and molecular findings confirmed"
		a diagnosis of fungal dermatitis and lymphadenitis due to P. brasiliensis in this
		dog. This case represents the third description of clinical PCM in dogs and the
		first confirmation of mycotic dermatitis associated with P. brasiliensis in this
		species. The participation of dogs in the possible dissemination of PCM is
		"reviewed, and it is proposed that dogs are probable accidental hosts in the"
		epidemiological cycle associated with P. brasiliensis.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Paracoccidioidomycosis is a disease that is endemic to southern and
		"southeastern Brazil, caused by the fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. The most"
		common clinical oral manifestation is the presence of multiple granulomatous
		"ulcers with hemorrhagic dots, located mainly on the lips, palate, and buccal"
		"mucosa. However, the disease can manifest atypically as a single ulcer, mimicking"
		oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) or tuberculosis. CASE REPORT: A 65-year-old
		male patient presented with a complaint of a single ulcerated lesion on the
		dorsum of the tongue; the lesion had evolved over 6 months. The diagnostic
		hypotheses were SCC and oral manifestation of tuberculosis. An incisional biopsy
		"was performed, and histopathological analysis of the specimen revealed"
		"pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, a granulomatous structure of epithelioid"
		"histiocytes, multinucleated giant cells, and lymphocytes in the connective"
		"tissue. Grocott staining confirmed the presence of the fungus in the lesion, and"
		a diagnosis was made of paracoccidioidomycosis. The patient was treated with
		200 mg/day of itraconazole for 12 months and now shows no signs or symptoms of
		recurrence of the disease. CONCLUSION: Correct diagnosis is essential for a
		successful therapeutic approach and resolution of the lesion.

		immunodeficiency virus: a case-control study.
PG	-	359-66
AB	-	Epidemiologic and clinical data for 53 patients with paracoccidioidomycosis and
		co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (cases) were compared with
		those for 106 patients with endemic paracoccidioidomycosis (controls). The
		prevalence of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis co-infection was estimated in 1.4% in
		cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Patients co-infected with HIV
		"were younger, less involved in agricultural occupations; 83.7% had CD4+ cell"
		count < 200 cells/microL. Paracoccidioidomycosis in co-infected patients usually
		"showed a rapid progression, with more fever, frequent involvement of the lungs,"
		and multiple extrapulmonary lesions. The response to antifungal therapy and
		"deaths caused by paracoccidioidomycosis were similar in the two patient groups,"
		but late relapses were more common in co-infected cases. Paracoccidioidomycosis
		in HIV-infected patients shows epidemiologic and clinical characteristics
		differing from those of the endemic disease and should be considered an
		AIDS-defining opportunistic infection in Latin America.

AB	-	PURPOSE: To report a case of aggressive chorioretinal paracoccidioidomycosis
		"requiring treatment with systemic antifungal agents, frequent intravitreal"
		"voriconazole injections, and surgical excision. OBSERVATIONS: A Brazilian man in"
		"his mid-30s with a history of chronic, biopsy-proven cutaneous"
		"paracoccidioidomycosis, chronic sinusitis, and perichondritis secondary to"
		paracoccidioidomycosis presented with profound vision loss. He was found to have
		significant vitreous inflammation and a large chorioretinal lesion in the
		posterior pole concerning for ocular involvement. He was treated initially with
		combined topical and systemic steroids as well as systemic antifungals and
		"antibiotics, then with serial intravitreal voriconazole injections resulting in a"
		significant reduction of intraocular inflammation and subretinal fluid. The
		residual tractional retinal detachment from the chorioretinal lesion was
		addressed surgically by pars plana vitrectomy. CONCLUSION AND IMPORTANCE:
		Intravitreal voriconazole can be an effective adjuvant treatment for the vitreous
		inflammation and subretinal fluid associated with chorioretinal
		paracoccidioidomycosis. Surgical intervention may be indicated in cases
		complicated by tractional retinal detachment.

		"intradermal reaction (Delayed-Type Hypersensitivity, DTH) to Paracoccidioides"
		"brasiliensis in rural areas in Alfenas, Southern Minas Gerais (MG) State, Brazil,"
		"and to assess risk factors (gender, occupation, age, alcohol intake and smoking)"
		associated with infection. We conducted a population-based cross-sectional study
		"using intradermal tests with gp 43 paracoccidioidin in 542 participants, who were"
		previously contacted by local health agents and so spontaneously attended the
		test. Participants underwent an interview by filling out a registration form with
		epidemiological data and were tested with an intradermal administration of 0.1 mL
		of paracoccidioidin in the left forearm. The test was read 48 hours after
		injection and was considered positive if induration was greater than or equal to
		"5 mm. Out of 542 participants, 46.67% were positive to the skin test. Prevalence"
		increased in accordance with an increase of age. There was statistical
		"significance only for males. Occupation, alcohol intake and smoking habits were"
		not significantly associated with the risk of paracoccidioidomycosis infection.
		"There is relevance of paracoccidioidomycosis infection in such rural areas, which"
		suggests that further epidemiological and clinical studies on this mycosis should
		be done in the southern part of Minas Gerais State.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is the most prevalent endemic systemic
		"fungal infection in Latin America. In Brazil, it stands out as the eighth-highest"
		cause of mortality among chronic or recurrent infections and has the highest
		mortality rate among systemic mycoses. Oral mucosal lesions may be the first
		visible physical manifestation of the disease. This study traced the
		epidemiological and clinical profiles of patients with oral lesions treated at
		"the University Hospital Cassiano Antonio Moraes, Federal University of Espirito"
		Santo. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional analysis of patient medical
		records was performed. RESULTS: Among the 161 patients identified with a
		"confirmed diagnosis of PCM, 97 (60.24%) presented with oral lesions. The"
		"male:female ratio was 15:1, the mean age was 50.5 years, and the chronic form of"
		paracoccidioidomycosis was predominant. Most of the patients had smoking habits
		and were rural workers. The most common oral lesions present in various
		"anatomical sites were mulberry-like ulcers, more frequently observed in the"
		"gingiva, with regression within one to three months. Patients completed the"
		"treatment in one to two years (32.99%), and 47.42% of cases discontinued"
		"treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to the characteristics of the oral lesions,"
		information from the clinical profiles of patients with oral PCM is a central
		tool for dentists for early diagnosis. Earlier diagnosis may result in fewer
		"consequences, especially respiratory ones that may cause an inability to work and"
		poor quality of life.

AB	-	CD40 ligand (CD40L) deficiency or X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome (X-HIGM) is a
		well-described primary immunodeficiency in which Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia
		is a common clinical feature. We have identified an unusual high incidence of
		fungal infections and other not yet described infections in a cohort of 11 X-HIGM
		"patients from nine unrelated Brazilian families. Among these, we describe the"
		first case of paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) in X-HIGM. The molecular genetic
		analysis of CD40L was performed by gene sequencing and evaluation of CD40L
		protein expression. Nine of these 11 patients (82%) had fungal infections. These
		included fungal species common to CD40L deficiency (P. jiroveci and Candida
		albicans) as well as Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. One patient presented with
		"PCM at age 11 years and is now doing well at 18 years of age. Additionally, one"
		patient presented with a simultaneous infection with Klebsiella and
		"Acinetobacter, and one with condyloma caused by human papilloma virus. Molecular"
		"analysis revealed four previously described CD40L mutations, two novel missense"
		mutations (c.433 T > G and c.476 G > C) resulting in the absence of CD40L protein
		expression by activated CD4(+) cells and one novel insertion (c.484_485insAA)
		within the TNFH domain leading to a frame shift and premature stop codon. These
		observations demonstrated that the susceptibility to fungal infections in X-HIGM
		extends beyond those typically associated with X-HIGM (P. jiroveci and C.
		albicans) and that these patients need to be monitored for those pathogens.

		is an endemically fungal infection in Latin America. It is caused by the
		dimorphic fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis and may cause oral mucosal
		lesions. The incidence of Pb mycosis oral lesions was evaluated in patients
		assisted at a Brazilian Dental School's Specialized Oral Diagnosis Service with
		"special focus on the different clinical forms of these lesions, its location,"
		"patients' occupation, deleterious habits, and diagnosis methodology. Students'"
		and professionals' initial diagnoses were compared with the definitive diagnosis.
		Lesions were detected 31 cases (18 patients). The results show that 88.8% of the
		patients were male with a mean age of 50 years and 39% work(ed) with activities
		related to agriculture. As much as 88.9% were smokers and 72.2% were alcohol
		users. Exfoliative cytology was performed in 66.6% of the patients. Oral mucosa
		"(30%), gingiva (16.6%) and lips 16.6% were the most common sites of Pb mycosis"
		oral lesions. Comparing the initial with the definitive diagnosis made by the
		professionals their accuracy was 33% (6 out of 18 patients). Students' diagnosis
		was more accurate demonstrating 72.5% of initial correct diagnosis (13 out of
		"18). Statistical analysis by ANOVA (α=0.05, SPSS WIN) demonstrated a significant"
		difference between the diagnosis of Pb mycosis made by students and professionals
		when considering initial diagnosis and final diagnosis (after histopathological
		analysis) (p=0.25). Incisional biopsy and exfoliate cytology are efficient for an
		early diagnosis of this disease in mouth. Students' training in diagnosis of oral
		pathologies to recognize lesions is urgent to improve public health.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Neuroparacoccidioidomycosis (NPCM) is a term used to describe the
		invasion of the central nervous system by the pathogenic fungus Paracoccidioides
		brasiliensis. NPCM has been described sporadically in some case reports and small
		"case series, with little or no focus on treatment outcome and long-term"
		follow-up. METHODS: All patients with NPCM from January 1991 to December 2006
		were analyzed and were followed until December 2009. RESULTS: Fourteen (3.8%)
		cases of NPCM were identified out of 367 patients with paracoccidioidomycosis
		(PCM). A combination of oral fluconazole and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim
		"(SMZ/TMP) was the regimen of choice, with no documented death due to"
		Paracoccidioides brasiliensis infection. Residual neurological deficits were
		observed in 8 patients. Residual calcification was a common finding in
		neuroimaging follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: All the patients in this study responded
		positively to the association of oral fluconazole and
		"sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, a regimen that should be considered a treatment"
		option in cases of NPCM. Neurological sequela was a relatively common finding.
		"For proper management of these patients, anticonvulsant treatment and physical"
		therapy support were also needed.

AB	-	Paracoccidiodomycosis ceti (PCM-C) is a zoonotic mycosis characterized by chronic
		granulomatous cutaneous lesions in cetaceans. It is distributed worldwide and is
		"caused by an unculturable fungus; Paracoccidioides cetii. On the other hand,"
		"coccidioidomycosis (CCM), caused by Coccidioides spp., is also a zoonotic and"
		highly pathogenic fungal infection endemic in both American continents. Even
		"though the Far East is not an endemic area of CCM, an autochthonous case has been"
		reported in China. Although the seroprevalence against P. cetii in captive
		"dolphins was 61.0%, there is no information on wild dolphins living in cold"
		waters. The present study aimed to investigate the seroprevalence against P.
		cetii and C. posadasii in 15 Dall's porpoises (Phocoenoides dalli) and 11 harbor
		"porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) stranded in Hokkaido, Japan. The seroprevalence"
		"against P. cetii in the above dolphins was 26.9% (7/26), which was recorded only"
		"in Dall's porpoises (7/15), and that against C. posadasii was 15.4% (4/26), three"
		in Dall's porpoises and one in harbor porpoise. The present study demonstrated
		positive seroprevalence against P. cetii and C. posadasii in wild cetaceans
		"living in the subarctic areas of the Far East as the first records, and would"
		issue the warning those who live in the area were exposed to the causative agent
		of CCM from seawater.

PG	-	495-498
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-017-0230-9 [doi]
AB	-	Two distinct patterns of immune recovery inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) are
		"recognized, paradoxical and unmasking IRIS. Here we raise some concerns regarding"
		"the first case of neuroPCM-IRIS published to date, as recently proposed by"
		"Almeida and Roza (Mycopathologia 177:137-141, 2017) for a patient originally"
		"described by Silva-Vergara et al. (Mycopathologia 182:393-396, 2014), taking in"
		account the different case definitions for IRIS and the cases of
		neuroparacoccidioidomycosis already described in the literature. We are concerned
		that data from the case report have been misinterpreted and that no regard has
		been given to the possibility that the development of manifestations of neuroPCM
		after starting antiretroviral therapy and antifungal treatments could represent
		the predicted course of a missed neuroPCM diagnosis at presentation whose
		treatment failed. We hypothesize that diagnosis of the neuroPCM would not have
		been missed if careful screening for opportunistic infection of the central
		nervous system was performed prior to antiretroviral therapy initiation.
		"Currently, there is no definitive diagnostic test for IRIS and diagnostic"
		"suspicion, as well as its management, are based on image studies and non-specific"
		clinical signs and symptoms of inflammation. IRIS remains a diagnosis of
		"exclusion, after considering drug toxicity, microbiologic treatment failure and"
		the expected course of newly or previously diagnosed opportunistic infections.

TI	-	Trigeminal trophic syndrome.
PG	-	1330-3
AB	-	Trigeminal trophic syndrome is an unusual condition also known as trigeminal
		neurotrophic ulceration or trigeminal neuropathy with nasal ulceration. The
		"diagnosis is suggested when ulceration of the face, especially of the ala nasi,"
		occurs in a dermatome of the trigeminal nerve that has been rendered anesthetic
		by a surgical or other process involving the trigeminal nerve or its central
		sensory connections. A history of paresthesias and self-induced trauma to the
		area further support the diagnosis. Neurological deficits causing trigeminal
		"trophic syndrome may result from surgical trigeminal ablation, vascular disorders"
		"and infarction of the brainstem, acoustic neuroma, postencephalitic parkinsonism,"
		and syringobulbia. The following etiologies of nasal ulceration should be
		"excluded: postsurgical herpetic reactivation and ulceration, syphilis,"
		"leishmaniasis, leprous trigeminal neuritis, yaws, blastomycosis,"
		"paracoccidioidomycosis, lethal midline granuloma, pyoderma gangrenosum, Wegener's"
		"granulomatosis, and basal cell carcinoma. In the case reported here, the"
		diagnosis of TTS was made primarily as a result of previous experience with the
		"syndrome, underscoring the importance of physician recognition of this unusual"
		disorder.

TI	-	Cutaneous primary paracoccidioidomycosis.
PG	-	113-7
AB	-	Paracoccidioidomycosis is a common fungal infection in Latin America. Few cases
		have been described in non-endemic countries and their diagnosis without the
		"correct suspicion, bearing in mind that the latency period might be up to 60"
		"years, may not be easy. We report the case of a 59-year-old man who worked as a"
		taxi driver for 25 years in Venezuela. Cutaneous paracoccidioidomycosis was
		diagnosed one year after he returned to Spain. No internal signs or symptoms of
		the disease were found and cell-mediated immunity showed no depression. Our case
		"suggested us to consider direct cutaneous infection, although respiratory tract"
		is believed to be the most frequent portal of entry for this infection.

AB	-	"In Brazil, human fungal infections are prevalent, however, these conditions are"
		not officially reportable diseases. To estimate the burden of serious fungal
		"diseases in 1 year in Brazil, based on available data and published literature."
		Historical official data from fungal diseases were collected from Brazilian
		Unified Health System Informatics Department (DATASUS). For fungal diseases for
		"which no official data were available, assumptions of frequencies were made by"
		estimating based on published literature. The incidence (/1000) of hospital
		"admissions for coccidioidomycosis was 7.12; for histoplasmosis, 2.19; and for"
		"paracoccidioidomycosis, 7.99. The estimated number of cryptococcal"
		"meningoencephalitis cases was 6832. Also, there were 4115 cases of Pneumocystis"
		"pneumonia in AIDS patients per year, 1 010 465 aspergillosis and 2 981 416 cases"
		"of serious Candida infections, including invasive and non-invasive diseases. In"
		"this study, we demonstrate that more than 3.8 million individuals in Brazil may"
		"be suffering from serious fungal infections, mostly patients with malignant"
		"cancers, transplant recipients, asthma, previous tuberculosis, HIV infection and"
		those living in endemic areas for truly pathogenic fungi. The scientific
		community and the governmental agencies should work in close collaboration in
		"order to reduce the burden of such complex, difficult-to-diagnose and hard to"
		treat diseases.

		"the demographic data, clinical features, diagnostic methods, and treatment of"

		medical records of outpatient cases with a diagnosis of histoplasmosis and
		considered clinical samples processed at our laboratory. We collected
		"demographic, epidemiologic, and clinical data from each case as available,"
		including results of any mycologic examinations performed. Treatment and outcome
		data were available for some patients. We assessed 158 cases of histoplasmosis:
		103 (65.2%) patients came from the Caracas metropolitan area; 53 were associated
		"with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), 14 with tuberculosis, and 8 with"
		paracoccidioidomycosis. Six pediatric patients were malnourished. Epidemiologic
		data suggested histoplasmosis in most cases. Patients received treatment with
		itraconazole and/or amphotericin B. Our results may reflect changes in the
		"epidemiology occurring in Venezuela, perhaps due to environmental changes and the"
		presence of AIDS. Several mycologic exams are necessary to ensure a proper
		diagnosis. More reliable data and statistics on this infection are necessary to
		monitor outbreaks closely and to establish if there is an epidemic pattern.

TI	-	Infectious granulomatous laryngitis: a retrospective study of 24 cases.
PG	-	675-80
AB	-	The diagnostic and treatment of verrucous lesions of the larynx involves a high
		level of suspicion by the physician attending the patient. The causes may go from
		unspecific laryngitis to neoplasia and granulomatous diseases. This kind of
		lesion is uncommon and the presentation aspects may vary broadly. The lesions in
		larynx are significant source of morbidity. The onset of symptoms is insidious
		"and the diagnosis is usually delayed. Symptoms include dysphonia, dyspnea,"
		"dysphagia and odynophagia. Proper treatment depends upon tissue biopsy,"
		"identification of the causative organism, and the appropriate pharmacotherapy. As"
		there are few papers presenting the clinical features of infectious granulomatous
		"laryngitis (IGL) as leishmaniasis, tuberculosis and paracoccidiodomycosis"
		"affecting the larynx, we considered important to show the experience of a big"
		Brazilian Laryngology Service in dealing with this potential worldwide problem.
		We present a retrospective chart review showing our institution's experience with
		"IGL focusing in the diagnostic, treatment and prognosis aspects. Twenty-four"
		patients were identified. Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Paracoccidiodis
		"brasiliensis accounted for ten cases each, and Leishmania braziliensis the"
		remaining four. Hoarseness was the most common symptom of infection. Up to
		one-third of patients with laryngeal involvement lacked laryngeal symptoms. The
		average delay from onset of symptoms to diagnosis was 7 months. All patients
		underwent direct laryngoscopy and biopsies. Caseating granulomas was the key
		histopathologic finding. Identification of the causative organism was uncommon.
		"No evidence of concomitant malignancy was seen on biopsy. Despite treatment,"
		"almost 40% of patients had permanent sequelae of infection, including hoarseness,"
		"dyspnea, and dysphagia. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, P. brasiliensis, and L."
		braziliensis accounted for all cases of IGL. Patients may have laryngeal
		infection but lack laryngeal symptoms. Prompt diagnosis relies upon a high index
		"of suspicion, especially when evaluating patients from endemic areas. Given the"
		"degree of tissue destruction, which accompanies infection, timely intervention"

PG	-	73-81
AB	-	"Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) in children is rare, and its clinical progression is"
		not clearly understood. The admission and post-admission clinical records of 38
		children and teenagers aged up to 14 were studied who had been under treatment
		"for 24-30 months. It is a consecutive case series, 17 retrospective and 21"
		"prospective, from 1977 to 2000, admitted before and after 1990, respectively. The"
		"main clinical presentations were lymphatic, abdominal and cutaneous involvement,"
		"and fever. The alterations which disappeared more slowly were lymphadenomegaly,"
		"hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and osteoarticular pain. Poor intestinal absorption,"
		esophageal varices and splenic calcification were observed before treatment and
		persisted as sequelae. There was a satisfactory response to initial treatment in
		56.7% of cases. Half the patients became asymptomatic in the ninth month of
		"treatment, and 17+/-8% of cases presented with at least one symptom of the"
		"disease after 30 months of treatment. There were five deaths, and treatment"
		failure was frequent and associated in part with the irregular use of antifungal.
		Treatment with ketoconazole was safe and effective. PCM is a serious systemic
		"disease with slow evolution and high lethality, requiring treatment maintenance"
		for a minimum of 24 months with careful and prolonged follow-up. Studies are
		necessary to evaluate the efficacy of different antifungals and the ideal
		treatment length for children with PCM.

PG	-	245-53
AB	-	"Paracoccidioidomycosis, the main systemic mycosis in Brazil, requires long-term,"
		"high-cost treatment and leaves serious sequelae in the lungs, the organ most"
		frequently affected and further subject to aggressive external risk factors like
		smoking. The influence of tobacco and alcohol consumption on chronic
		paracoccidioidomycosis was investigated using a case-control study. Data on
		"occupation, place of residence, and living habits were obtained from 70 cases and"
		180 controls residing in the same geographic areas. The risk of becoming ill was
		14 times greater among smokers and 3.6 times greater among individuals with an
		alcohol intake of more than 50 g/day. Logistic regression showed as significant
		"variables: tobacco consumption for more than 20 years (OR = 10.1), smoking"
		"manufactured (not hand-rolled) cigarettes (OR = 4.8), and alcohol intake > 50"
		g/day (OR = 2.9). Cases who smoked 20 or more cigarettes/day became ill on
		average eight years before others (p = 0.002). Alcohol intake > 50 g/day had no
		statistically significant impact on age at onset of illness (p = 0.78). The study
		concludes that smoking stands as an important risk factor for the development of
		"chronic paracoccidioidomycosis. As for alcoholism, there is evidence that it acts"
		"as a co-factor, together with smoking."

AB	-	The sensitivity of the double agar gel immunodiffusion test is about 90% in
		"patients with untreated paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), but it is much lower in"
		"cases of relapse. In addition, serum from patients with PCM caused by"
		"Paracoccidioides lutzii, frequent in the Midwest region of Brazil, do not react"
		with the classical antigen obtained from Pb B-339. These findings showed the need
		"for alternative diagnostic methods, such as biological markers through"
		proteomics. The aim of this study was to identify biomarkers for the safe
		identification of PCM relapse and specific proteins that could distinguish
		infections caused by Paracoccidioides brasiliensis from those produced by
		Paracoccidioides lutzii. Proteomic analysis was performed in serum from 9
		"patients with PCM caused by P. brasiliensis, with and without relapse, from 4"
		"patients with PCM produced by P. lutzii, and from 3 healthy controls. The"
		comparative evaluation of the 29 identified plasma proteins suggested that the
		presence of the immunoglobulin (Ig) alpha-2 chain C region and the absence of Ig
		"heavy chain V-III TIL indicate infection by P. lutzii. In addition, the absence"
		of complement factor B protein might be a predictor of relapse. The evaluation of
		these proteins in a higher number of patients should be carried out in order to
		validate these findings.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: The main clinical forms of paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) are the
		"acute/subacute form (AF) and the chronic form (CF), and they both display"
		"considerable clinical variability. The immune responses of PCM patients, during"
		"and after treatment, remain neglected, mainly in the case of CF patients, due to"
		the high prevalence of pulmonary sequelae. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the
		"distribution of whole blood T cell subsets, serum cytokines, and biomarkers of"
		"pulmonary fibrosis in PCM patients, according to the clinical form and at"
		"different time points, during the antifungal therapy. METHODS: Eighty-seven PCM"
		"patients, from an endemic area in Brazil, were categorised into groups, according"
		to the clinical form (AF or CF) and the moment of treatment. The peripheral blood
		T lymphocyte subsets of these patients were analysed using fluorescence-activated
		"cell sorting. The serum levels of cytokines, basic fibroblast growth factor and"
		"surfactant protein-D (SP-D) were also analysed. FINDINGS: In the CF patients, an"
		"expansion of the peripheral blood TCD4+ cells was observed during the treatment,"
		"and this persisted even after two years of antifungal treatment. In addition,"
		these patients showed high serum levels of SP-D. CONCLUSION: Our findings
		"highlight the immunological changes CF patients undergo, during and after"
		"treatment, possibly due to the hypoxia triggered by pulmonary fibrosis and"
		emphysema.

AB	-	Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a fungal infection caused by Paracoccidioides
		brasiliensis and P. lutzii. It is endemic to South and Central America. While PCM
		"frequently remains latent, the disease can reactivate years after the initial"
		"infection. As the disease is rare outside the endemic area, and symptoms can"
		"mimic other pulmonary diseases, correct diagnosis can be challenging for"
		"clinicians in developed countries. In this report, we present the case of a"
		57-year-old female Venezuelan immigrant with PCM. She was initially misdiagnosed
		"with sarcoidosis and treated with corticosteroids, leading to an exacerbation of"
		the infection requiring intensive care. Because cultivation of Paracoccidioides
		"sp. is slow and unsensitive, we opted for microscopic observation of fungal"
		elements and molecular testing on a tissue biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage
		"(BAL) together with antibody detection. This allowed the diagnosis of PCM,"
		enabling specific management. PCM and other imported mycoses should be considered
		as a differential diagnosis in patients originating from South and Central
		America displaying symptoms suggestive of sarcoidosis. The reviews of this paper
		are available via the supplemental material section.

AB	-	Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a systemic granulomatous disease caused by
		Paracoccidioides brasiliensis or P. lutzii. It is a neglected tropical infectious
		disease that poses a major public health burden in endemic areas of Latin
		America. Mucosae of the upper digestive and respiratory tracts are commonly
		"involved and many patients have disease at multiple mucosal sites, with or"
		without lung involvement. Mucosal PCM presenting as solitary true vocal fold
		disease is relatively rare. We present the case of a 67-year-old Brazilian forest
		guard who presented with a 6-month history of hoarseness and globus pharyngeus
		due to a solitary left true vocal fold infiltration and vegetation diagnosed as
		PCM. Silent pulmonary disease was also present. A laryngoscopy video is offered
		as supplemental material to this report. He completely remitted after surgical
		removal and amphotericin B deoxycholate treatment.

LID	-	10.1007/s11046-020-00501-5 [doi]
AB	-	The skin disease paracoccidioidomycosis ceti occurs in several dolphin species
		globally. Infection by the unculturable fungi Paracoccidioides brasilensis or
		other Paracoccidioides spp. results in chronic cutaneous and granulomatous
		lesions. In this study we used immunohistochemistry to investigate the
		seroprevalence of antibodies to Paracoccidioides spp. in captive dolphins from
		three aquaria in Japan. We had previously reported that there were serological
		cross-reactions for Paracoccidioides spp. with related species in the order
		Onygenales. We hypothesized that the degree of serological cross-reactions for
		"Paracoccidioides spp. might be lower in areas, such as Japan, where the fungal"
		diseases coccidiodomycosis and paracoccidiodomycosis are not endemic. Sera from
		"41 apparently healthy dolphins, including 20 Atlantic bottlenose dolphins (BD:"
		"Tursiops truncatus), 6 Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (IPBD: Tursiops aduncus),"
		"2 F1 generation of a cross between BD and IPBD (F1), 3 Pacific white-sided"
		"dolphins (PWD: Lagenorhynchus obliquidens), 2 pantropical spotted dolphins (PSD:"
		"Stenella attenuata), 6 false killer whales (FKW: Pseudorca crassidens), and 2"
		rough-toothed dolphins (RTD: Steno bredanensis) were investigated. Sera from
		three dolphins with paracoccidioidomycosis ceti were used as a positive control.
		The yeast-form cells of Paracoccidioides spp. in the cutaneous tissue sample
		derived from the first Japanese paracoccidioidomycosis ceti case were used as the
		"antigen for the immunohistochemistry. Of the 41 dolphins tested, 61.0% had"
		antibodies against Paracoccidioides spp. This indicates that dolphins of several
		species in Japanese aquaria have likely been exposed to the pathogen
		Paracoccidioides spp.

AB	-	Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is one of the main endemic systemic mycoses in Latin
		"America, usually occurring in rural areas. When PCM occurs simultaneously with"
		"underlying immunosuppressive conditions, it can present as an opportunistic"
		"disease. Between 2000 and 2017, literature reported around 200 PCM cases in"
		people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). To address research gaps on this
		"co-infection and to study its possible temporal changes in the last decade, we"
		performed an active co-infection case search on the HIV/AIDS and PCM cohorts from
		a Brazilian reference center database from 1989 to 2019. We found 20 PLWHA among
		"684 PCM patients (2.92%), predominantly male (70.0%) and urban workers (80.0%)."
		The median age of patients was higher in the 2010-2019 decade (p = 0.006). The
		occurrence of PCM in PLWHA was lower when compared with other fungal diseases.
		Although 50.0% of the patients had already been diagnosed with HIV infection and
		"presented CD4+ T cell counts greater than 200/mm3 at the time of PCM diagnosis,"
		the suspicion of immunosuppression in the context of atypical and more severe
		clinical forms of PCM revealed the diagnosis of HIV infection in 35.0% of the
		patients. Two (10.0%) patients had an evolution compatible with immune
		reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) after starting antiretroviral therapy
		(ART).We highlight the importance of considering a PCM diagnosis in PLWHA to
		prevent a late-onset treatment and progression to severe manifestations and
		"unfavorable outcomes. In addition, HIV investigation is recommended in PCM"
		"patients, especially those with atypical and more severe clinical presentations."

TI	-	Central nervous system paracoccidioidomycosis: clinical features and laboratorial
		findings.
PG	-	193-8
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To study prospectively the clinical features and laboratorial
		characteristics of 24 patients with central nervous system (CNS) involvement with
		paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM). PCM is an infectious disease caused by the
		"dimorphic fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, endemic in subtropical areas of"
		"Central and South America. METHODS: From 173 cases of PCM, 24 (13.9%) had CNS"
		involvement (NPCM) and were studied prospectively from 1993 to 1997. In all the
		"patients, the diagnosis of systemic PCM was made by the demonstration of the P."
		"brasiliensis organisms or positive serology, DID (double immunodiffusion). In"
		seven cases the diagnosis was made by means of a CNS biopsy. CNS clinical
		"manifestations, neuroimaging (CT or MRI) and CSF cytochemical characteristics"
		were reported. RESULTS: The mean age was 44 years (range 25-72 years); 23
		"patients were male, only one was female. Neurological symptoms began before"
		"systemic symptoms in 21%; simultaneously in 33%, and after systemic symptoms in"
		46%. Epilepsy was the more frequent neurological presentation (44%). Twenty-three
		cases had parenchymatous involvement and in two of these cases there was an
		association with meningitis and one case had spinal cord involvement. Lesions
		"were more frequent in the brain hemispheres (69%), in 65% there were multiple"
		granuloma characterized by hypodense images with annular or nodular enhancing.
		"All cases were treated with sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprin. Four patients died,"
		while 20 patients showed a good therapeutic response. CONCLUSION: NPCM should
		always be considered in the differential diagnosis of expanding lesions of the
		CNS and meningoencephalitis. Being alert to this diagnosis depends on knowledge
		of epidemiology. There was good response to sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprin
		treatment.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Paracoccidoidomycosis (PCM) is a granulomatous systemic mycosis
		endemic in southern Brazil. OBJECTIVES: Analyze the clinical and epidemiological
		characteristics of cases of PCM with head and neck manifestations in southern
		Brazil. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective study of histopathologically
		diagnosed cases of PCM with head and neck manifestations referred to two medical
		"centers in the municipality of Santa Cruz do Sul, state of Rio Grande do Sul,"
		"Brazil, during a 10-year period (2011-2020). RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were"
		"selected. The number of cases usually ranged from one to four per year, although"
		11 cases were diagnosed in 2019. Most patients were between 40 and 59 years old.
		"In total, 21 patients were men and seven were women (male:female ratio 3:1). Most"
		(92%) were Caucasian and 46% were smokers. Patients were from 12 municipalities
		in the central-eastern region of the state. The most frequent site of the lesions
		was the larynx. Associated HIV and squamous cell carcinoma were both present in
		three cases. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to analyze PCM cases from
		"central-eastern Rio Grande do Sul. PCM is endemic in southern Brazil, and more"
		"epidemiological data are needed, considering that its incidence may be higher"
		"than currently estimated, as demonstrated by our results."

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Paracoccidioidomycosis is a systemic fungal infection common in Latin
		"America. Cutaneous involvement is frequent and usually affects multiple sites,"
		being most frequently associated with lesions of the oropharyngeal mucosa. The
		cutaneous form on its own is rare. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report a case of
		paracoccidioidomycosis isolated from the ear of a 43-year-old immunocompetent
		man. The lesion consisted of a partially ulcerated plaque on the auricle of the
		"left ear. Direct examination, histopathological examination and PCR revealed the"
		presence in the skin lesion of yeasts identified as Paracoccidioides
		brasiliensis. DISCUSSION: The sites of paracoccidioidomycosis on the ear can be
		confused with other tropical diseases frequently found in the Amazon region such
		"as leishmaniasis, leprosy and lobomycosis. The absence of any other cutaneous"
		sites in this case raised the question of whether the lesion was of primary or
		secondary origin.

AB	-	Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a systemic mycosis caused by fungi from the genus
		Paracoccidioides in Latin America. PCM-patients (PCM-p) are classified as having
		acute/subacute or chronic (CF) clinical forms. CF is responsible for 75%-90% of
		"all cases, affects mainly adults over 30 years old and the clinical manifestation"
		are associated mainly with lungs and mucosa of upper airdigestive tract. In
		"addition, the CF patients exhibit fibrosis of the lungs, oral mucous membranes"
		"and adrenals, and pulmonary emphysema. Consequently, CF PCM-p with active"
		"disease, as well as those that have been apparently cured, seem to be an"
		interesting model for studies aiming to understand the long-term host-fungi
		relationship and hypoxia. Dendritic cells (DCs) constitute a system that serve as
		a major link between innate and adaptive immunity composed of several
		subpopulations of cells including two main subsets: myeloid (mDCs) and
		plasmacytoid (pDCs). The present study aimed to access the distribution of PBDC
		subsets of CF PCM-p who were not treated (NT) or treated (apparently cured - AC).
		"CF PCM-p were categorized into two groups, consisting of 9 NTs and 9 ACs."
		Twenty-one healthy individuals were used as the control group. The determination
		of the PBDC subsets was performed by FACS (fluorescence-activated cell sorting)
		"and the dosage of serum TNF-α, IL1β, IL-18, CCL3, IL-10 and basic fibroblast"
		growth factor (bFGF) by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). A high count
		"and percentage of mDCs was observed before treatment, along with a low count of"
		"pDCs in treated patients. Furthermore, the mDC:pDC ratio and serum levels of"
		TNF-α was higher in both of the PCM-p groups than in the control group. In
		"conclusion, our findings demonstrated that active PCM influences the distribution"
		"of mDCs and pDCs, and after treatment, PCM-p retained a lower count of pDCs"
		"associated with pro-inflammatory profile. Therefore, we identified new evidences"
		of persistent immunological abnormalities in PCM-p after treatment. Even these
		patients showing fungal clearance after successful antifungal treatment; the
		"hypoxia, triggered by the persistent pulmonary sequelae, possibly continues to"
		interfere in the immune response.

AB	-	AbstractParacoccidioidomycosis is a systemic mycosis caused by Paracoccidioides
		"brasiliensis. It occurs more frequently in its chronic form, which particularly"
		affects male adults from rural areas. These patients present with pulmonary
		involvement and systemic symptoms. Skin and mucosal lesions are rather typical
		and might suggest the diagnosis. The involvement of the upper airway mucosa is
		"common and the patients usually complain of dysphagia and dysphonia. Nonetheless,"
		"in endemic areas, physicians should maintain a high level of suspicion even when"
		faced with some atypical symptoms. We present the case of an adult diagnosed with
		nasopharyngeal paracoccidioidomycosis after presenting with an unusual
		otolaryngologic syndrome including unilateral soft palate paralysis with
		velopharyngeal insufficiency and hearing loss secondary to middle ear effusion.

PG	-	104-8
AB	-	"OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of lobomycosis, a mycotic infection of"
		"dolphins and humans caused by a yeastlike organism (Lacazia loboi), among"
		dolphins in the Indian River Lagoon in Florida. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
		ANIMALS: 146 Atlantic bottlenose dolphins. PROCEDURE: Comprehensive health
		assessments of bottlenose dolphins in the Indian River Lagoon of Florida (n = 75)
		"and in estuarine waters near Charleston, SC (71), were conducted during 2003 and"
		"2004. Bottlenose dolphins were captured, examined, and released. Skin lesions"
		were photographed and then biopsied. Tissue sections were stained with H&E and
		Gomori methenamine silver stains for identification of L. loboi. RESULTS: 9 of 30
		(30%) dolphins captured in the southern portion of the Indian River Lagoon had
		"lobomycosis, whereas none of the 45 dolphins captured in the northern portion of"
		"the lagoon or of the 71 dolphins captured near Charleston, SC, did. Affected"
		dolphins had low serum alkaline phosphatase activities and high acute-phase
		protein concentrations. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results suggest that
		lobomycosis may be occurring in epidemic proportions among dolphins in the Indian
		"River Lagoon. Localization of the disease to the southern portion of the lagoon,"
		"an area characterized by freshwater intrusion and lower salinity, suggests that"
		exposure to environmental stressors may be contributing to the high prevalence of
		"the disease, but specific factors are unknown. Because only dolphins and humans"
		"are naturally susceptible to infection, dolphins may represent a sentinel species"
		for an emerging infectious disease.

AB	-	Seventy-six paracoccidioidomycosis patients attended at the university hospital
		of Brasília from 1984 to 2005 were studied. 82.9% were male and the mean age was
		42 years. 54.9% of the patients were engaged in farming activities. Among the
		"patients with the chronic form, 87% were smokers and 55.3% consumed alcohol."
		Among 71 patients without HIV/AIDS coinfection: a) paracoccidioidomycosis was
		"recurrent in 21 (29.6%); b) the chronic or mixed form affected 77.5% of patients,"
		"predominantly in the oropharynx (70.9%) and lungs (67.3%), with lymph node"
		"lesions in 29.8%, laryngeal lesions in 27.3% and cutaneous lesions in 16.4%; c)"
		"in the acute/subacute form, lymph node lesions predominated (81.3%), followed by"
		"cutaneous lesions in 43.8%, which resulted in severe disease in 62.5% and"
		moderate disease in 37.5%. Five patients had HIV/AIDS coinfection and three of
		them presented disseminated fungal infection together with marked
		immunosuppression.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus is a public health problem in Mexico, and the trend"
		"of the disease is increasing. From 2000 to 2017, 7.32 million new cases were"
		"diagnosed, with pulmonary mycoses being one of the most serious complications."
		AIMS: To describe the frequency and the clinical characteristics of patients
		"diagnosed with pulmonary mycoses, and to identify the risk factors associated"
		"with this entity. METHODS: Case-control study, paired by gender (1:1-3) and age"
		"(± 5 years), that analyzed patients with pulmonary mycosis (mucormycosis,"
		"histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, blastomycosis, aspergillosis, cryptococcosis,"
		paracoccidioidomycosis) and studied the risk factors present in each patient.
		"RESULTS: From the 162 patients studied, 56 suffered pulmonary mycosis and 106"
		were controls. The median of the age was 51 and 50 years for the cases and for
		"the controls, respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that"
		"patients with diabetes mellitus had an odds ratio of 8,3 (p < 0.001), and"
		"patients with a history of tuberculosis had an odds ratio of 8,8 (p < 0.001)."
		CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that 52% of the patients with pulmonary mycoses had
		a history of diabetes mellitus. Diabetes mellitus is a relevant risk factor for
		"pulmonary mycoses, which are usually diagnosed in advanced stages and have a high"
		mortality.

		a Review.
LID	-	10.3390/tropicalmed5030126 [doi]
LID	-	126
AB	-	Parinaud's oculoglandular syndrome (POGS) is defined as unilateral granulomatous
		conjunctivitis and facial lymphadenopathy. The aims of the current study are to
		describe a case of POGS with uveitis due to flea-borne typhus (FBT) and to
		"present a diagnostic and therapeutic approach to POGS. The patient, a 38-year old"
		"man, presented with persistent unilateral eye pain, fever, rash, preauricular and"
		"submandibular lymphadenopathy, and laboratory findings of FBT: hyponatremia,"
		"elevated transaminase and lactate dehydrogenase levels, thrombocytopenia, and"
		hypoalbuminemia. His condition rapidly improved after starting doxycycline. Soon
		"after hospitalization, he was diagnosed with uveitis, which responded to topical"
		"prednisolone. To derive a diagnostic and empiric therapeutic approach to POGS, we"
		reviewed the cases of POGS from its various causes since 1976 to discern
		epidemiologic clues and determine successful diagnostic techniques and therapies;
		we found multiple cases due to cat scratch disease (CSD; due to Bartonella
		"henselae) (twelve), tularemia (ten), sporotrichosis (three), Rickettsia conorii"
		"(three), R. typhi/felis (two), and herpes simplex virus (two) and single cases"
		"due to tuberculosis, paracoccidioidomycosis, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pasteurella"
		"multocida, Chlamydia trachomatis, Epstein-Barr virus, and Nocardia brasiliensis."
		Preauricular lymphadenopathy is a common clinical clue for POGS and is unusual in
		"viral and bacterial conjunctivitis. For POGS, the major etiological consideration"
		"is B. henselae, which is usually diagnosed by the indirect immunofluorescence"
		"serologic technique. Although CSD POGS is usually self-limited, oral azithromycin"
		"may hasten resolution. However, other possible etiologies of POGS may also arise"
		"from cat or cat flea contact: sporotrichosis, tularemia, Pasteurella multocida,"
		"or FBT. If there is no cat contact, other epidemiologic and clinical findings"
		"should be sought, because several of these conditions, such as tularemia,"
		"paracoccidioidomycosis, and tuberculosis, may have grave systemic complications."
		Although there are usually no long-term ocular sequelae if POGS is properly
		"diagnosed, it still may cause prolonged ocular discomfort and require multiple"
		physician contacts.

TI	-	"Paracoccidioidomycosis of bones and joints. A clinical, radiologic, and"
		pathologic study of 9 cases.
PG	-	213-25
AB	-	Paracoccidioidomycosis is a systemic fungal infection endemic to Central and
		South America. It is associated with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations
		and has been classified into acute and chronic forms. The latter is the most
		common type and usually affects male agricultural workers in rural communities.
		The disease typically begins in the lungs producing varying degrees of
		"parenchymal damage, and in a significant number of cases the organism spreads"
		"through bronchogenic, lymphatic, or hematogenous routes to involve 1 or more"
		organs. Bone and joint infection is relatively uncommon and has not been well
		described in the English literature. Much of the information on this form of the
		disease has been derived from radiographic and autopsy studies on patients with
		severe or fatal infections in whom skeletal involvement was a minor or incidental
		finding. We describe our experience with 9 cases in which osteoarticular
		manifestations were the sole or 1 of the few major complications of the disease.
		"All 9 patients were male, from 9 to 49 years of age (mean, 36.6 yr). Six were"
		"farmers. Evidence of visceral infection was present in 6 patients, in all of whom"
		the lungs were considered the primary site of disease. The osteoarticular lesions
		"were symptomatic in all cases, with the duration of symptoms ranging from 1 week"
		to 2 years. The lesions were centered in bone in 2 cases: they manifested
		radiographically as circumscribed areas of lysis with or without a rim of
		sclerosis. The disease was centered in joints in 7 cases; the associated
		"radiographic changes included evidence of joint effusion, periarticular bony"
		"erosions, and narrowing of the joint space. Biopsy of the involved skeletal site"
		revealed compact or loose granulomas containing variable numbers of fungi.
		"Although follow-up information was not available for all patients, those treated"
		with TMP-SMX (and 1 patient who also received amphotericin B) and who were
		followed had prompt resolution of their signs and symptoms. Our findings
		substantiate some of what is known about the epidemiology of bone and joint
		involvement in chronic paracoccidioidomycosis. Our patients exhibited features of
		"skeletal infection that have not been emphasized previously, however, including"
		"1) frequent involvement of large joints or long bones of the extremities, 2)"
		"presentation with relatively rapidly developing musculoskeletal symptoms, and 3)"
		manifestation as a solitary joint or bone lesion with or without concurrent
		clinically detectable pulmonary disease. Bone and joint paracoccidioidomycosis
		should be considered in the differential diagnosis in patients who have skeletal
		lesions with or without pulmonary involvement and have either lived in or
		traveled through endemic areas. Early diagnosis and treatment with antifungal
		medications can achieve an excellent outcome with limited local sequelae.

AB	-	Paracoccidioidomycosis is a fungal infection endemic to South America. The
		infection is usually asymptomatic and mostly affects the upper and lower
		respiratory tracts with clinical-radiological dissociation. Joint involvement is
		rare with no specific pattern or radiological injury. We report a case of
		paracoccidioidomycosis in which the patient's initial symptoms were hoarseness
		"and arthritis. After an ultrasound examination, we performed the differential"
		diagnosis of other noninfectious arthropathies and analysis of the material
		"collected, which revealed infection with the fungus Paracoccidioides"
		brasiliensis.

		Case Report and Review of the Literature.

AB	-	Paracoccidioides infection is a rare entity in the USA. This dimorphic fungus is
		found in Central and South America and is thought to be acquired by inhalation
		through the soil. We report a case of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis infection
		"presenting as a clavicular bone lesion, peripancreatic mass, and various skin"
		lesions. A 35-year-old man with a history significant for Hodgkin lymphoma
		presented with a left clavicular mass that was suspected clinically and
		radiologically as recurrent Hodgkin lymphoma. He was not experiencing any
		associated symptoms and was undergoing chemotherapy treatment for his known
		"Hodgkin disease. On CT imaging, the mass was seen as a lytic bone lesion with an"
		overlying soft tissue mass. This was biopsied and histologically diagnosed as a
		Paracoccidioides brasiliensis infection with associated necrotizing granulomatous
		inflammation. Also found on the CT scan was an enlarging peripancreatic mass
		"which on endoscopic biopsy had similar histologic findings. In conclusion, this"
		report presents a rare case of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis infection mimicking
		recurrent Hodgkin lymphoma.

AB	-	The identification of appropriate laboratory measures to confirm clinical
		hypotheses is important in routine paracoccidioidomycosis medical care. The
		clinical records and laboratory reports of 401 paracoccidioidomycosis patients
		"attended at the Tropical Diseases Area, Faculdade de Medicina de Botucatu, from"
		"1974 to 2008 were reviewed. Direct mycological (DM), cell block (CB),"
		"histopathological (HP), and double immunodiffusion (DID) tests were evaluated"
		before treatment. Typical Paracoccidioides brasiliensis yeast forms were observed
		"in clinical specimens of 86% of the patients, but 14% were detected only by"
		"serological test. DM of 51 different tissue specimens produced 74.5% sensitivity,"
		and 62.5% sensitivity was observed in 112 sputum samples. CB in 483 sputum
		samples generated 55.3% sensitivity. HP performed in 239 samples from different
		tissues revealed 96.7% sensitivity. Serology carried out in 351 patients and 200
		"healthy controls provided 90.0% sensitivity, 100.0% specificity, 100.0% positive"
		"predictive value, 85.1% negative predictive value and 93.6% accuracy. Comparisons"
		of laboratory measurements performed in the same patient showed that sensitivity
		"decreases from HP to DID to CB and DM, with the last two assays providing similar"
		"sensitivities. This study demonstrated that P. brasiliensis identification by HP,"
		"CB, and/or DM associated with DID is sufficient to establish the laboratorial"
		diagnosis of paracoccidioidomycosis in practically all cases.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a systemic granulomatous disease
		caused by Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. Involvement of the central nervous
		system (CNS) occurs in about 10% of cases. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 57-year-old white
		man presented with the complaint of headache and an episode of focal seizure 1
		month earlier. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a ring-enhancing lesion
		in the right parietal lobe with peri-lesional vasogenic edema suggestive of a
		primary neoplasm. The patient underwent craniotomy and the intraoperative finding
		"was a yellowish, hard lesion with thick content and yellow inside."
		"Anatomo-pathological findings were pathognomonic of PCM: large, thick-walled,"
		spherical yeast cells with multiple peripheral buds. The patient tested negative
		for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Encephalitis and meningitis were ruled
		out by cerebrospinal fluid analysis. Culture confirmed the diagnosis of PCM and
		the patient was treated with amphotericin B. The patient responded well to
		"treatment with resolution of the headache and clinical improvement, despite a"
		bitemporal hemianopia. He was clinically stable and then discharged in good
		general condition. CONCLUSIONS: Radiographic findings of PCM with CNS involvement
		"may suggest neoplasia, making diagnosis difficult. In endemic areas, the"
		diagnosis of PCM should be promptly considered when a ring-enhancing mass
		associated with peri-lesional edema is observed on MRI.

AB	-	Clinical presentation of paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) can be diverse. Morphology
		and quantity of skin lesions depends on interactions between host immunity and
		fungus virulence. Diagnosis can be a challenge considering that this fungus has
		"low virulence and some individuals have immunity to microorganism, which results"
		in well-marked granulomas without visible microorganisms. We report herein a
		"clinical presentation of sarcoid-like PCM, initially diagnosed as tuberculoid"
		leprosy. This rare type of PCM is often mistaken for other types of chronic
		granulomatous diseases. Diagnosis was confirmed after 4 years when a special
		stain analysis helped in the identification of the specific etiologic agent.

		45-year-old man was referred to our institution with a 2-mo history of epigastric
		"abdominal pain that was not diet-related, with night sweating, inappetence,"
		"weight loss, jaundice, pruritus, choluria, and acholic feces, without signs of"
		sepsis or palpable tumors. Abdominal ultrasonography (US) showed a solid mass of
		approximately 7 cm × 5.5 cm on the pancreas head. Abdominal computerized
		"tomography showed dilation of the biliary tract, an enlarged pancreas (up to 4.5"
		"in the head region), with dilation of the major pancreatic duct. The patient"
		"underwent exploratory laparotomy, and the surgical description consisted of a"
		"tumor, measuring 7 to 8 cm with a poorly-defined margin, adhering to posterior"
		"planes and mesenteric vessels, showing an enlarged bile duct. External drainage"
		"of the biliary tract, Roux-en-Y gastroenteroanastomosis, lymph node excision, and"
		"biopsies were performed, but malignant neoplasia was not found. Microscopic"
		analysis showed chronic pancreatitis and a granulomatous chronic inflammatory
		process in the choledochal lymph node. Acid-alcohol resistant bacillus and fungus
		screening were negative. Fine-needle aspiration of the pancreas was performed
		under US guidance. The smear was compatible with infection by Paracoccidioides
		brasiliensis. We report a rare case of paracoccidioidomycosis simulating a
		malignant neoplasia in the pancreas head.

AB	-	Paracoccidioidomycosis is a systemic granulomatous disease caused by the
		dimorphic fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis and is restricted to Latin
		"America. It normally affects lungs, skin and lymph nodes. Abdominal organs are"
		usually not involved. In rare cases paracoccidioidomycosis may simulate neoplasm.
		Herein we describe our experience with four cases of paracoccidioidomycosis
		"mimicking cholangiocarcinoma. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest"
		case series on this subject produced in English. Paracoccidioidomycosis must be
		"considered as a differential diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma, especially in"
		individuals who come from endemic areas.

TI	-	[The relationship between paracoccidioidomycosis and alcoholism].
PG	-	6-Dec
AB	-	The relationship between alcoholism and paracoccidioidomycosis was evaluated by
		the case-control method. The alcohol consumption of 4 groups of patients was
		"compared: 50 patients with chronic paracoccidioidomycosis, 20 patients with the"
		acute or subacute form of this mycosis and their respective control groups of
		"hospitalized patients, each case matched by sex and age. Between September 1986"
		and July 1988 the cases and their controls were interviewed by one and the same
		investigator using a questionnaire on drinking habits: quantity and type of
		"beverage consumed, time of onset and frequency of use and whether they had"
		manifested symptoms of inebriation or of alcohol dependence previously. As
		"compared with control patients, the mean daily ingestion of alcohol in excess of"
		60 ml was more frequent in the chronic paracoccidioidomycosis group (50.0% x
		30.0%). These patients also preferred to drink sugar cane brandy more frequently
		(89.4% x 68.3%). When the average daily consumption of ethyl alcohol exceeded 100
		"ml, most patients presented a recurrence of infection during or after antifungal"
		"therapy. In the acute-subacute paracoccidioidomycosis group, 64.3% of the"
		"patients reported inebriation on one or more occasions, versus 17.6% in the"
		respective control group. The results suggest that alcoholism can be a
		"predisposing factor to paracoccidioidomycosis and, probably, accounts for a worse"
		prognosis for this infection.

		(Paracoccidioides brasiliensis). The most common lesions frequently occur in the
		"bucopharinx mucosa. Other lesions occur in the adrenal glands, liver, bone,"
		"gastrointestinal tract, lungs and nervous system. We report here a case of"
		"neuroparacoccidioidomycosis. The patient was a 49 year-old male, who consulted"
		"due to neurological symptoms (cephalalgia, speech difficulty and one tonic clonic"
		seizure with urinary incontinence) of eight months duration. Upon physical
		"examination it was observed an emaciated male with nail clubbing, a skin ulcer"
		with raised edges and a crusted bottom of 4 x 2 cm in diameter located in the
		right supraclavicular region and an ulcerated lesion in the left tonsil with
		edema. The rest of the physical examination reveled a discrete left side
		hemiparesis and pulmonary rales in the left hemitorax. The fungus was identified
		through direct examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The histopathology of
		"suprarenal, lungs, brain and skin showed multiple paracoccidioidal granulomas. To"
		"the best of our knowledge, this is the third case reported in the literature. We"
		review the literature on the pathogenesis and prevalence of
		neuroparacoccidioidomycosis.

AB	-	Paracoccidioidomycosis (South American blastomycosis) is a systemic infection
		caused by a dimorphic fungus (Paracoccidioides brasiliensis). It is common in the
		rural areas of Latin America. The majority of the reported cases come from
		"Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela. Paracoccidioidomycosis is the most important"
		"systemic mycosis of the tropical Americas and can affect any organ, causing"
		symptomatic or asymptomatic lesions. Paracoccidioidomycosis can mimic other
		"diseases, which must be considered in making the differential diagnosis. Patients"
		get infected by inhaling mycelia found in the natural environment or rarely from
		traumatic inoculation via mucous membranes. The most common lesions frequently
		"occur in the buccal pharynx mucosa. Others lesions occur in the larynx, adrenal"
		"glands, liver, bones, gastrointestinal tract, lungs and nervous system."

LID	-	581
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Brain paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) or neuroparacoccidioidomycosis
		(NPCM) is a fungal infection of the central nervous system (CNS) caused by
		"Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, a dimorphic fungus. The CNS involvement is through"
		bloodstream dissemination. The association between NPCM and systemic lupus
		"erythematous (SLE) is rare. However, SLE patients are under risk of opportunistic"
		infections given their immunosuppression status. CASE DESCRIPTION: The aim of
		this case report is to present a 37-year-old female with diagnosis of SLE who
		presented with progressive and persistent headache in the past 4 months
		accompanied by the right arm weakness with general and neurologic examination
		unremarkable. The computerized tomography of the head showed left extra-axial
		parietooccipital focal hypoattenuation with adjacent bone erosion. The brain
		magnetic resonance imaging reported left parietooccipital subdural collection
		associated with focal leptomeningeal thickening with restriction to diffusion and
		peripheral contrast enhancement. The patient underwent a left craniotomy and dura
		mater biopsy showed noncaseous granulomatosis with multinucleated giant cells
		"with rounded birefringent structures positive for silver stain, consistent with"
		PCM. Management with itraconazole 200 mg daily was started with a total of 12
		"months of treatment, with patient presenting resolution of headache and right arm"
		weakness. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of NPCM is challenging and a high degree of
		suspicious should be considered in patients with persistent headache and
		immunosuppression.

AB	-	Neuroparacoccidioidomycosis is the central nervous system involvement by
		"Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, a condition that may be underdiagnosed and has"
		been scarcely reported. We describe a case of neuroparacoccidioidomycosis in a
		diabetic male with antecedent of heavy cigarette smoking and alcohol abuse.
		"Thirty years before, he lived in the Amazon area and exerted rural activities in"
		"more recent years. The patient's main complaints were headache, visual deficit,"
		"hemiparesis, and weight loss. Imaging studies detected changes in the lungs and"
		"right adrenal gland, in addition to brain lesions. Paracoccidioides brasiliensis"
		was found in tissue samples collected by the lung and brain biopsies. The patient
		is under ambulatory surveillance and in use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

AB	-	Autopsy continues to play an essential role in monitoring opportunistic fungal
		"infections. However, few studies have analysed the historical trends of fungal"
		"infections in autopsies. Here, we analyse available data on fungal infections"
		obtained from autopsy reports during 85 years of autopsies performed by the
		largest autopsy service in Brazil. All invasive fungal infections presented in
		"autopsy reports between 1930 and 2015 were included. Of the 158,404 autopsy"
		"reports analysed, 1096 involved invasive fungal infections. In general,"
		"paracoccidioidomycosis (24%) was the most frequent infection, followed by"
		"candidiasis (18%), pneumocystosis (11.7%), cryptococcosis (11%), aspergillosis"
		(11%) and histoplasmosis (3.8%). Paracoccidioidomycosis decreased after the
		"1950s, whereas opportunistic fungal infections increased steadily after the 1980s"
		during the peak of the AIDS pandemic. The lung was the most frequently affected
		organ (73%). Disseminated infection was present in 64.5% of cases. In 26% of the
		"513 cases for which clinical charts were available for review, the diagnosis of"
		opportunistic fungal infections was performed only at autopsy. Our unique 85-year
		history of autopsies showed a transition from endemic to opportunistic fungal
		"infections in São Paulo, Brazil, reflecting increased urbanization, the"
		"appearance of novel diseases, such as AIDS in the 1980s, and advances in medical"
		care over time.

AB	-	An autochthonous case of paracoccidioidomycosis was reported in a city of north
		Iran. This condition is a well-known endemic fungal infection highly prevalent in
		"Latin American countries, with an incidence of 1 to 3.7 cases per 100.000"
		"annually in Brazil. The classical features are cutaneous lesions, lymph node, and"
		"pulmonary involvements, while typical oral changes are superficial ulcers with"
		hemorrhage and moriform aspect. Herein is reported an adult male patient with
		"characteristic oral and pulmonary lesions. Rural environment, male gender,"
		"cigarette smoking, and alcohol abuse were risk factors; and clinical history,"
		"imaging studies, and histopathologic data established the diagnosis. The patient"
		improved well by administration of sulfamethoxazole plus trimethoprim. The aim of
		this case study is to enhance the awareness of generalists about this mycosis.

PG	-	111-4
LID	-	10.4269/ajtmh.2010.09-0634 [doi]
AB	-	This study assessed adrenal function in patients with paracoccididioidomycosis
		who had been treated to determine a possible connection between high antibody
		titers and adrenal dysfunction attributable to persistence of the fungus in
		adrenal gland. Adrenal gland function was studied in 28 previously treated
		"patients, 2 (7.1%) of whom were shown to have adrenal insufficiency and 7 (259%)"
		who showed a below normal response to stimuli by adrenocorticotropic hormone.
		Paracoccidioides brasiliensis was detected in the adrenal gland from one of the
		patients with adrenal insufficiency. Although the study failed to demonstrate a
		"significant difference between high antibody titers and low cortisol levels, the"
		proportion of adrenal insufficiency detected and the subnormal response to
		adrenocorticotropic hormone confirmed that adrenal damage is an important sequela
		of paracoccidioidomycosis. Studies with a larger number of patients should be
		conducted to confirm the hypothesis of persistence of P. brasiliensis in adrenal
		gland after therapy.

		corticosteroids?
PG	-	641-8
LID	-	10.3109/13693786.2011.654135 [doi]
AB	-	"Despite their immunosuppressive effects, corticosteroids have long been used as"
		adjunct therapy (aCST) in the treatment of infectious diseases. The rationale is
		that in certain infections it is necessary to decrease the exacerbated host's
		"inflammatory response, which can otherwise result in tissue damage and organ"
		"dysfunction. In fact, a major concern in treating paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is"
		"the host's intense inflammatory response to Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, which"
		"can be further intensified by antifungal therapy. Depending on its localization,"
		this immunological phenomenon may be life threatening or result in permanent
		"sequels, as is the case for some patients with cerebral or laryngeal involvement."
		"However, the literature on aCST in paracoccidioidomycosis treatment is scarce and"
		as a result we present our recent experience in the management of four patients
		"with severe PCM manifestations, i.e., cerebral paracoccidioidal granuloma,"
		"laryngeal stenosis, compressive abdominal mass, and exacerbated inflammatory"
		"response with tissue destruction. In addition to the antifungal therapy, these"
		"patients required aCST, which probably promoted their clinical improvement and/or"
		prevented serious complications. We suggest that aCST: (a) can potentially help
		"in the management of selected cases of severe forms of PCM, particularly when"
		"there is a risk of acute complications, and (b) that it can be used safely"
		"provided that the risk-benefit ratio is carefully weighed. Well-controlled,"
		prospective studies of aCST in the treatment of severe cases of
		paracoccidioidomycosis are needed to better define its role in the management of
		PCM.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: The term leishmaniasis comprises a group of diseases caused by
		different protozoan species of the genus Leishmania. There are three main
		"clinical forms of leishmaniasis: visceral, cutaneous and mucocutaneous. Exclusive"
		involvement of the mucosa is very rare. OBJECTIVES: To present a case of
		"mucocutaneous leishmaniasis in an elderly patient, discuss the clinical"
		"presentation, diagnostic process and treatment emphasizing the distinctions from"
		other granulomatous lesions. CASE REPORT: A 71-year-old male presenting with a
		"symptomatic lesion on the hard and soft palate, which had developed over a period"
		of 6 months was evaluated. The oral exam revealed a lesion with multiple
		ulcerated nodules on the hard and soft palate extending to the oropharynx. The
		"diagnostic hypothesis was chronic infectious disease (paracoccidioidomycose,"
		"tuberculosis and leishmaniasis) or squamous cell carcinoma. Histopathological,"
		histochemical and immunohistochemical analysis were performed. A chest x-ray
		revealed a normal pulmonary pattern. The Montenegro skin test was positive. The
		definitive diagnosis was leishmaniasis with exclusive oral manifestation and the
		patient was treated with liposomal amphotericin. CONCLUSIONS: Localized oral
		mucosa leishmaniasis is an uncommon event in an immunocompetent patient. Dentists
		"play an important role in the diagnosis of oral leishmaniasis, which has systemic"
		repercussions.

AB	-	Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is the most common endemic mycosis in Latin America.
		"The etiological agents, which comprise two species, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis"
		"and P. lutzii, are thermodimorphic fungi that usually affect previously healthy"
		adults. They primarily involve the lungs and then disseminate to other organs.
		Such mycosis is rare in organ transplant recipients; there have been only three
		"cases reported in literature, until now. We report a case of PCM in a renal"
		transplant recipient with an unusual dermatological presentation.

TI	-	Severe acute paracoccidioidomycosis in children.
PG	-	510-5
AB	-	This report describes clinical and immunologic features of five illustrative
		cases of paracoccidioidomycosis in previously healthy children. All had
		disseminated disease and two of them died despite treatment. The major clinical
		presentation in four patients was fever and diffuse superficial and
		"intraabdominal adenopathy, with or without hepatosplenomegaly. Other sites were"
		"also affected: three patients had multiple osteoarticular lesions, occasionally"
		with intense tissue destruction; two had cutaneous eruptions; two had pericardial
		"effusions; and two had pulmonary involvement, once considered an organ spared in"
		the young. We detected variable lymphocyte responses to mitogens and to Candida
		albicans antigen and non-responsiveness to Paracoccidioides brasiliensis cell
		wall antigen. High concentrations of serum immunoglobulins and anti-P.
		brasiliensis antibodies were present. These immune alterations tended to resolve
		"with treatment, suggesting a reversible nature of the immune defect. We conclude"
		"that this mycosis has a high morbidity and mortality in children, which is"
		probably related to an antigen-specific immunodeficiency. Further studies are
		needed to increase knowledge of this mycosis in children.

TI	-	Oral paracoccidioidomycosis: a case without lung manifestations.
PG	-	92-8
AB	-	AIM: The aim of this article is to present a case of Paracoccidioidomycosis with
		involvement of the oral cavity but without pulmonary manifestations. BACKGROUND:
		Paracoccidioidomycosis is a fungal infection caused by Paracoccidioides
		brasiliensis. It is an endemic disease representing a serious health problem for
		"Latin American countries, especially Brazil. This infection primarily affects the"
		lungs of adult men and is acquired through inhalation or accidental inoculation
		"of the fungus. It can spread to other organs and tissues, mainly the oral cavity."
		Administration of antifungal medication always resolves the disease. REPORT: A
		"58-year-old black male presented with three painless, ulcerated, mulberry-like"
		"granulomatous lesions located in the floor of the mouth, on the superior alveolar"
		"ridge, and on the hard palate, which had evolved over a period of two years."
		Facial asymmetry was observed due to edema in the lower lip and lymphadenopathy.
		"He had smoked for more than six years but showed no evidence of lung alterations,"
		"productive cough, or fever. Panoramic radiography showed no signs of a bone"
		lesion in the jaws. Both a radiograph and a CT scan of the thorax showed no areas
		of nodular infiltration. Fibrobronchoscopic examination of the entire respiratory
		"tract was normal. Biopsies of the oral lesions were performed, and tissue"
		sections exhibited oral mucosa coated with non-keratinized stratified squamous
		epithelium with acanthosis and focal areas of exocytosis. The underlying
		connective tissue showed an intense lymphocytic and polymorphonuclear infiltrate
		in addition to multinuclear giant cells and coagulation necrosis. A special stain
		used for fungus (the Grocott-Gomori method) was positive. Pulmonary biopsy
		"exhibited aerial spaces containing macrophages, dark granular hemossiderin, and"
		absence of fungus. This was considered normal. In agreement with the
		recommendation of pneumologists 400 mg/day of ketoconazole was prescribed for the
		"patient. After two months of treatment, even though the oral lesions had resolved"
		"completely, the therapy was maintained for six months more. One year after"
		following treatment the patient was in good health and free of any signs of a
		"recurrent infection. SUMMARY: Based on clinical, radiographic, and histologic"
		findings the differential diagnosis included paracoccidioidomycosis and squamous
		cell carcinoma. Following clinical and biopsy examinations of the oral lesions
		and the lungs a final diagnosis of paracoccidioidomycosis was made. This is a
		prime example of oral manifestations of a systemic disease in which the dentist
		is the initial health care professional to evaluate the patient due to the
		location of the lesions.

PG	-	39-43
AB	-	Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a systemic disease that in its aftermath form is
		characterized by clinical manifestations related to anatomic or functional
		sequelae of organs and systems affected during the period of state. Aim: To
		describe the anatomical and functional sequelae in patients with treated
		laryngeal PCM. Materials and Methods: Retrospective study. We reviewed the charts
		"from of 49 male patients, aged between 30 to 60 years, diagnosed with laryngeal"
		PCM during the period of 1999 to 2004. In all patients the diagnosis of PCM was
		"confirmed by demonstration of the fungus in sputum, cytological or"
		histopathological examination and being followed up by the Infectious and
		Parasitic Diseases Department. Results: The vocal folds were the most affected
		"laryngeal structure, being affected in 67% of the patients. The epiglottis and"
		"the aryepiglottic folds were affected in 55% and 53% of the cases, respectively."
		Vestibular folds were changed in 46% of the patients. In 40% of the cases there
		"were changes in the arytenoids. During phonation, 28% of the patients showed"
		"limited movement of the vocal folds, unilateral vocal fold paralysis was found in"
		"4%. 24% of the cases had glottic lumen reduction and 4% showed glottic stenosis,"
		2% needed tracheostomy. Conclusion: Sequela lesions of the laryngeal PCM are
		extensive and cause functional limitations in most cases.

PG	-	147-52
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-011-9412-z [doi]
AB	-	"Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a severe systemic mycosis, endemic in Latin"
		"America and highly prevalent in Brazil, where it ranks eighth as a mortality"
		cause among infectious and parasitic diseases in humans. The disease in animals
		has been little explored. It is observed that armadillos can harbor the fungus at
		"high frequencies, although the active disease has not been well documented in"
		"this wild mammal. Dogs are susceptible to experimental infection, and the"
		naturally acquired PCM-disease was reported only recently in a dog from Brazil.
		The present work reports the second case of naturally acquired PCM in a
		"6-year-old female dog that presented emaciation, lymphadenomegaly, and"
		hepatosplenomegaly. Biochemical and pulmonary radiographic evaluation did not
		"reveal any abnormalities. PCM was diagnosed by clinical findings, culturing,"
		"immunohistochemistry, and histopathology of popliteal lymph node. The fungus was"
		"recovered from popliteal lymph node, and the molecular analysis showed respective"
		sequencing similarities of 99 and 100% for 803 nucleotides of the Gp43 gene and
		592 nucleotides from the ITS-5.8S region of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis.
		"Immunohistochemistry revealed severe lymphadenitis and presented numerous yeasts,"
		which reacted against the gp43 antibody. Histopathology revealed a severe
		granulomatous lymphadenitis associated with numerous single or multiple budding
		"yeasts. After diagnosis, the dog was successfully treated with itraconazol for 2"
		years. Veterinarians should be aware of the importance of considering PCM for
		"differential diagnosis, especially in dogs from PCM-endemic areas, whose"
		monophagocytic system involvement is evident.

		"lesions in 20 of the episodes, most of them being multiple lytic lesions,"
		involving both long (70%) and plain bones (30%). First line treatment consisted
		"of an association of sulfametoxazole-trimethoprin, which was used, exclusively,"

AB	-	Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a systemic granulomatous disease caused by
		"Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, prevalent in Latin America, particularly in"
		Brazil. Central nervous system (CNS) involvement occur in about 10% of cases.
		Thirteen patients with PCM involving CNS were studied considering clinical
		"manifestation, neuroradiology and treatment modalities. Age ranged from 30 to 71"
		years-old (M=47.1+/-11.6 Me=46). There were eleven men and two women. The most
		"frequent symptoms were motor deficits (53.8%), cognitive disturbance (53.8%),"
		"weight loss (46.1%), headaches (46.1%) and seizures (46.1%). The diagnosis was"
		confirmed by the demonstration of P. brasiliensis. Granulomatous forms were
		present in all patients. Four (30.8%) of them had also meningeal involvement
		(mixed form). Computerized tomography (CT) scans were obtained in all cases and
		magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used in one case. Serology for HIV was done
		"in ten patients (76.9%), and all the tests were negatives. Amphotericin B was"
		"used in twelve patients (92.3%), one of them by intraventricular infusion. In"
		"eight patients (61.5%), trimethopim and sulfamethoxazole were used, and, in two"
		"(15.4%), sulfadiazine and pirimetamine. Fluconazole, ketoconazole and"
		itraconazole were each one used in a different patient as well. Six patients died
		(46.1%) and seven (53.9%) had satisfatory outcome. The follow-up period ranged
		"from 2 to 74 (M=30.9) months. In conclusion, the CNS involvement in"
		paracoccidioidomycosis is more frequent and more serious than thought before. The
		"clinical manifestations, CT scans and MRI findings are not specific of"
		paracoccidioidomycosis.

AB	-	The association between paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) and AIDS is relatively rare
		in contrast to the higher incidence of other systemic mycosis. The explanation
		"may be that AIDS is still predominantly an urban disease, and the PCM is endemic"
		in Latin American rural areas. The aim of this study was to detect the prevalence
		of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis infection in HIV-positive patients at an endemic
		area of paracoccidioidomycosis in Brazil. Skin test with purified 43 kD
		glycoprotein (gp43) was performed in 90 HIV/AIDS patients. The prevalence found
		"was 12.2% and it may be even greater, considering that HIV/AIDS patients may not"
		"respond to the intradermal test, which depends on cellular immunity for its"

AB	-	In order to describe the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of
		"paracoccidioidomycosis, a descriptive study of all the cases diagnosed by the"
		Clinical Microbiology Service at Dr. Julio C. Perrando hospital in the city of
		"Resistencia (Chaco Province, Argentina) was conducted. Between 2011 and 2014, 46"
		"cases were detected. In the period 2013-2014, an almost 4-fold increase in the"
		incidence rate was detected. The chronic form of the disease was predominant with
		an average age of 53 years. Serological tests in 39 out of 46 patients were
		"performed. In 15 of 39 patients, serological tests were the only diagnostic tool"
		while in 4 patients with a microbiological diagnosis serological tests were
		non-reactive. In patients from endemic areas with non-specific infectious
		syndrome it is important to include paracoccidioidomycosis in the differential
		diagnosis and to apply all available diagnostic tools to reach a timely diagnosis
		and to reduce the long-term sequelae and their socio-economic impact.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a systemic, progressive,"
		"noncontagious, and often chronic disease caused by the fungus Paracoccidioides"
		brasiliensis that rarely affects the central nervous system (CNS). The condition
		"is usually treated using antifungal drugs, and some cases may require surgery."
		"CASE DESCRIPTION: A 55-year-old man, a smoker, without known comorbidities, was"
		referred to the neurosurgery team with a history of a single epileptic seizure a
		week before hospital admission followed by progressive right- sided hemiparesis.
		Head computed tomography and brain magnetic resonance imaging showed an
		"intra-axial expansive lesion affecting the left parietal lobe, associated with"
		extensive edema and a regional compressive effect producing slight subfalcine
		herniation that was initially managed as an abscess. After the failure of
		"antibiotic treatment, the patient underwent a neurosurgical procedure for"
		excision of the lesion. Histopathological analysis revealed that it was PCM and
		there was no evidence of impairment of other systems due to the disease.
		"CONCLUSION: PCM can be a serious, debilitating disease and is potentially fatal."
		"Although isolated CNS involvement is rare, it must be considered, especially in"
		"endemic areas, as late diagnosis and treatment severely decreases good outcome"
		rates.

TI	-	Case Report: Misleading Serological Diagnosis of Paracoccidioidomycosis in a
		Young Patient with the Acute Form Disease: Paracoccidioides brasiliensis or
		Paracoccidioides lutzii?
PG	-	1082-1085
LID	-	10.4269/ajtmh.17-0812 [doi]
AB	-	Negative results in serological routine screening of patients with
		microbiologically proven Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) are occasionally reported.
		Failure in detecting anti-Paracoccidioides antibodies has been ascribed to
		factors either related to serological techniques or to the status of the host
		"immune reactivity. Recently, this issue has been renewed by the recognition that"
		"the Paracoccidioides genera comprises two species, lutzii and brasiliensis, which"
		"have distinct antigenic profiles and, therefore, may elicit different host"
		antibody responses. We describe a patient with the acute form PCM due to
		Paracoccidioides brasiliensis with negative results on two reference centers'
		"routine screening for P. brasiliensis antibodies, but positive results with"
		Paracoccidioides lutzii antigens. The present case report suggests that
		antibodies elicited during P. brasiliensis infection recognize antigenic
		"fractions shared by both species, highlighting the difficulties in distinguishing"
		the two infections by means of the currently available routine serological
		assays.

TI	-	A case of imported paracoccidioidomycosis: an awkward infection in The
		Netherlands.
PG	-	13-8
AB	-	Paracoccidioidomycosis is an important endemic mycosis in South America. In
		Europe the disease is very rare and only found as infections in travelers to
		Latin America. We report here the first case encountered in the Netherlands for
		which the appropriate diagnosis was not attained for several months. A Dutch
		60-year-old man presented with a painful ulceration in the buccal mandibular
		vestibular mucosa of three months duration. While his medical history was
		"uneventful, he had worked, until 8 years prior to his presentation, as a"
		carpenter for 25 years in the jungles of Peru and Ecuador. An aberrant chest
		"radiograph, CT-scan of the lungs and increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate"
		were suggestive of sarcoidosis or a bronchiolitis obliterans organizing
		pneumonia. There was no improvement in the patient's symptoms despite the use of
		"budesonide and prednisone medication, as well as tuberculosis prophylaxis with"
		"isoniazide and rifampicin, and local use of miconazole. Quite to the contrary, as"
		"an irritated, irregular hyperemic mucosa and gingiva with ulceration were noticed"
		during this period of time. These precipitated an incisional biopsy through which
		a mixed inflammatory cellular infiltrate and large yeast cells were found on
		histopathologic examination. Based on the patient's travel history and the
		"multiple budding yeastlike cells revealed in the biopsy tissue, the diagnosis of"
		paracoccidioidomycosis was finally made. This was supported by the isolation of
		Paracoccidioides brasiliensis in culture. Antimycotic oral therapy with
		itraconazole was started and continued for 15 months. At two and five year
		"follow-ups, the patient was asymptomatic. In Europe, it may be expected that"
		diseases that are endemic in other areas will be seen more frequently in
		countries where the diseases are not routinely encountered. It is most likely
		"that the use of corticosteroid medication, with its inherent immunosuppressive"
		"effect, resulted in the reactivation of an infection acquired many years before"
		in Latin America. The etiologic agent then disseminated from the initial focal
		point to cause the ensuing oral mucous membrane lesions. The importance of the
		patient's prolonged residence in Latin America was overlooked. The very long
		latency of endemic mycoses emphasizes the need for a meticulous history which
		"should include not only recent trips, but also past residence in foreign"
		countries.

AB	-	The largest endemic areas of paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) in Brazil comprise the
		"humid agricultural regions of the Southeast, South, and, recently, the Midwest"
		"and North regions. The Ceara State, located in the Brazilian Northeast region,"
		"presents semi-arid climate in most of its territory, characterized by high"
		"temperatures, scarce vegetation and low humidity. The objective of the present"
		study was to describe a new autochthonous case of paracoccidioidomycosis from a
		distinct area of Ceara and review the characteristics of PCM occurrence in
		Northeastern Brazil. The patient was a 65-year-old male farmer who denied
		traveling outside the Ceara State or living in other locations. He was born and
		"lived in the rural area known as Camara, bordering the municipalities of Itapaje"
		and Itapipoca. Camara is one of the highest areas (around 720 m of altitude) of
		the Uruburetama mountains that exhibits tropical forests and is located in
		"Northern Ceara, distant 139 km from the capital, Fortaleza. The patient sought"
		"for care, complaining of an oral lesion that appeared over the past three years."
		The hard palate lesion biopsy revealed multinucleated cells with cytoplasmic
		"inclusions, compatible with PCM. After culture, P. brasiliensis was identified by"
		polymerase chain reaction. Serological testing for PCM was reagent. The patient
		"was treated with itraconazole for approximately 17 months, persisting free of"
		symptoms after 15 months of follow-up. Regarding this new autochthonous case in
		"the Ceara State, PCM should be considered in the differential diagnosis of"
		"patients with suggestive clinical manifestations, proceeding from the mountainous"
		areas of Ceara.

TI	-	Emergence of acute/subacute infant-juvenile paracoccidioidomycosis in Northeast
		Argentina: Effect of climatic and anthropogenic changes?
PG	-	30-37
LID	-	10.1093/mmy/myx153 [doi]
AB	-	Argentina has two endemic areas of paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM). Bordering
		"Paraguay and Brazil, Northeast Argentina (NEA) comprises the area with the"
		highest incidence where the chronic adult clinical form has historically been
		reported. Juvenile form in children and adolescents is rare in this area since
		"only one case was reported in the last 10 years. Despite this, between 2010 and"
		"2012, several cases of acute/subacute clinical forms in children aged 10 to 16"
		"(median 12) were detected. In the last decade, the NEA region has been exposed to"
		ecological variations as consequences of certain climatic and anthropogenic
		"changes, including El Niño-Southern Oscillation phenomenon during 2009, and"
		deforestation. The region has also suffered from the significant ecological
		effects of the construction of one of the biggest hydroelectric dams of South
		America. This study aims to describe clinical and epidemiological aspects of
		acute/subacute PCM cases detected in children from NEA and to discuss climatic
		and anthropogenic changes as possible contributing factors in the emergence of
		this disease in children. This acute/subacute PCM cluster was characterized by
		"severe disseminated and aggressive presentations to localized form, with a high"
		spectrum of clinical manifestations uncommonly observed. Due to the lack of
		experience in acute/subacute PCM in children in the studied area and the atypical
		"clinical manifestations observed, the diagnosis was delayed. In order to avoid"
		"misdiagnosis, a higher level of suspicion is now required in NEA and countries"
		"bordering the southern part of the endemic area, which are affected by the"
		changes discussed in this article.

		Paracoccidioidomycosis.
PG	-	393-396
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-016-0076-6 [doi]
AB	-	The immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is a deregulated
		inflammatory response to invading microorganisms. It is manifested when there is
		an abrupt change in host immunity from an anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive
		state to a pro-inflammatory state as a result of rapid depletion or removal of
		factors that promote immune suppression or inhibition of inflammation. The aim of
		this paper is to discuss and re-interpret the possibility of association of
		paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) with IRIS in the central nervous system (CNS) in a
		case from Brazil published by Silva-Vergara ML. et al. (Mycopathologia
		"177:137-141, 6). An AIDS patient who was not receiving medical care developed"
		pulmonary PCM successfully treated with itraconazole. The patient developed
		central nervous system PCM (NPCM) after starting the ARV therapy with recovery of
		"immunity and control of HIV viral load, although it was not interpreted as IRIS"
		"by the authors, it fulfills the criteria for CNS IRIS. This could be the first"
		"case of NPCM associated with IRIS described. Although not frequent, IRIS must be"
		"considered in PCM patients and HIV, from endemic areas or patients that traveled"
		"to endemic areas, receiving ARV treatment and with worsening symptoms."

AB	-	Paracoccidioidomycosis is a highly prevalent systemic mycosis in Brazil. The
		primary cutaneous form is rare and occurs in the absence of pulmonary
		involvement. Lesions located in the distal regions of the lower limbs are not
		uncommon and particularly in the feet may go unnoticed or even be confused with
		infectious or neoplastic lesions of different etiologies. We report a case of
		"paracoccidioidomycosis affecting the left great toe of a man, leading to complete"
		destruction of the nail plate. Treatment was done with the sulfamethoxazole plus
		trimethoprim with excellent results.

PG	-	189-93
AB	-	Paracoccidiodomycosis and histoplasmosis are endemic diseases in the south of
		"Venezuela, representing a public health problem. Prevalence of Paracoccidiodes"
		"brasiliensis and Histoplasma capsulatum infections were estimated in Monte Ralo,"
		a rural community area of Bolivar state using paracoccidiodine and histoplasmine
		skin tests. Paracoccidiodine was intradermically injected to 173 persons and
		readings were made at 24 and 48 h afterwards to 167 persons (97.85%). Reaction
		was positive in 8.5% (n = 14) at 24 h post-injection and 13.2% (n = 20) at 48 h.
		Farmers showed the higher percentage of positivity at 24 and 48 h. One
		hundred-seventy five persons were intradermically injected with histoplasmine but
		167 and 157 of them attended for reading of the dermal reaction at 24 and 48 h
		post-injection respectively. Tests were positive in 25.7% (n = 43) at 24 h and
		42.7% (n = 67) at 48 h. Further studies are needed in surrounding places to
		"delimit the endemic area of these mycosis in the Bolivar state. However,"
		epidemiological vigilance of PCM and H should be considered by local health
		authorities.

AB	-	Paracoccidioidomycosis is an endemic disease in Latin America that is rarely
		"associated with immunosuppression and biological therapy. Herein, we report for"
		the first time a case of pulmonary paracoccidioidomycosis reactivation after
		infliximab treatment. A 47-year-old man from Brazil received infliximab to treat
		"psoriatic spondyloarthropathy and presented with cough, dyspnea, weight loss, and"
		fever. Chest computed tomography revealed a pulmonary nodule and biopsy confirmed
		paracoccidioidomycosis. Treatment with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim was
		initiated for fungal infection and infliximab was reintroduced two months later.
		"Considering his clinical improvement and favorable radiologic evolution,"
		antifungal therapy was discontinued after 29 months.

AB	-	PURPOSE: to describe the clinicopathologic features and treatment of a rare case
		of systemic paracoccidioidomycosis with choroidal and retinal involvement.
		DESIGN: retrospective interventional case report. PARTICIPANT: A 36-year-old
		young man with visual impairment in left eye with anterior uveitis and presence
		"of whitish perimacular choroidal nodule, multiple underlying whitish spots and"
		mid-periphery exudative retinal detachment. A primary extensive work-up for
		"systemic infectious, autoimmune, neoplasic or inflammatory conditions was"
		performed and high-resolution computer tomography scan demonstrated asymmetric
		parietal thickening of the trachea and bilateral diffuse multiple lobular
		"opacities. Pulmonary bronchoscopy/biopsy of larynx, trachea and bronchial tube"
		were also performed. Histopathological evaluation showed characteristic of
		Paracoccidioidomycosis. INTERVENTION: Patient was treated with oral sulphadiazine
		"(1.5 g/day). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Anterior uveitis, retinal examination,"
		histopathological evaluation and primary clinical outcome were observed during
		"systemic treatment. RESULTS: After 3 months of irregular treatment, choroidal"
		lesions decreased in size forming atrophic scars and fibrotic spots; however
		visual acuity did not show any improvement. CONCLUSION: We report a rare case of
		systemic paracoccidioidomycosis with choroidal and retinal involvement treated
		with oral sulphadiazine.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Paracoccidioidomycosis is an endemic mycosis caused by members of the
		"Paracoccidioides genus. Brazil remains the focus area and, to a lesser extent,"
		"the disease has been reported from Argentina, Colombia and Venezuela. AIMS: A"
		"Venezuelan Paracoccidioides brasiliensis strain, isolated from a patient"
		"diagnosed with chronic multifocal paracoccidioidomycosis, was subjected to whole"
		genome sequencing to provide more insight about Paracoccidioides outside the
		endemic focus area. METHODS: P. brasiliensis strain CBS 118890 was whole genome
		sequenced using nanopore; library preparation with the 'native barcoding genomic
		DNA kit' was followed by sequencing on Flongle and MinION flowcells. Batches of
		strain CBS 118890 were re-identified by sequencing the internal transcribed
		"spacer (ITS) region, and final identification was made based on phylogenetic"
		"analysis. RESULTS: Surprisingly, the Venezuelan P. brasiliensis strain CBS 118890"
		turned out to be a Nannizziopsis species. The batches of this strain were ITS
		sequenced followed by phylogenetic analysis and resulted in the final
		identification of Nannizziopsis arthrosporioides. CONCLUSIONS: Nannizziopsis
		"infections are commonly seen in a wide variety of reptiles, but are particularly"
		rare in human infections. This case underlines the need for molecular
		characterization of cases that clinically mimic paracoccidioidomycosis but that
		are serologically negative for Paracoccidioides.

AB	-	Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a systemic disease caused by thermodymorphic
		"fungi of the Paracoccidioides brasiliensis complex, (Paracoccidioides spp.)."
		Patients with PCM reveal specific cellular immune impairment. Despite the
		"effective treatment, quiescent fungi can lead to relapse, usually late, the"
		serological diagnosis of which has been deficient. The present study was carried
		out with the objective of investigating a biomarker for the identification of PCM
		relapse and another molecule behaving as an immunological recovery biomarker;
		"therefore, it may be used as a cure criterion. In the evolutionary analysis of"
		"the proteins identified in PCM patients, comparing those that presented with"
		"those that did not reveal relapse, 29 proteins were identified. The interactions"
		"observed between the proteins, using transferrin and haptoglobin, as the main"
		"binding protein, were strong with all the others. Patient follow-up suggests that"
		cerulosplamin may be a marker of relapse and that transferrin and apolipoprotein
		A-II may contribute to the evaluation of the treatment efficacy and avoiding a
		premature decision.

AB	-	Osteoarthritis in paracoccidioidomycosis has been rarely reported. The present
		"case describes a 36-""year""-old woman, with chronic monoarthritis in the knee"
		"lasting 4 years. The diagnosis was achieved only after synovial biopsy, by"
		anatomopathological examination showing granulomatous reaction with a large
		"number of the characteristic ""pilot wheel""Paracoccidioides brasiliensis yeast"
		"cells. Specific therapy, initially with ketoconazole and followed by"
		cotrimoxazole led to complete functional recovery of the compromised joint. No
		"other affected site was detected by various propaedeutic methods, including"
		computed axial tomography of the thorax and abdomen. The authors emphasize the
		rarity of the case and discuss its possible pathophysiology.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a systemic mycosis caused by
		pathogenic dimorphic fungi of the genus Paracoccidioides. It is the most
		important systemic mycosis in Latin America and the leading cause of
		hospitalizations and death among them in Brazil. Acute PCM is less frequent but
		relevant because vulnerable young patients are affected and the severity is
		usually higher than that of the chronic type. METHODS: The authors performed a
		retrospective cohort study from 2001 to 2009 including acute juvenile PCM
		"patients from a reference center in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Clinical,"
		"epidemiological, diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic data were reported."
		RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were included. The average age was 23 years old and
		the male to female ratio was 1:1.07. All cases were referred from 3 of 9 existing
		"health areas in the state of Rio de Janeiro, predominantly from urban areas"
		"(96.5%). Lymph nodes were the most affected organs (100%), followed by the skin"
		and the spleen (31% each). Twenty-eight patients completed treatment (median 25
		months) and progressed to clinical and serological cure; 1 death occurred.
		Twenty-four patients completed 48-month median follow-up. Four patients abandoned
		follow-up after the end of treatment. The most frequent sequela was low adrenal
		reserve. Paracoccidioides brasiliensis S1 was identified by partial sequencing of
		the arf and gp43 genes from 4 patients who presented a viable fungal culture.
		CONCLUSION: Acute juvenile PCM is a severe disease with a high rate of
		complications. There are few cohort clinical studies of acute PCM in the
		literature. More studies should be developed to promote improvement in patients'
		healthcare.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a systemic mycosis of chronic
		"presentation more frequent in adults, which may lead to disseminated severe and"
		"lethal forms involving the lungs, skin, lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and lymphoid"
		"organs of the digestive tract. Common in Latin America, it is rare in"
		"transplanted patients, with few cases described in the literature. PURPOSE: To"
		report a case of a patient who underwent kidney transplant 3 years ago with a
		"pseudotumoral cervical PCM diagnosis. METHODS: A male patient, 45 years old, who"
		"underwent kidney transplantation 3 years ago presenting with diarrhea, severe"
		"weight loss, and anemia; no breathing complaints. Parasitological stool tests,"
		"fecal culture, urine culture, and abdomen USG were performed in order to assess"
		"the diarrhea, and were inconclusive. He was treated with antibiotics and"
		antiparasitic drugs with no improvement and continued with weight loss of 15 kg
		"within 3 months. Immunosuppression was changed, with the mycophenolic acid"
		"reduced until it was replaced by everolimus. The diarrhea returned to intensify,"
		and there was an increase in the creatinine (from 1.5 to 3.4). He was empirically
		"treated with sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, with total remission of the diarrhea."
		"The patient underwent a kidney biopsy, anti-HIV examinations, PCR BK virus, and"
		PCR for Mycobacterium tuberculosis-with no diagnostic conclusion. During his
		"fifth hospitalization (6 months after the beginning of the diagnostic research),"
		"presenting a quite compromised general state, loss of 20 kg, anemia, kidney"
		"failure, and fever, he developed skin lesions on the legs and a voluminous and"
		"hard tumor in the right cervical region. Chest computed tomography was performed,"
		and the tumoral lesions were removed from those regions. He was started on
		tuberculostatics and underwent a biopsy of the cervical tumoral lesion. RESULT:
		Biopsy of the cervical tumor showed a fungal infection by paracoccidioidomycosis.
		The BAAR test of the biopsy was negative. The patient died a few weeks after the
		diagnosis. CONCLUSION: The association between the organ transplant and PCM is
		"rare and, in unusual clinical presentations, the diagnosis difficulty may"
		compromise a successful treatment.

AB	-	Hyperkalemic renal tubular acidosis is a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis that
		"invariably indicates an abnormality in potassium, ammonium, and hydrogen ion"
		"secretion. In clinical practice, it is usually attributed to real or apparent"
		hypoaldosteronism caused by diseases or drug toxicity. We describe a 54-year-old
		liver transplant patient that was admitted with flaccid muscle weakness
		associated with plasma potassium level of 9.25 mEq/L. Additional investigation
		revealed type 4 renal tubular acidosis and marked hypomagnesemia with high
		fractional excretion of magnesium. Relevant past medical history included a
		"recent diagnosis of Paracoccidioidomycosis, a systemic fungal infection that is"
		"endemic in some parts of South America, and his outpatient medications contained"
		"trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, tacrolimus, and propranolol. In the present"
		"acid-base and electrolyte case study, we discuss a clinical approach for the"
		diagnosis of hyperkalemic renal tubular acidosis and review the pathophysiology
		of this disorder.

		that may present cutaneous and oral lesions. Oral lesions mimic other infectious
		"diseases or even squamous cell carcinoma, clinically and microscopically."
		"Sometimes, the dentist is the first to detect the disease, because lung lesions"
		"are asymptomatic, or even misdiagnosed. An unusual case of PCM with 5 months of"
		"evolution presenting pulmonary, oral, and cutaneous lesions that was diagnosed by"
		the dentist based on oral lesions is presented and discussed.

PG	-	67-9
AB	-	We report a rare case of bony involvement by paracoccidioidomycosis in a
		4-year-old boy. Extremity radiographs show a diffuse permeative pattern of
		"metaphyseal bony destruction. Although these findings are nonspecific, they may"
		"suggest the disease in an appropriate clinical setting. Definitive diagnosis,"
		"however, depends upon detection of Paracoccidioides braziliensis on laboratory"
		analysis.

TI	-	Opportunistic infections in patients with AIDS admitted to an university hospital
		of the Southeast of Brazil.
PG	-	69-74
AB	-	Opportunistic diseases in HIV-infected patients have changed since the
		introduction of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART). This study aims at
		evaluating the frequency of associated diseases in patients with AIDS admitted to
		"an university hospital of Brazil, before and after HAART. The medical records of"
		342 HIV-infected patients were reviewed and divided into two groups: group 1
		"comprised 247 patients before HAART and, group 2, 95 patients after HAART. The"
		male-to-female rate dropped from 5:1 to 2:1for HIV infection. There was an
		"increase in the prevalence of tuberculosis and toxoplasmosis, with a decrease in"
		"Kaposi's sarcoma, histoplasmosis and cryptococcosis. A reduction of in-hospital"
		mortality (42.0% vs. 16.9%; p = 0.00002) has also occurred. An agreement between
		the main clinical diagnoses and autopsy findings was observed in 10 out of 20
		cases (50%). Two patients with disseminated schistosomiasis and 2 with
		"paracoccidioidomycosis are reported. Overall, except for cerebral toxoplasmosis,"
		it has been noticed a smaller proportion of opportunistic conditions related to
		severe immunosuppression in the post HAART group. There was also a significant
		"reduction in the in-hospital mortality, possibly reflecting improvement in the"
		treatment of the HIV infection.

		Glycoprotein Coding Gene of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis from a Case of
		Lacaziosis in a Female Pacific White-Sided Dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens).
PG	-	523-9

AB	-	"Lacaziosis, formerly called as lobomycosis, is a zoonotic mycosis, caused by"
		"Lacazia loboi, found in humans and dolphins, and is endemic in the countries on"
		"the Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean of Japanese coast. Susceptible"
		"Cetacean species include the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), the Indian"
		"Ocean bottlenose dolphin (T. aduncus), and the estuarine dolphin (Sotalia"
		"guianensis); however, no cases have been recorded in other Cetacean species. We"
		diagnosed a case of Lacaziosis in a Pacific white-sided dolphin (Lagenorhynchus
		obliquidens) nursing in an aquarium in Japan. The dolphin was a female estimated
		to be more than 14 years old at the end of June 2015 and was captured in a coast
		"of Japan Sea in 2001. Multiple, lobose, and solid granulomatous lesions with or"
		"without ulcers appeared on her jaw, back, flipper and fluke skin, in July 2014."
		The granulomatous skin lesions from the present case were similar to those of our
		previous cases. Multiple budding and chains of round yeast cells were detected in
		the biopsied samples. The partial sequence of 43-kDa glycoprotein coding gene
		"confirmed by a nested PCR and sequencing, which revealed a different genotype"
		"from both Amazonian and Japanese lacaziosis in bottlenose dolphins, and was 99 %"
		identical to those derived from Paracoccidioides brasiliensis; a sister fungal
		species to L. loboi. This is the first case of lacaziosis in Pacific white-sided
		dolphin.

		adult].
PG	-	199-202
AB	-	Paracoccidioidomycosis is endemic in subtropical rainforests of Latin America.
		Acute/subacute presentations involve an aggressive dissemination throughout the
		"lymphatic system, while chronic forms (more frequent) arise as differential"
		"diagnosis for other conditions involving lung, oropharynx, skin, and eventually"
		the brain. We present the case of a man referred for evaluation and treatment of
		a possible lung tumor with brain metastasis. The finding of multibudded yeasts
		and the microbiological isolation of a dimorphic fungus identified as
		Paracoccidioides sp. from a brain biopsy prompted a cardinal change in prognosis
		and treatment. This case alerts on the importance of considering systemic fungal
		diseases as differential diagnosis of compatible clinical presentations in
		"patients who had lived in, or visited, endemic areas."

PG	-	147-52
AB	-	The authors report an unusual case of fungal gastric lesion in a patient with the
		chronic form of paracoccidioidomycosis. For a period of 8 months the major
		symptoms of the patient were abdominal pain and body weight loss. The endoscopic
		evaluation of the upper gastrointestinal tract showed a partial gastrectomy made
		"previously, a great and irregular ulcer in the stomach and a granulated aspect of"
		the duodenal mucosa. A granulomatous process and Paracoccidioides brasiliensis
		were observed in the histopathological examination of the gastric and duodenal
		biopsy tissue. New endoscopic evaluation 4 months after treatment with
		sulfadiazine revealed healing of the gastric ulcer. It was suggested that
		"abdominal lymph nodes involvement, duodenal infection and anatomical and atrophic"
		alterations of the stomach were predisposing factors for the gastric
		paracoccidioidomycosis.

		"Cryptococcus neoformans, Blastomyces dermatitidis, and Paracoccidioides"
		"brasiliensis. The in vivo occurrence of such giant forms is rare, and when"
		observed histologically may result in an erroneous diagnosis or a diagnosis of

TI	-	Central nervous system paracoccidioidomycosis. Report of a case successfully
		treated with itraconazol.
PG	-	231-4
AB	-	Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a primary pulmonary infection that often
		disseminates to other organs and systems. Involvement of the central nervous
		system (CNS) is rare and due to the fact that both clinical alertness and
		"establishment of the diagnosis are delayed, the disease progresses causing"
		"serious problems. We report here a case of neuroparacoccidioidomycosis (NPCM),"
		"observed in a 55 year-old male, who consulted due to neurological symptoms (left"
		"hemiparesis, paresthesias, right palpebral ptosis, headache, vomiting and tonic"
		"clonic seizures) of a month duration. Upon physical examination, an ulcerated"
		granulomatous lesion was observed in the abdomen. To confirm the diagnosis a
		"stereotactic biopsy was taken; additionally, mycological tests from the ulcerated"
		"lesion and a bronchoalveolar lavage were performed. In the latter specimens, P."
		"brasiliensis yeast cells were visualized and later on, the brain biopsy revealed"
		the presence of the fungus. Treatment with itraconazole (ITZ) was initiated but
		clinical improvement was unremarkable; due to the fact that the patient was
		"taking sodium valproate for seizure control, drug interactions were suspected and"
		confirmed by absence of ITZ plasma levels. The latter medication was changed to
		"clonazepam and after several weeks, clinical improvement began to be noticed and"
		was accompanied by diminishing P. brasiliensis antigen and antibody titers. In
		"the PCM endemic areas, CNS involvement should be considered more often and the"
		efficacy of itraconazole therapy should also be taken into consideration.

AB	-	"Up to now, over 200 patients with paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) associated to HIV"
		"infection have already been reported; however, the central nervous system"
		involvement in this coinfection was rarely reported. This paper presents a
		35-year-old Brazilian male AIDS patient who developed pulmonary PCM successfully
		"treated with itraconazole. At the antiretroviral therapy starting, he had 32"
		"CD4(+) T cells baseline count and high viral load levels. After 9 months, he"
		presented severe fungal meningoencephalitis diagnosed by sublenticular enhanced
		nodular lesion at computerized tomography and magnetic resonance brain imaging
		and a positive Paracoccidiodes brasiliensis smear and culture from cerebrospinal
		"fluid. At the time, a sixfold increase in CD4(+) T cell count and undetectable"
		viral load level were evidenced. The patient received amphotericin B during 1
		"year presenting slow but progressive clinical improvement, and he is currently"
		"asymptomatic and without neurological disabilities. To our knowledge, this is the"
		second case report of a patient with neuroparacoccidioidomycosis associated to
		HIV infection.

		fungus with a brief review of the literature.
PG	-	419-21
LID	-	10.1002/dc.23432 [doi]
AB	-	Here we report a rare case of Cokeromyces recurvatus in a Pap test in an
		asymptomatic pregnant patient. Each liquid-based Pap slide contained multiple
		rounded yeast-like forms measuring 10-30 µm including some profiles with
		peripheral small buds. The background had neither epithelial abnormality nor any
		significant inflammation. A positive silver stain aided in confirming a fungal
		organism. Rare fungi were considered including Paracoccidioides brasiliensis due
		"to the 'mariner's wheel' morphology of forms with peripheral budding; however,"
		the final report morphologically favored C. recurvatus which was subsequently
		confirmed by culture. This is the sixth report of C. recurvatus isolated at a
		gynecologic site. While C. recurvatus has been reported to cause invasive disease
		"in immunocompromised patients at deep sites, in the gynecologic tract it has so"
		far been reported as a non-pathogenic colonizer. Awareness of this organism and
		use of either culture or molecular diagnostics are important in avoiding
		misdiagnosis.

PG	-	e12-6
AB	-	Gingival leishmaniasis is unusual and is mainly observed in immunocompromised
		"patients. We report a case involving the palate, uvula, and gingiva of an"
		HIV-negative patient who was initially diagnosed as having
		paracoccidioidomycosis. The patient underwent a biopsy for parasite isolation and
		in situ histopathology and immunohistochemistry. The Leishmania spp. were
		"detected in lesions of the uvula and gingiva. Despite the poor state of teeth,"
		the gingival lesions were caused by American tegumentary leishmaniasis (ATL). The
		gingival lesions presented an intense inflammatory infiltrate permeated by
		neutrophils. Immunohistochemistry revealed a predominantly lymphocytic
		"infiltrate. The patient responded well to treatment, with no reactivation during"
		follow-up. The rarity of gingival involvement in immunocompetent patients and the
		need for inclusion of ATL in the differential diagnosis of gingival lesions are
		discussed.

PG	-	629-33
AB	-	"In a 43-year-old Japanese Brazilian who came to Japan in 2001, since subjective"
		"symptoms such as cough, sputum, and dyspnea on exertion had become severe, he was"
		referred to our hospital because of suspicion of pulmonary tuberculosis in chest
		radiography and CT findings. A chest radiograph of initial examination showed
		"interstitial shadows in both lungs with nodular, infiltrative or cavitary"
		changes. No Mycobacterium tuberculosis was found. The mycetocyte with multipolar
		"budding resembling the steerage of a ship, which was characteristic of"
		Paracoccidioides was observed in sputum and transbronchial lung biopsy specimens.
		"We cultured a fungus to show dimorphism of temperature dependency, and a"
		diagnosis of chronic lung paracoccidioidomycosis was arrived at. By
		"administration of ITCZ 200 mg/day, the chest radiography findings and clinical"
		manifestations were improved. This case seems to be worthy of reporting in Japan
		since the affected site or organ was limited to the two lungs with multiple
		"cavitary lesions and fibrotic changes on radiographic examination, and final"
		diagnosis was made by cytology of sputum and pathology of TBLB specimens.

TI	-	Case of recurrent paracoccidioidomycosis in female. 10 years after initial
		treatment.
PG	-	67-72
AB	-	This report describes a case of recurrence of chronic paracoccidioidomycosis 10
		years following the initial diagnosis. A 56-year-old female was admitted to the
		Dental Clinic of the Pontifical Catholic University of Paraná complaining of oral
		"soreness. Mulberry-like ulcerations were observed on the gingiva, right labial"
		"comissura, and vermillion of the lip. The patient reported persistent chronic"
		"cough, weight loss, appetite loss and fever. The anamnesis revealed that the"
		patient had developed and been treated for paracoccidioidomycosis 10 years
		earlier. A biopsy was performed and microscopic examination revealed
		"microabscesses, collections of macrophages organized into granulomas,"
		multinucleated giant cells and Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. The patient was
		"treated with Itraconazole and, the oral lesions disappeared within 3 months."
		Persistent follow-up examination in patients with a history of
		paracoccidioidomycosis is essential in the management of this disease.

TI	-	Intramedullary spinal cord paracoccidioidomycosis. Report of two cases.
PG	-	466-73
AB	-	Two cases of intramedullary paracoccidioidomycosis are reported.
		Paracoccidioidomycosis is a systemic disease that involves the buccopharyngeal
		"mucosa, lungs lymph nodes and viscera and infrequently the central nervous"
		system. Localization in the spinal cord is rare. Case 1: a 55-year old male
		"admitted with crural pararesis, tactile/painful hypesthesia and sphincter"
		disturbances of 15 days duration. Cutaneous-pulmonary blastomycosis was diagnosed
		17 years ago. Myelotomography showed a blockade of T3-T4 (intramedullary lesion).
		The lesion surgically removed was a Paracoccidioides brasiliensis granuloma.
		Treatment with sulfadiazine was started after the surgery. Follow-up of 15 month
		showed an improvement of the clinical signs. Case 2: a 57-year old male was
		"admitted elsewhere 6 months ago and, with a radiologic diagnosis of pulmonary"
		"paracoccidioidomycosis, was treated with amphotericin B. He progressively"
		"developer paresthesia and tactile/pain anaesthesia on the left side, sphincter"
		disturbances and tetraparesis with bilateral extensor plantar response and clonus
		of the feet. Myelotomography showed a blockade of C4-C6 (intramedullary lesion).
		The lesion was not found during surgical exploration and the patient deteriorated
		and died. Post-mortem examination revealed an intramedullary tumor above the site
		of the mielotomy (Paracoccidioides brasiliensis granuloma). The preoperative
		diagnosis of intramedullary paracoccidioidomycotic granulomas is difficult
		because the clinical and radiologic manifestations are uncharacteristic. Clinical
		suspicion was possible in our cases based on the history of previous systemic
		"disease. Contrary to intracranial localizations, paracoccidioidomycotic"
		granulomas causing progressive spinal cord compression may require early surgery
		because response to clinical treatment is slow and the reversibility of
		neurological deficits depends on the promptness of the decompression.

TI	-	[South American blastomycosis--a differential diagnosis to tuberculous
		meningitis].
PG	-	33-4
AB	-	BACKGROUND: South American blastomycosis is primarily a lung infection often
		complicated by multiorgan or intracranial disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We
		describe the clinical and pathological findings of fatal cerebral blastomycosis
		occurring in a woman that immigrated to Norway from Brazil 23 years earlier.
		RESULTS: The clinical symptoms together with the radiological findings of
		multiple cerebral lesions and thickening of the basal meninges were interpreted
		as cerebral tuberculosis. Examination of cerebral spinal fluid was inconclusive.
		A diagnosis of cerebral fungal infection was subsequently established by brain
		biopsy. INTERPRETATION: This case history stresses the importance of confirming a
		clinical diagnosis by brain biopsy and extended investigation of the
		cerebrospinal fluid when intracranial lesions may have an infectious origin.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Paracoccidioidomycosis is the most frequent systemic mycosis in Latin
		"America, caused by the dimorphic fungus Paracoccidioides. Paracoccidioidomycosis"
		in children is uncommon. Our aim is to describe clinical features of patients who
		had a confirmed diagnosis of paracoccidioidomycosis in our hospital in the last
		10 years. CASE REPORTS: We describe 4 cases of paracoccidioidomycosis in
		previously healthy children from the north of our country. Diagnoses were made by
		biopsy or culture. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of paracoccidioidomycosis should be
		"considered in a patient coming from regions where Paracoccidioides is endemic,"
		"and presenting with a lymphoproliferative syndrome, anemia, eosinophilia and"
		hypergammaglobulinemia.

AB	-	We report on a 36 years-old man that had been at the Amazon forest four years
		before. Six months before the admission he had developed a progressive
		"quadriparesis, gait ataxia, dysphagia, dysarthria, difficulty in breathing and"
		hiccup. The gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted MRI showed a lesion into the right
		"parietoccipital area and another into the medulla, that was the largest. There"
		was any evidence of tuberculosis or AIDS. The patient was submitted to
		microsurgical approach to the medulla. Pathological examination revealed
		paracoccidioidomycosis. Treatment with anphotericin B till 2100 mg was
		administered followed by sulfamethoxazole-trimetoprim for three months plus
		physical therapy. The patient went back to his activities six months after the
		end of the treatment. Comments are presented about the participation of the
		immunological system and of the cytokines (interleukines).

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Paracoccidioidomycosis is an important medical and social problem
		"mainly in rural areas of Brazil, because of the high incidence of the diseases,"
		"its long clinical evolution, frequent recurrences and sequels leading to"
		anatomical and functional incapacities. MAIN OBSERVATION: We present a
		73-year-old patient with paracoccidioidomycosis showing significant lymph node
		"manifestations, which are only common in children and teenagers. CONCLUSIONS:"
		"Paracoccidioidomycosis may have a long incubation period, and it can be diagnosed"
		"outside of the endemic regions, where it was acquired. Thus, all dermatologists"
		"should maintain a high index of suspicion, especially in unusual cases of"
		extensive lymph node enlargement in the elderly patients.

TI	-	Paracoccidioidomycosis and AIDS: report of the first two Colombian cases.
PG	-	377-81
AB	-	The records of the first two Colombian patients with AIDS and
		paracoccidioidomycosis are presented. Both patients were males and had no known
		risk factors for HIV although in the past they had worked in the field where they
		could have been infected with the fungus. They exhibited the juvenile type of
		disease with multiple organ system involvement and symptoms of short duration.
		They were deeply immunodepressed as indicated by less than 100 CD4 T lymphocytes
		"per mL; however, serologic tests revealed circulating anti-Paracoccidioides"
		brasiliensis antibodies and in one patient the first diagnostic clue came from
		"such tests. In one case, the mycosis preceded the AIDS diagnosis while in the"
		"other, both pathologies were discovered simultaneously. Antimycotic therapy with"
		"itraconazole was administered for over 10 months, with an initial dose of 200"
		mg/day followed by 100 mg/day; marked improvement of the mycotic signs and
		symptoms was soon noticed an there have been no signs of relapse. The patients
		improvement was also due to the combined retroviral treatment that was
		instituted. In spite of the rarity of the AIDS-paracoccidioidomycosis
		"association, physicians practicing in endemic areas should consider the presence"
		"of the mycosis in immunosuppressed patients, since a prompt diagnosis and"
		institution of combined antimycotic-anti-retroviral treatments would result in
		patient improvement and survival. It appears possible that the longer survival
		time of today's AIDS patients would give the quiescent fungus the opportunity to
		"revive, multiply and cause overt disease."

AB	-	Acute or chronic disseminated paracoccidioidomycosis can be associated with
		"changes in blood and bone marrow cell counts, mainly in the severe forms of this"
		"disease. However, there are few reports about the microbiological confirmation of"
		the mycosis in bone marrow tissue. The present report describes a case of an
		"adult patient with severe chronic multifocal paracoccidioidomycosis, whose"
		etiological diagnosis has been done by the microscopical exam and culture fo the
		bone marrow aspirate. The authors emphasize the importance of these exams as an
		alternative way for the diagnosis of suspected cases of severe
		paracoccidioidomycosis.

AB	-	Paracoccidioidomycosis is a fungal disease which can compromise the central
		nervous system (CNS).We present a case of an immunocompetent 45 year old man from
		"Satipo, Peru who developed paracoccidioidomycosis in the CNS without any apparent"
		point of entry or infection. The patient was diagnosed by imaging with a
		"cerebellar granuloma, followed by a craniotomy where tissue and secretion of the"
		granuloma abscess was obtained. Histological and microbiological diagnoses were
		"performed on the tissue and secretion, respectively. Yeasts were observed in the"
		histological section and growth of the fungus in the culture. The patient
		"initially received antifungals, then acquired an intrahospital infection,"
		received colistin and subsequently died. The case report emphasizes the
		importance of early and correct diagnosis for good outcomes of
		paracoccidioidomycosis cases.

		"developed painful ulcerations throughout the body. After the correct diagnosis,"
		"with evidence of the fungus in histopathological and mycological examinations,"
		the patient was properly treated with itraconazole for eight months and evolved
		with total remission of the disease.

TI	-	Recovery of adrenal reserve following treatment of disseminated South American
		blastomycosis.
PG	-	298-301
AB	-	South American blastomycosis commonly involves the adrenal glands as proved in
		"autopsy series, although clinical adrenocortical insufficiency is infrequently"
		"suspected. In 1972, an Ecuadorian man was seen with disseminated"
		paracoccidioidomycosis and Addison's disease documented by low basal steroid
		levels and lack of response to ACTH therapy. The patient has since been treated
		"with a total dose of 4,000 mg of amphotericin B. He discontinued all steroid"
		replacement therapy for two years but remained asymptomatic. Recent evaluation
		"documented improvement in basal steroid production, particularly"
		mineralocorticoids. Adrenal reserve has also been demonstrated by the response of
		glucocorticoids to ACTH stimulation. This is the first well documented case in
		which adrenal reserve was recovered following treatment of granulomatous
		Addison's disease.

TI	-	The role of apoptosis in the antigen-specific T cell hyporesponsiveness of
		paracoccidioidomycosis patients.
PG	-	215-22
AB	-	Paracoccidioidomycosis is a deep endemic mycosis associated with an
		antigen-specific immunodeficiency. To examine the role of apoptosis in this
		"immunodeficiency, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of patients with"
		paracoccidioidomycosis and controls were stimulated with the main antigen of
		Paracoccidioides brasiliensis (gp43) and an unrelated fungal antigen (from
		"Candida albicans, CMA) and analyzed for annexin V and propidium iodide staining"
		by flow cytometry. Control PBMC proliferated well with both antigens. Patients'
		"PBMC proliferated only with CMA, but presented higher levels of apoptosis with"
		"gp43 and CMA than in their own unstimulated cultures. Moreover, gp43-triggered"
		"apoptosis in control PBMC was lower than in those of the patients. Thus, patient"
		but not control gp43-stimulated T cells apparently remained anergized and
		subsequently underwent apoptosis. While CMA-induced apoptosis is likely triggered
		"by activation-induced cell death, this is apparently not the case in gp43-induced"
		apoptosis because of the lack of cell cycling and IL-2 in the gp43-stimulated
		"cultures. However, higher IL-10 levels were found in gp43-stimulated patient PBMC"
		cultures. Addition of a neutralizing anti-IL-10 antibody to the cultures resulted
		in increased apoptosis levels only in gp43-stimulated patient PBMC cultures. Our
		results suggest that apoptosis plays a role in the patients' antigen-specific
		hyporesponsiveness and that IL-10 may have an antiapoptotic role.

TI	-	Reversed halo sign in lymphomatoid granulomatosis.
PG	-	e162-6
AB	-	Lymphomatoid granulomatosis is a rare lymphoproliferative disorder which affects
		"extranodal sites, most commonly lung. Radiologically, it typically presents with"
		multiple nodular opacities that may wax and wane. The reversed halo sign has
		previously been reported in cryptogenic organizing pneumonia and more recently in
		South American blastomycosis. We describe a case of histologically proven
		lymphomatoid granulomatosis in a patient who presented initially with the more
		"typical nodular opacities, which subsequently progressed into the reversed halo"
		"sign. To the best of our knowledge, this association has not been previously"
		described.

AB	-	Patients with Mendelian Susceptibility to Mycobacterial Diseases (MSMD) exhibit
		variable vulnerability to infections by mycobacteria and other intramacrophagic
		"bacteria (e.g., Salmonella and Klebsiella) and fungi (e.g., Histoplasma, Candida,"
		"Paracoccidioides, Coccidioides, and Cryptococcus). The hallmark of MSMD is the"
		inherited impaired production of interferon gamma (IFN-γ) or the lack of response
		to it. Mutations in the interleukin (IL)-12 receptor subunit beta 1 (IL12RB1)
		"gene accounts for 38% of cases of MSMD. Most IL12RB1 pathogenic allele mutations,"
		"including ten known stop-gain variants, cause IL-12Rβ1 complete deficiency"
		"(immunodeficiency-30, IMD30) by knocking out receptor cell-surface expression."
		"IL12RB1 loss-of-function genotypes impair both IL-12 and IL-23 responses. Here,"
		"we assess the health effects of a rare, novel IL12RB1 stop-gain homozygous"
		genotype with paradoxical IL-12Rβ1 cell-surface expression. We appraise four MSMD
		"children from three unrelated Brazilian kindreds by clinical consultation,"
		"medical records, and genetic and immunologic studies. The clinical spectrum"
		narrowed down to Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine-related suppurative
		"adenitis in all patients with one death, and recrudescence in two,"
		"histoplasmosis, and recurrence in one patient, extraintestinal salmonellosis in"
		"one child, and cutaneous vasculitis in another. In three patients, we established"
		the homozygous Trp7Ter predicted loss-of-function inherited genotype and inferred
		it from the heterozygote parents of the fourth case. The Trp7Ter mutation maps to
		the predicted IL-12Rβ1 N-terminal signal peptide sequence. BCG- or
		phytohemagglutinin-blasts from the three patients have reduced cell-surface
		expression of IL-12Rβ1 with impaired production of IFN-γ and IL-17A. Screening of
		227 unrelated healthy subjects from the same geographic region revealed one
		"heterozygous genotype (allele frequency 0.0022) vs. one in over 841,883 public"
		genome/exomes. We also show that the carriers bear European ancestry-informative
		alleles and share the extended CACCAGTCCGG IL12RB1 haplotype that occurs
		worldwide with a frequency of 8.4%. We conclude that the novel IL12RB1 N-terminal
		signal peptide stop-gain loss-of-function homozygous genotype confers IL-12Rβ1
		deficiency with varying severity and early-onset age through diminished
		cell-surface expression of an impaired IL-12Rβ1 polypeptide. We firmly recommend
		attending to warning signs of IMD30 in children who are HIV-1 negative with a
		history of adverse effects to the BCG vaccine and presenting with recurrent
		Histoplasma spp. and extraintestinal Salmonella spp. infections.

PG	-	159-63
AB	-	"In paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), the primary lung infection remains silent. In"
		"this study, attempts were done to define the primary target organ by correlating"
		lung radiographic abnormalities with the time course of mucosal/skin lesions
		concurrently exhibited at diagnosis by 63 patients in whom microscopy and/or
		isolation of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis from respiratory secretions had been
		"positive. Mucosal and skin lesions were found in 65.1% and 12.7% of the patients,"
		respectively. Odynophagia and dysphagia were present in 38.1% each. All patients
		"had lung interstitial infiltrates, and 31.7% had also alveolar lesions; fibrosis"
		was recorded in 46% of them. An inverse correlation was shown for fibrosis and
		presence of either odynophagia or dysphagia. Cluster analyzes strongly supported
		"two sets of patients: those with mucosal damage, odynophagia/dysphagia, and"
		"alveolo-interstitial infiltrates and those with dermal lesions, dyspnea, and lung"
		fibrosis. These groups may represent novel stages in the natural course of PCM.

		"years before, treated with oral antifungal, with good clinical response. The"
		mycological study of the skin clinical samples showed multiple budding yeast like
		"elements consistent with Paracoccidioides, and the same organism was isolated in"

		with the first treatment. A rapid and favorable evolution was seen with the

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Paracoccidioidomycosis is a systemic mycosis of significant
		importance in some Latin American countries. The widespread use of neuroimaging
		methods has shown that involvement of the central nervous system was more
		frequent than previously reported. The most common form of occurrence of
		neuroparacoccidioidomycosis is the pseudotumoral one. The authors report a case
		of pseudotumoral neuroparacoccidioidomycosis localized in the posterior fossa.
		"CASE DESCRIPTION: A 49-year-old single man, rural worker, born and raised in"
		"Laranjal Paulista-SP, was admitted to the hospital with 3 months history of"
		bilateral occipital headache every day. Along with a history of active smoking
		"and previous use of alcohol, the patient reported personal history of mild"
		occipitotemporal injury 3 months ago. The patient was submitted to computed
		"tomography in a 16-row multidetector scanner, which revealed a nodular hypodense"
		lesion with a ring-enhancement and associated perilesional edema in the left
		cerebellar hemisphere. Radiological workup was initiated to investigate the
		eventual primary neoplastic site. CONCLUSION: The analysis of the lipid peak by
		spectroscopy of proton magnetic resonance may indicate the neurological
		"involvement by paracoccidioidomycosis, notably in patients with concomitant risk"
		and pulmonary involvement signals.

		paracoccidioidomycosis.
PG	-	65-9
AB	-	We describe the case reports of two patients with immunodeficiency secondary to
		paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) and opportunistic Cryptococcus neoformans
		infections. Secondary immunodeficiency likely occurred as a consequence of the
		intestinal loss of proteins and lymphocytes associated with malabsorption
		syndrome due to obstructed lymphatic drainage. Both patients had had severe
		abdominal involvement during the acute PCM disease. Immunological evaluation
		showed cellular and humoral immunity impairment. Cryptococcosis manifested as
		relatively well circumscribed lesions: osteolytic lesions of the skull in one
		"patient, and pulmonary nodules in the other. The latter was treated surgically"
		"and with amphotericin B, whereas the other was treated with the combination"
		amphotericin-B and flucytosine. Both patients had a good response to treatment
		with complete regression of the lesions. They have now 2 and 4 years of follow-up
		with maintenance therapy and no indication of reactivation of the infection. PCM
		also did not reactivate. The clinical and immunological characteristics of these
		patients are discussed and compared to the opportunistic C. neoformans infections
		of AIDS and transplant patients.

PG	-	37-46
LID	-	10.1099/0022-1317-49-1-37 [doi]
AB	-	Several serological tests have been used successfully in the diagnosis of
		"paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM). In contrast, data about the use of these tests in"
		"the follow-up of PCM patients have been heterogeneous. In this study, serum"
		samples from 43 PCM patients with different clinical forms were analysed by
		"counter-immuno-electrophoresis (CIE), complement fixation (CF) and ELISA before"
		"treatment. With CIE and ELISA, the chronic unifocal form showed significantly"
		lower antibody levels compared with chronic multifocal and acute forms. Acute
		form patients had significantly higher titres than patients with multifocal
		disease by CIE but not by ELISA. No significant differences were observed with
		CF. Twenty-seven of these patients were followed-up for 2 years and showed a
		"decline in antibody levels by all three tests, paralleling clinical improvement."
		"However, only patients with unifocal disease cleared their antibodies after 1"
		"year of treatment as analysed by CF and ELISA and after 2 years by CIE,"
		suggesting that these patients may need shorter courses of therapy. Patients with
		the other clinical form of the disease needed > or =2 years of therapy to clear
		their antibodies. Sera from a further five patients who presented with a relapse
		were analysed. At the time of relapse all showed increases in antibody levels by
		"CIE and ELISA, but only three showed increases by CF tests. Therefore, CIE and"
		"ELISA demonstrated a better clinical correlation than CF, probably reflecting the"
		fungal burden of PCM patients more accurately.

PG	-	916-9
AB	-	Presented here is a case of chronic paracoccidioidomycosis that occurred in a
		Cuban female living in Austria and was first misdiagnosed as tuberculosis. The
		"clinical picture was one of progressive pulmonary insufficiency with fever,"
		weight loss and productive cough. Since antituberculous therapy was started but
		"did not achieve a long-term clinical response, an intensive diagnostic work-up"
		was performed. Paracoccidioides brasiliensis was then diagnosed by
		"histopathology, serology, microbiology and molecular identification. Antifungal"
		"therapy was commenced immediately with amphotericin B (1 mg/kg/day) for 10 days,"
		"followed by voriconazole (200 mg/day po) for at least 3 months, and the lesions"
		disappeared almost completely. This report presents the first published case of
		imported paracoccidioidomycosis in a female patient in Austria.

AB	-	Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a systemic disease caused by the dimorphic fungus
		Paracocdioides brasiliensis. The infection primarily reaches the lungs by the
		inhalation of fungi spores and later can disseminate to other organs causing
		"secondary oral lesions. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), on the other hand, is"
		"an autoimmune chronic inflammatory disease that affects various organ systems,"
		including skin and oral cavity. Here we report a 39-year-old female patient
		bearing SLE and presenting an ulcerated lesion on the hard palate extending to
		"the superior alveolar ridge, diagnosed as PCM. Itraconazole 200mg was prescribed"
		and photodynamic therapy (PDT) was also instituted in a way to help dealing with
		the PCM infection while assisting such an immunocompromised patient to heal. PDT
		"consisted of topically placing toluidine blue dye at 37.5mg/L for 5min, followed"
		by low-level laser irradiation (660nm; 100J/cm(2); 40mW of power; 100s per
		"point). Forty days after beginning the treatment, the patient showed total"
		regression of the oral lesion and absence of painful symptoms. The serologic test
		was performed again after six months of therapy and was negative; the patient
		continues to be followed periodically.

TI	-	Paracoccidioidomycosis in the immunosuppressed host: report of a case and review
		of the literature.
PG	-	340-2
AB	-	A case of reactivated paracoccidioidomycosis in an immunosuppressed host is
		"described, the first association of this disease with renal transplantation. His"
		presentation and clinical course was similar to the general experience with this
		mycosis. his response to ketoconazole was delayed when compared with that in
		non-immunosuppressed patients. Ketoconazole produced a dramatic resolution of all
		symptoms within 7 months. Serial determinations of paracoccidioides complement
		"fixing antibodies showed falling titers, accurately reflecting his clinical"
		status. Comparisons are made with other endemic mycoses in immunosuppressed
		patients. More cases of paracoccidioidomycosis in immunosuppressed patients can
		be expected to occur as immunosuppressive therapy becomes more common in areas
		"endemic for Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, and with current trends in migration"
		and travel.

TI	-	Parinaud'S oculoglandular syndrome associated with paracoccidioidomycosis.
PG	-	49-52
AB	-	The authors report one case of Parinaud's oculoglandular syndrome associated with
		Paracoccidioides brasiliensis infection. No other medical report of this
		condition was found in the medical literature available at Index Medicus and
		Medline. The eye involvement has been rather uncommon in paracoccidioidomycosis
		and this report emphasizes the possibility of this kind of presentation making it
		also necessary to include paracoccidioidomycosis among the several known causes
		of Parinaud's oculoglandular syndrome.

AB	-	Paracoccidioidomycosis is a systemic disease caused by inhalation of conidia of
		"Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, a dimorphic fungus that initially affects the"
		"airway, spreading by lymphatic and hematogenous routes to various organs and"
		"systems, and that can be fatal if the diagnosis and treatment are not correct."
		The authors describe a patient who presents small vessel vasculitis as an initial
		"manifestation of the disease, which is an atypical clinical form with a single"
		description in the literature.

PG	-	37-9
AB	-	A two year-old female child was admitted at the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit in
		"a septic shock associated with a lymphoproliferative syndrome, with history of"
		"fever, adynamia and weight loss during the last two months. On admission, the"
		"main clinical and laboratory manifestations were: pallor, jaundice, disseminated"
		"enlarged lymph nodes, hepatosplenomegaly, crusted warts on face, anemia,"
		"eosinophilia, thrombocytopenia, increased direct and indirect bilirubin, alkaline"
		"phosphatase, and gammaglutamyl transpeptidase. A parenteral administration of"
		"fluids, dobutamine and mechanical ventilation was started, without improvement of"
		the clinical conditions. A direct examination of exsudate collected from cervical
		"lymph node revealed numerous oval-to-around cells with multiple budding, like a"
		"""pilot wheel"" cell, suggesting Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. Even though"
		"treatment with intravenous sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprine was soon started, the"
		child died 36 hours after hospital admission. Disseminated paracoccidioidomycosis
		was confirmed in the autopsy. This is the youngest case of paracoccidioidomycosis
		in children reported in the literature.

AB	-	We describe the first report of a patient with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis
		associated with disseminated and recurrent paracoccidioidomycosis. The
		"investigation demonstrated that the patient had a mannose receptor deficiency,"
		which would explain the patient's susceptibility to chronic infection by Candida
		spp. and systemic infection by paracoccidioidomycosis. Mannose receptors are
		responsible for an important link between macrophages and fungal cells during
		phagocytosis. Deficiency of this receptor could explain the susceptibility to
		"both fungal species, suggesting the impediment of the phagocytosis of these fungi"
		in our patient.

TI	-	Plasma amylase levels as a marker of disease severity in an isogenic murine model
		of paracoccidioidomycosis.
PG	-	37-45
AB	-	Survival patterns after peritoneal infection with Paracoccidioides brasiliensis
		vary according to the mouse strain and to the virulence of the fungal isolate. It
		has previously been observed that a significant increase in plasma amylase levels
		occurs only when susceptible mice (B10.A) were infected with a virulent isolate
		(Pb18). In order to verify if increased amylase levels correlate with
		"susceptibility to P. brasiliensis infection, 12 mouse strains with different"
		susceptibility patterns to this fungus were investigated after infection with
		"Pb18. When compared with their respective controls, C57BI/6, B10D2/oSn,"
		"B10D2/nSn, C3H/HeJ, B10.A and BALB/c mice showed a conspicuous amylase increase"
		"and AKR, (NZB x NZW)F1, CBA/J, (A/Sn x B10.A)F1, A/Sn and DBA/2 absence of"
		alteration. The influence of the infecting fungal isolate on this enzymatic
		parameter was investigated using B10.A mice and fungal isolates with diverse
		"degrees of virulence. When compared with their non-infected controls, mice"
		"infected with Pb45 or Pb47 showed a very high amylase increase, with Pb44 or Pb18"
		"a high one and with Pb50 or Pb265 a discrete increase. On the whole, there is an"
		inverse correlation between survival times after infection and the increase in
		"amylase levels. Thus, measurement of plasma amylase is a satisfactory parameter"
		to evaluate the severity of paracoccidioidomycosis in mice.

LID	-	10.3109/13693780902893405 [doi]
AB	-	The association of paracoccidioidomycosis with AIDS is apparently less frequent
		than expected. The authors present an unusual case of paracoccidioidomycosis in a
		13-year-old female student which was later found to be the first opportunistic
		infection in the course of the patient's HIV-infection. The clinical presentation
		followed an accidental incised wound on the palmar region initially described as
		a 'sporotrichotic-chancre'. After good response under
		"sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprin, the patient relapsed and presented an associated"
		oral candidiasis. HIV-infection was documented and additional investigation
		"showed CD4(+) T-cells=22/mm(3), CD8(+)=280 cell/mm(3) and viral load=4,043 log."
		This case report presents an uncommon dermatological-clinical picture in the
		youngest patient in which such association has been reported to date.

AB	-	Paracoccidioidomycosis is the most common deep mycosis in South America and is
		"caused by Paracoccidioides brasiliensis (P. brasiliensis), a thermally dimorphic"
		"fungus. Infections usually occur by inhalation of conidia, which more often cause"
		"respiratory, mucocutaneous, and lymph nodal changes. Chronic features of this"
		mycosis can mimic diverse infections and malignancies and constitute diagnosis
		challenges. Squamous cell carcinoma deserves special attention in this setting.
		We describe the case of a patient with synchronous diagnosis of oral
		paracoccidioidomycosis and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Concomitance of
		"these conditions may be a casual event, but a not fully understood causal"
		relationship can be involved.

		"has been described more than 80 years ago, reports of PCM and gastric cancer are"
		"rare. PCM can present before or concomitantly with the diagnosis of cancer, and"
		its clinical presentation may rise the suspicion of malignancies or be part of
		reactivation by immunosuppression. We present the case of a 52-year-old Peruvian
		man with a signet-ring cell (SRC) gastric adenocarcinoma who after 6 chemotherapy
		"sessions with FLOT (docetaxel, oxaliplatin, leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil) presented"
		rapidly growing lung nodules. The lung biopsy showed yeasts compatible with
		"Paracoccidioides sp., so he received initial treatment with itraconazole and"
		after gastrectomy maintenance therapy with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole
		accompanied by tomographic resolution of lesions.

		"lesions, diffuse lymphadenopathy and adrenal insufficiency. Histopathological and"
		mycological examination of a skin lesion were compatible with PCM. Itraconazole
		"was prescribed in high doses (400 mg/day). After seven months of treatment, the"
		patient presented with acute abdominal pain which led to an emergent
		"appendectomy, revealing the presence of the fungus. After 24 months, the patient"
		reached clinical cure and recovered from adrenal insufficiency. We emphasize the
		importance of PCM as a differential diagnosis in patients with chronic diarrhea.
		The risk of fungal infections should be considered prior to initiating
		"immunosupressive therapies, particularly in endemic areas."

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: In order to describe the case of an adolescent who developed psoas
		abscesses caused by Paracoccidiodes brasiliensis. DESCRIPTION: A 12-year-old boy
		was admitted with a history of daily fever and global lymph nodes enlargement. He
		"had been treated in the last 6 years, with irregular use of the drugs, for an"
		acute form of paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM). He presented a tenderness fluctuating
		"polyadenopathy in all cervical, submandibular, supraclavicular, axillary, and"
		"inguinal chains; several lymph nodes were up to 4 cm in diameter, hardened and"
		"coalescent. After 1 month of unsuccessful therapy with SMX-TMP, the patient"
		presented a pain in the right groin and difficulty to walk. CT scan showed a
		"global retroperitoneal lymph nodes enlargement, some with central necrosis and"
		two bigger collections adjacent to both psoas muscles. A surgical drainage of the
		collections was performed for several times. The patient received a total of 1.9
		"g of Amphotericin B. After 1 month of the last surgical procedure, CT scan showed"
		"only a residual collection, and the patient was sent to ambulatory follow-up. We"
		hypothesed that the retroperitoneal lymph nodes became a coalescent mass that
		fistulized to the psoas compartment. COMMENTS: The patient presented a febrile
		lymphoproliferative syndrome that is frequently seen in children with PCM.
		"Although a polymorphic manifestation is observed in this disease, psoas abscess"
		is a rare complication of PCM. The health professionals that take care of the
		patients with PCM must pay attention to the possibility of this one more
		complication.

AB	-	The immunossuppression caused by HIV infection makes the affected individuals
		"more susceptible to some diseases including infections, neoplasms, or even the"
		association between them. Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is the most common AIDS-related
		"neoplasm, featured as an angioproliferative disorder. Its cause seems to be"
		related to the human herpesvirus type 8 and it is usually associated with lower
		"CD4+ T cell count. Oral involvement is frequent, presenting red to blue-purplish"
		"plaques, maculaes, and nodules. On the other hand, paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM)"
		"is a systemic mycosis, endemic in Latin America, caused by Paracoccidioides"
		brasiliensis. This mycosis is not commonly related to human immunodeficiency
		"virus (HIV) infection, although PCM can be present in immunosuppression cases."
		"Oral lesions, as granulomatous ulcers, are often identified in seropositive"
		"patients with PCM. A rare case, in which a male HIV-positive patient presented"
		"simultaneously Kaposi sarcoma and PCM in the same fragment of oral mucosa biopsy,"
		"is described. To the best of our knowledge, this concomitant association had not"
		been previously described.

AB	-	Paracoccidioidomycosis is a fungal infection endemic to South American countries
		"that affects the lungs, skin, and mucosae. Reports from Japan are limited by a"
		long-term resident in South America. Some cases are incorrectly diagnosed because
		of a refractory buccal ulcer that resembles a malignant tumor. This is a disease
		that may not be correctly examined if we cannot suspect by a case history. We
		"report the case of a Brazilian man who had a buccal ulcer with lung involvement,"

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: Surgical clipping and parent vessel reconstruction of wide-neck
		paraclinoid aneurysms can be very challenging. We report a case of a ruptured
		paraclinoid aneurysm which failed standard clipping techniques. We were able to
		reconstruct this aneurysm while providing proximal and distal control using an
		adjuvant endovascular balloon. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: We report the case of a
		"45-year-old woman presenting with a ruptured large paraclinoidal aneurysm, which"
		involved a significant portion of the internal carotid artery wall. INTERVENTION:
		Repeated attempts at fenestrated clip placement resulted in slipping of the clip
		"and occlusion of the parent artery. Ultimately, the aneurysm ruptured at the"
		"neck, and, despite trapping and direct aneurysmal suction decompression,"
		"significant bleeding was encountered. The bleeding point was packed, and,"
		"subsequently, endovascular access was obtained. A balloon was navigated and then"
		inflated across the neck of the aneurysm using C-arm fluoroscopic guidance. The
		"aneurysm was successfully clipped, and intraoperative angiography demonstrated no"
		parent vessel stenosis. CONCLUSION: This case demonstrates a salvage procedure in
		the event of intraoperative rupture and inadequate interruption of local blood
		flow. Balloon inflation resulted in adequate hemostasis and provided intraluminal
		support for optimal clip placement while preserving the parent artery.

TI	-	[Hypercalcemia and multiple osteolytic lesions in a child with disseminated
		paracoccidioidomycosis and pulmonary tuberculosis].
PG	-	349-52
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To describe the case of a child with paracoccidioidomycosis who
		presented hypercalcemia with multiple osteolytic lesions. DESCRIPTION: A
		6-year-old boy was admitted with a one-month history of fever and
		"hepatosplenomegaly. On admission, he looked sick, pale, and had disseminated"
		lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. The laboratory findings included anemia
		"(hemoglobin = 6.8 g/dl), eosinophilia (1,222/mm3), thrombocytopenia"
		"(102,000/mm3), and hypoalbuminemia (serum albumin = 2.2 g/dl). Paracoccidioides"
		brasiliensis was identified in bone marrow examination. In the second week after
		"admission, the patient presented joint pain, poor activity and difficulty in"
		walking. He presented hypercalcemia (maximum value = 14.9 mg%) and reduction in
		"renal function, which lasted for two weeks. On the 42nd day after admission, his"
		"chest X-ray showed lytic lesions in clavicle, scapula, ribs, and humerus, with"
		bilateral slipped capital humeral epiphysis. The patient presented
		"nephrocalcinosis and nephrolithiasis, reduction in creatinine clearance and"
		"evidence of tubular lesions. At the end of the second month after admission,"
		Mycobacterium tuberculosis was isolated in gastric washing. The child received
		treatment for paracoccidioidomycosis and tuberculosis and has not had any
		sequelae for 3 years. COMMENTS: The development of symptomatic hypercalcemia
		"leading to renal lesion, associated with multiple osteolytic lesions, had never"
		been described in paracoccidioidomycosis. Although pulmonary tuberculosis was
		"diagnosed and could be related to hypercalcemia, the sudden onset of"
		hypercalcemia and its normalization without specific treatment for tuberculosis
		suggests that bone lysis was the most important factor in the genesis of
		hypercalcemia.

PG	-	2419-22
AB	-	"We present the case of a 69 yr old, white male, suffering from diffuse"
		"interstitial lung disease, finally diagnosed as paracoccidioidomycosis or South"
		"American blastomycosis. During the course of his disease, antineutrophil"
		"cytoplasmic antibodies (c-ANCAs) became positive, suggesting the possibility of a"
		Wegener's granulomatosis. Transbronchial biopsies and a video-assisted
		"thoracoscopic lung biopsy revealed only the pulmonary yeast infection, without"
		"other co-existing pathology. During treatment with itraconazole, the patient"
		"improved clinically and functionally, and c-ANCAs became negative. Serological"
		"monitoring confirmed the diagnosis. To our knowledge, this is the first report"
		describing positive c-ANCAs in a patient with paracoccidioidomycosis. It
		re-emphasizes the fact that cautious interpretation of c-ANCAs in patients
		without convincing clinical signs or pathological evidence of a granulomatous
		"vasculitis is absolutely necessary. In this era of increased mobility, a thorough"
		"medical history, including documentation of travel, remains an inexpensive tool"
		in making a diagnosis and is still the cornerstone of good medical practice.

PG	-	407-13
AB	-	Systematic examination of the upper respiratory and digestive tracts (URDT) was
		performed in a group of 80 paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) patients submitted to
		post-treatment follow-up ranging from 8 months to 17 years. Mucosae of the URDT
		"had been involved prior to specific treatment in 74 patients, distributed as"
		"follows: oropharynx, 50 (41 alone, 7 in association with the larynx, and 2 with"
		"the nasal mucosa); larynx, 30 (23 alone and 7 in association); and nasal mucosa,"
		3 (1 alone and 2 in association). Inactive lesions were observed in all the 50
		"patients with lesions of the oropharynx, 3 of whom with deforming scars (1 with"
		retraction of the tongue and 2 with narrowing of the oral orifice). One case
		"presented a destructive lesion, with perfuration of the palate. Of the other 46"
		"cases, examination showed nacreous white striated scars which were nearly"
		imperceptible in some cases and in others displayed partial retraction of
		anatomical structures without any alteration of their features. Patients
		presented a high rate of missing teeth. In 3 patients with involvement of the
		"nasal mucosa, none of whom presented active PCM lesions, 2 still had nasal"
		"voices. In 30 patients with lesions of the larynx, 1 suffered a relapse of PCM"
		"and 2 developed epidermoid carcinoma. Of the other 27 cases, none of whom had"
		"active PCM lesions, 15 presented dysphonia, 3 were tracheotomized, and 9 were"
		asymptomatic.

		Paracoccidioidomycosis: Lessons from Patients with a Single Paracoccidioides spp.
		Exposure.
PG	-	435-9
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-015-9976-0 [doi]
AB	-	Several aspects of the natural history of paracoccidioidomycosis are still poorly
		"understood. Different from the most prevalent, chronic form of the disease, the"
		acute form represents a continuum from the initial respiratory infection to the
		"full-blown disease, thus providing an opportunity to elucidate the pathogenesis"
		"of the early phase of this mycosis. We describe, for the first time, two patients"
		"with a single time point exposure to Paracoccidioides spp., for whom we were able"
		to determine the time lapsed between exposure to the fungus Paracoccidioides spp.
		"and the onset of signs and symptoms. In case 1, the pulmonary infection was"
		"unapparent, and the first manifestations of the acute/subacute form of the"
		"disease presented 4 months after Paracoccidioides spp. EXPOSURE: In case 2,"
		"self-limited, non-specific respiratory and systemic symptoms presented 45 days"
		"after infection. Thus, our patients confirm that, within a few weeks of"
		"infection, Paracoccidioides spp. affects the pulmonary lymphatic system and"
		"initially causes no or mild-to-moderate self-limited symptoms, eventually causing"
		"abnormalities on a chest X-ray, all of which spontaneously subside. These cases"
		"provide some insight into the natural history of this mycosis, the extent of the"
		"host exposure to the fungus, and the determination of its incubation period."

PG	-	456-9
AB	-	PURPOSE: To describe an atypical case of central nervous system and ocular
		paracoccidioidomycoses simulating ocular toxoplasmosis in a pregnant woman with
		acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). DESIGN: Interventional case report.
		"METHODS: Case report. RESULTS: A 25-year-old pregnant woman with AIDS, presented"
		"with a severe ocular inflammation in the right eye involving the choroid, retina,"
		"and the optic disk, which rapidly progressed to retinal detachment, iris"
		"neovascularization, and neovascular glaucoma. The left eye was normal. Magnetic"
		resonance imaging (MRI) showed a focal hypodense contrast-enhanced ring lesion in
		"the brain. Serum antibody titers were negative for Toxoplasma gondii, but the"
		polymerase chain reaction was positive for the parasite in the vitreous sample.
		"The patient responded partially to specific treatment for toxoplasmosis, and"
		there was a small reduction in size of the brain lesion. She progressed to a
		"blind painful eye, which was enucleated. Paracoccidioides brasiliensis was found"
		in the histopathological studies of the eye and oropharynx. With the diagnosis of
		"disseminated ocular paracoccidioidomycoses, the patient was treated with"
		trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole with a satisfactory outcome and reduction in size
		of the brain lesion. CONCLUSION: Although ocular infection with ocular
		"paracoccidioidomycoses is rare, this diagnosis should be considered when"
		investigating ocular inflammation in a patient with AIDS.

AB	-	This study reports two cases of chronic paracoccidioidomycosis with sarcoid-like
		cutaneous lesions. The patients began the treatment in 2013 at Hospital
		Universitário Clementino Fraga Filho (HUCFF) of the Universidade Federal do Rio
		de Janeiro (UFRJ). The first case (mild form) was treated with
		"trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (8 mg /kg per day, orally) for three months and,"
		"then, with half the dose for nine months; the second (moderate form), with"
		"itraconazole (200 mg per day, orally) for 12 months. We point out the rareness of"
		the sarcoid-like cutaneous lesions and the differential diagnoses for other
		granulomatous diseases.

PG	-	79-81
AB	-	BACKGROUND: There are several reported cases that describe female genital tract
		"infections with opportunistic fungi, such as Blastomyces dermatitidis,"
		"Coccidioides immitis, Aspergillus flavus, Cryptococcus neoformans and Mucor. We"
		describe a case of paracoccidiodomycosis limited to the uterine cervix. To the
		"best of our knowledge, no such case has been described before in the"
		"English-language literature. CASE: A 27-year-old, healthy female, gravida 3, para"
		"2, abortion 1, presented for a routine gynecologic examination at six weeks'"
		postpartum. Her past medical history was unremarkable. A routine
		cervical/endocervical smear revealed the presence of multiple fungal forms at
		"different stages of development with a characteristic ""pilot's wheel"" appearance"
		consistent with Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. Detailed medical examination of
		the patient did not reveal the presence of the primary infection in any other
		system. Cultures of the endometrium revealed no growth of the fungal organisms.
		"The patient was asymptomatic, and therefore no therapy was initiated. Repeat"
		Papanicolaou smears were negative for organisms. CONCLUSION:
		"Paracoccidioidomycosis can present as a limited form, involving the cervix only."
		Identification and recognition of the infection are important in cytopathology.

		"been described, with an incidence rate varying from 9.99% to 27.27%. There are"
		"two basic forms of clinical presentation: meningeal and tumor-like (abscesses,"
		"granulomas, nodules, and cysts). The Paracoccidioides brasiliensis is"
		"preferentially described in cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, medulla oblonga and"

		paracoccidioidomycosis which diagnosis was achieved by microscopic examination of
		material from oral lesions and specific serology. The patient presented clinical
		signs of spinal cord involvement confirmed by lesions found in magnetic resonance
		imaging. They emphasize the inedit therapeutic response to a new antifungal agent
		"(fluconazole) used for the first time in this kind of clinical manifestation, and"
		the excellent prognosis when diagnosis is promptly made.

		"touristic destination as well, with most cases occurring in Brazil, Argentina,"
		Venezuela and Colombia. The authors report a case of a 43 year old man who
		"previously worked in Venezuela and is living in Portugal for 8 years, presenting"
		with a single cutaneous lesion. Despite the absence of valuable respiratory
		"complaints, severe lung damage was found with high-resolution computed tomography"
		(HRCT). Biopsy of the cutaneous lesion and mycologic sputum examination were
		performed revealing Paracoccidioides brasiliensis infection.

AB	-	"The authors report the first case of fatal septic shock, a rare clinical"
		presentation of paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) caused by Paracoccidioides
		brasiliensis S1. We also provide an immunological evaluation of the patient.
		Severe clinical signs such as organ dysfunction and digital gangrene occurred in
		this case. The patient presented a remarkable cell activation profile and
		diminished percentage of peripheral blood T regulatory cells. A decrease in
		anti-inflammatory IL-1RA plasma level showed the potential for endothelium
		"damage, probably contributing to a vasculitis process. Together with P. lutzii,"
		P. brasiliensis appears to be involved in severe cases of PCM.

		in Midwestern Brazil.
PG	-	124-128
LID	-	10.1111/myc.12571 [doi]
AB	-	Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is the most important systemic mycosis in Latin
		America. About 80% of PCM patients are present with its chronic form. The lungs
		"are affected in most patients with the chronic form; however, pleural involvement"
		has rarely been reported. We describe nine cases of PCM that presented with lung
		"involvement and spontaneous pneumothorax. All patients, except one whose"
		"condition was not investigated, were smokers. PCM was diagnosed during the"
		"pneumothorax episode in three patients, and from 3 to 16 years before the"
		pneumothorax episode in six patients. A total of six patients underwent chest
		drainage and one died as a direct result of the pneumothorax. We suggest that
		"pneumothorax, although rare, should be considered in PCM patients who present"
		with suddenly worsening dyspnoea. PCM should also be investigated in cases of
		pneumothorax in adult men from mycosis-endemic areas.

PG	-	741-7
AB	-	The involvement of the central nervous system in paracoccidioidomycosis is more
		frequent than previously thought. The first reference to the possibility that
		Paracoccidioides brasiliensis could affect the central nervous system was by
		"Pereira & Jacobs in 1919. Since then, a great number of other studies has showed"
		"this form of clinical behavior and, in some of them, the frequency has ranged"
		27.27%. We report a clinical case of a 34-year-old white Brazilian woman admitted
		"because of bacterial pneumonia. In the sixth day of admission, the patient"
		"developed cerebellar symptomatology with nausea, vomiting, dysmetria and gait"
		disturbance. Central nervous system computer tomographic scanning disclosed a
		hypodense lesion in the right cerebellar hemisphere. The patient was submitted to
		surgery with total excision of the lesion. Histopathological examination
		confirmed the diagnosis of neuroparacoccidioidomycosis. Coadjuvant treatment with
		sulfamethoxazole-trimetoprim was introduced. The patient had a good outcome and
		was discharge 30 days after surgery.

PG	-	542-5
LID	-	10.3109/13693780903330563 [doi]
AB	-	Paracoccidioidomycosis is a systemic mycosis that is usually acquired early in
		life by inhalation of conidia which convert in the lungs into yeast forms; these
		in turn trigger an inflammatory process. This mycosis may appear as an
		"acute/subacute form or a chronic, adult form. Acute/subacute presentations can be"
		"observed in children and young adults, with the reticuloendothelial system"
		frequently involved but the lungs are usually spared or present with mild
		"clinical or radiological alterations. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),"
		an extensive dysfunction of the lungs alveolar-capillary barrier has occasionally
		"been observed in other endemic mycoses such as coccidioidomycosis,"
		"cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis and blastomycosis. We describe the first patient"
		with acute paracoccidioidomycosis who developed fatal ARDS accompanied by
		multiple organ injuries. The basis of the rarity of this entity in patients with
		"paracoccidioidomycosis, as well as the reasons that may have lead to the"
		development of ARDS in this patient are discussed.

		Guiana].
PG	-	136-9
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Paracoccidio-domycosisis a deep mycosis due to a dimorphic
		fungus:Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. The principle endemic country is Brazil. We
		"describe the first case of paracoccidio-domycosis, in its cutaneous-mucosal form,"
		"diagnosed in French Guiana. OBSERVATION: A 20 year-old Brazilian man, having"
		"mover to French Guiana a few months earlier, presented with multiple disseminated"
		"cutaneous lesions, predominating on the face, and composed of multiple nodules"
		and two ulcerations. The clinical examination also revealed voluminous
		superficial lymph nodes and ulcerations of the pharynx and larynx. Direct
		"examination, anatomopathology and culture of cutaneous biopsies revealed specific"
		images of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. HIV serology was negative. Treatment
		combining cotrimoxazole and itraconazole eliminated the lesions in one month.
		"DISCUSSION: Because the patient had just moved to Guiana, this observation"
		probably corresponded to an imported disease. The principle differential
		diagnosis was leishmaniosis.

TI	-	In silico prediction of peptides binding to multiple HLA-DR molecules accurately
		identifies immunodominant epitopes from gp43 of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis
		frequently recognized in primary peripheral blood mononuclear cell responses from
		sensitized individuals.
PG	-	209-19
AB	-	One of the major drawbacks limiting the use of synthetic peptide vaccines in
		genetically distinct populations is the fact that different epitopes are
		recognized by T cells from individuals displaying distinct major
		histocompatibility complex molecules. Immunization of mice with peptide (181-195)
		from the immunodominant 43 kDa glycoprotein of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis
		"(gp43), the causative agent of Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), conferred protection"
		against infectious challenge by the fungus. To identify immunodominant and
		"potentially protective human T-cell epitopes in gp43, we used the TEPITOPE"
		algorithm to select peptide sequences that would most likely bind multiple HLA-DR
		molecules and tested their recognition by T cells from sensitized individuals.
		The 5 most promiscuous peptides were selected from the gp43 sequence and the
		actual promiscuity of HLA binding was assessed by direct binding assays to 9
		prevalent HLA-DR molecules. Synthetic peptides were tested in proliferation
		assays with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from PCM patients after
		chemotherapy and healthy controls. PBMC from 14 of 19 patients recognized at
		"least one of the promiscuous peptides, whereas none of the healthy controls"
		recognized the gp43 promiscuous peptides. Peptide gp43(180-194) was recognized by
		"53% of patients, whereas the other promiscuous gp43 peptides were recognized by"
		32% to 47% of patients. The frequency of peptide binding and peptide recognition
		"correlated with the promiscuity of HLA-DR binding, as determined by TEPITOPE"
		analysis. In silico prediction of promiscuous epitopes led to the identification
		of naturally immunodominant epitopes recognized by PBMC from a significant
		proportion of a genetically heterogeneous patient population exposed to P.
		brasiliensis. The combination of several such epitopes may increase the frequency
		of positive responses and allow the immunization of genetically distinct
		populations.

TI	-	Report of the first human case of lobomycosis in the United States.
PG	-	1283-5
AB	-	We describe the first human case of lobomycosis caused by Lacazia loboi in a
		42-year-old white male resident of Georgia. The patient had traveled to Venezuela
		"7 years earlier, where he had planned to rappel down Angel Falls in Canaima."
		"Although he never actually rappelled the falls, he did walk under the falls at"
		"least three times, exposing himself to the high water pressures of the falls. He"
		noticed a small pustule with surrounding erythema developing on the skin of his
		right chest wall. The lesion gradually increased in size and had an appearance of
		"a keloid. For cosmetic reasons, the patient sought medical treatment to remove"
		"the lesion. After an uncomplicated excision of the lesion, the patient recovered"
		completely. The excised tissue was fixed in formalin for pathologic examination.
		"Tissue sections stained by hematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid-Schiff stain, and"
		"Gomori methenamine silver stain procedures showed numerous histiocytes,"
		"multinucleated giant cells, and numerous globose or subglobose, lemon-shaped"
		cells producing multiple blastoconidia connected by narrow tube-like connectors
		and catenate chains of various lengths characteristic of L. loboi.

AB	-	Colibacillosis is known as a fatal bacterial disease resulting in a high level of
		"commercial loss worldwide. This study amid to elucidate the sequence, genetic"
		"characteristics, and phylogeny of the bor gene in Escherichia coli (E. coli)"
		strain c1378 (O78:K80) isolated from avian colibacillosis in Iran and develop a
		rapid and optimal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) molecular-based technique with
		"specific primers to detect this gene in E. coli. A virulent avian E. coli (i.e.,"
		laboratory designation E. coli strain c1378) isolated from a chicken with
		"systemic colibacillosis from a broiler farm in Tehran, Iran, in 2004 was used as"
		"a source of the bor gene. After DNA extraction, PCR method was used to amplify"
		"the bor gene. A 658 bp fragment of the bor gene was amplified, sequenced,"
		"blasted, and phylogenetically studied. The most similar sequences to the bor gene"
		"in E. coli strain c1378 were E. coli APEC O78, Enterobacteria phage HK630, and"
		"Escherichia coli BW2952, respectively. There was a high similarity between the"
		"bor gene in E. coli bacteria with their phage and plasmid. Moreover, a high"
		similarity was observed between the bor and iss genes (approximately 92%) showing
		"that they were homologous genes. In addition, the similarity analysis of"
		"different bacterial species, as well as their plasmid and bacteriophage, to the"
		bor gene indicated that the highest similarity to O78:K80 was related to
		"Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, Bacillus thuringiensis CT43 plasmid pBMB0558, and"
		"Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Kentucky strain CVM29188 plasmid,"
		"respectively. Altogether, the results of the present study confirmed the presence"
		"of the bor gene in the studied isolates and clarified its sequence, phylogenetic"
		"relationship, and similarities of E. coli strain c1378 (O78:K80) isolated from"
		avian colibacillosis.

AB	-	Cokeromyces recurvatus is a zygomycetes yeast form that is very rarely detected
		"in Papanicolaou (Pap) tests, in which it typically represents an innocuous"
		colonizer. Its morphology closely resembles that of the better known
		"Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, which can disseminate widely and cause clinically"
		significant disease. We present a case of C. recurvatus detected in a cervical
		liquid-based preparation obtained from a 38-year old healthy woman. Careful
		"cytomorphologic evaluation, in combination with culture and molecular techniques,"
		was utilized to make a diagnosis and prevent the misdiagnosis of P. brasiliensis.

AB	-	"In the necropsy material of the Medical School of the University of São Paulo,"
		"collected between 1931 and 1981, consisting of 131,466 post-mortem examinations,"
		"there were 254 (0.2%) cases of adrenalitis, 185 male and 69 female. In 161 of"
		"these cases the affection was bilateral, in 46 it was unilateral and in 47 cases"
		"this information is lacking. In 111 cases (43.7%), the adrenalitis was caused by"
		"tuberculosis, in 86 cases (33.8%), by South American blastomycosis, in three"
		"cases (1.2%) by histoplasmosis, in two (0.8%) by Salmonellosis, in two (0.8%) by"
		cytomegalovirus infection and in one (0.4%) by leishmaniasis. The high number of
		cases with tuberculosis and paracoccidioidomycosis of adrenal glands is due to
		high incidence of these infections in Brazil.

PG	-	47-50
AB	-	Paracoccidioidomycosis is one of the most frequent systemic and endemic mycoses
		"of Latin America caused by a dimorphic fungus. In AIDS patients,"
		paracoccidioidomycosis appears as a severe and disseminated disease with a wide
		spectrum of clinical findings. The CD4 counts are usually less than 200 cell/mu
		L. We present a case of disseminated paracoccidioidomycosis with peripleuritis
		and subcutaneous abscesses on the chest wall as initial manifestation of AIDS. In
		"endemic countries, paracoccidioidomycosis should be included as an opportunistic"
		infection in AIDS.

AB	-	"With the exception of Candida species, fungal organisms are rarely encountered in"
		"the Papanicolaou test and, when encountered, usually represent contaminants"
		rather then infections. We present the case of a healthy 29-year-old pregnant
		"female, gravida 1, para 0, who presented for her first prenatal visit at 12-week"
		gestation and had many large fungal-like elements with a distinct budding pattern
		"of multiple narrow-based buds resembling a ""ship's-wheel"" identified in her"
		routine liquid-based Papanicolaou test. Based on its characteristic appearance in
		"the Papanicolaou test and the hematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid Schiff and"
		Gomori's methenamine silver stains performed on the cell block made from the
		"residual sample, the fungus was diagnosed as ""consistent with Paracoccidioides."""
		This is the second reported case of Paracoccidioides presenting in a Papanicolaou
		test and shows that this organism may rarely involve the uterine cervix in the
		absence of clinical systemic disease.

TI	-	Paracoccidioidomycosis in patients with human immunodeficiency virus: review of
		12 cases observed in an endemic region in Brazil.
PG	-	248-52
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical characteristics of 12 patients with
		paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.
		"METHODS: The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and outcome of PCM in"
		12 patients infected with HIV attended at a University Hospital of Mato Grosso do
		"Sul, Brazil, were evaluated. RESULTS: All patients were men, mean age 36.1 years"
		"old, and 11 had a diagnosis other than PCM as the aids-defining illness. Lymph"
		"nodes were the organs most often involved (10 patients, 83.3%), followed by lung"
		"involvement, usually with an interstitial pattern (seven patients, 58.3%),"
		papule-nodular skin lesions with central ulceration in six (50%) and ulcerated
		lesions of oral mucous membrane in five (41.6%) patients. Pleural involvement
		occurred in one patient who presented large pleural effusion beside a pathologic
		rib fracture caused by P. brasiliensis. Seven patients showed involvement in more
		than one extrapulmonary organ. In eight (66.6%) cases the diagnosis was
		established by direct microscopy of clinical specimens. All patients used
		trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and seven patients were also treated with
		amphotericin B. Eight patients died with progressive PCM manifestations.
		"CONCLUSION: Our review demonstrates that PCM, an endemic systemic mycosis in"
		"Brazil, when associated with AIDS, behaves clinically as an opportunistic"
		disease.

TI	-	A case of imported paracoccidioidomycosis in a German legionnaire.
PG	-	213-6
AB	-	We report on a case of the chronic form of paracoccidioidomycosis with swelling
		and ulcerations of the mouth in a German legionnaire who also suffered from a
		"chronic bronchitis. The patient had worked for many years in Brazil, an area"
		endemic for the disease. Infection due to Paracoccidioides brasiliensis was
		"diagnosed in Germany, more than 10 years after the patient's return. Diagnosis"
		was established by the presence of yeast cells with multipolar budding in the
		"tissue of the oral lesion. Furthermore, the fungus was grown in a liquid"
		Leishmania culture medium. Identification of the fungus was based on morphology
		"and genetic sequencing. Furthermore, IgG antibodies against a 43-kDa antigen of"
		P. brasiliensis were detected in a western blot. After itraconazole therapy (400
		"mg day(-1)) for 4 weeks, the lesions had disappeared almost completely, but the"
		therapy was continued for further 5 months to avoid relapse of the infection.

AB	-	The authors describe a case of paracoccidioidomycosis in a 7-year-old girl from
		the city of Rio de Janeiro who initially presented to her physician with a lesion
		in her calcaneous which was misdiagnosed and treated as bacterial osteomyelitis.
		"Later, cutaneous manifestations, lymph node enlargement, and hepatosplenomegaly"
		developed and biopsy of the skin and cervical lymph nodes showed the fungus which
		was also present in the sputum. It is emphasized that Paracoccidioides
		brasiliensis can be the cause of bone lesions in endemic areas of Latin America
		and that response to treatment with amphotercin B is good.

TI	-	Difficulty in diagnosing oral paracoccidioidomycosis after topical nystatin
		usage.
PG	-	e44-6
AB	-	Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is caused by a dimorphic fungus called
		"Paracoccidioides brasiliensis and is a disseminated, systemic disorder that"
		involves the lungs and other organs but presents characteristic oral lesions as
		the prominent feature. This article reports an unusual case of a 56-year-old man
		who had symptomatic granulomatous lesions in the oral cavity. The patient had
		received a nystatin-based treatment that masked the presence of fungi and made
		the diagnosis of PCM difficult. Although nystatin is normally used to treat oral
		"fungal infections such as candidiasis, its topical usage is not appropriate for"
		"management of PCM. Once the patient received the correct treatment, he"
		demonstrated a full recovery.

PG	-	119-20
AB	-	We describe long-term therapy for paracoccidioidomycosis occurring in a
		61-year-old house-painter from Venezuela. The diagnostic examinations made in
		South America had shown pulmonary granulomatous lesions and an osteolytic pattern
		of the left knee that had been considered suspect of malignant disease with an
		indication for limb amputation. With the aid of fine needle aspiration biopsy
		(FNAB) and culture examination we diagnosed an osteomyelitis by Paracoccidioides
		"brasiliensis and initiated therapy with itraconazole, 400 mg per day, reduced to"
		"200 mg per day after 2 months. At the end of 2 years of drug therapy, we observed"
		complete regression of the pulmonary lesions and of the osteolytic area of the
		"left knee. Moreover, we have periodically observed our patient to verify his"
		clinical development and he is still in good health. We suggest that this
		"pathology be considered in differential diagnosis of leprosy, tuberculosis,"
		"leishmaniasis, and systemic mycoses, even in non-endemic areas."

PG	-	25-8
AB	-	The lymphoabdominal involvement in the sub-acute form of paracoccidioidomycosis
		"shows a wide variety of clinical manifestations, ranging from fever and lymph"
		"node enlargement to infiltration of all abdominal organs, which can lead to a"
		situation of abdominal surgical emergency. This case report presents
		"paracoccidioidomycosis mimicking carcinoma of the biliary tract, The purpose of"
		this paper is to call the general physician's attention for this important
		differential diagnosis of abdominal masses. Although paracoccidioidomycosis is
		"rarely encountered in the United States and Europe, it should be considered in"
		patients who are suspected of having a fungal infection and have had previous
		exposure in an endemic area for this disease.

PG	-	85-90
AB	-	The authors described three acute paracoccidioidomycosis patients with bone
		marrow involvement. P. brasiliensis yeast forms were observed in bone marrow
		"smears of all them, and in one case, culture also revealed fungus growth. The"
		"mononuclear phagocytic system involvement, the blood eosinophilia and the"
		"negative skin hypersensibility responses were emphasized in all of them, as well"
		"as the severity of the disease in one case, with disseminated bone lesions and"
		20.260 eosinophils/mm3 in peripheral blood. The authors discuss the possible role
		"of eosinophil in the host-parasite interaction in paracoccidioidomycosis,"
		suggesting that TH 2 subpopulation activation and increased IL 5 and GM-CSF
		secretions may be responsible by eosinophilia in the most severe case.

AB	-	We describe the case of a 45-year-old male with pulmonary paracoccidioidomycosis
		and spontaneous pneumothorax. The patient presented to the hospital with sudden
		and intense chest pain accompanied by dyspnea and had a six-month history of dry
		"cough, weight loss, and progressive dyspnea on exertion. Chest X-ray showed a"
		"small right pneumothorax, bilateral nonhomogeneous opacities, and emphysematous"
		areas in the lung base. Chest computed tomography showed consolidation in both
		"lungs, with architectural distortion, nodules, interlobular septal thickening,"
		"and emphysema, in addition to the right pneumothorax. A lung biopsy revealed"
		"yeast consistent with Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. No drainage was needed, and"
		"the lung was re-expanded. The patient was treated with antifungal drugs, showed"
		"mild improvement, and was referred to outpatient care."

AB	-	From August to October 1992 a study of prevalence of cutaneous positivity to
		histoplasmin and paracoccidioidin was carried out in the cities of Cachoeira do
		"Sul (Valley of Jacuí River) and Santo Angelo (western hillside of the PlateAn),"
		"Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Skin tests were made in 193 soldiers from Cachoeira do"
		"Sul and 161 soldiers from Santo Angelo, both groups of 17 to 19 years of age. In"
		Cachoeira do Sul the prevalence of positive tests to histoplasmin was 89% and to
		paracoccidioidin 82%. In Santo Angelo 48% of the intradermical reactions were
		positive to histoplasmin and 39% to paracoccidioidin.

PG	-	407-11
LID	-	10.3109/13693786.2011.630685 [doi]
AB	-	"Once rare, septic shock (SS) due to disseminated fungal infections has been"
		"increasingly reported due to a growing number of immunocompromised patients, but"
		"remains rare in non-immune-compromised individuals. In paracoccidioidomycosis, it"
		"has been described in only three patients with the severe, acute form of the"
		"disease. We describe the development of a refractory, fatal septic shock due to a"
		severe disseminated chronic form of paracoccidioidomycosis in an older woman
		without any other microbial insults. A striking event in the evolution of her
		case was the severe depletion of lymphocytes from the peripheral blood and
		lymphoid organs. Lymphocyte depletion due to apoptosis is described in the late
		phase of sepsis and can contribute both to immunosuppression and the progression
		of SS. The possible mechanisms involved in the induction of SS in the chronic
		form of paracoccidioidomycosis are discussed.

PG	-	189-93
AB	-	A case is presented in which yeastlike cells resembling the yeast phase of
		Paracoccidioides brasiliensis were observed by microscopic examination of a urine
		sample. A mold identified as Mucor circinelloides was isolated from the specimen.
		It was converted to the yeast form by cultivation on Sabouraud agar incubated in
		a GasPak jar at 37 degrees C. The isolate was eventually shown not to be related
		"to the patient's illness; however, the superficial resemblance of the yeast phase"
		to P. brasiliensis caused some confusion in making a correct diagnosis.

TI	-	Oral exfoliative cytology for the diagnosis of paracoccidoidomycosis in a patient
		with human immunodeficiency virus: a case report.
PG	-	1127-9
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Paracoccidioidomycosis is not the most common fungal disease in
		"patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), except for endemic"
		regions in Latin America countries. CASE: A 33-year-old man with HIV presented
		with mulberry-like lesions on the palate. The diagnosis was made by exfoliative
		cytology and Papanicolaou staining. Microscopic analysis revealed fungal
		structures with birefringent walls and exosporulation conferring an airplane
		"radial motor appearance, or even bowel-like or goblet-like forms compatible with"
		Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. CONCLUSION: This process spares the
		immunosuppressed patient from undergoing invasive biopsy procedures.

AB	-	This rare mycosis is caused by Paracoccidiodis loboii and is found mainly among
		indians of the Amazon forest. It is a cutaneous disease. No visceral affection
		"was ever described, though generalized skin disease has been reported. One case"
		of cheloid paracoccidioidomycosis was studied with gallium-67. The
		"radiopharmaceutical has accumulated in the affected area and in a lymph node,"
		although adenomegaly be rare. Degree of accumulation was discrete/moderate but
		the patient had been under irregular treatment for 10 years. As no laboratorial
		"data are evaluable for this affection, gallium-67 may represent a means of"
		disease extent and therapy efficacy evaluation.

AB	-	Sulfadiazine is one of the drugs of choice in the treatment of
		paracoccidioidomycosis. Side effects are uncommon. Cutaneous and gastrointestinal
		reactions and rarely leucopenia and jaundice may occur. A patient on sulfadiazine
		"6 g daily exhibiting a good response is reported. On the 12th day, he presented"
		an intense abdominal pain and reduced urinary output. An ultrasonography revealed
		"diffuse calculosis in urinary tract. Peritoneal dialysis, urinary alkalinization"
		and rehydration were instituted with complete restoration of renal function. This
		case illustrates the importance of an adequate hydratation of patients receiving
		"sulfadiazine, a simple measure in the prevention of this uncommon complication"
		which carries a high morbidity.

		he had been treated with fluconazole for mucocutaneous-lymphangitic
		paracoccidioidomycosis with oral ulceration and neak hymphadenitis. Chest
		roentgenograms and computed tomograms showed diffuse small nodular and

		transbronchial lung biopsy showed no abnormality. He was treated with oral
		"fluconazole, and the abnormal radiographic shadows regressed. We believe that"
		this was the first case of chronic pulmonary paracoccidiodomycosis in Japan.

		months after the beginning of chemotherapy indicated overall improvement of his
		"physical condition and of the radiologic picture, negativeness of the test of"
		"precipitin in capillary tube, and positiveness of the skin test with"
		paracoccidioidin. The Authors also reviewed the cases of paracoccidioidomycosis

AB	-	"The authors report a clinical case of a 60-year-old Caucasian man, with two"
		episodes of arterial embolization in the lower limbs. A microscope investigation
		of the emboli revealed that they originated from fungal aortitis caused by
		Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. A review of aortic infections showed only one
		similar report of this rare clinical expression of blastomycosis. The authors
		suggest a routine postoperative search for emboli followed by culture and
		histopathology.

TI	-	The gamut of progressive pulmonary paracoccidioidomycosis.
PG	-	65-74
AB	-	Paracoccidioidomycosis is an important Latin American endemy. The lung is the
		portal of entrance of the infection and the lesions are confined to this organ
		"in, at least, 30 per cent of the progressive cases. Twelve case histories of"
		patients with the progressive pulmonary form are presented in order to illustrate
		the repetitious clinical manifestations but the large variety of radiological
		presentations. The mycologic diagnosis is also emphasized.

		or pseudotumoral lesions. Although occurring more frequently in the brain and
		"meninges, they can occasionally involve the spinal cord. A case of"
		paracoccidioidomycosis in the cervical spinal cord is reported in this paper.
		"Difficulties in establishing the etiologic diagnosis, the importance of"
		"radiologic examination of the thorax, and the treatment of the patient are"
		"commented. In an extensive review of the literature on the subject, only three"
		"other cases have been found, which are also discussed."

		computed tomography of the chest].
PG	-	621-6
AB	-	A 56-year-old female non-smoker complained of general fatigue and pyrexia.
		Laboratory examination revealed elevation of white blood cells (WBC) 10200/microl
		and C-reactive protein (CRP) 13.3mg/dl. Chest radiograph showed bilateral patchy
		and ring-shaped consolidations in both lungs. Chest computed tomography (CT)
		"revealed multiple round ground glass opacities fringed with consolidation, namely"
		"the ""reversed halo sign"". Transbronchial lung biopsy specimens showed polypoid"
		"granulation tissue in terminal air spaces, consistent with an organizing"
		pneumonia pattern. Clinical findings suggesting collagen vascular diseases and
		"drug induced lung diseases were not recognized, thus cryptogenic organizing"
		pneumonia (COP) was diagnosed. High dose methylprednisolone therapy improved her
		"condition, and the ring-shaped opacities on chest CT resolved. She relapsed twice"
		during approximately five years after the disease onset. Chest CT at the
		recurrences revealed subpleural patchy consolidations without formation of the
		"""reversed halo sign"". The sign was originally supposed to be specific for"
		"cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. However, other diseases like sarcoidosis and"
		paracoccidioidomycosis have been reported to show this sign. The meaning of the
		"""reversed halo sign"" should be examined based on the accumulation of more cases."

		PAS and Gomori-Grocott stains show very numerous roundish structures of variable
