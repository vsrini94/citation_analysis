AB	-	We sought to determine the prevalence of probable disseminated histoplasmosis
		among advanced HIV disease (AHD) patients in Nigeria. We conducted a
		cross-sectional study in 10 sites across 5 of 6 geopolitical zones in Nigeria. We
		identified patients with urinary samples containing CD4 cell counts <200
		cells/mm(3) or World Health Organization stage 3 or 4 disease who also had >2
		"clinical features of disseminated histoplasmosis, and we tested them for"
		Histoplasma antigen using a Histoplasma enzyme immune assay. Of 988 participants
		"we recruited, 76 (7.7%) were antigen-positive. The 76 Histoplasma"
		antigen-positive participants had significantly lower (p = 0.03) CD4 counts; 9
		(11.8%) were also co-infected with tuberculosis. Most antigen-positive
		participants (50/76; 65.8%; p = 0.015) had previously received antiretroviral
		treatment; 26/76 (34.2%) had not. Because histoplasmosis is often a hidden
		"disease among AHD patients in Nigeria, Histoplasma antigen testing should be"
		required in the AHD package of care.

		"States, 2019."
PG	-	14-Jan
LID	-	10.15585/mmwr.ss7107a1 [doi]
AB	-	"PROBLEM/CONDITION: Coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, and blastomycosis are"
		underdiagnosed fungal diseases that often mimic bacterial or viral pneumonia and
		can cause disseminated disease and death. These diseases are caused by inhalation
		"of fungal spores that have distinct geographic niches in the environment (e.g.,"
		"soil or dust), and distribution is highly susceptible to climate changes such as"
		"expanding arid regions for coccidioidomycosis, the northward expansion of"
		"histoplasmosis, and areas like New York reporting cases of blastomycosis"
		previously thought to be nonendemic. The national incidence of
		"coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, and blastomycosis is poorly characterized."
		REPORTING PERIOD: 2019. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: The National Notifiable Diseases
		"Surveillance System (NNDSS) tracks cases of coccidioidomycosis, a nationally"
		notifiable condition reported to CDC by 26 states and the District of Columbia.
		Neither histoplasmosis nor blastomycosis is a nationally notifiable condition;
		"however, histoplasmosis is voluntarily reported in 13 states and blastomycosis in"
		five states. Health departments classify cases based on the definitions
		established by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists. RESULTS: In
		"2019, a total of 20,061 confirmed coccidioidomycosis, 1,124 confirmed and"
		"probable histoplasmosis, and 240 confirmed and probable blastomycosis cases were"
		"reported to CDC. Arizona and California reported 97% of coccidioidomycosis cases,"
		and Minnesota and Wisconsin reported 75% of blastomycosis cases. Illinois
		reported the greatest percentage (26%) of histoplasmosis cases. All three
		"diseases were more common among males, and the proportion for blastomycosis (70%)"
		was substantially higher than for histoplasmosis (56%) or coccidioidomycosis
		(52%). Coccidioidomycosis incidence was approximately four times higher for
		"non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) persons (17.3 per 100,000"
		population) and almost three times higher for Hispanic or Latino persons (11.2)
		compared with non-Hispanic White (White) persons (4.1). Histoplasmosis incidence
		was similar across racial and ethnic categories (range: 0.9-1.3). Blastomycosis
		incidence was approximately six times as high among AI/AN persons (4.5) and
		approximately twice as high among non-Hispanic Asian and Native Hawaiian or other
		Pacific Islander persons (1.6) compared with White persons (0.7). More than one
		"half of histoplasmosis (54%) and blastomycosis (65%) patients were hospitalized,"
		and 5% of histoplasmosis and 9% of blastomycosis patients died. States in which
		"coccidioidomycosis is not known to be endemic had more cases in spring (March,"
		"April, and May) than during other seasons, whereas the number of cases peaked"
		"slightly in autumn (September, October, and November) for histoplasmosis and in"
		"winter (December, January, and February) for blastomycosis. INTERPRETATION:"
		"Coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, and blastomycosis are diseases occurring in"
		geographical niches within the United States. These diseases cause substantial
		"illness, with approximately 20,000 coccidioidomycosis cases reported in 2019."
		Although substantially fewer histoplasmosis and blastomycosis cases were
		"reported, surveillance was much more limited and underdiagnosis was likely, as"
		evidenced by high hospitalization and death rates. This suggests that persons
		with milder symptoms might not seek medical evaluation and the symptoms
		"self-resolve or the illnesses are misdiagnosed as other, more common respiratory"
		diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: Improved surveillance is necessary to better
		characterize coccidioidomycosis severity and to improve detection of
		histoplasmosis and blastomycosis. These findings might guide improvements in
		testing practices that enable timely diagnosis and treatment of fungal diseases.
		"Clinicians and health care professionals should consider coccidioidomycosis,"
		"histoplasmosis, and blastomycosis in patients with community-acquired pneumonia"
		or other acute infections of the lower respiratory tract who live in or have
		traveled to areas where the causative fungi are known to be present in the
		environment. Culturally appropriate tailored educational messages might help
		improve diagnosis and treatment. Public health response to these three diseases
		is hindered because information gathered from states' routine surveillance does
		not include data on populations at risk and sources of exposure. Broader
		"surveillance that includes expansion to other states, and more detail about"
		"potential exposures and relevant host factors can describe epidemiologic trends,"
		"populations at risk, and disease prevention strategies."

PG	-	654-659
LID	-	10.1097/EDE.0000000000001499 [doi]
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: In the United States, the true geographic distribution of the"
		environmental fungus Histoplasma capsulatum remains poorly understood but appears
		to have changed since it was first characterized. Histoplasmosis is caused by
		inhalation of the fungus and can range in severity from asymptomatic to life
		threatening. Due to limited public health surveillance and under detection of
		"infections, it is challenging to directly use reported case data to characterize"
		spatial risk. METHODS: Using monthly and yearly county-level public health
		"surveillance data and various environmental and socioeconomic characteristics, we"
		"use a spatio-temporal occupancy model to estimate latent, or unobserved, presence"
		"of H. capsulatum , accounting for imperfect detection of histoplasmosis cases."
		RESULTS: We estimate areas with higher probabilities of the presence of H.
		"capsulatum in the East North Central states around the Great Lakes, reflecting a"
		shift of the endemic region to the north from previous estimates. The presence of
		H. capsulatum was strongly associated with higher soil nitrogen levels.
		"CONCLUSIONS: In this investigation, we were able to mitigate challenges related"
		to reporting and illustrate a shift in the endemic region from historical
		"estimates. This work aims to help inform future surveillance needs, clinical"
		"awareness, and testing decisions for histoplasmosis."

AB	-	"Histoplasmosis, a mycotic infection caused by Histoplasma spp, can infect the"
		gastrointestinal tract of dogs. Clinical signs of gastrointestinal histoplasmosis
		"can include diarrhea, profound weight loss, anorexia, and vomiting. Rectal scrape"
		"for cytology can provide a quick diagnosis, but if negative abdominal ultrasound"
		is often pursued. Ultrasonographic abnormalities in dogs with gastrointestinal
		"histoplasmosis have rarely been reported. This retrospective, single-center case"
		series aimed to describe the ultrasonographic features of gastrointestinal
		histoplasmosis in dogs. Nineteen cases with a diagnosis of gastrointestinal
		histoplasmosis confirmed with gastrointestinal cytology or histopathology
		(N = 15) or gastrointestinal lymph node cytology (N = 4) that had undergone an
		abdominal ultrasound examination from 2005 to 2020 were included. Ultrasound
		images were reviewed by an American College of Veterinary Radiology
		(ACVR)-certified veterinary radiologist and diagnostic imaging resident. Eighteen
		cases had sonographic abnormalities within the gastrointestinal tract. The colon
		was the most affected organ. Colonic thickening and abnormal wall layering were
		the most frequent findings (N = 16 dogs); thickening ranged from 0.36 to 1.2 cm.
		"Diffuse, multifocal, and focal thickening patterns were seen. Sixteen patients"
		had abnormal wall layering of the colon (complete loss of layering or altered
		"with partial loss of layering). Other frequent findings included lymphadenopathy,"
		small intestinal thickening with abnormal wall layering and peritoneal effusion.
		"Based on the authors' review of the literature, this is the first description of"
		ultrasonographic findings of gastrointestinal histoplasmosis in a group of dogs.
		Although abnormal gastrointestinal wall layering seen sonographically is most
		"frequently associated with neoplasia, this is not pathognomonic. Gastrointestinal"
		histoplasmosis should be considered as a differential diagnosis due to the
		similarities and overlap of ultrasonographic features.

LID	-	e248738
AB	-	Laryngeal histoplasmosis is a very rare cause of laryngitis which is encountered
		usually in the immunosuppressed states but can also occur in immunologically
		intact status. We report a rare case of laryngeal histoplasmosis in a man in his
		"60s, a chronic smoker who presented with a history of progressive hoarseness for"
		3 months. The glottic growth was biopsied. The rarity of diagnosis was aided by
		"histopathological examination of the tissue, which revealed histoplasmosis."
		Management was done with intravenous liposomal amphotericin B and oral
		itraconazole with complete resolution of symptoms.

		"describe the epidemiology of 1,392 microbiology laboratory-confirmed cases of"
		"blastomycosis, histoplasmosis, and coccidioidomycosis in Ontario during"
		"1990-2015. Blastomycosis was the most common infection (1,092 cases; incidence of"
		"0.41 cases/100,000 population), followed by histoplasmosis (211 cases) and"
		coccidioidomycosis (89 cases). Incidence of blastomycosis increased from 1995 to
		"2001 and has remained elevated, especially in the northwest region, incorporating"
		"several localized hotspots where disease incidence (10.9 cases/100,000"
		population) is 12.6 times greater than in any other region of the province. This
		retrospective study substantially increases the number of known endemic fungal
		"infections reported in Canada, confirms Ontario as an important region of"
		"endemicity for blastomycosis and histoplasmosis, and provides an epidemiologic"
		baseline for future disease surveillance. Clinicians should include blastomycosis
		and histoplasmosis in the differential diagnosis of antibiotic-refractory
		pneumonia in patients traveling to or residing in Ontario.

		to priority.
PG	-	e3100

LID	-	e3100
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Histoplasmosis is an endemic fungal infection in French Guiana. It is
		the most common AIDS-defining illness and the leading cause of AIDS-related
		"deaths. Diagnosis is difficult, but in the past 2 decades, it has improved in"
		this French overseas territory which offers an interesting model of Amazonian
		pathogen ecology. The objectives of the present study were to describe the
		temporal trends of incidence and mortality indicators for HIV-associated
		histoplasmosis in French Guiana. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted to
		describe early mortality rates observed in persons diagnosed with incident cases
		of HIV-associated Histoplasma capsulatum var. capsulatum histoplasmosis admitted
		in one of the three main hospitals in French Guiana between 1992 and 2011. Early
		mortality was defined by death occurring within 30 days after antifungal
		treatment initiation. Data were collected on standardized case report forms and
		analysed using standard statistical methods. RESULTS: There were 124 deaths
		(45.3%) and 46 early deaths (16.8%) among 274 patients. Three time periods of
		"particular interest were identified: 1992-1997, 1998-2004 and 2005-2011. The two"
		main temporal trends were: the proportion of early deaths among annual incident
		"histoplasmosis cases significantly declined four fold (χ2, p<0.0001) and the"
		number of annual incident histoplasmosis cases increased three fold between
		"1992-1997 and 1998-2004, and subsequently stabilized. CONCLUSION: From an"
		"occasional exotic diagnosis, AIDS-related histoplasmosis became the top"
		AIDS-defining event in French Guiana. This was accompanied by a spectacular
		"decrease of early mortality related to histoplasmosis, consistent with North"
		American reference center mortality rates. The present example testifies that
		rapid progress could be at reach if awareness increases and leads to clinical and
		laboratory capacity building in order to diagnose and treat this curable disease.

AB	-	The standard serologic tests for diagnosis of histoplasmosis include the
		"complement fixation test (CF), which is quite sensitive, and the immunodiffusion"
		"test (ID), which is fairly specific. Radioimmunoassay (RIA) is an experimental"
		"serological test even more sensitive than CF, but also less specific. Problems"
		with the specificity of serodiagnosis are addressed followed by a discussion of
		the sensitivity of the three tests in the different forms of
		"histoplasmosis-chronic cavitary histoplasmosis, progressive disseminated"
		"histoplasmosis, and acute pulmonary histoplasmosis. Next, serologic results from"
		"a large point-source outbreak of acute pulmonary histoplasmosis in Orono, Minn,"
		are presented. These results are used to define the sensitivity of the three
		tests in acute symptomatic pulmonary histoplasmosis and also to detail the time
		"course of the appearance of antibodies measurable by each test. Finally, a case"
		of sporadic severe acute pulmonary histoplasmosis is presented in which the
		approach to serodiagnosis was based on lessons learned from the Orono outbreak.

		"since then, the environment, climate, and anthropogenic land use have changed"
		"drastically. Recent outbreaks of acute disease in Montana and Nebraska, USA,"
		"suggest shifts in geographic distribution, necessitating updated prevalence maps."
		"To create a weighted overlay geographic suitability model for Histoplasma, we"
		used a geographic information system to combine satellite imagery integrating
		"land cover use (70%), distance to water (20%), and soil pH (10%). We used"
		logistic regression modeling to compare our map with state-level histoplasmosis
		incidence data from a 5% sample from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
		"Services. When compared with the state-based Centers data, the predictive"
		accuracy of the suitability score-predicted states with high and mid-to-high
		histoplasmosis incidence was moderate. Preferred soil environments for
		Histoplasma have migrated into the upper Missouri River basin. Suitability score
		mapping may be applicable to other geographically specific infectious vectors.

TI	-	"Prevalence, healthcare resource utilization and overall burden of fungal"
		meningitis in the United States.
PG	-	215-227
LID	-	10.1099/jmm.0.000656 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: Previous epidemiological and cost studies of fungal meningitis have
		"largely focused on single pathogens, leading to a poor understanding of the"
		disease in general. We studied the largest and most diverse group of fungal
		"meningitis patients to date, over the longest follow-up period, to examine the"
		broad impact on resource utilization within the United States. METHODOLOGY: The
		Truven Health Analytics MarketScan database was used to identify patients with a
		fungal meningitis diagnosis in the United States between 2000 and 2012. Patients
		"with a primary diagnosis of cryptococcal, Coccidioides, Histoplasma, or Candida"
		meningitis were included in the analysis. Data concerning healthcare resource
		"utilization, prevalence and length of stay were collected for up to 5 years"
		following the original diagnosis. RESULTS: Cryptococcal meningitis was the most
		prevalent type of fungal meningitis (70.1 % of cases over the duration of the
		"study), followed by coccidioidomycosis (16.4 %), histoplasmosis (6.0 %) and"
		candidiasis (7.6 %). Cryptococcal meningitis and candidiasis patients accrued the
		"largest average charges ($103 236 and $103 803, respectively) and spent the most"
		time in the hospital on average (70.6 and 79 days). Coccidioidomycosis and
		histoplasmosis patients also accrued substantial charges and time in the hospital
		"($82 439, 48.1 days; $78 609, 49.8 days, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our study"
		characterizes the largest longitudinal cohort of fungal meningitis in the United
		"States. Importantly, the health economic impact and long-term morbidity from"
		these infections are quantified and reviewed. The healthcare resource utilization
		of fungal meningitis patients in the United States is substantial.

PG	-	59-65
LID	-	10.1111/myc.12551 [doi]
AB	-	Histoplasmosis is a systemic mycosis that is considered an important public
		"health problem. In this work, we performed a descriptive, observational,"
		cross-sectional and retrospective study with a secondary data analysis of medical
		records from 2000 to 2012 at a tertiary hospital. The study sample consisted of
		275 patients with laboratory-confirmed Disseminated Histoplasmosis (DH)/AIDS. The
		results showed that the prevalence of DH associated with AIDS was 4.4%. The
		"majority of patients were young adult men with fever in 84.2%, cough in 63.4%,"
		"weight loss in 63.1%, diarrhoea in 44.8% and skin manifestations in 27.6% of"
		"patients. In the overall cohort, the CD4 counts were low, but not significantly"
		different in survivors and non-survivors. Higher levels of urea and lower levels
		of haemoglobin and platelets were observed in non-survivor patients (<.05). The
		global lethality was 71.3% (196/275). The results with high prevalence and
		"lethality highlight the need to adopt measures to facilitate early diagnosis,"
		proper treatment and improved prognosis.

PG	-	e13102
LID	-	10.1111/tid.13102 [doi]
AB	-	Histoplasma capsulatum is an endemic fungus that most oftenly causes a
		self-limiting illness but can result in severe infections in immunocompromised
		patients including pulmonary or extra-pulmonary disease. Rarely it can also cause
		"a chronic progressive infection of the larynx. Herein, we report a case of"
		laryngeal histoplasmosis in a kidney transplant patient who presented with
		"progressive symptoms of several weeks of hoarseness, dysphagia and odynophagia."
		Laryngoscopic examination revealed thick plaques in the oropharynx with
		surrounding hyper-erythema and histopathology showed numerous intracellular
		yeasts forms consistent with H capsulatum. Patient was initiated on treatment
		with itraconazole. Infection of the larynx due to H capsulatum is highly uncommon
		and therefore can result in an inappropriate or delayed diagnosis. A review of
		literature showed four previously reported cases of laryngeal histoplasmosis in
		patients with solid organ transplant. This is the first case series of laryngeal
		histoplasmosis in transplant recipients.

AB	-	The present report describes a fatal case of imported AIDS-related disseminated
		histoplasmosis capsulati infection associated with multiple coexisting
		"infections, diagnosed with cultural recovery of Histoplasma capsulatum var."
		capsulatum with a commercial radiometric Mycobacterium medium. The
		epidemiological and clinical features of histoplasmosis capsulati and duboisii in
		Europe are reviewed by examining also 69 documented cases of Histoplasma
		capsulatum var. capsulatum infection (25 in AIDS patients) and 17 cases of
		"Histoplasma capsulatum var. duboisii infection (3 in HIV-infected patients),"
		described since 1980. This draws special attention to the role played during
		recent years by the emergence of the HIV pandemic and the progressive
		intensification of travel and immigration as risk factors for this disease in our
		"continent. AIDS patients, who are prone to multiple concurrent opportunistic"
		infections which may share clinical and laboratory features with each other and
		"with other HIV-associated diseases, represent the most relevant current group at"
		"risk for severe disseminated histoplasmosis, which may come to medical attention"
		far from their place of origin.

		inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) in people living with human immunodeficiency virus
		(PLHIV) is rarely reported.This study aimed to describe the incidence and
		features of histoplasmosis-associated IRIS in a cohort of PLHIV. METHODS: A
		retrospective multicenter study was conducted in French Guiana from 1 January
		1997 to 30 September 2017. The target population was represented by PLHIV who
		presented an episode of histoplasmosis within 6 months after antiretroviral
		"therapy initiation. We used a consensual IRIS case definition, submitted to the"
		agreement of 2 experts. Each case was described using a standardized
		"questionnaire, and all patients gave informed consent. RESULTS: Twenty-two cases"
		of histoplasmosis-associated IRIS were included (14 infectious/unmasking and 8
		"paradoxical), with an overall incidence rate of 0.74 cases per 1000 HIV-infected"
		"person-years (95% confidence interval, 0.43-1.05). Mean age was 40.5 years. The"
		ratio of males to females was 1:4. Median time to IRIS was 11 days (interquartile
		range 7-40 days) after antiretroviral therapy initiation. The main clinical
		"presentation was fever, without any specific pattern, and disseminated disease."
		We reported 2 severe cases and partial or complete recovery at 1 month was the
		rule. Twenty-two cases were identified in the literature with similar
		characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Histoplasmosis-associated IRIS incidence was low
		"but generated significant morbidity in PLHIV. In endemic areas, screening for"
		latent or subclinical histoplasmosis should be implemented before antiretroviral
		therapy initiation.

AB	-	Histoplasmosis is an invasive mycosis caused by inhalation of the spores of
		dimorphic fungi Histoplasma capsulatum. The disease manifests in the lung as
		acute or chronic pulmonary histoplasmosis and in severe cases gets disseminated
		"in multiple organs like skin, adrenal gland, central nervous system, lymph node,"
		"liver, spleen, bone marrow, and gastrointestinal tract. It occurs most commonly"
		"in immunodeficient patients like HIV-positive patients and transplant recipients,"
		while immunocompetent hosts are affected rarely. In cases of gastrointestinal
		"histoplasmosis, the samples are collected for culture and biopsy should be sent"
		for histopathological examination for definitive diagnosis. We conducted a
		retrospective study of colonic biopsies performed in the department of
		gastroenterology in a tertiary care hospital of north India from January 2014 to
		December 2015. Five cases of colonic histoplasmosis were diagnosed on
		histopathology out of which 4 patients were from north India while 1 patient was
		"from Myanmar. The patients presented with various complaints, including loose"
		"stools, diarrhea, altered bowel habits, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The"
		prognosis is very good after early and aggressive treatment while the disease is
		"fatal if it remains untreated. In our study, 2 patients died within few days of"
		"diagnosis due to delay in the diagnosis, dissemination, and associated"
		complications. Other patients were started on amphotericin B deoxycholate and are
		under follow-up. An early diagnosis of gastrointestinal histoplasmosis is
		important as appropriate treatment leads to long-term survival while untreated
		cases are almost fatal.

TI	-	The Simultaneous Occurrence of Histoplasmosis and Cryptococcal Fungemia: A Case
		Report and Review of the Literature.
PG	-	891-897
AB	-	Simultaneous infections with Cryptococcus neoformans and Histoplasma capsulatum
		"are rare and typically occur in immunocompromised individuals, particularly AIDS"
		patients. Because both of those fungi can spur the development of latent
		"infections, it is generally unknown which organism was first present. The"
		"diagnosis of one fungus can hide the diagnosis of the other, leading to"
		underdiagnoses and poor prognosis. We report a case of C. neoformans and H.
		capsulatum co-infection. We also performed a systematic review of the literature.
		"Our patient, a 69-year-old HIV-negative man, presented with a 9-month history of"
		"a productive cough, dyspnea and wheezing. His history showed chronic obstructive"
		pulmonary disease and type II diabetes mellitus (DM). Pulmonary lesions of
		unidentified etiology were noted. Cryptococcal involvement of the central nervous
		"system was confirmed, and C. neoformans and H. capsulatum were also isolated from"
		"blood cultures. In the literature, we found ten cases of simultaneous"
		"histoplasmosis and cryptococcosis. Including our patient, all of the cases were"
		"located in North America and Latin America, except for two, one Indian and one"
		"African diagnosed in France. AIDS was the main predisposing factor, followed by"
		DM and age >60 years. Several diagnostic methods were employed. A blood culture
		and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) culture resulted in the growth of C. neoformans
		in most of the cases. H. capsulatum was more often detected in BAL and bone
		"marrow cultures. Although co-infection by these pathogens is severe, it can be"
		cured if it is diagnosed and treated early. We emphasized the importance of
		clinical suspicion and differential diagnosis of systemic mycoses.

		histoplasmosis: a case-based review.
PG	-	1673-1680
LID	-	10.1007/s00296-020-04739-6 [doi]
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Concomitant infections during the debut or relapse of systemic
		"lupus erythematosus are a common scenario, due to multiple mechanisms including"
		the use of immunosuppressive drugs and autoimmunity per se. Invasive fungal
		infections are rare in systemic lupus erythematosus and are associated with
		profound immunosuppressed states. Disseminated histoplasmosis in patients with
		lupus has rarely been reported and the concomitant presentation of both entities
		is exceptional. METHODS: We describe a case and performed a literature review in
		order to identify all case reports. A literature search was carried out using in
		"PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE and Google Scholar (the first 200 relevant references)"
		bibliographic databases. All available inclusion studies from January 1968
		"through July 2020. All data were tabulated, and outcomes were cumulatively"
		analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-one additional cases were identified. Disseminated
		histoplasmosis was the most common clinical presentation and most cases have been
		reported in patients with a prior diagnosis of lupus in the setting of moderate
		"to high steroid dose use, usually in combination with some other"
		immunosuppressant. Description at systemic lupus disease onset was only reported
		"in 3 cases with a high associated mortality. In our patient, severe disease"
		"activity, significant immunosuppression, malnutrition and multi-organ compromise"
		conditioned the patient's fatal outcome. CONCLUSION: Histoplasmosis can closely
		"mimic activity of lupus. Thus, early clinical recognition is important since a"
		delay in diagnosis and treatment can lead to fatal outcomes.

PG	-	e0009050
LID	-	10.1371/journal.pntd.0009050 [doi]
LID	-	e0009050
AB	-	Disseminated histoplasmosis is one the main AIDS-defining opportunistic
		"infections in HIV-infected patients, notably in Latin America. The non-specific"
		and proteiform clinical presentation leads to diagnostic delays that may lead to
		fatal outcomes. This retrospective multicentric study aimed to describe the
		"frequency and manifestations of gastrointestinal histoplasmosis in French Guiana,"
		and to compare patients with disseminated histoplasmosis with or without
		"gastrointestinal involvement. Between January 1, 1981 and October 1, 2014"
		co-infections with HIV and histoplasmosis were enrolled. Inclusion criteria were:
		"age >18 years, confirmed HIV infection; first proven episode of histoplasmosis."
		"Among 349 cases of disseminated histoplasmosis, 245 (70%) had a gastrointestinal"
		presentation. Half of patients with gastrointestinal signs had abdominal pain or
		"diarrhea, mostly watery. Half of patients with abdominal pain had diarrhea"
		(63/124) and half of those with diarrhea (63/123) had abdominal pain. A
		"significant proportion of patients also had hepatomegaly and, to a lesser degree,"
		"splenomegaly. After adjusting for potential confounding, the presence of"
		"lymphadenopathies >2cm (AOR = 0.2, IC95 = 0.04-0.7, P = 0.01), Haitian origin"
		"(AOR = 0.04, IC95 = 0.004-0.4, P = 0.006) were associated with a lower prevalence"
		of gastrointestinal signs and positive gastrointestinal presence of H.
		capsulatum. Persons with a gastrointestinal H. capsulatum were more likely to
		"have a decreased prothrombin time, lower ferritin, lower liver enzymes, and lower"
		concentrations of LDH than those without gastrointestinal signs and symptoms.
		They also had a shorter interval between symptoms onset and diagnosis. Patients
		with a positive gastrointestinal identification of H. capsulatum were less likely
		to die at 1 month than those without a gastrointestinal presentation
		"(respectively, 4.6% vs 18.5%, P = 0.01). Subacute or chronic gastrointestinal"
		"presentations are very frequent during disseminated histoplasmosis, they seem"
		"less severe, and should lead to suspect the diagnosis in endemic areas. There"
		were populational or geographic differences in the frequency of gastrointestinal
		manifestations that could not be explained.

		is no consensus in its management. The aim of this study was to present a case
		report and literature review of histoplasmosis in the upper extremities to
		provide the best treatment recommendation and to increase awareness of this
		"disease. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was performed in PubMed,"
		"MEDLINE, and EMBASE databases with the search terms ""(Tenosynovitis AND"
		"histoplasmosis)"" OR ""(Upper limbs AND histoplasmosis)"" OR ""(Upper extremities AND"
		"histoplasmosis)"" OR ""((finger OR arm OR hand OR forearm OR wrist) AND"
		"histoplasmosis)."" Manuscripts were included in the study if they described"
		"diagnosis of histoplasmosis in the bone, joint, synovia, or tendons of the upper"
		"extremities. Results: In all, 14 manuscripts and 15 cases of histoplasmosis of"
		the upper extremities from 1992 to 2015 met the inclusion criteria. Eight (53.3%)
		"patients were diagnosed with tenosynovitis, 5 (33.3%) with osteomyelitis, 1"
		"(6.7%) with carpal tunnel syndrome, and 1 (6.7%) with joint wrist abscess."
		"Immunosuppression, travel history, previous diagnosis with histoplasmosis, and"
		persistent symptoms may suggest infectious causes. Surgery and medical treatment
		together are recommended to optimize outcomes compared with single treatment
		alone. Conclusions: Histoplasmosis of the upper extremities may have various
		"clinical presentations, including tenosynovitis, osteomyelitis, carpal tunnel"
		"syndrome, and joint wrist abscess. The type of surgical approach may depend on"
		"the etiology of disease. Increased awareness and knowledge of the clinical signs,"
		"symptoms, and effective treatment modalities will help decrease possible"
		"complications, such as tendon rupture and functional impairment of the upper"
		extremities.

LID	-	D6335 [pii]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Histoplasmosis is an infection caused by inhalation of spores of the
		fungus Histoplasma capsulatum. H. capsulatum is not present in the Netherlands
		"but can cause severe disseminated disease in the immunocompromised traveller,"
		"with high mortality rate, especially when diagnosis is delayed. Therefore, early"
		"recognition is crucial. However, similarities with other infectious diseases,"
		haematological malignancies and auto-immune diseases make timely diagnosis
		difficult. CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case of a 39-year-old immunocompromised
		male traveller who presented with disseminated histoplasmosis after a trip to
		Central America. The diagnosis was made a few months after the first symptoms
		occurred. He died despite adequate treatment with liposomal amphotericin B.
		CONCLUSION: Disseminated histoplasmosis should be considered as a cause of
		unexplained fever in immunocompromised patients who travelled to endemic regions.
		"Mortality is high, even when properly treated. Early recognition and treatment"
		improve outcome.

		in French Guiana.
PG	-	125-129

LID	-	10.4269/ajtmh.20-1486 [doi]
AB	-	Disseminated histoplasmosis is the most frequent acquired immunodeficiency
		"syndrome-defining illness in French Guiana. Paradoxically, central nervous system"
		(CNS) involvement has been scarcely described. We aimed to identify CNS
		"histoplasmosis in our territory. We conducted an observational, multicentric,"
		"descriptive, and retrospective study including patients with proven or probable"
		CNS histoplasmosis according to the European Organization for Research and
		Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group and the National
		Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MGS). The
		study population consisted of patients admitted in one of the hospitals of French
		"Guiana between January 1, 1990 and December 31, 2019. During the study period,"
		"390 cases of HIV-associated histoplasmosis were recorded, in which six of them"
		had CNS infections with Histoplasma capsulatum. The male to female sex ratio was
		"0.25, and the median age at diagnosis was 37.5 years. The median CD4 count was 42"
		cells/mm3 ([IQR: 29-60]). All patients had disseminated histoplasmosis. Usual
		signs of meningitis were observed in three patients and focal signs in four
		patients. One patient had no neurological signs. The median time between the
		first cerebral symptoms and diagnosis was 22.4 days (IQR 9.5-36.2). Two patients
		"died within a month after diagnosis. In conclusion, few proven CNS localizations"
		of histoplasmosis were observed on 30-year study in French Guiana. This low
		proportion suggests that the documentation of CNS involvement is often not
		"ascertained for lack of awareness of this particular presentation, and for lack"
		of rapid and sensitive diagnostic tools.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: The HIV pandemic continues to cause a high burden of morbidity and
		mortality due to delayed diagnosis. Histoplasmosis is prevalent in Latin America
		"and Colombia, is difficult to diagnose and has a high mortality. Here we"
		determined the clinical characteristics and risk factors of histoplasmosis in
		"people living with HIV (PLWH) in Pereira, Colombia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This"
		was a retrospective cross-sectional study (2014-2019) involving two tertiary
		"medical centers in Pereira, Colombia. People hospitalized with HIV were included."
		Histoplasma antigen detection was performed in urine samples. Probable
		histoplasmosis was defined according to European Organization for Research and
		Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group/National
		Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group criteria.
		RESULTS: 172 HIV-infected patients were analyzed. Histoplasmosis was confirmed in
		29% (n = 50/172) of patients. The logistic regression analysis showed that the
		"risk factors for histoplasmosis were pancytopenia (OR 4.1, 95% CI 1.6-10.3,"
		"P = 0.002), < 50 CD4 + cells/μL (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.3-7.3, P = 0.006) and Aspartate"
		"transaminase (AST) levels > 46 IU/L (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.3-8, P = 0.010)."
		CONCLUSIONS: Histoplasmosis is highly prevalent in hospitalized patients with HIV
		"in Pereira, Colombia. The clinical findings are nonspecific, but there are some"
		"clinical abnormalities that can lead to suspicion of the disease, early diagnosis"
		"and prompt treatment. Urine antigen detection is useful for diagnosis, but is not"
		widely available. An algorithmic approach is proposed for low-resource clinical
		settings.

AB	-	Histoplasmosis is a fungal infection due to Histoplasma capsulatum. The African
		"form of this mycosis, caused by Histoplasma capsulatum var. duboisii, remains"
		"rare. We report a case of disseminated African histoplasmosis with skin, lymph"
		"nodes, bones and viscera localizations. The 22-year-old patient was"
		HIV-seronegative and was considered immunocompetent. The presence of Histoplasma
		capsulatum var duboisii in ulcerations and a nodule pus aspiration was confirmed
		by direct microscopic examination and by culture. The medical treatment was based
		"on fluconazole. Even though a regression of the symptoms was observed, the"
		"patient died. In disseminated African histoplasmosis, an early laboratory"
		diagnosis must be carried out for accurate treatment.

TI	-	Pediatric Histoplasmosis in an Area of Endemicity: A Contemporary Analysis.
PG	-	400-407
LID	-	10.1093/jpids/piy073 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Data on pediatric histoplasmosis have been limited to those from
		outbreak and case reports. We sought to evaluate the contemporary clinical
		"manifestations, laboratory findings, and outcomes in children with histoplasmosis"
		living in an area of endemicity. METHODS: This study was a single-center
		retrospective review of proven and probable cases of histoplasmosis in children
		aged 0 to 18 years between April 2008 and April 2014. Case ascertainment was
		"ensured by us using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision"
		"codes cross-referenced with laboratory, microbiology, and histopathology tests"
		"that detected Histoplasma capsulatum. Demographics, diagnostics, clinical"
		"management, and outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS: Seventy-three children with"
		"histoplasmosis (41 males; median age, 13 years [range, 3-18 years]) were"
		"diagnosed with proven (n = 17 [23%]) or probable (n = 56 [77%]) histoplasmosis,"
		which manifested as pulmonary (n = 52 [71%]) or disseminated (n = 21 [29%])
		disease. Symptoms at presentation were nonspecific; the examination of 21 (29%)
		patients revealed abnormal physical findings. Detection of H capsulatum by
		serologic methods occurred in 93% (63 of 68) of the patients tested. Histoplasma
		antigen in blood or urine was detected in 42% (20 of 48) and 28% (15 of 53) of
		"the patients tested, respectively. The 16 (22%) patients who were"
		immunocompromised had significantly higher rates of disseminated disease (56% vs
		"21%, respectively; P = .01), antigenuria (62% vs 18%, respectively; P = .004),"
		"and antigenemia (69% vs 31%, respectively; P = .02) and longer durations of"
		"antigenuria (403 vs 120 days, respectively; P = .003) and antigenemia (451 vs 149"
		"days, respectively; P < .0001) than did the immunocompetent children."
		CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric histoplasmosis manifests most frequently as pulmonary
		disease. The highest diagnostic yield was achieved when multiple diagnostic
		modalities were used. Presentation with disseminated disease and evidence of
		"antigenemia, antigenuria, and delayed antigen clearance were more likely to be"
		seen in immunocompromised children.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Fungal peritonitis (FP) is a rare complication of peritoneal
		dialysis. We herein describe the second case in Asia of Histoplasma capsulatum
		peritonitis associated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD).
		CASE PRESENTATION: An 85-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who
		had been on CAPD for 3 years and who had a history of 3 prior episodes of
		peritonitis presented with intermittent abdominal pain for 2 weeks and high-grade
		fever for 3 days. Elevated white blood cell (WBC) count and rare small oval
		"budding yeasts were found in her peritoneal dialysis (PD) fluid. From this fluid,"
		"a white mold colony was observed macroscopically after 7 days of incubation, and"
		"numerous large, round with rough-walled tuberculate macroconidia along with small"
		smooth-walled microconidia were observed microscopically upon tease slide
		"preparation, which is consistent with H. capsulatum. The peritoneal dialysis (PD)"
		"catheter was then removed, and it also grew H. capsulatum after 20 days of"
		incubation. The patient was switched from CAPD to hemodialysis. The patient was
		successfully treated with intravenous amphotericin B deoxycholate (AmBD) for
		"2 weeks, followed by oral itraconazole for 6 months with satisfactory result. The"
		patient remains on hemodialysis and continues to be clinically stable.
		CONCLUSION: H. capsulatum peritonitis is an extremely rare condition that is
		associated with high morbidity and mortality. Demonstration of small yeasts upon
		"staining of PD fluid, and isolation of slow growing mold in the culture of"
		clinical specimen should provide important clues for diagnosis of H. capsulatum
		peritonitis. Prompt removal of the PD catheter and empirical treatment with
		amphotericin B or itraconazole is recommended until the culture results are
		known.

AB	-	African histoplasmosis is the relatively unknown infection by Histoplasma
		"capsulatum var. duboisii. It is endemic to Central and West Africa, generally"
		"involving the skin with potential for systemic dissemination, and has been"
		described mainly in immunocompetent hosts. We present the case of a 30-year-old
		"Bissau-Guinean man with HIV-2 infection known for 16 years, irregularly treated,"
		"admitted with two weeks of fever, diarrhoea and cutaneous lesions. Examination"
		"revealed multiple subcutaneous nodes, Molluscum contagiosum-like lesions,"
		generalized lymphadenopathy and painful palpation of the left iliac fossa.
		"Laboratory tests showed severe nonhaemolytic anaemia and CD4+ count of 9/mm3,"
		with normal creatinine and hepatic enzymes. Chest roentgenogram was unremarkable
		and a research for Mycobacterium tuberculosis by GeneXpert® was negative.
		"Nonetheless, given the lack of further diagnostic tools, a presumptive diagnosis"
		"of disseminated tuberculosis was made, and the patient was started on"
		"tuberculostatic and antiretroviral drugs. Despite initial improvement, a national"
		"shortage of antiretrovirals precluded further treatment, with worsening of the"
		"clinical picture, namely an increase in the number and dimensions of the skin"
		lesions. An excisional biopsy of a subcutaneous nodule revealed Histoplasma
		"capsulatum var. duboisii. Unfortunately, due to the unavailability of"
		"antifungals, the patient died one week later. To our best knowledge, this is the"
		first confirmed case of an HIV infected patient with African histoplasmosis in
		Guinea-Bissau.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Head and neck involvement with histoplasmosis usually occurs as a
		part of the disseminated illness. There are no pathognomic features of the upper
		aerodigestive tract involvement and the lesion may mimic a host of other
		conditions. The current report presents our experience with head and neck
		histoplasmosis in a non-endemic tertiary care center. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We
		present a case of disseminated histoplasmosis with oral symptoms and lesions as
		the chief complaints. A 10 years' retrospective institutional database search was
		undertaken to identify the patients with histoplasmosis affecting head and neck
		region treated at our institution. The demographic and treatment details of the
		"patients were reviewed. RESULTS: In addition to the index patient, four more"
		patients (two with gingivobuccal and one each with nasal and laryngeal
		"histoplasmosis) were found. Out of the five patients, only one patient was found"
		to have underlying immunosuppression. All of the patients were diagnosed with
		biopsy showing typical appearance of the intracellular organism. All the patients
		were satisfactorily treated with systemic antifungal treatment. CONCLUSION: Upper
		aerodigestive tract involvement with histoplasmosis can present as an intriguing
		clinical puzzle. A high index of suspicion is needed and biopsy is the gold
		standard for the diagnosis. Intravenous Liposomal Amphotericin B and oral
		Itraconazole are standard treatment agents of choice and are highly efficacious
		in achieving cure.

AB	-	Histoplasmosis is an infection caused by the dimorphic fungus Histoplasma
		"capsulatum. The lungs are the most common site of infection, especially in"
		patients with immune deficiency. We report a case of 62-year-old male patient
		presented with cough for 3 months and had been taking immunosuppressive drugs for
		10 years after heart transplantation. Chest CT scan showed multiple pulmonary
		"nodules. Lung tissue biopsy specimen culture suggested fungal infection, and"
		Histoplasma capsulatum was confirmed by next-generation sequencing (NGS)
		detection. The patient was diagnosed with pulmonary histoplasmosis. After
		"administration of voriconazole for 46 days, the symptom of cough was markedly"
		"relieved and the lesions were partly absorbed. After 13 months of treatment, the"
		"lesions completely disappeared, and no significant side-effect of voriconazole"
		"was observed. To our knowledge, report of voriconazole as the treatment of"
		"histoplasmosis is rare, especially in non-endemic areas. Moreover, this case"
		enriches our experience in the adjustment between immunosuppressive and
		antifungal agents in treating histoplasmosis.

AB	-	Purpose: To report a rare case of skin biopsy proven Histoplasma
		panuveitis.Method: Observational case report of a 76-year-old Asian Indian man
		"presented as panuveitis. Clinical course, diagnostic and treatment difficulties"
		and confocal microscopy findings were studied.Result: Patient presented with mild
		"anterior uveitis, membranous vitritis and large chorio-retinal lesions in"
		peripheral fundus with a small macular scar in the right eye. Positive
		quantiferon test along with chest and adrenal findings initially misled
		ophthalmologist and pulmonologist to commence anti-tubercular treatment with
		steroids which further worsened the inflammation and the fungus involved iris and
		scleral tissue. Skin biopsy from the lesions on thigh revealed histoplasma spores
		and confocal microscopy showed similar cystic lesions on endothelium. Prolonged
		course of anti-fungal with steroids resulted in resolution of the
		infection.Conclusion: Histoplasma uveitis can worsen with steroids only treatment
		and may invade iris and scleral tissue which may require prolonged treatment with
		antifungal agents.

PG	-	1550-1557
LID	-	10.1093/cid/cix1067 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Histoplasmosis is a fungal infection associated with exposure to bat
		guano. An outbreak of an unknown severe febrile illness occurred among tunnel
		"workers in the Dominican Republic, and resulted in several deaths. We conducted"
		an investigation to confirm etiology and recommend control measures. METHODS: A
		case was defined as fever and ≥2 symptoms consistent with histoplasmosis in a
		"tunnel worker, July-September 2015. We interviewed workers and family members,"
		"reviewed medical records, tested serum and urine for Histoplasma"
		"antigen/antibody, and conducted a cohort study to identify risk factors for"
		histoplasmosis and severe infection (intensive care). RESULTS: A crew of 36 male
		workers removed large amounts of bat guano from tunnels without respiratory
		"protection for a median of 24 days per worker (range, 1-25 days). Median age was"
		"32 years (range, 18-62 years); none were immunocompromised. Thirty (83%) workers"
		"had illness that met the case definition, of whom 28 (93%) were hospitalized, 9"
		"(30%) required intensive care, 6 (20%) required intubation, and 3 (10%) died. The"
		"median time from symptom onset to antifungal treatment was 6 days (range, 1-11"
		days). Twenty-two of 34 (65%) workers had laboratory evidence of infection.
		CONCLUSIONS: Severe illnesses and death likely resulted from exposure to large
		"inocula of Histoplasma capsulatum spores in an enclosed space, lack of"
		"respiratory protection, and delay in recognition and treatment. Clinician"
		"education about histoplasmosis, improved laboratory capacity to diagnose fungal"
		"infections, and occupational health guidance to protect workers against endemic"
		fungi are recommended in the Dominican Republic.

		"seldom reported in paediatrics. AIMS: To report the epidemiology, clinical"
		features and outcome of children diagnosed with histoplasmosis in an Argentinian
		Children's Hospital. METHODS: A retrospective and descriptive study was performed
		from January 2008 to December 2016 in Hospital de Pediatría 'Prof. Dr. Juan Pedro
		"Garrahan'. Patients under 18 years with clinical features, serological tests,"
		cultures and/or histological findings compatible with histoplasmosis were
		included. Thirteen patients were selected (seven male and six female; mean age
		was 9 years with interquartile range 3.4-13); three children (23%) were from
		"Buenos Aires province, three (23%) from Santa Fe province, and seven (54%) from"
		"other provinces. RESULTS: In ten cases (77%) the clinical form was disseminated,"
		and it was pulmonary in three (23%). Eight cases (62%) suffered other
		"comorbidities. Serological tests were positive in seven patients (54%), with"
		positive cultures obtained in nine patients (69%). Histological findings
		compatible with histoplasmosis were found in 10 cases (77%). All patients
		"received treatment with amphotericin B (liposomal formulation in seven cases,"
		"deoxycholate in six), with 10 patients continuing with oral itraconazole. Three"
		patients (23%) died from causes unrelated to histoplasmosis. CONCLUSIONS: The
		majority of children in the series had comorbidities and disseminated
		histoplasmosis. Mortality was not directly associated with histoplasmosis.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Histoplasma (H.) capsulatum is a dimorphic fungus, and infection is"
		typically via inhalation of microconidia. After conversion to the yeast phase
		"within the lung, the organism is subsequently disseminated to other tissues by"
		macrophages. Nasal histoplasmosis appears to be a rare condition in dogs. CASE
		PRESENTATION: We report the clinical case of a 4.5-year-old male neutered Cocker
		"spaniel/Poodle mix, 7.7 kg, body condition score 6/9, that presented with a"
		3-month history of sneezing and left-sided mucoid nasal discharge. The history
		also included a mild swelling (transient) of the right carpus with a lameness
		"(grade II-III/IV), coinciding with the onset of sneezing and nasal discharge. The"
		dog lived primarily indoors in the Texas Gulf Coast area. On physical
		"examination, the dog was febrile, and the left nostril was swollen, ulcerative,"
		"deformed, and hypopigmented. Mandibular lymph nodes were firm and mildly enlarged"
		"bilaterally. Mild lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and hyperglobulinemia were"
		noted. Thoracic radiographs were unremarkable. Computed tomography and rhinoscopy
		revealed swelling of the rostral portion of the left and right nasal passages.
		Cytology and histology of biopsies of the affected nasal tissue showed
		pyogranulomatous inflammation and yeast organisms consistent with H. capsulatum.
		Weak antigenuria was detected on the MVista H. capsulatum antigen test. Treatment
		with oral itraconazole led to a resolution of the nasal signs and normalization
		"of the appearance of the nostril over 13 weeks, and neither antigenuria nor"
		antigenemia was detected on several recheck examinations. The dog remained in
		good general and physical condition and showed no signs of disease recurrence
		more than 6 years after the last examination. CONCLUSION: We report a rare case
		"of nasal mucocutaneous histoplasmosis in an immunocompetent dog, with an"
		excellent clinical response to oral itraconazole. This case documents that
		"histoplasmosis in dogs can affect primarily the nasal cavity, which responds"
		rapidly to triazole antifungal therapy and has a good prognosis. A similar case
		has only been reported in human medicine in a young adult.

PG	-	864-6
AB	-	A case of histoplasmosis of bone manifested by a single punched-out lesion in the
		humerus is reported in a man with asymptomatic mild chronic disseminated
		histoplasmosis. Roentgenologically evident lesions of bone due to Histoplasma
		"capsulatum are rare, and this is the only report of a large punched-out lytic"
		lesion. Such lesions are common in disseminated histoplasmosis due to the African
		strain H. duboisii. Although H. duboisii has been accorded species
		"differentiation, there are only two clearly defined differences, compared to H."
		"capsulatum. One is morphologic (size of yeast cell), and the other is a different"
		clinical disease spectrum. Many believe that this organism is best viewed as a
		"stable variant of H. capsulatum. At times, the two strains are indistinguishable"
		"morphologically, and at times, as in the case reported, there may be clinical"
		similarities in their respective disease entities.

		Histoplasmosis: A Retrospective Cohort.
PG	-	e3727-e3732
LID	-	10.1093/cid/ciaa1555 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Itraconazole is the preferred azole for histoplasmosis in the current
		Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. Voriconazole is increasingly
		used as treatment for histoplasmosis; it has in vitro activity against
		Histoplasma capsulatum and has shown success in case reports and small case
		"series, but may have a lower barrier to resistance. No comparative studies have"
		"been published. METHODS: We constructed a single-center, retrospective cohort of"
		adult patients diagnosed with histoplasmosis from 2002 to 2017. Individual charts
		"were reviewed to gather clinical information, including demographics, clinical"
		"features, immune status, treatments, and mortality. Patients were categorized"
		based on the choice of azole and use as an initial treatment or as a step-down
		therapy from amphotericin B. Initial therapies with other azoles were excluded.
		Mortality was compared using a multivariable Cox proportional hazards with
		Heaviside function at 42 days. RESULTS: We identified 261 cases of histoplasmosis
		from 2002 to 2017. After excluding patients not treated with itraconazole or
		"voriconazole, 194 patients remained. Of these, 175 (90%) patients received"
		itraconazole and 19 (10%) received voriconazole. There were no significant
		demographic differences between patient populations receiving either azole as
		their initial azole treatment. Death at 180 days occurred in 41 patients (23.4%)
		in the itraconazole group and 6 patients (31.6%) in the voriconazole group.
		Patients on voriconazole had a statistically significant increase in mortality
		during the first 42 days after initiation of treatment when compared to patients
		"receiving itraconazole (hazard ratio, 4.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-13.9; P"
		"= .015), when controlled for other risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Voriconazole in"
		histoplasmosis was associated with increased mortality in the first 42 days when
		compared to itraconazole.

		clinical and epidemiological implications.
PG	-	35-42
AB	-	The South-East Asian region is not known to be a major endemic area for
		histoplasmosis. We have recently diagnosed several cases of disseminated
		histoplasmosis in patients from this region. We report on a well documented
		indigenous case of disseminated histoplasmosis in a 62-year-old poultry farmer
		and review the literature for other reported cases of clinical histoplasmosis in
		the South-East Asian region. Sporadic cases of indigenous chronic pulmonary and
		non-meningeal disseminated histoplasmosis in immunocompetent hosts have been
		reported as well as examples of disseminated histoplasmosis in immunocompromised
		hosts. These reports suggest that histoplasmosis is endemic to certain areas in
		South-East Asia and that there may be a large number of undiagnosed and
		subclinical cases. The recent advances in diagnostic tests for histoplasmosis are
		also reviewed with reference to the experience of using these tests in the
		reported case.

		to estimate the burden of HIV-associated histoplasmosis compared with
		"tuberculosis in Latin American countries. METHODS: For this modelling study, we"
		"estimated prevalence of previous exposure to Histoplasma capsulatum,"
		"HIV-associated histoplasmosis annual incidence, and number of deaths in 2012 in"
		Latin American countries based on historical histoplasmin skin test studies in
		"the general population, with an antigen dilution level of more than 1/10. Studies"
		were identified in a literature search. Data on HIV-associated tuberculosis were
		extracted from the WHO notifications and outcomes tables and data on people
		living with HIV were extracted from the UNAIDS report for the year 2012. We
		systematically propagated uncertainty throughout all the steps of the estimation
		"process. FINDINGS: Among 1310 articles identified as of June 1, 2015, 24 articles"
		"were included in the study, representing 129 histoplasmin skin test studies led"
		"in the general population of Latin American countries. For the year 2012, we"
		estimated a range of 6710 (95% CI 5680-7867) to 15 657 (13 254-18 357) cases of
		symptomatic HIV-associated histoplasmosis in Latin America. Hotspot areas for
		histoplasmosis prevalence (>30%) and incidence (>1·5 cases per 100 people living
		"with HIV) were Central America, the northernmost part of South America, and"
		"Argentina. According to realistic scenarios, we estimated a range of 671 (95% CI"
		"568-787) to 9394 (7952-11 014) deaths related to histoplasmosis, compared with"
		5062 (3777-6405) deaths related to tuberculosis reported in Latin America.
		INTERPRETATION: Our estimates of histoplasmosis incidence and deaths are high and
		"consistent with published data. For the first time, the burden of histoplasmosis"
		is estimated to be equivalent in incidence and even higher in deaths when
		compared with tuberculosis among people living with HIV in Latin America.
		FUNDING: None.

PG	-	725-9
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: We report the first case of clinically diagnosed endogenous
		endophthalmitis caused by Histoplasma capsulatum var. capsulatum in a patient
		with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome. DESIGN: Interventional case report
		and literature review. INTERVENTION: Pars plana vitrectomy and scleral buckling
		procedure in the left eye with intravenous and intravitreal amphotericin in both
		"eyes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The clinical features, culture results, visual"
		"outcome, and complications were studied. RESULTS: This case demonstrates a"
		"bilateral endophthalmitis with severe subretinal exudation, choroidal granulomas,"
		and intraretinal hemorrhage leading to exudative bilateral retinal detachments.
		Vitreous cultures grew H. capsulatum var. capsulatum. Treatment consisted of
		"intravenous amphotericin, intravitreal amphotericin (both eyes), pars plana"
		"vitrectomy (left eye), and scleral buckling procedure (left eye) with resulting"
		counting fingers vision (right eye) and 20/300 (left eye). Four cases of
		"Histoplasma endophthalmitis have been reported previously, all of which had a"
		documented history of disseminated histoplasmosis and resulted in enucleation.
		CONCLUSIONS: H. capsulatum should be considered a possible etiologic agent of
		"endophthalmitis, especially in patients with a history of disseminated"
		histoplasmosis and/or immune deficiency.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE To determine the clinical manifestations of histoplasmosis in a large
		"sample of dogs, compare outcomes achieved with fluconazole versus itraconazole,"
		and identify variables available at the time of diagnosis with prognostic value.
		DESIGN Retrospective case series with nested cohort study. ANIMALS 79 dogs with
		confirmed histoplasmosis evaluated at 2 veterinary teaching hospitals from 1999
		through 2015. PROCEDURES Medical records were reviewed and data extracted
		"regarding clinical signs at evaluation, physical examination findings, clinical"
		"laboratory values, other diagnostic test results, treatments, and outcomes. Data"
		were compared between antifungal agents used (fluconazole or itraconazole) and
		between other variables. RESULTS Various breeds were represented. Working and
		"herding breeds had mostly disseminated histoplasmosis, and toy breeds had mostly"
		the gastrointestinal form. The diagnosis was often achieved with noninvasive
		"techniques, such as cytologic evaluation of rectal scrape samples (n = 24) or"
		blood films (15). Clinical remission was achieved in 16 of 25 (64%) dogs
		receiving fluconazole and 17 of 24 (71%) dogs receiving itraconazole. No
		"differences were identified between antifungal agents in survival, clinical"
		"remission, or disease relapse rates. Identified negative prognostic factors"
		"included Great Pyrenees breed, dyspnea, need for oxygen supplementation, icterus,"
		"palpable abdominal organomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypercalcemia, high"
		"serum alkaline phosphatase activity, and hyperbilirubinemia, whereas diarrhea was"
		a positive prognostic factor. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Findings
		suggested that histoplasmosis should be considered in a sick dog of any breed in
		an endemic area. Clinical signs may be nonspecific. Diagnosis may often be
		possible with noninvasive and inexpensive tests. Either fluconazole or
		itraconazole may be an effective treatment option.

		evaluate the performance of different diagnostic tests.
PG	-	20-24
LID	-	10.1111/myc.12536 [doi]
AB	-	The burden of histoplasmosis has been poorly documented in most of the endemic
		"areas for the disease, including Brazil. Also, modern non-culture-based"
		diagnostic tests are often non-available in these regions. This was a prospective
		cohort study in HIV-infected patients with suspected disseminated disease
		evaluated with different diagnostic tests. Patients were enrolled in three
		"referral medical centres in Porto Alegre, Brazil. Among 78 evaluated patients,"
		disseminated histoplasmosis was confirmed in eight individuals (10.3%) by the
		means of classical (culture/histopathology) tests. Antigen detection in the urine
		was found to be more sensitive: IMMY(®) ALPHA ELISA detected 13 positive cases
		(16.7%) and the in-house ELISA test developed by the Centers for Disease
		Prevention and Control (CDC) detected 14 (17.9%). IMMY(®) and CDC tests provided
		concordant results in 96.2% of cases. This is the first study to compare the
		performance of the in-house CDC ELISA test with the IMMY(®) commercial test for
		"the diagnosis of histoplasmosis, and a high degree of concordance was observed."
		The study revealed that H. capsulatum is an important agent of disseminated
		"disease in AIDS patients in Brazil, reinforcing the importance of making"
		available modern diagnostic tests as well as safer antifungal agents for the
		treatment of histoplasmosis.

AB	-	Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) secondary to Histoplasma capsulatum
		infection is a rare disorder with poor outcome. Although cases of patients with
		"human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection have been well documented, little"
		"study has reported in the setting of HIV seronegative. In this study, we report a"
		case of HLH secondary to histoplasmosis in an immunocompetent patient in China
		and review all cases on this situation. The objective was to summary their
		"epidemiology, clinical characteristics, diagnostic approaches, and therapeutic"
		"response. A 46-year-old male cooker presented fever, fatigue, anorexia, and"
		weight loss. Bone marrow examination suggest fungus organism and
		"hemophagocytosis, and further, bone marrow culture confirmed Histoplasma"
		"capsulatum, as the etiology of HLH. The patient was successfully treated. We"
		reviewed a total of the 13 cases (including our patient) of HLH with
		histoplasmosis in intact immunology patients. Twelve of the 13 patients are from
		"endemic areas, and nine of the 12 cases are from emerging endemic areas, India"
		and China. Three patients had sojourn history may related to the disease onset.
		Twelve of the 13 cases fulfilled HLH-2004 criteria. The diagnosis of Histoplasma
		"capsulatum infection was established by histological examination (13 of 13),"
		"culture (4 of 13), molecular method (2 of 13), and antigen or serological assays"
		"(2 of 13). Amphotericin B, posaconazole, and itraconazole show favorable activity"
		"against the fungus, seven patients used specific treatment for HLH. For analysis"
		"of outcomes, two of the 13 patients died. Our present case report and literature"
		review show that disseminated Histoplasma capsulatum infection with HLH in the
		immunocompetent population becomes increasingly common in emerging endemic areas
		and have high mortality. It is necessary for clinicians to improve the awareness
		of disease diagnosis due to the atypical population and disease presentation.
		Timely diagnosis and early use of antifungal agents will lead to favorable
		prognosis.

AB	-	Histoplasmosis is a progressive disease caused by dimorphic intracellular fungi
		"and can prove fatal. Usually, it is present in immunocompromised individuals and"
		immunocompetent individuals in the endemic zones. We report an unusual
		presentation of progressive disseminated histoplasmosis. The patient in the
		"present case report was immunocompetent child and had fever, bone pains, gradual"
		"weight loss, lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. Disseminated histoplasmosis"
		"(DH) was diagnosed on microscopic examination and fungal culture of bone marrow,"
		"blood, skin biopsy and lymph node aspirate. The patient died on seventh day of"
		amphotericin B. In the absence of predisposing factors and classical clinical
		"presentation of febrile neutropenia, lung, adrenal and oropharyngeal lesions, the"
		disease posed a diagnostic challenge. Progressive disseminated histoplasmosis in
		"children can be fatal despite timely diagnosis and therapy. In India,"
		disseminated histoplasmosis is seen in immunocompetent hosts. All the pediatrics
		immunocompetent cases from India are also reviewed.

		series study.
PG	-	1923-1931
LID	-	10.1007/s00431-021-03969-5 [doi]
AB	-	Progressive disseminated histoplasmosis (PDH) is thought to be on the top of the
		list of AIDS-defining illnesses in South America. Reported experience in children
		is very scarce. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical
		"characteristics, management, and outcomes of children living with HIV presenting"
		with PDH in Ecuador. We did a retrospective study using collected data on medical
		records of children living with HIV attended in Francisco Icaza Bustamante
		Children's Hospital (Guayaquil) between 1997 and 2019. The inclusion criteria
		consisted of patients under 18 years of age at admission with documented HIV
		infection and laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of PDH. Twenty-four children living
		with HIV were attended due to laboratory-confirmed PDH. Median CD4 cell count was
		39 cells/mm³ (p25-p75 21-155) between 1 and 5 years and 22 cells/mm³ (p25-p75
		10-57) for those aged 6 years and over. Fever (96%) was the most common clinical
		"manifestation, followed by hepatomegaly (75%), cough (67%), weight loss (63%),"
		"diarrhea (63%), and abdominal distension (58%). Most significant laboratory"
		"findings were hypoalbuminemia (90%), hypertransaminasemia (78%), and pancytopenia"
		(46%). Intravenous treatment with amphotericin B deoxycholate was started in all
		but one case in which diagnosis was postmortem. All these 23 patients were
		discharged after being hospitalized for a median of 68 days (p25-p75 48-90). Two
		"children showed relapse during follow-up, one of whom died during the"
		hospitalization of this second episode of PDH.Conclusion: Clinical manifestations
		and laboratory findings of PDH in children living with HIV seem similar to those
		"seen in adults, and low CD4 cell count appears to be the most important risk"
		"factor. What is Known: • Since 1987, progressive disseminated histoplasmosis has"
		"been considered an AIDS-defining illness and, although underdiagnosis is"
		"frequent, is thought to be on the top of the list of AIDS-defining illnesses in"
		South America. • Reported experience in children is very scarce. What is New: •
		Clinical manifestations and laboratory findings of progressive disseminated
		histoplasmosis in children living with HIV seem similar to those seen in adults.
		• Low CD4 cell count to be the most important risk factor.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Histoplasmosis is an endemic fungal infection in Peru and HIV
		coinfection leads to difficult diagnoses and high associated mortality. AIM: To
		"describe clinical, epidemiological and clinical outcomes in patients with HIV"
		infection with diagnosis of disseminated histoplasmosis (DH) at Guillermo
		"Almenara Irigoyen National Hospital, Lima, Peru. METHODS: Retrospective,"
		descriptive study; information was obtained from the computer registry of
		"patients with HIV infection diagnosed with DH, during the period 1996-2014."
		"Clinical, epidemiological, treatment and outcome characteristics were described."
		"RESULTS: We found 27 patients, 25 (92.6%) were male, with a mean age of 36.7"
		years (± 9.4 years) and 22 (81.5%) had an epidemiological history contact.
		Sixteen patients (59.3%) had DH as an AIDS defining disease. The median CD4 count
		was 65 cells/mm3 (IQR 15-92). Only 7 (25.9%) received combination antiretroviral
		"therapy at diagnosis. The most common clinical presentation was fever (66.7%),"
		chronic diarrhea (40.7%) and lymphadenopathy (33.3%). The diagnosis was made
		mainly by histopathology. Six (22.2%) patiens died in the acute stage of the
		disease. Seven (25.9%) were initially treated empirically as tuberculosis.
		CONCLUSION: We describe the clinical characteristics of a group of patients who
		had DH as HIV coinfection and this is still a quasi endemic reality in patients
		suffering from this pathology.

TI	-	Disseminated Histoplasmosis: An Unusual Cause of Bowel Obstruction.
PG	-	e66-e70
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Although histoplasmosis is an extremely rare cause of bowel
		"obstruction, this case describes disseminated gastrointestinal histoplasmosis as"
		it progresses from acute colitis to subacute recurrent bowel obstructions. CASE
		PRESENTATION: A White man in his early 80s with history of multiple myeloma
		presented to the emergency department with lightheadedness and diarrhea.
		"Following a diagnostic journey for unspecified colitis, urine antigen testing and"
		endoscopic biopsies led to the diagnosis. During the initial 12 weeks of
		"antifungal treatment, the disease process transitioned from an acute inflammatory"
		syndrome into a recurrent bowel obstruction. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: Only one
		other case of histoplasmosis causing recurrent bowel obstruction has been
		"reported; however, that patient succumbed to the disease without surgical"
		intervention. No clear guidelines exist of how to manage bowel obstructions from
		"rare infectious sources, such as histoplasmosis, but close surveillance,"
		"multidisciplinary care, and an understanding of gastrointestinal pathology can"
		guide clinicians when encountering atypical etiologies of bowel obstruction.

PG	-	2958-2965
LID	-	10.1002/ppul.25565 [doi]
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Mediastinal granuloma (MG) is a postinfectious complication of
		histoplasmosis that remains a rare diagnosis in the pediatric literature. This
		case series presents a well phenotyped population to further characterize this
		disease process. METHODS: Thirty cases of MG in children under 21 years-of-age
		presenting over a 16-year period were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS:
		Seventy-five percent of patients presented with respiratory symptoms. Histoplasma
		antigen was negative in 90%. Histoplasma antibody was positive in 100%. Fine
		needle aspirates were positive for histoplasma in 31% whereas excisional biopsy
		was positive in 71%. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was negative for histoplasma in
		all cases where performed. Computed tomography revealed 53% of MGs were right
		"paratracheal, 60% had internal calcifications, and 23% had splenic"
		"calcifications. Sixteen patients (53%) were managed with medical therapies only,"
		with 7 (44%) treated with steroids and antifungals and 7 (44%) with antifungals
		alone. The remaining 14 patients (47%) underwent surgical excision and 9 were
		also treated with antifungals (64%). Bronchial compression was the most common
		comorbidity within the medically managed only group whereas vascular compression
		and fistulation were most common within the surgically managed group. CONCLUSION:
		Respiratory symptoms should raise suspicion for MG. Diagnostic evidence of MG
		"includes positive histoplasma serologies, right paratracheal location, internal"
		"calcifications, and splenic calcifications. Bronchoscopy, BAL and needle biopsies"
		provide minimal diagnostic benefit. Antifungals are used in the majority of
		"cases, whereas steroids are used most often in non-surgically managed patients"
		"with airway compression. Indications for surgical resection are less defined, but"
		include vascular compression and fistulation unresponsive to medical treatment.

TI	-	Imported and autochthonous histoplasmosis in Italy: new cases and old problems.
PG	-	169-71
AB	-	In the past the Italian soil was considered as a low-endemic pabulum for H.
		capsulatum var. capsulatum and only few autochthonous cases of histoplasmosis
		"were reported in Italy, especially in the Po valley. The aim of the paper was to"
		evaluate this possibility by reviewing the literature and providing our own
		personal data. Four additional cases of histoplasmosis were observed during
		"1999-2003 in AIDS immigrant or in Italian citizens, and in travellers to endemic"
		areas. One of the AIDS patients was an autochthonous case of histoplasmosis. The
		Italian literature was reviewed. Recent cases and literature data confirm the
		"possible autochthonous presence of histoplasmosis in Italy, especially in the"
		Northern regions.

TI	-	Cavitary histoplasmosis occurring during two large urban outbreaks. Analysis of
		"clinical, epidemiologic, roentgenographic, and laboratory features."
PG	-	201-9
AB	-	We have compared risk factors for cavitary histoplasmosis in 62 patients with
		that manifestation of the infection and in 679 patients with other forms of
		"histoplasmosis, and we have evaluated the clinical and laboratory findings in 45"
		patients with cavitary histoplasmosis who were cared for at the Indiana
		University Medical Center hospitals during two large histoplasmosis outbreaks.
		Chronic obstructive lung disease and old age were the strongest risk factors for
		"cavitary histoplasmosis but male sex, white race and immunosuppression were also"
		"important in certain patient groups. Fever, sweats, weight loss, productive"
		"cough, anemia, lymphopenia, and alkaline phosphatase elevation were common"
		findings. The patients were occasionally incorrectly treated for presumed class 3
		"tuberculosis. Cultures were positive in 58% of patients, with sputum samples"
		providing the highest yield (61%). Histoplasmal serologic tests provided useful
		"clues to the diagnosis, positive in over 90% of cases. About one-third of"
		patients recovered spontaneously while another 35% improved following treatment.
		About 4% developed chronic untreated cavitary histoplasmosis characterized by
		clinical and roentgenographic exacerbations and remissions. Of the deaths in four
		"patients with untreated disease, one was caused by disseminated histoplasmosis"
		while three died of other causes. Ketoconazole appeared effective in three of
		seven patients while its effect in three additional patients was uncertain.
		Toxicity precluded completion of ketoconazole therapy in one patient. Only
		amphotericin B has been proven to be effective therapy for cavitary
		histoplasmosis.

		Virus/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Patients with Histoplasmosis in
		Guatemala.
PG	-	42-48
LID	-	10.4269/ajtmh.16-0009 [doi]
AB	-	Histoplasmosis is one of the most common and deadly opportunistic infections
		among persons living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune
		"deficiency syndrome in Latin America, but due to limited diagnostic capacity in"
		"this region, few data on the burden and clinical characteristics of this disease"
		"exist. Between 2005 and 2009, we enrolled patients ≥ 18 years of age with"
		suspected histoplasmosis at a hospital-based HIV clinic in Guatemala City. A case
		of suspected histoplasmosis was defined as a person presenting with at least
		three of five clinical or radiologic criteria. A confirmed case of histoplasmosis
		was defined as a person with a positive culture or urine antigen test for
		Histoplasma capsulatum. Demographic and clinical data were also collected and
		"analyzed. Of 263 enrolled as suspected cases of histoplasmosis, 101 (38.4%) were"
		confirmed cases. Median time to diagnosis was 15 days after presentation
		(interquartile range [IQR] = 5-23). Crude overall mortality was 43.6%; median
		survival time was 19 days (IQR = 4-69). Mycobacterial infection was diagnosed in
		70 (26.6%) cases; 26 (25.7%) histoplasmosis cases were coinfected with
		mycobacteria. High mortality and short survival time after initial symptoms were
		observed in patients with histoplasmosis. Mycobacterial coinfection diagnoses
		"were frequent, highlighting the importance of pursuing diagnoses for both"
		diseases.

TI	-	Gastrointestinal histoplasmosis in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome: report
		of 18 cases and literature review.
PG	-	195-201
AB	-	No large case series of gastrointestinal histoplasmosis (GIH) in patients with
		AIDS has been published. We report 18 cases and review 34 published cases in the
		medical literature. We did a retrospective chart review from patients seen in our
		medical practices between 1989 and 2004. Most of our patients were men who had
		sex with men and who were not receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy.
		"Median CD4 count was 34/muL. The most common presenting symptoms were diarrhea,"
		"fever, abdominal pain, and weight loss. The most commonly involved site was the"
		colon or cecum. Biopsies revealed visible Histoplasma capsulatum organisms in
		89%. Cultures from any site were positive in 76.9%. Four patients died from GIH.
		Gastrointestinal histoplasmosis occurs in severely immunocompromised patients
		with AIDS not receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy. Typical
		"manifestations include diarrhea, fever, abdominal pain, and weight loss."
		Diagnosis is confirmed by blood or gastrointestinal tissue culture. Improvements
		in antiretroviral and antifungal therapies appear to have reduced the incidence
		of GIH and may improve the prognosis of this disease.

PG	-	63-8
LID	-	S1806-37132013000100009 [pii]
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To describe the main clinical and radiological characteristics of
		patients with histoplasmosis mimicking lung cancer. METHODS: This was a
		retrospective descriptive study based on the analysis of the medical records of
		the 294 patients diagnosed with histoplasmosis between 1977 and 2011 at the
		Mycology Laboratory of the Santa Casa Sisters of Mercy Hospital of Porto Alegre
		"in the city of Porto Alegre, Brazil. The diagnosis of histoplasmosis was"
		"established by culture, histopathological examination, or immunodiffusion testing"
		(identification of M or H precipitation bands). After identifying the patients
		"with macroscopic lesions, as well as radiological and CT findings consistent with"
		"malignancy, we divided the patients into two groups: those with a history of"
		cancer and presenting with lesions mimicking metastases (HC group); and those
		with no such history but also presenting with lesions mimicking metastases (NHC
		"group). RESULTS: Of the 294 patients diagnosed with histoplasmosis, 15 had"
		presented with lesions mimicking primary neoplasia or metastases (9 and 6 in the
		"HC and NHC groups, respectively). The age of the patients ranged from 13 to 67"
		"years (median, 44 years). Of the 15 patients, 14 (93%) presented with pulmonary"
		lesions at the time of hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical and
		"radiological syndrome of neoplastic disease is not confined to malignancy, and"
		granulomatous infectious diseases must therefore be considered in the
		differential diagnosis.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Histoplasmosis is a worldwide mycosis with endemic areas throughout
		"Latin America. Disseminated histoplasmosis (DH) has been described in Peru, but"
		there are few reports about its clinical presentation in non-HIV patients.
		METHODS: Case series was done with review of clinical and laboratory charts from
		Hospital Cayetano Heredia and Instituto de Medicina Tropical Alexander von
		Humboldt. Eight patients meet the case definition: HIV negative test and
		definitive diagnosis of DH (isolation of H. capsulatum in culture and/or presence
		"of yeasts on the histopathology), between 2000-2019. RESULTS: Six were men with"
		"median age of 53 years [IQR 35-63,5], most of them were farmers or merchants and"
		with a history of being born in or traveled to the jungle. The median time of
		illness until diagnosis was 390 days [IQR 60-730] and in 7 out 8 cases the
		diagnosis was made by isolation of fungi in culture. Isolates required 11 days
		[IQR 10-18] to become detectable in culture. Six cases had another concomitant
		disease that probably caused an immunosuppression. CONCLUSION: DH form occurs
		"rarely in apparently healthy people. In this series, men in their fifties,"
		"working in farming or merchant, with history of being born in or traveled to the"
		jungle were the most frequent epidemiological characteristics. Culture and
		histopathology were used for the diagnosis but obtaining the results required
		several days. It is necessary the use of other faster techniques and to
		strengthen the clinical awareness about this disease.

		capsulatum variety capsulatum antigen levels.
PG	-	936-41
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To assess the accuracy of Histoplasma capsulatum variety capsulatum
		polysaccharide antigen testing for the identification of histoplasmosis relapse
		in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). DESIGN: A
		retrospective study using stored specimens. SETTING: A referral center and
		several private hospitals. PATIENTS: Twenty episodes of histoplasmosis relapse
		were evaluated in 17 patients with AIDS from November 1987 to August 1990.
		Controls included 30 patients with AIDS and histoplasmosis who did not have a
		relapse during maintenance therapy and who were initially tested during the same
		week as the patients with relapse. A second control group included seven patients
		with AIDS and histoplasmosis who were evaluated for relapse on 23 occasions;
		"relapse, however, was excluded on each occasion. MEASUREMENTS: To avoid"
		"interassay variability, specimens were tested for H.c. var. capsulatum"
		polysaccharide antigen with the same radioimmunoassay. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The
		change in the H.c. var. capsulatum polysaccharide antigen level during successful
		as opposed to unsuccessful maintenance therapy for the prevention of
		histoplasmosis relapse. MAIN RESULTS: For the 20 episodes of relapse (17
		"patients), H.c. var. capsulatum antigen levels increased by at least 2"
		"radioimmunoassay units in 12 of 14 serum specimens tested (85.7%; 95% Cl, 57.2%"
		"to 98.2%) and in 17 of 18 urine specimens tested (94.4%; Cl, 72.7% to 99.9%)."
		"Antigen levels increased in the urine or serum in 1 of 83 specimens (1.2%; CI,"
		"0.03% to 6.6%) obtained on 56 occasions (1.8%; CI, 0.04% to 9.6%) from controls"
		"(specificity, 98.2%; CI, 90.4% to 99.96%). In three cases of relapse, antigen"
		"levels increased before clinical relapse, antigen levels increased before"
		clinical relapse was suspected. Complement fixation titers increased by at least
		"2 dilutions in 4 of 11 cases (36.4%; CI, 10.9% to 69.2%) but in 0 of 9 control"
		"patients (CI, 0% to 28.3%). CONCLUSION: An increase in H.c. var. capsulatum"
		polysaccharide antigen levels of 2 units or more strongly suggests histoplasmosis
		relapse. The presence of increasing titers of anti-H.c. var. capsulatum
		antibodies by complement fixation is less accurate for the diagnosis of relapse.

AB	-	A case of histoplasmosis duboisii in a 30 year-old engineer is presented. The
		"diagnosis was made with the help of light microscopy, electron microscopy and"
		"cultures. Although diagnosed in Chile, the patient probably acquired the disease"
		"in the endemic African area, more precisely in the Ivory Coast. Differential"
		diagnosis between Histoplasma capsulatum var. capsulatum and Histoplasma
		capsulatum var. duboisii is based primarily on the larger in-vivo yeast form size
		"of the latter. Electron microscopy study, the first done on the duboisii variety"
		"of Histoplasma capsulatum in human material to our knowledge, was not essential"
		for this purpose. Differential diagnosis between Histoplasma capsulatum var.
		duboisii and Blastomyces dermatitidis is based on morphological tissue changes
		"and mycologic characteristics. Once more, a case of an ""exotic"" or geographically"
		"restricted disease is detected far from its endemic area, thanks to easier means"
		of transportation. Earth is a shrinking planet.

		"infection. A 22-year-old man presented with a seven month history of fever,"
		"weight loss, and progressive aortic insufficiency. The diagnosis of H. capsulatum"
		was suggested by a diagnostic rise in complement fixation titers and positive

PG	-	67-9
AB	-	"Disseminated histoplasmosis is a disease with a high case-fatality rate,"
		especially in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The
		"disease can occur in various sites, such as the lungs, eyes, oral cavity, larynx,"
		"nervous system, gastrointestinal tract and, more rarely, the nasal sinus region."
		It is a cosmopolitan mycosis with a high prevalence in Brazil. Nasal
		"manifestation of the disease is rare, with only three cases reported in the"
		"literature, but it is part of the differential diagnosis for other granulomatous"
		"diseases, such as Wegener's granulomatosis, tegumentary leishmaniasis and nasal"
		lymphoma. The authors of this study present a literature review and report a case
		of nasal histoplasmosis in a patient with AIDS. No record of such an aggressive
		presentation has been reported previously in the literature.

		case report and review of the prostatic histoplasmosis literature.
PG	-	595-8
AB	-	Histoplasmosis is a common cause of systemic mycosis in areas of the United
		States where it is endemic. Central nervous system and genitourinary
		"histoplasmosis is rare, especially in immunocompetent hosts. We describe a case"
		of disseminated histoplasmosis in a normal host that was associated with cerebral
		"and prostatic histoplasmosis presenting as fever of undetermined origin, weight"
		"loss, and severe debilitating altered mental status. The patient subsequently"
		developed acute renal failure that manifested as obstructive uropathy during
		antifungal therapy with amphotericin B. Transurethral resection of the prostate
		resulted in improved renal function during continuation of amphotericin B
		therapy. Pathological analysis of the prostate revealed necrotizing granulomas
		with intralesional fungal organisms. Blood and urine cultures were positive for
		Histoplasma capsulatum. Diagnostic issues and management are discussed. Treatment
		resulted in return of normal cognitive and motor function. This case is compared
		with the 8 previously reported cases of H. capsulatum prostatitis.

AB	-	The primary objective of the study was to investigate the risk factors for
		Histoplasma capsulatum fungemia. We conducted a retrospective case-control study
		among patients with histoplasmosis seen at Mayo Clinic in Rochester from 1
		January 1991 through 31 December 2005. Blood cultures were prepared from
		specimens obtained from 111 patients with a diagnosis of histoplasmosis of which
		55 had demonstrated H. capsulatum fungemia whereas the cultures of the remaining
		"56 patients were negative. The mean age of the patients was 56 years, of which"
		"70% men and 95% were white. In univariate analysis, immunocompromised status (OR"
		"2.9, P=0.008), peripheral leukocyte count (WBC)<3000 cells/mm(3) (OR 7.3,"
		"P<0.001), albumin<3.5 g/ dl (OR 3.1, P=0.018), and Charlson score of>4 (OR 2.9,"
		"P=0.022) were associated with H. capsulatum fungemia, but age>55 years was not"
		"(OR 1.4, P=0.38). In multivariable analysis, immunocompromised status (OR 2.4,"
		"P=0.043) and WBC<3000 cells/mm(3) (OR 6.5, P=0.001) remained significant factors"
		associated with H. capsulatum fungemia. Immunocompromised status and WBC<3000
		cells/ mm(3) are independent risk factors for the development of H. capsulatum
		fungemia.

PG	-	87

LID	-	87
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Histoplasmosis is worldwide systemic mycoses caused by the dimorphic
		fungus Histoplasma capsulatum. The isolation and identification of H. capsulatum
		in culture is the reference test for histoplasmosis diagnosis confirmation.
		"However, in the absence of it, serology has been used as a presumptive diagnosis"
		through antibody and antigen detection. The purpose of the present study was to
		validate an immunoassay method (western blot) for antibodies detection in the
		diagnosis of histoplasmosis. METHODS: To validate the western blot (WB) a study
		was conducted using 118 serum samples from patients with histoplasmosis and 118
		serum controls collected from January 2000 to December 2013 in residents of the
		"Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. Diagnostic validation parameters were calculated"
		based on the categorization of results obtained in a 2 × 2 table and subjected to
		"statistical analysis. In addition, the viability of deglycosylated histoplasmin"
		antigen (ptHMIN) onto nitrocellulose membranes previously sensitized was
		evaluated during the same period. RESULTS: The WB test showed sensitivity of 94.9
		"%, specificity of 94.1 %, positive predictive value of 94.1 %, negative"
		"predictive value of 94.9 %, accuracy of 94.5 %, and almost perfect precision."
		"Besides, the strips have proved to be viable for using at least 5 years after"
		ptHMIN antigen sensitization. CONCLUSION: Western blot test using ptHMIN provides
		"sensitive, specific, and faster results. Therefore, could be considered a useful"
		"tool in the diagnosis of histoplasmosis being used by public health system, even"
		in situations where laboratory facilities are relatively limited.

		literature.
PG	-	172-4
AB	-	The usual manifestation of histoplasmosis is in the form of respiratory illness.
		We report the case of a 67-year-old man who presented with chronic diarrhea and
		"did not respond to the conventional treatment, including that for Clostridium"
		"difficile. He was found to have isolated colonic histoplasmosis infection, which"
		was treated with itraconazole. There was no evidence of any disseminated disease.
		"His only immunocompromised state was end-stage renal disease, for which he was on"
		chronic hemodialysis. Although it is well documented as a part of disseminated
		"histoplasmosis, our extensive review of the literature did not reveal any"
		reported case of isolated colonic histoplasmosis in a patient on hemodialysis.

AB	-	"Following treatment for pneumonia, a 1-y-old female Nubian goat was presented"
		because of a persistent fever for 3 mo and peripheral lymphadenopathy for 1 mo.
		Cytology and histology of the superficial cervical and prefemoral lymph nodes
		"demonstrated a moderate-to-marked ""left-shifted"" lymphoid population, suggestive"
		"of lymphoma, and extremely rare extracellular, 2-4 µm, oval, basophilic yeast,"
		"consistent with Histoplasma capsulatum. On immunohistochemistry, >95% of the"
		lymphocytes demonstrated positive cytoplasmic and membranous immunoreactivity for
		CD3. Histoplasma spp. urine antigen and serum antibody testing were positive and
		"negative, respectively. Panfungal PCR and sequencing of DNA extracted from"
		"scrolls of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue yielded matches to H."
		capsulatum with 99-100% identity. Given the poor prognosis and persistent
		"pyrexia, the animal was euthanized. Postmortem examination confirmed concurrent"
		"multicentric, intermediate-size, T-cell, lymphoblastic lymphoma and"
		histoplasmosis; lesions consistent with intestinal coccidiosis and suspected
		pulmonary Rhodococcus equi were also noted. Although dimorphic fungi have been
		"described previously in goats, lesions of Histoplasma spp. had not been"
		"documented in this species, to our knowledge. Given the low disease burden, it is"
		"suspected that the lymphoma was primary, leading to an immunocompromised state"
		"and development of secondary, opportunistic infections."

TI	-	Adrenal histoplasmosis: a case series and review of the literature.
PG	-	920-5
AB	-	Adrenal histoplasmosis is an uncommon mycotic disease typically caused by
		Histoplasma capsulatum. The objective was to determine the clinicopathological
		findings in adrenal histoplasmosis. Pathological records were searched from the
		"database at the Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi"
		"Hospital, Mahidol University from 1993 to 2008 for cases of adrenal"
		"histoplasmosis. The keywords were ""histoplasmosis"" and ""adrenal gland"". Adrenal"
		histoplasmosis was diagnosed by histopathology and Gomori-Grocott methenamine
		silver staining. Histoplasma capsulatum was confirmed by tissue culture and/or
		serology. The authors report seven cases of adrenal histoplasmosis in
		immunocompetent patients. The mean age at diagnosis was 67 years. All patients
		presented as chronic fatigue syndrome. The onset of symptoms ranged from one to
		three months. Addison's disease was found in adrenal histoplasmosis in one case
		(14.3%). The computed tomography revealed adrenal nodules measuring 1.2 to 7.8 cm
		in diameter. The histopathology showed granulomatous inflammation with caseous
		necrosis. Culture of adrenal tissue from two patients revealed Histoplasma
		capsulatum. Serum Histoplasma antibodies were positive in four cases. A cure was
		accomplished in 6 out of 7 cases (85.7%). The patients were followed up for 2.5
		to 16.5 years.

TI	-	Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related oral and/or cutaneous histoplasmosis:
		a descriptive and comparative study of 21 cases in French Guiana.
PG	-	571-6
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Oral or cutaneous acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related
		histoplasmosis is a rare presentation of disseminated histoplasmosis. OBJECTIVE:
		To describe this clinical presentation and to compare it with other forms of
		AIDS-related disseminated histoplasmosis. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of
		patients with AIDS-related disseminated histoplasmosis was performed. CD4 counts
		and survival were compared between patients with oral or cutaneous histoplasmosis
		and patients with nonmucocutaneous disseminated histoplasmosis. RESULTS: The mean
		CD4 lymphocyte count was lower in patients with mucocutaneous lesions than in
		"patients with nonmucocutaneous disseminated histoplasmosis (29 vs. 72/mm3, P ="
		0.002). The proportion of survivors 1 month after diagnosis did not differ
		"significantly between the two groups (13/21 vs. 32/45, P = 0.4). At 6 months, the"
		proportion of survivors was significantly lower for patients with mucocutaneous
		"lesions (6/21 vs. 22/39, P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that"
		mucocutaneous lesions occur at a later stage of human immunodeficiency virus
		"infection, but are not, in themselves, associated with a higher level of"
		mortality. The excess mortality at 6 months reflects deaths from other
		complications of severe immunodepression. This study confirms the polymorphism of
		"mucocutaneous lesions, emphasizing the need for systematic testing for"
		Histoplasma in all cases of mucocutaneous lesions in AIDS patients.

AB	-	"Histoplasmosis, a granulomatous disease caused by Histoplasma capsulatum, is"
		endemic in Venezuela. We conducted the current study to appraise retrospectively
		"the demographic data, clinical features, diagnostic methods, and treatment of"
		patients with histoplasmosis from January 2000 to December 2005. We reviewed the
		medical records of outpatient cases with a diagnosis of histoplasmosis and
		considered clinical samples processed at our laboratory. We collected
		"demographic, epidemiologic, and clinical data from each case as available,"
		including results of any mycologic examinations performed. Treatment and outcome
		data were available for some patients. We assessed 158 cases of histoplasmosis:
		103 (65.2%) patients came from the Caracas metropolitan area; 53 were associated
		"with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), 14 with tuberculosis, and 8 with"
		paracoccidioidomycosis. Six pediatric patients were malnourished. Epidemiologic
		data suggested histoplasmosis in most cases. Patients received treatment with
		itraconazole and/or amphotericin B. Our results may reflect changes in the
		"epidemiology occurring in Venezuela, perhaps due to environmental changes and the"
		presence of AIDS. Several mycologic exams are necessary to ensure a proper
		diagnosis. More reliable data and statistics on this infection are necessary to
		monitor outbreaks closely and to establish if there is an epidemic pattern.

		"This disease is usually asymptomatic, but it can result in severe and"
		"disseminated infection involving gastrointestinal tract, especially in"
		immunocompromised individuals. We report a case of a 33-years-old Ecuadorian male
		treated with infliximab who developed disseminated histoplasmosis with
		gastrointestinal affection. Due to the non-specific presentation of
		"gastrointestinal histoplasmosis, the diagnosis is often delayed and it causes"
		poor outcomes. It is important to consider this diagnosis in immunocompromised
		"patients with compatible symptoms, like patients on TNF inhibitors."

TI	-	Acute histoplasmosis in travelers: a retrospective study in an Italian referral
		center for tropical diseases.
PG	-	40-45
LID	-	10.1080/20477724.2020.1716517 [doi]
AB	-	Purpose: Histoplasmosis is a fungal infection acquired through inhalation of
		"Histoplasma capsulatum microconidia, mostly present in the Americas. Both"
		immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients can present a wide spectrum of
		"signs/symptoms, ranging from mild disease to a severe, disseminated infection."
		The aim of this observational study is to describe histoplasmosis cases diagnosed
		in travelers and their clinical/radiological and therapeutic pattern.Methods:
		Retrospective study at the Department of Infectious - Tropical Diseases and
		"Microbiology (DITM) of Negrar, Verona, Italy, between January 2005 and December"
		"2015.Results: Twenty-three cases of acute histoplasmosis were diagnosed, 17 of"
		which belong to the same cluster. Seven of the 23 patients (30.4%) were admitted
		"to hospital, four of whom underwent invasive diagnostic procedures. Thirteen"
		"patients (56.5%) received oral itraconazole. All patients recovered, although"
		nine (39.1%) had radiological persisting lung nodules at 12 month follow
		"up.Conclusions: Clinical, laboratory and radiological features of histoplasmosis"
		"can mimic other conditions, resulting in unnecessary invasive diagnostic"
		"procedures. However, a history of travel to endemic areas and of exposure to risk"
		factors (such as visits to caves and presence of bats) should trigger the
		clinical suspicion of histoplasmosis. Treatment may be indicated in severe or
		prolonged disease.

TI	-	Fibrosing mediastinitis complicating prior histoplasmosis is associated with
		human leukocyte antigen DQB1*04:02 - a case control study.
PG	-	206
LID	-	10.1186/s12879-015-0943-7 [doi]
LID	-	206
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Fibrosing mediastinitis (FM) is an idiosyncratic reaction to
		"infection with Histoplasma capsulatum with a prevalence of 3:100,000 people"
		infected. The rarity of post-histoplasmosis fibrosing mediastinitis (PHFM) in
		areas where H. capsulatum is endemic suggests that an abnormal immunological host
		response may be responsible for the development of fibrosis. Our group previously
		reported an association between subjects with PHFM and human leukocyte antigen
		(HLA)-A*02. We sought to confirm or extend those findings with application of
		high resolution HLA typing in a cohort of subjects with PHFM. METHODS:
		High-resolution HLA typing was performed on DNA samples from a new cohort 34
		"patients with PHFM. Control cohorts included 707 subjects from the ""European"
		"American"" subset of the National Marrow Donor Program(®) (NMDP) and 700 subjects"
		"from Dialysis Clinic, Inc. (DCI). The carriage frequencies of the HLA alleles"
		"identified in the PHFM, NMDP, and DCI cohorts were calculated and then all were"
		compared. RESULTS: We found an increase in the carriage frequency of
		HLA-DQB1*04:02 in PHFM subjects relative to the controls (0.15 versus 0.07 in DCI
		and 0.05 in NMDP; p = 0.08 and 0.03). Multiple logistic regression showed that
		"DQB1*04:02 was statistically significant (p = 0.04), while DQB1*03:02 and C*03:04"
		"had point estimates of OR > 1, though they did not reach statistical"
		significance. The HLA-A*02 association was not replicated. CONCLUSIONS:
		"HLA-DQB1*04:02 is associated with PHFM, which supports the premise that an"
		aberrant host immune response contributes to the development of PHFM.

PG	-	148-51
AB	-	Questions have arisen regarding the risk of developing symptomatic Histoplasma
		capsulatum infection among patients who undergo transplant-related
		immunosuppression in areas endemic for histoplasmosis. Our medical center is
		"located in a hyperendemic area for histoplasmosis, where three large outbreaks"
		occurred since 1978. We undertook a retrospective chart review of 137 patients
		who received allogeneic bone marrow transplant and of 449 patients who received
		solid organ transplant from January 1994 to December 1996 in order to assess the
		incidence of active histoplasmosis. Charts were reviewed before and after
		"transplantation for clinical outcomes, H. capsulatum serologies and antigen"
		"results, and microbiological and radiological results. After a mean follow-up"
		"duration exceeding 16 months, no patient was diagnosed with histoplasmosis. In"
		"the absence of an outbreak, histoplasmosis is a rare infection following the"
		immunosuppression of allogeneic bone marrow or solid organ transplantation even
		in a hyperendemic area. Pre-transplant serologies or chest radiographs consistent
		with prior infection were not associated with post-transplant histoplasmosis.

PG	-	841-7
LID	-	10.1007/s00408-014-9624-3 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: The acute host response to histoplasma capsulatum infection varies
		according to exposure and susceptibility. Late sequelae include calcifications in
		"the lung, thoracic lymphatics, and spleen. Determinants of calcified granuloma"
		formation are poorly studied and may differ from those affecting acute response.
		We examined the occupational associations and familial aggregation of
		radiographic calcified granulomatous disease to characterize the determinants of
		calcified granuloma formation. METHODS: We analyzed prospectively collected
		cross-sectional data including computed tomograms from 872 adult members of the
		Old Order Amish of Lancaster County. RESULTS: Granulomas were present in 71 % of
		"participants. Granulomas were present in the lung of 57 % of participants, in the"
		"hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes of 55 % of participants, and in the spleen of 29"
		% of participants. No significant differences were observed in the presence of
		granulomas between men and women. Each year of age was associated with 4 % higher
		"odds of splenic calcifications, and a primary occupation of farming was"
		associated with an 84 % higher odds of splenic calcifications. A compelling
		pattern of familial aggregation was not observed. CONCLUSIONS: Calcified
		granulomatous disease does not appear to aggregate in families. Determinants
		"influencing patterns of granulomatous disease include occupation, age, and"
		geographic location.

		REPORT: We describe a case of a 33 years old gentleman who was clinically
		diagnosed as acute appendicitis at initial presentation in view of a one-week
		"history of fever, right lower quadrant abdominal pain- and guarding at right"
		iliac fossa. He had thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia on presentation. Mesenteric
		"lymphadenitis and small bowel lesion were found intraoperatively, which was"
		respectively biopsied and resected. Histopathological result confirms
		disseminated histoplasmosis. Retroviral screen was positive. He was treated with
		"amphotericin B for one week, subsequently switched to oral itraconazole, followed"
		by initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). DISCUSSION: This
		case illustrates the various nature of histoplasmosis presentation. A high index
		of suspicion is needed to clinch the diagnosis and subsequently institute prompt
		treatment as disseminated disease can be fatal if left untreated in an
		immunosuppressed host.

		"including Trinidad and Tobago (population 1,339,000 million) is scanty. Tinea"
		"capitis is common in children, being predominant in those of African descent,"
		"with no definitive estimate. Asthma is also common affecting 77,000-139,000"
		adults with an estimated 1927-3491 affected by allergic bronchopulmonary
		aspergillosis (ABPA) and 2544-4608 with severe asthma and fungal sensitisation
		"(SAFS). An estimated 23,763 women have ≥4 attacks of vaginal candidiasis"
		"annually. Among the estimated 14,000 HIV-infected patients, 750 cases of"
		"oesophageal candidiasis, 400 cases of Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) and 50 cases"
		of cryptococcal meningitis are anticipated. Histoplasma capsulatum is endemic in
		the islands with a 49% skin positivity rate in those <60 years old. Three cases
		of cutaneous histoplasmosis in AIDS patients have been reported. Three cases of
		pulmonary histoplasmosis were reported among German biologists following exposure
		to bats in a cave in Trinidad. Using a low mean international incidence figure
		"for candidaemia of 5/100,000, 67 cases of candidaemia are estimated. The burden"
		of fungal infections in Trinidad and Tobago is considerable and requires
		appropriate diagnostic and clinical expertise.

		from Brazil.
PG	-	1108-15
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To identify the main clinical and laboratory features of disseminated
		histoplasmosis (DH) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients and compare
		them with those of HIV patients with other opportunistic diseases. METHODS:
		Retrospective study of HIV patients comparing the clinical and laboratory data of
		patients with and without DH. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed
		"to verify the risk factors related to DH. RESULTS: In total, 378 HIV patients"
		"were included, 164 with DH and 214 with other opportunistic diseases. Acute renal"
		"failure, respiratory insufficiency and septic shock were more frequent in DH"
		"patients, who also had a higher mortality (32%vs. 14%, P < 0.001). Independent"
		risk factors for DH were: acute renal failure [odds ratio (OR) 5.2; 95%
		"confidence interval (CI) 3.2-8.5; P < 0.001], splenomegaly (OR 3.4; 95% CI"
		"1.19-9.9; P < 0.001), respiratory insufficiency (OR 2.7 95% CI 1.5-5.0; P <"
		"0.001), proteinuria (OR 2.7; 95% CI 1.3-5.2; P = 0.03), hypotension (OR 2.5; 95%"
		"CI 1.2-5.0; P = 0.008), hepatomegaly (OR 2.4; 95% CI 1.2-4.8; P = 0.01),"
		"cutaneous lesions (OR, 1.9; 95% CI 1.0-3.3; P = 0.02) and weight loss (OR 1.8;"
		95% CI 1.0-3.1; P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that DH is a severe
		"opportunistic disease with high mortality rate, which should be promptly"
		recognized in order to provide early specific treatment.

TI	-	Histoplasma endocarditis: clinical and mycologic features and outcomes.
PG	-	9-Feb
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To define the salient clinical and microbiologic characteristics and
		outcome of infective endocarditis caused by Histoplasma capsulatum. METHODS: Case
		report and review of 43 literature cases. RESULTS: Infection involved both native
		"(36 cases) and prosthetic (7) heart valves, had a high rate of systemic"
		"embolization (58%), and a more delayed diagnosis than bacterial endocarditis."
		"Cardiac involvement generally occurred on mitral and/or aortic valves, and almost"
		always in the setting of disseminated disease. Antemortem diagnosis was best made
		by serology (serum antibody titers or urinary antigen) or culture of blood
		"(positive in <20% of cases), bone marrow, excised valves, and other non-blood"
		specimens. Other diagnostic methods included histopathology and immunofluorescent
		staining of tissue samples. Untreated infection was uniformly fatal. Prolonged
		"antifungal therapy with amphotericin B, without surgical intervention, appeared"
		more effective than for Candida endocarditis. CONCLUSIONS: Histoplasma
		"endocarditis is an infrequent but important cause of left-sided, blood"
		culture-negative endocarditis. Its true prevalence may be underestimated because
		of the relative difficulty in making a precise microbiologic diagnosis.
		"Amphotericin B therapy appears more effective than for Candida endocarditis,"
		while the role for azole treatment and secondary prophylaxis remains uncertain.
		Indications for surgical valve replacement are similar to those for bacterial
		endocarditis.

AB	-	"Histoplasmosis is a fungal infection caused by Histoplasma capsulatum, and Japan"
		is considered a non-endemic area for histoplasmosis. Most patients diagnosed with
		histoplasmosis in the past usually have exposure to caves and bat guano with
		"travel history to endemic areas. Therefore, travel history and risk activities"
		should be comprehensively assessed when suspecting histoplasmosis because this
		"important information may be overlooked. Although few, possibilities of"
		"indigenous cases have also been suggested. Moreover, it is assumed that the"
		number of travelers and endemic mycoses has decreased with the recent coronavirus
		"disease 2019 epidemic. However, clinicians should carefully consider the"
		differential diagnosis of histoplasmosis for travelers traveling to endemic
		"areas. In this case report, we describe an immunocompetent Japanese woman who"
		developed histoplasmosis due to a history of travel to an endemic country. Our
		case report suggests that clinicians should not exclude histoplasmosis from the
		differential diagnosis even in the absence of risk features such as activities or
		immunodeficiencies during travel.

		people receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy for HIV infection: A
		systematic review.
PG	-	791-799
LID	-	10.1093/mmy/myy143 [doi]
AB	-	Histoplasmosis is the most clinically significant mycosis in Latin America; still
		it has been neglected in people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). There is
		limited information about its contribution to morbidity and mortality in this
		population. We conducted a systematic review of scientific literature to provide
		an estimation of the frequency and mortality of histoplasmosis among people with
		"HIV receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in Latin America, and"
		"factors associated with mortality. We searched articles in PubMed, Scopus, WHO"
		"Global health library, and Scielo using different combination of terms including"
		"""histoplasmosis"" and HAART. We identified 949 articles, removed 662 duplicated;"
		screened 287 abstracts; reviewed full text of 53 articles; and selected 15
		"articles that provided information on the number of patients studied, included"
		"patients receiving ART, and reported any measure of frequency estimate for"
		"qualitative synthesis. Studies were conducted in Argentina (n = 4), Brazil (n ="
		"6), Colombia (n = 2), French Guyana and the Bahamas (=2), and Guatemala (n = 1)."
		Heterogeneity of studies characteristics precluded any aggregated estimates.
		Histoplamosis was frequent in these cohort studies and mortality was high despite
		"the use of HAART. Low CD4 counts, delayed HAART initiation and poor adherence"
		"were related to increased incidence, poor prognosis and increased mortality,"
		respectively. Histoplasmosis may be an important contributor to mortality in
		people with HIV in Latin America. Diagnostic delays represent an important
		limitation for improving care of patients suspected to have histoplasmosis.
		Reducing histoplasmosis diagnostic delays and therapy initiation is needed to
		further decrease mortality.

		six cases and review of the literature.
PG	-	e13274
LID	-	10.1111/petr.13274 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: We report a case series of histoplasmosis in KTx patients in a
		"children's hospital in an endemic area. METHODS: All KTx cases from January 1,"
		"2002, to August 31, 2016, were reviewed to identify those with disseminated"
		histoplasmosis. RESULTS: The attack rate of histoplasmosis among our KTx patients
		was 6.9 per 100 cases. The median age at the time of diagnosis was 16 years
		"(11-18). Comorbidities included glomerulosclerosis (3), medullary cystic disease"
		"(1), and obstructive uropathy (2) and HIV (1). There were 5 deceased and 1"
		"living-related donor transplants, and no patient had a history of rejection prior"
		to histoplasmosis. Median time from transplant to histoplasmosis was 14.8 months
		(IQR 2.2-38.3) and 33% occurred in the first year after transplant. Urine and/or
		serum antigens were positive in all patients. They were either treated with
		amphotericin B and transitioned to an azole or received azole monotherapy. Most
		(83%) received chronic suppression with itraconazole. No patients died and
		relapse occurred in 1 patient after repeat transplant. CONCLUSIONS: KTx patients
		in endemic areas are at risk for disseminated histoplasmosis. Further study is
		needed to determine which factors portend the need for fungal prophylaxis in this
		subset of patients.

TI	-	Bat-associated histoplasmosis in returning travelers: case presentation and
		description of a cluster.
PG	-	258-60
AB	-	Histoplasma capsulatum is a dimorphic fungus with the mycelial form producing
		spores that are readily airborne and able to reach small bronchi and alveoli.
		Isolation of the mycelial form of H. capsulatum in nature shows a striking
		"correlation with moist, acidic soils, frequently contaminated with bird or bat"
		"excreta. Bats, but not birds, may be infected by H. capsulatum and may excrete"
		the fungus in their feces. Skin test surveys show that the infectious agent is
		present worldwide in the areas between 45 degrees north and 30 degrees south of
		the equator. Clusters of cases may occur because of the disturbance of soil
		"contaminated with H. capsulatum, or by visiting bat caves. Cave-associated"
		"histoplasmosis has been reported from the Americas, Africa, Oceania, and Africa."
		"Recently, cave-associated histoplasmosis has been reported in travelers returning"
		from Costa Rica and Peru. We report a cluster of cave-associated acute
		histoplasmosis that occurred in college students returning from Ecuador. Advice
		regarding histoplasmosis prevention should be given to travelers planning to
		"visit bat-infested caves, and histoplasmosis should be considered in the"
		differential diagnosis of febrile illness in returning travelers with a history
		of epidemiologic or geographic exposure.

		compatible with H. capsulatum var. duboisii. Cultures were not possible but
		serology showed antibodies against both H. capsulatum var. duboisii and H.
		capsulatum var. capsulatum antigens. Presumptive diagnosis of histoplasmosis was
		done but treatment with itraconazole was inefficacious. After 15 days of
		"treatment with Amphotericin B i/v, improvement was evident and, three months"
		"later, the patient was discharged with only residual lesions. Seven months later,"
		no relapses were observed.

TI	-	Oral histoplasmosis in a patient infected with HIV. A case report.
PG	-	126-30
AB	-	Histoplasmosis is a frequent complication of HIV infection and is usually the
		"result of reactivation. In the immunocompromised host, histoplasmosis may cause a"
		chronic pulmonary infection or disseminated disease. In the setting of
		"disseminated disease, oral lesions are present in 30% to 50% of patients and may"
		occur in almost every part of the oral mucosa. The most common sites are the
		"tongue, palate, and buccal mucosa. In some cases, oral lesions appear to be the"
		primary or only manifestation of disease. We have been able to find only five
		case reports in the literature of histoplasmosis in HIV infection with oral
		"lesions. In two of the cases, histoplasmosis was apparently localized to the oral"
		"cavity, whereas two cases also had evidence of disseminated disease, the fifth"
		was undetermined. We report one such case of apparently localized oral
		histoplasmosis in a patient with HIV infection.

AB	-	Histoplasmosis is the most frequent opportunistic infection and the first cause
		of mortality in HIV-infected patients in French Guiana and presumably in much of
		Latin America. Mucocutaneous lesions of histoplasmosis are considered as rare and
		late manifestations of the disease. It has been debated whether the greater
		proportion of cutaneo-mucous presentations in South America relative to the USA
		was the reflection of Histoplasma strains with increased dermotropism or simply
		delayed diagnosis and advanced immunosuppression. The objective of this study was
		"to describe the clinical presentation, frequency, prognosis and temporal trends"
		of cutaneomucous histoplasmosis in French Guiana. A retrospective study of
		patients with AIDS-related disseminated histoplasmosis followed in the three
		hospitals of French Guiana was performed between 1981 and 2014. Incident cases of
		"histoplasmosis, proved by pathology and/or mycological examinations, were"
		studied. Mucocutaneous histoplasmosis was confirmed by a positive cutaneous or
		mucosal biopsy. Mucocutaneous lesions were polymorphic. Ninety percent of
		patients were profoundly immunocompromised patients (CD4<50/mm3) and over 80%
		were not on antiretroviral treatment. The frequency of mucocutaneous forms and
		case fatality of disseminated histoplasmosis within one month of antifungal
		"treatment significantly decreased over time (p<0,001). In this South American"
		"territory, diagnostic and therapeutic improvements have led to the quasi"
		disappearance of cutaneous manifestations. There may be South American
		dermotropism in the laboratory but at the bedside early diagnosis seems to be the
		main parameter explaining the proportion of cutaneomucous presentations in South
		America relative to the USA.

AB	-	Disseminated histoplasmosis is usually associated with immunosuppressive
		conditions like AIDS. People with respiratory distress syndrome secondary to
		"SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia are vulnerable to bacterial infections. Additionally,"
		coinfection with fungal pathogens should be considered as a differential
		diagnosis even in immunocompetent patients who remain on mechanical ventilation
		"secondary to COVID-19. The case presents a 61-year-old immunocompetent man,"
		admitted to the medical ward due to COVID-19 pneumonia. Despite appropriate
		"therapy, the patient required transfer to the intensive care unit for invasive"
		mechanical ventilation. He remained critically ill with worsening respiratory
		"failure. Two weeks later, coinfection by disseminated histoplasmosis was"
		"detected. After immediate treatment with amphotericin B and itraconazole, the"
		patient tolerated weaning from mechanical ventilation until extubation. Awareness
		of this possible fungal coinfection in immunocompetent patients is essential to
		"reduce delays in diagnosis and treatment, and prevent severe illness and death."

AB	-	African histoplasmosis caused by Histoplasma capsulatum var. duboisii is an
		invasive fungal infection endemic in central and west Africa. Most of its ecology
		and pathogenesis remain unknown. H. capsulatum var. capsulatum is an
		AIDS-defining opportunistic infection in HIV-infected patients who are living in
		"or have traveled to histoplasmosis-endemic areas. In contrast, reports concerning"
		"African histoplasmosis during HIV infection are rare, although both pathogens"
		coexist in those regions. We report 3 cases of imported African histoplasmosis
		diagnosed in France in HIV-infected patients and a literature review on similar
		cases.

		retrospective review.
PG	-	436-41
AB	-	Histoplasmosis and penicilliosis are fungal infections with similar clinical
		presentation and laboratory findings that were reported mainly in the era prior
		to highly active antiretroviral therapy. We conducted a retrospective review at
		two hospitals in Central Thailand of the medical records of HIV-positive patients
		with microbiologic evidence of histoplasmosis or penicilliosis between January
		2003 to September 2007 when antiretrovirals became widely available in Thailand.
		"Fifty patients met inclusion criteria; 36 had histoplasmosis, and 14 had"
		penicilliosis. Symptoms and laboratory findings on presentation were similar
		between the two infections except for a greater incidence of tachypnea and
		neutropenia among patients with histoplasmosis (both p < 0.05). For
		"histoplasmosis, blood culture had a significantly lower yield for detecting"
		infection compared to tissue microscopic examination highlighting the importance
		of obtaining tissue for diagnosis (p < 0.05).

AB	-	One adult leopard (Panthera pardus) and five adult tigers (Panthera tigris)
		"presented with a range of nonspecific clinical signs, including lethargy (6/6),"
		"mobility deficits (4/6), and hyporexia (3/6). Hematology and biochemistry"
		"revealed a hyperproteinemia characterized by hyperglobulinemia (4/6),"

		"(2/6), hyperbilirubinemia (2/6), or a combination of conditions. Further"
		diagnostics and management varied with the presenting signs and
		"clinicopathological findings, including supportive care, diagnostic imaging, and"
		"blastomyces urine antigen analyses. Two animals died, and four were euthanatized."
		"Postmortem findings included granulomatous pneumonia (6/6), fibrinous pleural"
		"effusion (3/ 6), pericardial effusion (2/6), and diffuse icterus (1/6)."
		Histopathology revealed round to oval structures with a thin clear wall and
		"purple inclusions within cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system, consistent"
		"with Histoplasma capsulatum, in each animal. Disseminated histoplasmosis was"
		"found in five cases, with organisms present in the lung (5/5), liver (3/5), lymph"
		"nodes (3/5), spleen (2/5), bone marrow (2/5), thyroid (1/5), tongue (1/ 5),"
		"kidney (1/5), or a combination of organs. One tiger was found to have pulmonary"
		histoplasmosis without evidence of disseminated infection. On the basis of
		"clinical and pathological findings, histoplasmosis was diagnosed. This case"
		series illustrates the difficulties in antemortem diagnosis of histoplasmosis on
		"the basis of complete blood count, serum biochemistry profile, and antigen"
		testing and underscores that histoplasmosis should be considered a differential
		diagnosis in any felid presenting with nonspecific clinical signs in endemic
		areas.

AB	-	Histoplasmosis is a common opportunistic infection in patients with human
		immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection who reside in areas where Histoplasma
		capsulatum is endemic. We undertook a prospective study of a cohort of 304
		HIV-Infected patients in Kansas City from October 1990 through March 1993 to
		"define the incidence-specific risk factors, and pathophysiology of"
		histoplasmosis. The annual incidence of histoplasmosis was 4.7%; 74% of the
		patients with histoplasmosis were symptomatic (all of whom had disseminated
		"disease). A history of exposure to chicken coops, a positive baseline serology"
		"for complement-fixing antibodies to Histoplasma mycelium antigen, and a baseline"
		CD4+ lymphocyte count of < 150/microL were associated with an increased risk for
		histoplasmosis. Histoplasmin reactivity and the presence of pulmonary
		calcifications were not useful markers for patients at high risk. Symptomatic
		infection occurred in 9.9% of patients with evidence of prior exposure to H.
		"capsulatum, in 4.0% of patients without documented prior exposure, and in 3.0% of"
		patients who were anergic; these findings suggest that the pathophysiology of
		histoplasmosis in patients with AIDS involves reactivation of latent infection in
		some cases and dissemination of exogenously acquired infection in other cases.

PG	-	158-62
LID	-	10.1177/1040638713516623 [doi]
AB	-	A 2.5-year-old intact male miniature lop rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) was
		"presented with multiple nodules surrounding the eyes, nose, mouth, and prepuce."
		Cytological evaluation of the periocular nodules revealed the presence of
		intracellular (within macrophages) and extracellular yeast organisms. The yeast
		"organisms were approximately 3-5 µm in diameter, round to oval, with a thin clear"
		"capsule, and contained an eccentrically placed basophilic crescent-shaped"
		nucleus. The clinical pathological interpretation was granulomatous inflammation
		with intralesional yeast of a morphology consistent with Histoplasma spp. The
		"rabbit was treated with microsized griseofulvin (25 mg/kg, orally, once a day)"
		for 12 days pending final cytological diagnosis of histoplasmosis. No significant
		"improvement was noted during the treatment period, and humane euthanasia was"
		performed. Postmortem examination revealed the presence of intracellular and
		"extracellular yeast organisms in the small intestine, skin (antebrachium,"
		"perioral, palpebral, perianal, and pinnal), penis, penile urethra, rectum,"
		"axillary lymph node, and conjunctiva. Postmortem fungal culture yielded"
		"Histoplasma capsulatum. Based on clinical and postmortem findings, a definitive"
		diagnosis of disseminated histoplasmosis was made. Disseminated histoplasmosis
		appears to be unreported in rabbits. Although the treatment used did not provide
		"noticeable improvement, available information on histoplasmosis treatment in"
		other species has been reviewed to provide useful information for future
		management of this condition in rabbits.

AB	-	Histoplasmosis is the most common endemic mycosis in the United States and is
		caused by the organism Histoplasma capsulatum. Infection is often asymptomatic or
		"self-limited, but when symptomatic it usually presents in the form of pulmonary"
		"histoplasmosis. In its most severe form, H. capsulatum can spread to"
		extrapulmonary sites causing disseminated infection. Here we present a peculiar
		case of central nervous system (CNS) histoplasmosis wherein multiple focal spinal
		"cord lesions were the only manifestation of CNS infection, causing bilateral"
		"lower extremity paresis and loss of sensation. Although uncommon, CNS"
		histoplasmosis should be included in the differential diagnosis when a patient
		"presents with meningitis, encephalitis, or isolated brain or spinal cord lesions"
		in endemic areas.

AB	-	"To our knowledge, an institutional review of systemic histoplasmosis has not been"
		conducted in the United States since the major outbreaks in Indianapolis in
		1978-4982. We conducted a retrospective review of all patients with systemic
		histoplasmosis diagnosed at Mayo Clinic over a 15-year period. The case
		definitions employed were based on an international consensus statement by the
		European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal
		Infections Cooperative Group (EORTC/IFICG) and the National Institute of Allergy
		and Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group (MSG). One hundred eleven patients
		"with systemic histoplasmosis were identified between January 1, 1991, and"
		"December 31, 2005. Of these, 78 patients had disseminated histoplasmosis and 55"
		patients had Histoplasma capsulatum fungemia. The mean age of patients was 55
		"years, 66% were male, and 98% were white. Fifty-nine percent of patients were"
		"immunocompromised. Fever was the most frequently reported symptom (63%), followed"
		by respiratory complaints (43%) and weight loss (37%). The peripheral white blood
		"cell count was <3000 cells/mm in 28%, hemoglobin was <10 g/dL in 29%, and"
		"platelet count was <150,000 cells/mm in 41% of patients. Liver enzymes were"
		"elevated (alanine aminotransferase >60 U/L in 39%, aspartate aminotransferase >60"
		"U/L in 27%), alkaline phosphatase was >200 U/L in 55%, and albumin was <3.5 g/dL"
		in 70%. Serologic and histopathologic examinations were each positive in 75% of
		"cases, Histoplasma urine antigen screening was positive in 80%, and H. capsulatum"
		was culture positive in 84%. Forty-seven percent of patients were sequentially
		"treated with an amphotericin B-containing product followed by itraconazole, 31%"
		"received itraconazole alone, and 7% received an amphotericin B-containing product"
		"only. Another 13% of patients did not receive antifungal treatment, and the"
		remaining 2% did not have treatment data available. Sixty percent of patients
		"required hospitalization, and in hospital mortality was 6% with a median survival"
		"time of 61 days. The relapse rate was 9%, with a median relapse-free survival of"
		857 days. Systemic histoplasmosis should be suspected in patients who have lived
		"in endemic areas with fever, bone marrow suppression, and elevated hepatic"
		"enzymes, particularly if they are immunocompromised. Evaluation including a"
		"combination of Histoplasma serologic screening, urine antigen assay, and fungal"
		culture will secure the diagnosis in most cases.

AB	-	Disseminated histoplasmosis is a life-threatening condition in immunocompromised
		patients. The majority of healthy persons have benign disease not requiring
		"treatment. However, in persons living with HIV, mortality is high and accurate"
		diagnosis is paramount. We present a case of a 48-year-old HIV-positive woman who
		presented with haematuria and flank pain. She had a history of recurrent urinary
		tract infection and nephrolithiasis with obstructive hydronephrosis. During
		"cystoscopy, a bladder lesion was found. Pathological evaluation demonstrated"
		abundant intracellular organisms with apparent budding. Subsequent urine
		histoplasma antigen was negative. Given the high index of suspicion for
		histoplasmosis based on the surgical pathology findings and epidemiological
		"history, the patient was started immediately on antifungal therapy. One week"
		"later, PCR results of the bladder lesion confirmed the presence of Histoplasma"
		capsulatum This case highlights a rare presentation of genitourinary
		histoplasmosis and the utility of surgical pathology evaluation and PCR for
		diagnosis.

AB	-	A 61-year-old female with a history of advanced HIV disease and chronic hepatitis
		B was presented with an 8-week history of painful oral ulcers. She appeared
		systemically well but examination revealed multiple well-demarcated clean-based
		ulcers on the tongue and hard palate. Biopsy of one of the lesions showed
		numerous histiocytes containing intracellular yeast forms consistent with
		Histoplasma capsulatum var. capsulatum Fungal blood cultures subsequently grew H.
		"capsulatum var. capsulatum, confirming a diagnosis of disseminated"
		histoplasmosis. She was treated with intravenous amphotericin B for 2 weeks
		"followed by a prolonged course of oral itraconazole, with which her ulcers"
		resolved completely and have not recurred. This case exemplifies how oral ulcers
		may be a manifestation of an underlying systemic disease and demonstrates the
		utility of biopsy in establishing a diagnosis.

AB	-	The objective of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of an
		antigen enzyme immunoassay (EIA) on urine samples for the diagnosis of
		histoplasmosis in dogs. This retrospective medical records review included canine
		cases with urine samples submitted for Histoplasma EIA antigen assay between 2007
		and 2011 from three veterinary institutions. Cases for which urine samples were
		submitted for Histoplasma antigen testing were reviewed and compared to the gold
		standard of finding Histoplasma organisms or an alternative diagnosis on cytology
		"or histopathology. Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive"
		"predictive value, and the kappa coefficient and associated confidence interval"
		were calculated for the EIA-based Histoplasma antigen assay. Sixty cases met the
		inclusion criteria. Seventeen cases were considered true positives based on
		"identification of the organism, and 41 cases were considered true negatives with"
		"an alternative definitive diagnosis. Two cases were considered false negatives,"
		and there were no false positives. Sensitivity was 89.47% and the negative
		predictive value was 95.35%. Specificity and the positive predictive value were
		"both 100%. The kappa coefficient was 0.9207 (95% confidence interval, 0.8131-1)."
		The Histoplasma antigen EIA test demonstrated high specificity and sensitivity
		for the diagnosis of histoplasmosis in dogs.

AB	-	Central nervous system (CNS) infection by Histoplasma capsulatum is a rare
		disease in immunocompromised individuals in endemic areas. About one quarter of
		cases result from hematogenous dissemination. A 23-year-old upholsterer with
		"chronic occipital headache had developed intracranial hypertension and dizziness,"
		"incoordination with ataxic gait, and acute confusion 5 months prior to admission."
		Laboratory examinations and chest roentgenogram were normal. Postcontrast
		"T1-weighted MRI of the brain revealed a multiple ring-enhancing cerebellar, brain"
		"stem and parietal lobe lesions, and meningeal contrast enhancement. Cerebrospinal"
		"fluid culture was positive for H. capsulatum species complex, which was confirmed"
		"by phylogenetic analysis. Thirteen years after the diagnosis and treatment, there"
		was no H. capsulatum recurrence; sequels related to complications due to the
		ventriculoperitoneal shunt. This case shows a primary neurological presentation
		"of cerebral histoplasmosis, without meningitis or disseminated disease in"
		nonimmune-compromised patient. The authors propose a categorization of the
		diagnosis of CNS histoplasmosis. Routine diagnostics of sibling species within
		the H. capsulatum complex proved to be difficult.

AB	-	A retrospective study was carried out on 171 cases of disseminated histoplasmosis
		diagnosed in HIV/AIDS patients during the period 2009-2014. Although HIV
		"diagnosis rates remained stable over the study period, a sensible increase in the"
		number of histoplasmosis cases was observed in the last three years. Disseminated
		histoplasmosis was prevalent in males with an average age of 37.8 years. At
		"diagnosis, only 54/171 (31.6%) were receiving HAART, and CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts"
		"ranged from 4 to 264 cells/upsilon. Cutaneous lesions, including ulcerated"
		"papules or molluscoid plaques, were present in 110/171 (64.3%), with Histoplasma"
		capsulatum being observed in all skin scraping specimens upon Giemsa staining.
		Respiratory manifestations were second in frequency with bronchoalveolar lavage
		showing a high diagnostic performance. Radiological findings included milliary
		"patterns, interstitial infiltrates, and focalized condensations. Out of 141 blood"
		"cultures performed, H. capsulatum was isolated in 82 (58.2%). No significant"
		difference in diagnostic performance was found between blood cultures and skin
		scraping (p = 0.6164). Other opportunistic infections were observed in 70/171
		(40.9%) prior to or concomitantly with histoplasmosis. Association with
		Mycobacterium tuberculosis was recorded in 16/171 (9.4%) and one had a multi-drug
		resistant isolate. The severity of histoplasmosis determined the monotherapy with
		"amphotericin B deoxycholate in 115 (67.3%), itraconazole in 42 (24.5%), and"
		"combined therapies in 14 (8.2%). Mortality was 19.9% (34/171). Finally, we"
		emphasize that the higher prevalence in the last three years of the study should
		prompt the medical community to consider the diagnosis of histoplasmosis to
		reduce mortality of AIDS patients.

AB	-	Histoplasma capsulatum variety capsulatum (H. capsulatum) is a thermally
		dimorphic fungus that is endemic to the Mississippi River and Ohio River valley
		"regions. Of the hundreds of thousands of patients exposed to this fungus, less"
		than 1% develop a severe illness most commonly manifesting as pulmonary disease.
		Septic arthritis from hematogenous seeding with H. capsulatum or from direct
		inoculation has been reported only rarely in the literature. The first case of
		septic arthritis of the shoulder due to H. capsulatum occurring in an
		"immunocompromised patient, treated successfully with irrigation and debridement,"
		"systemic antifungals, and local delivery of amphotericin B with cement beads, is"
		"reported here. Importantly, the addition of local amphotericin B delivery by"
		cement beads to conventional treatment likely led to clinical cure in this
		patient.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Histoplasmosis is an uncommon systemic fungal infection, but it is"
		"potentially fatal in immunosuppressed populations. In Latin America, which is"
		"considered an endemic area for this mycosis, there have been no published reports"
		"regarding the incidence, clinical presentation, morbidity, and mortality of"
		histoplasmosis in renal transplant patients. The objective of this study was to
		describe cases of histoplasmosis in renal transplant patients treated at the
		"Pablo Tobon Uribe Hospital (Medellin, Colombia) between 2006 and 2013. METHODS:"
		"This is a descriptive, retrospective study. RESULTS: The incidence of"
		histoplasmosis in our renal transplant population was 1.1%. The ages of the 9
		patients (4 men and 5 women) ranged between 27 and 59 years. In 2 of these
		"patients, histoplasmosis appeared during the first year after transplantation. At"
		"the time of transplantation, 66% of patients received induction with alemtuzumab;"
		88% had a prior rejection episode and required increased immunosuppressive
		medication; 88% had renal graft dysfunction with creatinine levels >1.5 mg/dL;
		and the primary clinical presentation was disseminated histoplasmosis followed by
		the pulmonary form of the disease. Diagnoses were performed by histology in 6
		"patients, blood culture in 2 patients, and antigenuria in 1 patient. Three"
		patients required treatment with amphotericin B for the severity of their
		"infection, and 2 of these patients died before receiving the cumulative dose of"
		amphotericin B. The 7 remaining patients received itraconazole for 12 months and
		"had a successful treatment response. Regarding complications, 2 patients had"
		"hemophagocytic syndrome. At the 1-year follow-up appointment, renal function"
		"remained stable in all patients, and no patients had acute rejection or required"
		"renal replacement therapy. Thus, the overall mortality rate observed was 22.2%."
		"CONCLUSIONS: In this series, histoplasmosis in renal transplant patients"
		presented as an aggressive opportunistic infection with a higher incidence than
		that previously reported in the literature. The following risk factors have been
		"associated with histoplasmosis: renal graft dysfunction, previous acute"
		"rejection, immunosuppression with tacrolimus-mycophenolate, and induction with"
		"alemtuzumab. The clinical presentation of histoplasmosis was nonspecific, which"
		"complicated disease diagnosis, and the treatment regimens were highly toxic and"
		associated with significant morbidity and mortality rates.

AB	-	Oral histoplasmosis in a 30-year-old male with no history of travel outside India
		is described. An ulcerating lesion was located on the hard palate. A chest X-ray
		"was normal. Based on physical examination, regional lymph nodes, liver and spleen"
		were not involved. The diagnosis was established by demonstrating yeast-like
		budding cells in a biopsy of the lesion and by isolating Histoplasma capsulatum
		in pure culture. The identity of the isolate was confirmed by a chemiluminescent
		DNA-probe assay and the exoantigen test. A review of the Indian literature from
		1968 to 1992 revealed the occurrence of 25 authentic cases of histoplasmosis in
		"India. In 19 cases, lesions were confined to the oral cavity confirming prior"
		observation that histoplasmosis in Indian patients tends to occur primarily in
		"extrapulmonary sites, particularly the oral cavity."

		description of one case and review of the Spanish literature.
PG	-	312-6
AB	-	We report a case of disseminated histoplasmosis in a 33-year old Ecuadorian
		patient with AIDS and a CD4 lymphocyte count of 39 cells/microl. He presented
		"with prolonged fever and cough, was diagnosed with hemophagocytic syndrome and"
		multiple organ failure and died 18 days after admission. Histoplasma capsulatum
		was isolated post-mortem from bone marrow biopsy and blood culture. In a
		literature review we found 22 published cases of disseminated histoplasmosis in
		patients with AIDS in Spain since 1988. All but two were men under 50 years old.
		Nineteen had been born or had lived in endemic areas. The diagnosis of
		histoplasmosis was established by culture of bone marrow biopsy in 10 cases.
		Itraconazole was introduced as a second drug after amphotericin B in ten of the
		thirteen patients who survived.

AB	-	"Histoplasmosis is a dimorphic fungal infection, which is rare outside endemic"
		"pockets in North, Central, and South America, Asia, and Africa. Herein, we"
		describe a woman in her 80s living in the Scottish Borders region of the United
		"Kingdom with a recent diagnosis of granulomatous rosacea, who on receiving"
		"escalating immunosuppression for suspected sarcoidosis, and long-standing"
		rheumatoid arthritis developed a striking eruption involving her eyelids along
		with painful ulceration of the oral and nasal mucosa. Histopathologic examination
		of the skin and mucosal lesions demonstrated granulomatous inflammation with
		numerous yeast forms of fungal organisms with morphological characteristics of
		Histoplasma species. This was confirmed to be H. capsulatum on fungal culture and
		direct panfungal polymerase chain reaction assay. Although the patient had not
		"left the United Kingdom for more than 20 years, she gave a travel history"
		"involving multiple trips to countries where histoplasmosis is known to occur,"
		before that. This case exemplifies the challenges involved in making a diagnosis
		of histoplasmosis in nonendemic regions for both clinicians and pathologists
		"alike. In this particular patient, the diagnostic difficulties were compounded by"
		the clinicopathological overlap with other cutaneous and systemic granulomatous
		disorders like granulomatous rosacea and suspected sarcoidosis and also the
		exceptionally long latency period between the purported historical primary
		infection and recent recrudescence. We highlight this unusual case to increase an
		"awareness of histoplasmosis, which is very rare in nonendemic regions like the"
		United Kingdom and involves cases acquired during residence in or travel to
		"endemic areas, to ensure its prompt recognition and treatment."

PG	-	1205-8
AB	-	In this study we examine the sensitivity of Histoplasma capsulatum var capsulatum
		antigen detection for the diagnosis of histoplasmosis. This was a retrospective
		review of the sensitivity of antigen detection in patients who were diagnosed as
		"having self-limited, chronic pulmonary, or disseminated histoplasmosis during an"
		"outbreak in Indianapolis, Ind. All patients had clinical and laboratory evidence"
		"of histoplasmosis, and specimens of urine or serum that were obtained from the"
		patients were tested for H capsulatum var capsulatum antigen. Of the 195 patients
		"who were studied, the following forms of the infection were found: disseminated"
		"(n = 108), self-limited (n = 70), chronic pulmonary (n = 14), and asymptomatic (n"
		"= 3). Antigen was detected in 92%, 21%, and 39% of the patients with the"
		"disseminated, chronic pulmonary, and self-limited forms of histoplasmosis,"
		respectively. Tests for the antigen are most useful in patients with clinical
		findings of disseminated infection. Antigen detection also may be useful in those
		"patients with more severe pulmonary involvement, especially during the first"
		month of illness when serologic tests for antibodies may be negative.

PG	-	236-8
LID	-	S1516-31802010000400012 [pii]
AB	-	CONTEXT: Histoplasmosis is a fungal disease caused by inhaling spores of the
		fungus Histoplasma capsulatum. The spores can be found in soil contaminated with
		"bird, bat or chicken feces. Histoplasmosis occurs worldwide and is one of the"
		most common pulmonary and systemic mycoses. CASE REPORT: We report here the case
		of a 37-year-old man with acquired immune deficiency syndrome and histoplasmosis
		"in the nasal septum, without pulmonary involvement, that evolved rapidly to"
		"disseminated infection, multiple organ failure and death."

PG	-	641-644
AB	-	Histoplasma capsulatum is an environmental fungus commonly found in the Ohio and
		"Mississippi River valleys, Central and South America, and Asia. The most affected"
		areas in Argentina are the Paraná and de La Plata river basins. Patients with
		histoplasmosis can have a wide range of clinical presentations. Most of them are
		"asymptomatic, while those with compromised cellular immunity are at increased"
		risk for the disseminated form. We present the case of a patient undergoing
		treatment with methotrexate for seronegative arthritis who developed the
		"disseminated form of the disease, and who represented a diagnostic challenge due"
		to the difficulty in identifying the etiologic agent.

PG	-	438-42
AB	-	"Between October 1998 and April 1999, 51 persons belonging to two separate groups"
		developed acute pulmonary histoplasmosis after visiting a cave in Costa Rica. The
		"first group consisted of 61 children and 14 adults from San Jose, Costa Rica; 44"
		(72%) were diagnosed with acute histoplasmosis. The second group comprised 14
		tourists from the United States and Canada; 9 (64%) were diagnosed with
		"histoplasmosis. After a median incubation time of 14 days, the most common"
		"symptoms were headache, fever, cough, and myalgias. Risk factors for developing"
		"histoplasmosis included crawling (odds ratio [OR] = 17.5, 95% confidence interval"
		"[CI] = 2.3-802) and visiting one specific room (OR = 3.4, 95% CI = 1.0-12.3) in"
		"the cave. Washing hands (OR = 0.1, 95% CI = 0.01-0.6) after exiting the cave was"
		associated with a decreased risk of developing histoplasmosis. Histoplasma
		capsulatum was isolated from bat guano collected from inside the cave. Persons
		"who explore caves, whether for recreation or science, should be aware of the risk"
		"bat-inhabited caves pose for developing histoplasmosis, especially if they are"
		immunocompromised in any way.

AB	-	"We reviewed the clinical, microbiologic, and outcome characteristics of 72"
		patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated histoplasmosis (4
		newly described) reported in Europe over 20 years (1984-2004). Seven cases (9.7%)
		"were acquired in Europe (autochthonous), whereas the majority involved a history"
		of travel or arrival from endemic areas. The diagnosis of progressive
		disseminated histoplasmosis (PDH) was made during life in 63 patients (87.5%) and
		was the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-presenting illness in 44
		"(61.1%). Disease was widespread in 66 patients (91.7%) and localized in 6 (8.3%),"
		with the skin being the most frequent site of localized infection. Overall skin
		involvement was reported in 47.2% of the patients regardless of whether
		histoplasmosis was acquired in Africa or South America. Reticulonodular or
		diffuse interstial infiltrates occurred in 52.8%. The diagnosis was made during
		"life by histopathology plus culture in 44 patients (69.8%), histopathology alone"
		"in 18 (28.5%), and culture alone in 1 (1.5%). During the induction phase"
		amphotericin B and itraconazole (74.6%) were the single most frequently used
		drugs. Both drugs were also used either in combination (10.2%) or in sequential
		therapy (11.8%). Cumulative mortality rate during the induction phase of
		"treatment was 15.2%. Overall, 37 patients died (57.8%); death occurred early in"
		the course in 18 (28.1%). Seven of 40 patients (17.5%) who responded to therapy
		subsequently relapsed. Autopsy data in 13 patients confirmed the widespread
		disseminated nature of histoplasmosis (85%) among AIDS patients with a median of
		4.5 organs involved. The results of the present report highlight the need to
		consider the diagnosis of PDH among patients with AIDS in Europe presenting with
		a febrile illness who have traveled to or who originated from an endemic area.

		Focus.
PG	-	1749-1756
LID	-	10.4269/ajtmh.17-0432 [doi]
AB	-	We describe four cases of histoplasmosis indigenous to Himachal Pradesh (India)
		that will be of considerable public health interest. A 48-year-old human
		immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative man with cervical and mediastinal
		"lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, adrenal mass, and bone marrow involvement"
		was treated as disseminated tuberculosis without benefit. Progressive
		disseminated histoplasmosis was diagnosed from the fungus in smears from adrenal
		mass. Another 37-year-old HIV-positive man was on treatment of suspected
		pulmonary tuberculosis. He developed numerous erythema nodosum leprosum-like
		"mucocutanous lesions accompanied by fever, generalized lymphadenopathy, and"
		weight loss. Pulmonary histoplasmosis with cutaneous dissemination was diagnosed
		"when skin lesions showed the fungus in smears, histopathology, and mycologic"
		culture. Both were successfully treated with amphotericin B/itraconazole. Third
		"patient, a 46-year-old HIV-negative man, had oropharyngeal lesions, cervical"
		"lymphadenopathy, intermittent fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and deteriorating"
		general health. Progressive disseminated oropharyngeal histoplasmosis was
		diagnosed from the fungus in smears and mycologic cultures from oropharyngeal
		lesions and cervical lymph node aspirates. He died despite initiating treatment
		with oral itraconazole. Another 32-year-old man 3 months after roadside trauma
		developed a large ulcer with exuberant granulation tissue over left thigh without
		evidence of immunosuppression/systemic involvement. He was treated successfully
		with surgical excision of ulcer under amphotericin B/itraconazole coverage as
		primary cutaneous histoplasmosis confirmed pathologically and mycologically. A
		clinical suspicion remains paramount for early diagnosis of histoplasmosis
		"particularly in a nonendemic area. Most importantly, with such diverse clinical"
		presentation and therapeutic outcome selection of an appropriate and customized
		treatment schedule is a discretion the treating clinicians need to make.

AB	-	"INTRODUCTION: Histoplasmosis, a fungal disorder characterized by a wide spectrum"
		of manifestations that range from subclinical infections to disseminated
		"processes, affects both immunocompetent and immunosuppressed individuals."
		"Histoplasmosis is not a reportable disease in Colombia and consequently, a survey"
		was designed to collect histoplasmosis cases diagnosed in the country. OBJECTIVE:
		The aim of this work was to analyze the data collected from 1992 to 2008.
		"Materials and methods. The survey included demographic data, risk factors,"
		"clinical manifestations, imaging data, diagnostic methods and antifungal"
		treatment. Patients were grouped according to risk factors and comparisons of the
		various findings were done. RESULTS: A total of 434 surveys were gathered from 20
		"of the country's Departments. Most patients (96.1%) were adults, 77% were males"
		with a mean age of 38.4 years. Only 3.9% were children less than 15 years of age.
		"In the adult population, AIDS was reported in 70.5% of the cases; additionally,"
		in 7.0% patients other immunosuppressive conditions were informed. The most
		"frequent clinical manifestations were fever (76.1%), cough (54.8%) and"
		constitutional symptoms (56.8%). X rays abnormalities were represented mainly by
		infiltrates (65.9%) and nodules (17.1%). Diagnosis was made by microscopic
		"observation of H. capsulatum in 49.6% patients, by culture in 58.0% and by"
		serological test in 14.6% cases. Antifungal use was recorded in 52.5% cases.
		"CONCLUSIONS: Histoplasmosis is frequent in Colombia, especially in certain risk"
		factor groups such as the HIV-infected population. Data collected from this large
		number of cases has allowed valid comparisons on various aspects of
		histoplasmosis in Colombia.

TI	-	Redefining the clinical spectrum of chronic pulmonary histoplasmosis: a
		retrospective case series of 46 patients.
PG	-	252-258
LID	-	10.1097/MD.0b013e318144b1d9 [doi]
AB	-	Chronic pulmonary histoplasmosis is a disorder caused by Histoplasma capsulatum
		infection that is classically described as cavitary disease in male smokers with
		underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This clinical
		description relies on previous studies conducted mainly on cohorts from
		tuberculosis sanatoriums and United States Department of Veterans Affairs
		hospitals. Patients in earlier series were often selected either after being
		suspected of having Mycobacteria tuberculosis or by the presence of cavitary
		disease on chest radiograph. These early studies therefore may overrepresent the
		"true proportion of males, smokers, and the percentage with cavitary disease in"
		the general population. We sought to define the clinical spectrum of chronic
		pulmonary histoplasmosis in a mixed-sex inpatient and outpatient population. We
		conducted a retrospective chart review from 1976 to 2000 on all adults with a
		diagnosis of histoplasmosis with symptoms suggestive of pulmonary histoplasmosis
		for > or =6 weeks and either significantly positive serum H. capsulatum antibody
		titers or positive cultures (without evidence of disseminated disease).
		"Participants included 46 patients, with a median age of 56 years. Notable"
		differences were found between our study population and those in previously
		"reported studies. First, nearly half of our patients were women (48%), and"
		one-quarter were life-long nonsmokers (27%). Only 39% had cavitary disease and
		only 20% had COPD. It is noteworthy that there were no positive cultures from
		those patients who had never smoked. Major differences existed between male and
		"female participants. Female patients had a lower presence of cavities, a"
		"decreased number of smokers and extent of smoking exposure, a decreased number of"
		"positive cultures, and an absence of underlying COPD. To our knowledge, this"
		study is the first to report on a large number of outpatients with chronic
		"pulmonary histoplasmosis. In contrast to previous studies, the current study"
		"included 48% female patients, 27% never smokers, and only 39% of patients with"
		"cavitary disease, representing a noticeably different spectrum of disease"
		compared to previous studies.

TI	-	Histoplasma capsulatum Infection with Extensive Lytic Bone Lesions Mimicking LCH.
PG	-	496-499
AB	-	Multiple lytic bone lesions in a child can be a manifestation of various diseases
		"like Langerhans cell histiocytosis, metastatic neuroblastoma, leukemia,"
		"hyperparathyroidism, multifocal osteomyelitis and histoplasmosis. Disseminated"
		histoplasmosis caused by Histoplasma capsulatum var. duboisii is well known to
		present with multiple osteolytic lesions in immunocompromised adults and is
		mostly restricted to the African subcontinent. Histoplasmosis seen in American
		"and Asian countries is caused by Histoplasma capsulatum var. capsulatum, which"
		presents with pulmonary and systemic manifestations and rarely bone involvement.
		"We report a case of histoplasmosis, caused by H. capsulatum var. capsulatum with"
		extensive lytic bone lesions in a 13 year old immunocompetent boy who presented
		"with prolonged fever, weight loss and multiple boggy swellings. He responded to"
		amphotericin and is currently on Itraconazole. This case is unique for extensive
		osteolytic lesions with H. capsulatum var. capsulatum infection in an
		immunocompetent child.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Histoplasma capsulatum has a worldwide distribution, but reports in"
		Europe remain rare. We present the second report of histoplasmosis in a cat in
		"Europe and, to the best of our knowledge, the first case of feline histoplasmosis"
		infection apparently limited to the skin. CASE REPORT: A 6-year-old male
		castrated outdoor cat was presented to the dermatology service with a history of
		skin lesions evolving over 1 month and consisting of multiple papules and nodules
		on the head and neck. General examination was unremarkable. Cytological
		"examination of the ulcerated nodules revealed a pyogranulomatous infiltrate, with"
		"numerous macrophages containing oval yeast-like cells, 2-5 μm in size, with a"
		"central, lightly basophilic core surrounded by a clear halo. A tentative"
		"diagnosis of fungal infection was made, and skin biopsy specimens were taken."
		"Histological examination confirmed the cytology findings, and Grocott staining"
		showed numerous organisms suggestive of Histoplasma within macrophages. Thoracic
		"radiographs, abdominal ultrasound and routine laboratory testing were"
		unremarkable. Fungal culture of a nodule was negative. PCR of total DNA extracted
		from the infected tissue and subsequent sequencing confirmed the diagnosis of H.
		"capsulatum var. capsulatum. Surgical excision of the other nodules was performed,"
		and the cat was treated with oral itraconazole 5 mg/kg once daily; 12 weeks after
		"initial consultation, no lesions were visible. No recurrence was observed during"
		an 8 month follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Histoplasmosis
		should be included in the differential diagnosis of nodular diseases of cats
		worldwide.

PG	-	193-7
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-011-9477-8 [doi]
AB	-	The present study described clinical and epidemiological aspects of three cases
		of feline histoplasmosis and compared them to previously described cases. A
		detailed mycological identification and antifungal susceptibility profile of each
		"isolate are presented. Secondarily, a serological survey for anti-Histoplasma"
		antibodies was performed with domestic and wild cats. Diseased animals presented
		nodular to ulcerated skin lesions and respiratory disorders as main clinical
		signs. H. capsulatum var. capsulatum was isolated and the strains showed to be
		susceptible to antifungal drugs. Considering that feline histoplasmosis is
		"uncommonly observed in veterinary clinics, diagnosis, and clinical management in"
		endemic areas should be improved.

PG	-	877-81
AB	-	We report factors associated with severe manifestations of histoplasmosis (such
		"as shock, respiratory failure, and death) in patients with AIDS during an"
		outbreak. Severe disease was present in 28 of 155 patients (17.9%). The following
		"factors were associated with severe disease: black race (odds ratio [OR], 2.8;"
		"95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-6.2); hemoglobin level <9.5 g/dL (OR, 2.7; 95%"
		"CI, 1.2-6.4), partial thromboplastin time >45 s (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.1-9.3);"
		"alkaline phosphatase level >2.5 times normal (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.3-8.7);"
		"aspartate aminotransferase level >2.5 times normal (OR, 4.2; 95% CI, 1.7-10.0);"
		"bilirubin level concentration >1.5 mg/dL (OR, 9.2; 95% CI, 2.5-34.3); creatinine"
		"concentration >2.1 mg/dL (OR, 8.3; 95% CI, 2.2-31.9); and albumin concentration"
		"<3.5 g/dL (OR, 4.6; 95% CI, 1.3-16.4). Zidovudine use was associated with"
		"decreased risk of severe disease (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1-0.7). Multivariate"
		"analysis showed that a creatinine value >2.1 mg/dL (OR, 9.5; 95% CI, 1.7-52) and"
		"an albumin value <3.5 g/dL (OR, 4.8; 95% CI, 1.0-22) were associated with an"
		"increased risk of severe disease, and zidovudine therapy remained associated with"
		"a decreased risk (OR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.1-0.6). Findings associated with severe"
		histoplasmosis should be recognized early and the cases managed aggressively.

		"from a National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil."
PG	-	261-267
LID	-	10.1111/myc.12877 [doi]
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Histoplasmosis is a frequent fungal infection in HIV/AIDS patients,"
		with high morbimortality rates when diagnosis and treatment are delayed. Antibody
		"detection, which is faster than the gold standard culture test, hastens the"
		laboratory investigation. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the role of WB for antibody
		detection in the diagnosis of histoplasmosis among HIV/AIDS patients. PATIENTS
		AND METHODS: Fifty patients with proven or probable histoplasmosis were included.
		"Clinical, epidemiological and laboratory data were described in the same"
		population after a review of their medical records. WB was performed using
		deglycosylated histoplasmin. RESULTS: About 82% of patients were adult males and
		the mean age was 39.3 years. CD4(+) T lymphocyte count less than 150 cells/mm(3)
		was observed in 62% patients. Antibodies against Histoplasma capsulatum M antigen
		"were detected in 62% of patients, and against both M and H antigens in 28% of"
		individuals. Sera from 10% of patients were nonreactive. Histoplasmosis was the
		first opportunistic infection in 38% of the cases. Disseminated and pulmonary
		"histoplasmosis occurred in 84% and 16% of patients, respectively. The overall"
		mortality was 16%. CONCLUSION: WB could be useful for the histoplasmosis
		diagnosis in HIV/AIDS patients because of its easefulness and good sensitivity in
		a population where antibody production is hampered.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Histoplasmosis is a systemic infection caused by the dimorphic fungus
		"Histoplasma capsulatum, naturally found in nitrogen-rich soil, whose main"
		transmission route is the inhalation of conidia. Up to 95% of histoplasmosis
		"cases are asymptomatic or transient, and the remaining 5% of cases have"
		"pathological manifestations in the lungs, bone marrow, liver, spleen, intestine,"
		"mucous membranes, and rarely on the skin. This mycosis has been reported from"
		"many endemic areas, mainly in immunosuppressed patients, such as HIV-positive"
		"patients, and its disseminated form is rarely reported. CASE REPORT: Histoplama"
		"capsulatum was isolated and identified by means of microscopy, culture"
		characteristics and nested PCR from the cutaneous lesions of a non-HIV patient
		from Vietnam. The patient improved significantly with systemic itraconazole
		treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Disseminated histoplasmosis with cutaneous involvement in
		non-HIV patients is an extremely unusual presentation.

PG	-	1445-8
AB	-	"Anemia, weight loss, lethargy, fever, anorexia, and interstitial lung disease"
		were the predominant clinical findings in 12 cats with disseminated
		histoplasmosis. Some cats were examined because of dysfunction or lesions of
		"bone, eyes, or skin. In most cases, the clinical signs were observed by the owner"
		for 4 weeks or less before seeking veterinary care. Young cats were most commonly
		"affected, with 7 of the 12 cats less than or equal to 1 year old. Identification"
		of Histoplasma organisms in bone marrow aspirates was used to confirm the
		diagnosis of histoplasmosis in 11 of the 12 cats. Histoplasma infection of
		"multiple organs was found at necropsy. In this study, disseminated histoplasmosis"
		had a higher prevalence in cats than in dogs at the same veterinary medical
		teaching hospital. Feline disseminated histoplasmosis was not associated with
		FeLV infection. Treatment was attempted in 7 of the 12 cats.

AB	-	We report a very rare case of disseminated pharyngo-laryngeal histoplasmosis with
		"systemic spread in a 10-year-old, immunocompetent child from Guyana. The main"
		"signs were a marked deterioration in his general condition, hepato-splenomegaly,"
		multiple lymphadenopathy and ulcerated pharyngo-laryngeal lesions. The diagnosis
		"was made from brushings of the ulcerative lesions, a lymph node biopsy and"
		serological tests performed in the national reference center for histoplasmosis.
		"The initial treatment was with amphotericin B, which was then replaced by oral"
		"itraconazole. We report here the main epidemiological, clinical and therapeutic"
		characteristics.

AB	-	Paracoccidiodomycosis and histoplasmosis are endemic diseases in the south of
		"Venezuela, representing a public health problem. Prevalence of Paracoccidiodes"
		"brasiliensis and Histoplasma capsulatum infections were estimated in Monte Ralo,"
		a rural community area of Bolivar state using paracoccidiodine and histoplasmine
		skin tests. Paracoccidiodine was intradermically injected to 173 persons and
		readings were made at 24 and 48 h afterwards to 167 persons (97.85%). Reaction
		was positive in 8.5% (n = 14) at 24 h post-injection and 13.2% (n = 20) at 48 h.
		Farmers showed the higher percentage of positivity at 24 and 48 h. One
		hundred-seventy five persons were intradermically injected with histoplasmine but
		167 and 157 of them attended for reading of the dermal reaction at 24 and 48 h
		post-injection respectively. Tests were positive in 25.7% (n = 43) at 24 h and
		42.7% (n = 67) at 48 h. Further studies are needed in surrounding places to
		"delimit the endemic area of these mycosis in the Bolivar state. However,"
		epidemiological vigilance of PCM and H should be considered by local health
		authorities.

AB	-	Histoplasma is endemic in North and Central America. We describe a case of
		disseminated histoplasmosis in a heart transplant recipient outside the known
		endemic areas. A 68-year-old gentleman known to have dilated cardiomyopathy. He
		underwent left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation in India and 2 years
		later did heart transplant in King Faisal Specialist and Research Center
		Hospital. Six weeks post-transplant he presented with headache and fever. All
		"investigations were negative, and he was discharged home. Four days after"
		"discharge he presented with headache, fever, blurred vision, and an episode of"
		loss of consciousness. Examination showed an ill looking patient who is highly
		febrile. Repeated work up showed pancytopenia. A repeat LP was negative. Bone
		marrow biopsy showed Small intracellular organisms. Extended work up revealed a
		"positive Histoplasma urinary antigen, positive Histoplasma PCR from the bone"
		marrow biopsy. Patient was started on Liposomal Amphotericin followed by
		Itraconazole with marker clinical improvement. This is the first reported case of
		disseminated Histoplasmosis in Saudi Arabia. We postulate that the patient had
		reactivation of a latent infection acquired at the time of LVAD insertion in
		India rather than donor derived infection by the negative fungal culture and PCR
		done on the donor's lung granuloma tissue.

TI	-	Five-year follow-up of fellow eyes of individuals with ocular histoplasmosis and
		unilateral extrafoveal or juxtafoveal choroidal neovascularization. Macular
		Photocoagulation Study Group.
PG	-	677-88
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To document the incidence of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in
		unaffected fellow eyes among individuals with ocular histoplasmosis and
		extrafoveal or juxtafoveal CNV in 1 eye; to determine whether the location and
		"type of ""histo spots"" in the macula predict the site of future CNV development in"
		second eyes; to describe changes over time in neovascular lesions present in
		fellow eyes at baseline; and to describe changes in visual acuity of fellow eyes
		"with and without CNV at baseline. DESIGN, PATIENTS, AND SETTING: Five-year"
		prospective follow-up study of fellow eyes of 516 patients enrolled in 2
		randomized clinical trials of laser photocoagulation of extrafoveal and
		"juxtafoveal CNV. Best-corrected visual acuity and reading vision were measured,"
		and both maculas were photographed at baseline and at 6-month intervals. MAIN
		OUTCOME MEASURES: Cumulative incidence of CNV in fellow eyes free of neovascular
		"maculopathy at the time of study enrollment, 5-year change in visual acuity of"
		"fellow eyes from baseline, and incidence of legal blindness (visual acuity < or ="
		20/200 in the better eye). RESULTS: Photographically documented CNV developed in
		"35 (9%) of 394 eyes initially free of neovascular maculopathy; nevertheless, good"
		visual acuity was maintained in most newly affected eyes until the end of the
		5-year follow-up period. Histo spots of any type in the macula at baseline
		tripled the risk for later development of CNV in comparison to eyes without histo
		spots in the macula. Although the type of histo spots present in the central
		"macula at baseline did not predict future CNV development, in 32 of 35 second"
		eyes in which CNV developed and in 7 of 9 fellow eyes in which a second area of
		"CNV developed during follow-up, CNV was preceded by an ""atypical"" histo spot in"
		the same location. Among 122 patients who had bilateral neovascular maculopathy
		"initially, 100 were examined 5 years later; 8 (8%) were legally blind, compared"
		with 3 (1%) of 339 patients examined who had unilateral CNV initially. At the
		"5-year examination, 355 (81%) of 439 patients examined had a visual acuity of"
		"20/20 or better in at least 1 eye, including 74 (55%) of 134 patients who had"
		bilateral neovascular maculopathy. CONCLUSIONS: Although the incidence of CNV in
		fellow eyes that initially were unaffected remained low throughout 5 years of
		"follow-up, it persisted at a nearly constant rate. The risk of legal blindness"
		"was low, even for patients who had bilateral involvement. Perhaps most important,"
		81% of all patients followed up for 5 years retained a visual acuity of 20/20 in
		"at least 1 eye, and 20% retained this visual acuity in both eyes. Retrospective"
		review of photographs suggests that the ophthalmologist should pay special
		"attention to areas of the central macula in which new ""atypical"" histo spots are"
		"observed, with the goal of treating CNV that may develop in the same area at a"
		time when the benefits of laser treatment may be greatest.

PG	-	829-38
AB	-	The authors report a case of disseminated African histoplasmosis with bone and
		joint involvement in a black 28-year-old citizen of the Central African Republic
		who presented with a 17-month history of multiple osteoarticular lesions
		"(sternoclavicular joints, humerus, ribs), cutaneous lesions (face, scalp,"
		"thorax), and lymphadenopathy. Clinical manifestations resolved rapidly under"
		treatment with ketoconazole (600 mg/d for 10 days then 400 mg/day for nine
		months). Persistent yeast cells were then found upon examination of a lymph node
		biopsy specimen. The characteristics and diagnosis of osteoarticular lesions due
		to African histoplasmosis are discussed on the basis of a review of the
		literature. Bone and joint lesions due to African histoplasmosis have not yet
		"been reported in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. However,"
		the expanding epidemic of human immunodeficiency virus infection in Africa can be
		expected to result in an increase in the incidence of African histoplasmosis.
		Imidazole derivatives are easier to use on a long-term basis than amphotericin B
		and have significantly improved our ability to treat African histoplasmosis.

AB	-	PURPOSE: To report on a case of Histoplasma capsulatum endogenous endophthalmitis
		in an immunocompetent patient. METHODS: A 30-year-old patient was admitted with
		floaters and vision impairment of 1 month's duration. He had a history of adrenal
		"insufficiency, together with nasal, septum, and soft palate lesions of 3 months;"
		duration. Culture results from specimens of these lesions were positive for H
		capsulatum. He was human immunodeficiency virus negative and there was no
		evidence of immunodepression or history of immunosuppression. Fundus examination
		"revealed multiple fluffy balls with a string of pearls appearance, 2+ vitreous"
		"haze, multiple foci of retinochoroiditis inferiorly in the peripheral retina, and"
		a 6-disk area lesion of retinochoroiditis at the superotemporal periphery. Due to
		"poor response to oral itraconazole, a vitrectomy was performed with an"
		intraocular injection of amphotericin B 5 μg/0.1 mL and removal for a vitreous
		specimen for culture of bacteria and fungi. RESULTS: Vitreous specimen culture of
		"the yeast at 28°C grew a white filamentous fungus colony, which was again"
		"cultured in a brain heart infusion agar medium, where it developed hyaline"
		"septate hyphae with microconidia and circular macroconidia with double wall,"
		which was stained with a lactophenol dye at microscopic examination. The
		macroscopic morphology was consistent with H capsulatum. CONCLUSIONS: Although
		"endogenous H capsulatum endophthalmitis is a rare entity, it should be considered"
		"as a possible etiology even in apparently immunocompetent hosts, especially in"
		patients with history of disseminated disease.

PG	-	451-5
LID	-	10.1111/ijd.12683 [doi]
AB	-	"OBJECTIVES: African histoplasmosis, caused by Histoplasma capsulatum var."
		"duboisii, is an invasive fungal infection endemic in Central and West Africa."
		Cases seen outside Africa are generally imported. We report a disseminated purely
		"cutaneous form of this infection in an otherwise healthy person from Kerala, in"
		"southern India. METHODS: A 59-year-old farmer presented with asymptomatic,"
		"generalized, reddish skin lesions of five months in duration. Dermatologic"
		"examination revealed multiple erythematous papules and plaques of varying sizes,"
		predominantly over the trunk and upper limbs. The patient was otherwise in good
		health. Systemic examination including the pulmonary and musculoskeletal systems
		revealed no abnormalities. RESULTS: Skin biopsy was performed from a lesion on
		the thigh. Histopathologic examination revealed epithelioid and suppurative
		"granulomas in the upper dermis, with lymphocytes, neutrophils, and plenty of"
		giant cells. Fite-Faraco staining for Mycobacterium leprae was negative. Fungus
		"cultured from the specimen was identified as H. capsulatum var. duboisii, the"
		rarer variant of H. capsulatum. The patient was treated with ketoconazole
		200 mg/day for four months and attained complete clearance. No relapse has been
		"detected over two years of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge,"
		this case represents the first instance of African histoplasmosis to be reported
		from India. The occurrence of such a rare infection in an immunocompetent
		"individual, who had not travelled elsewhere, raises the possibility of the"
		indigenous existence of H. capsulatum var. duboisii in Kerala. Further studies of
		the ecology and epidemiology of this rare infection are essential.

PG	-	410-6
AB	-	We report four cases of cerebral histoplasmosis and discuss features of six
		"additional cases reported in the medical literature in the past 10 years, when"
		azoles have been available for therapy. Most patients with this disease are
		immunocompromised or have a history that suggests heavy exposure to Histoplasma
		capsulatum. Fever and other clinical findings of systemic toxicity caused by
		disseminated histoplasmosis may be absent; 5 of 10 patients did not manifest
		these findings. Although the mainstay of treatment for central nervous system
		"histoplasmosis remains amphotericin B, 9 of the 10 patients received itraconazole"
		or fluconazole either as initial therapy or after a course of treatment with
		amphotericin B.

		with high prevalence of sarcoidosis.
PG	-	358-62
LID	-	10.1097/MAJ.0b013e31827b9b6d [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: We explored the role of dual time point fluorodeoxyglucose positron
		emission tomography/computed tomography (DTP PET/CT) scan in the differentiation
		of benign and malignant lung and mediastinal lesions. METHODS: We studied a
		sample of 72 consecutive patients who underwent DTP PET/CT scan for intrathoracic
		"lesions. Information on demographics, initial and delayed maximum standardized"
		uptake values (SUVmax) of lesions and final diagnosis were collected. Clinical
		criteria to diagnose benign lesions were defined as stability or regression of
		"the lesion on follow-up after 2 years of initial detection. Sensitivity,"
		"specificity, predictive values and likelihood ratio and retention index were"
		calculated using standard methods. RESULTS: Sixty-three (87%) patients had
		increased SUVmax in delayed scan (1 hour after initial scan). Among the patients
		"with increased delayed uptake, 51 (80%) had malignant lesion and 12 (20%) had"
		nonmalignant lesions. All 9 patients whose SUVmax decreased on delayed scan had
		nonmalignant lesions. The increased SUV on delayed scan was 100% sensitive in
		diagnosis of cancer but was only 42% specific. The positive predictive value was
		"80%, whereas the negative predictive value was 100%. Likelihood ratio for"
		positive test was 1.75. CONCLUSIONS: All the lesions with decreased SUVmax in
		delayed PET scan were nonmalignant. This was true for both lung and mediastinal
		lesions. This could be a very helpful diagnostic finding in areas with high
		prevalence of benign conditions such as histoplasmosis and sarcoidosis. Multiple
		invasive diagnostic modalities could be prevented in a significant percentage of
		"patients, with attendant decrease in morbidity and health care costs."

		(PA) is a rare cause of PH and may give the clinician cause to investigate

		of PA stenosis in a patient with prior histoplasmosis scheduled for left PA
		"stenting. However, because the pulmonary veins were not well-visualized on chest"
		"computed tomography, the anesthesia team performed a perioperative"
		transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to help differentiate the causes of PH. TEE
		revealed external compression of the pulmonary veins. This case highlights the
		"value of pathophysiologic understanding, preoperative planning, and the effect of"
		"echocardiography on clinical management and patient safety. In this case, TEE"
		prevented possible morbidity and mortality.

PG	-	577-80
AB	-	PURPOSE: To report some cases of ocular histoplasmosis-like syndrome from a
		nonendemic area. DESIGN: Observational case series. METHODS: This is a
		prospective study of 16 eyes from 8 immunocompetent patients evaluated between
		January 2001 to September 2005. Six patients were female and 2 male aged between
		"20 to 44 years, average 28 years. All patients presented clinical features that"
		resembled ocular histoplasmosis. All patients had a negative antibody test for
		"histoplasmosis and negative medical and laboratory evaluation of toxoplasmosis,"
		"syphilis, and tuberculosis. All patients were submitted to a complete ocular"
		examination including fluorescein angiography. One patient was submitted to
		indocyanine green angiography. RESULTS: Five patients presented the classical
		"triad of clinical features that include peripapillary scarring, histo spots,"
		"choroidal neovascularization, one patient presented enlargement of atrophic"
		"chorioretina scar, one patient presented multiple retinal pigment epithelial"
		"detachment, one, neovascularized retinal pigment epithelial detachment. Another"
		patient presented only histo spots. CONCLUSION: These findings of ocular
		histoplasmosis-like syndrome in patients with negative antibody serum test from a
		nonendemic area suggest that other agents could cause these similar fundus
		findings of ocular histoplasmosis.

AB	-	Twenty-two cases of feline histoplasmosis seen at the Virginia-Maryland Regional

		"reviewed. The median age of affected cats was 9 yr (mean, 8.8 yr). Female"
		domestic shorthairs were more commonly affected. The clinical presentation of
		most cases was nonspecific. The most common presenting complaints included
		"weakness, lymphadenopathy, weight loss, and anorexia. Less frequent clinical"
		"signs included vomiting, diarrhea, blindness, and lameness. Less than half of the"
		cats had clinical evidence of pulmonary disease on admission. Anemia and
		hypoalbuminemia were common laboratory abnormalities. An interstitial pattern was
		the most common radiographic pattern observed with pulmonary disease. Diagnosis
		was based on identification of the organism on cytology or histopathology.
		"Fifteen of the 22 cats were treated, and itraconazole was the most common"
		antifungal agent prescribed. Median duration of the antifungal treatment was 5 mo
		for cats that survived to discharge. Overall survival at time of discharge for
		cats in this study was 55%.

TI	-	Clinical manifestation of mediastinal fibrosis and histoplasmosis.
PG	-	1053-7; discussion 1057-8
AB	-	We treated 20 patients thought to have mediastinal fibrosis secondary to
		Histoplasma capsulatum. All but 1 were symptomatic. The most common symptoms were
		"dyspnea (8), hemoptysis (6), postobstructive pneumonia (5), and superior vena"
		"caval obstruction (2). Nine patients had severe stenosis of the trachea, carina,"
		or main bronchus. Special stains identified Histoplasma capsulatum in surgical
		specimens in 9 patients. Surgical procedures were done for 18 of 20 patients
		"(resection of subcarinal mass, 6; right middle and lower lobectomy, 5; carinal"
		"pneumonectomy, 4; esophagoplasty, 4; sleeve resection, 3 (with right main"
		"bronchus in 1, right lower and middle lobectomy in 1, and carina in 1); right"
		"upper lobectomy, 1; middle lobectomy, 1; and bronchoplasty of left main bronchus,"
		"1. There were 4 deaths, 3 after complications of carinal pneumonectomy and 1 in a"
		patient with tracheobronchial obstruction that could not be dilated. Two patients
		were treated with amphotericin and 4 with ketoconazole. Sclerosing mediastinitis
		secondary to histoplasmosis presents tremendous surgical challenges because of
		the intense fibrosis encountered. Bronchoplastic procedures are possible in spite
		of the intense fibrosis. High mortality rates after carinal resection may be
		encountered. The exact role of antifungal therapy is as yet undefined.

TI	-	Risk of visual impairment attributable to ocular histoplasmosis. Washington
		County Follow-up Eye Study Group.
PG	-	655-66
AB	-	PURPOSE: To compare 15-year incidence rates of visual impairment and
		vision-threatening conditions between cases with ocular histoplasmosis and
		controls residing in the same endemic community. METHODS: Controls and cases with
		and without disciform lesions who were between 30 and 69 years of age when
		"selected, interviewed, and examined in 1970 were reinterviewed and reexamined in"
		"1985. RESULTS: Of the 252 cases and controls examined in 1970, 216 were still"
		"alive in 1985. Of these, 202 (94%) were interviewed; 197 (91%) underwent visual"
		acuity measurement; and 173 (80%) were examined by a study ophthalmologist. Both
		"in 1970 and in 1985, cases with disciform macular lesions of ocular"
		histoplasmosis had a higher prevalence of both unilateral and bilateral visual
		impairment and blindness. Although prevalence of visual impairment and blindness
		in 1985 was similar among controls and cases of ocular histoplasmosis without
		"disciform lesions, this group of cases had about twice the incidence of visual"
		"impairment as that of controls. However, the 95% confidence intervals on"
		estimates of relative risks were broad and included unity. No new disciform
		lesions attributable to ocular histoplasmosis were found in 28 eyes of 18 cases
		free of them in 1970 or among 148 controls. CONCLUSIONS: The 15-year risk of
		visual impairment and blindness appears to be somewhat higher among adults aged
		30 years and older who have only peripheral atrophic scars characteristic of
		ocular histoplasmosis than among individuals without such scars who live in the
		same endemic community. Adults who already have a disciform lesion attributed to
		ocular histoplasmosis in one eye are at low risk of development of a disciform
		lesion in the fellow eye later in life.

AB	-	Histoplasmosis is a systemic mycosis caused by the dimorphous fungus Histoplasma
		capsulatum (H. capsulatum). The fungus enters the body through the respiratory
		"tract in the form of microconidia, which are transformed into intracellular"
		yeast-like structures in the lungs before disseminating hematogenously. Primary
		infection is usually asymptomatic and self-resolving. Some patients develop
		severe disease with acute or chronic respiratory involvement. Immunosuppressed
		"patients, mainly those with altered cellular immunity, may have disseminated"
		"disease with variable mucocutaneous involvement characterized by papules,"
		"nodules, gummas, or ulcers with a granulomatous base. We report the case of 3"
		HIV-negative patients infected by H capsulatum in whom diagnosis based on the
		skin lesions proved essential for early initiation of treatment.

LID	-	10.1177/1040638713479604 [doi]
AB	-	A 12-year-old intact male Miniature Schnauzer dog with chronic diarrhea that was
		unresponsive to empirical treatment was presented to a referring veterinarian. A
		"laparotomy was performed, and formalin-fixed biopsies of duodenum, jejunum, and"
		colon were sent to Oklahoma Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory for evaluation.
		"Histologic examination revealed a severe, diffuse, granulomatous enteritis and"
		colitis with intralesional yeast and hyphal forms. Grocott methenamine silver
		"stains revealed short, aseptate hyphae co-mingled with 2-8 µm, oval to round"
		yeast organisms consistent with Histoplasma capsulatum. The atypical presentation
		of both yeast and hyphal forms prompted identification of the organism. Direct
		sequencing of a polymerase chain reaction product from paraffin-embedded
		intestinal samples confirmed the presence of Ajellomyces capsulatus with a
		homology over 99% to several sequences in GenBank. Ajellomyces capsulatus is the
		"holomorphic name for H. capsulatum. Therefore, the mycelial form of a dimorphic"
		fungus such as H. capsulatum can coexist with yeast cells within lesions of
		"histoplasmosis. Following diagnosis, the dog was treated with itraconazole for 6"
		months and has improved.

AB	-	We report an imported case of Histoplasma capsulatum var. duboisii (H. duboisii)
		"infection in a white French woman revealed by cutaneous lesions of the scalp, 18"
		years after her last stay in West and Central Africa. Asymptomatic bilateral
		pulmonary infiltrates were discovered on thoracic computed tomography. Skin
		biopsy allowed the positive diagnosis showing the typical yeasts; culture of
		biopsy specimens was positive for H. capsulatum. In the absence of criteria of
		"severity, the patient was treated for one year with oral itraconazole 400mg/day."
		"The outcome was favourable, skin and pulmonary lesions resolved slowly. The"
		follow up is 5 years without relapse after the end of treatment. This case
		"illustrates the possibility of late occurrence of H. duboisii infection, many"
		years after exposure and the major importance of asking any patient for
		travelling or residency in tropical countries.

AB	-	Histoplasmosis is a fungal disease that affects humans and is caused by
		"Histoplasma capsulatum. The presentation of the infection may be acute, chronic,"
		or disseminated. The disseminated form has extrapulmonary manifestations which
		may include oral manifestations. A patient with AIDS sought treatment and he had
		disseminated histoplasmosis with oral manifestations. The purpose of this case
		report and literature review is to emphasize the role the dental team has in the
		diagnosis of disseminated disease when a patient presents with oral
		manifestations associated with the disease. This case report is clinically
		relevant because it is not uncommon for oral manifestations to be one of the
		first signs of systemic disease.

AB	-	Histoplasmosis is a relatively rare infectious disease endemic to certain
		"geographic areas such as East Africa, eastern and central United States, western"
		"Mexico, Central and South America. Disseminated histoplasmosis has been reported"
		mainly in immunocompromised hosts and in AIDS patients. In this paper we report
		on a fatal case of undiagnosed disseminated histoplasmosis presenting as fever of
		"unknown origin (FUO) in a 43-year-old Italian woman who, although splenectomized"
		"5years earlier due to a motor vehicle accident, was otherwise immunocompetent."
		"This case report highlights the fact that, even in Europe, histoplasmosis is an"
		emerging sporadic infection which needs be considered in the differential
		diagnosis of given clinical scenarios. The proposed case is of blatant forensic
		concern as it addresses the hypothesis of professional responsibility due to a
		"missed diagnosis of histoplasmosis. A timely diagnosis, with appropriate"
		"therapies, could have prevented death. The role of the forensic pathologist is"
		also crucial because the post-mortem diagnosis of histoplasmosis (never
		considered in the differential diagnosis during prior hospitalization) highlights
		the importance of a meticulous and thorough autopsy to elucidate the cause of
		death.

AB	-	Mycotic immunodiagnosis was performed in 325 patients with clinical evidence of
		"systemic mycoses, over a 5-year period, from different hospitals of Mexico City."
		Results showed 168 individuals that presented one positive serological test to
		"Histoplasma capsulatum antigens. From these, only 27 patients were serologically"
		"positive to two or more tests, such as tube precipitin, immunodiffusion,"
		"complement fixation, and ELISA, and developed signs and symptoms of a"
		histoplasmosis clinically classified as primary pulmonary. Four of them presented
		an underlying disease including one positive HIV patient. Twenty-two came from
		endemic histoplasmosis zones of the country and most of them acquired the disease
		in caves or uninhabited houses. The diagnosis of histoplasmosis should be based
		on reliable laboratory data which could raise more significant information of its
		incidence in Mexico.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Histoplasmosis is a rare infectious condition with mainly pulmonary
		involvement. Disseminated histoplasmosis may occur in immunocompromised
		condition. It can present in different ways but jaundice and ascites is very
		uncommon. CASE PRESENTATION: A 8- year old girl visited to department of
		"pediatric gastroenterology & nutrition, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical"
		"University, Dhaka, Bangladesh. Child presented with fever, jaundice and abdominal"
		distension for 2 ½ months. There was no history of contact with tuberculosis
		"patient and travelling to kala-azar, malaria endemic zone and no history of"
		"previous jaundice, blood or blood product transfusion, history of sib death,"
		"family history of jaundice or neuropsychiatric disorder, significant weight loss."
		"On general examination she was fretful, febrile, moderately icteric, mildly pale,"
		"vitally stable, severely wasted and moderately stunted, skin survey revealed"
		"infected scabies, BCG vaccine mark was absent, generalized lymphadenopathy,"
		"hepato-splenomegaly and ascites present. After evaluating the physical findings,"
		"several investigations was done including lymphnode biopsy, then the case was"
		finally diagnosed as Disseminated histoplasmosis with portal hypertension. Child
		was treated with injectable Deoxycholate Amphotericin B for 28 days and improved
		"on follow up. CONCLUSION: We suggest that children presenting with fever,"
		"jaundice, lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly and portal hypertension,"
		disseminated histoplasmosis can be one differential.

AB	-	"OBJECTIVES: Histoplasma capsulatum is a prevalent dimorphic fungus, reaching an"
		exposure rate of 90% in endemic areas such as the Midwest and Central United
		States. We report an unusual presentation of dysphonia due to right vocal cord
		paralysis caused by mediastinal lymphadenopathy from histoplasmosis. METHODS: A
		73-year-old male presented to an otolaryngology clinic with 4 months of
		hoarseness. Flexible strobolaryngoscopy demonstrated right vocal cord paralysis
		in lateral position and a full length glottic gap. Computerized tomography (CT)
		scan showed enlargement of a right paratracheal node. RESULTS: A lymph node
		biopsy was obtained and showed histoplasmosis. He was treated with a 3-month
		course of pozaconazole. He then received a vocal cord medialization injection
		"2 months after symptom onset, which produced favorable improvement of his"
		symptoms at 8-month follow up. CONCLUSIONS: One other case report in the
		literature has reported left vocal cord paralysis related to histoplasmosis. This
		first case of right vocal cord paralysis was extremely unusual and is not often
		included in the differential diagnosis of vocal cord paralysis.

TI	-	Histoplasmosis of the larynx.
PG	-	206-9
AB	-	Granulomatous diseases caused by infectious agents are being seen more frequently
		than before. Infection with Histoplasma capsulatum is one such granulomatous
		"disease. This condition may have protean manifestations, with involvement of the"
		larynx of particular interest to the Otolaryngologist. Histoplasmosis of the
		larynx may present difficult diagnostic problems and may closely mimic carcinoma.
		A case of histoplasmosis of the larynx treated at the University of Cincinnati
		Medical Center is presented and used to highlight the mode of presentation and
		the management of this particular disease. The clinical presentation of
		histoplasmosis is discussed with emphasis on involvement of the upper
		aerodigestive tract. The diagnostic tests of practical value are outlined.
		Amphotericin B is the treatment for this disease entity.

TI	-	Evaluation of a western blot test in an outbreak of acute pulmonary
		histoplasmosis.
PG	-	20-3
AB	-	A western blot (WB) test was evaluated for detection of antibodies against native
		glycosylated and chemically deglycosylated M and H antigens of Histoplasma
		capsulatum in serum obtained from patients during the acute phase of pulmonary
		histoplasmosis that occurred during an outbreak. Of 275 serum samples tested by
		immunodiffusion and complement fixation (CF) samples from 40 patients affected
		during this outbreak and from 37 negative controls were tested by WB test. A
		group of patients whose sera were negative for CF antibodies and precipitins
		early in the acute stage of histoplasmosis but who all seroconverted during
		convalescence 6 weeks later were tested with the WB test. Antibodies against
		untreated H and M antigens were detected at a 1:100 dilution by WB test in 45% of
		the 20 acute-phase serum samples and in all 20 of the convalescent-phase
		specimens. The WB test's sensitivity for acute-phase specimens increased to 90%
		(18 of 20 specimens) when H and M antigens were treated by periodate oxidation to
		inactivate susceptible carbohydrate epitopes. When native glycosylated antigens
		"were used in the WB test, positive reactions were observed in negative control"
		serum specimens (3 of 37 specimens; 8%) and in serum specimens obtained from
		asymptomatic persons screened as part of the outbreak investigation (13 of 20
		specimens; 65%). These positive reactions were also attributed to glycosidic
		epitopes since the specificity of the WB test increased from 78 to 100% when
		periodate-treated H and M antigens were used. WB test with deglycosylated H and M
		"antigens of histoplasmin provides a rapid, sensitive, and specific test to"
		diagnose acute pulmonary histoplasmosis before precipitins can be detected.

		CHOROIDAL NEOVASCULARIZATION SECONDARY TO OCULAR HISTOPLASMOSIS: Ten-Year
		Follow-Up.
PG	-	1568-1573
LID	-	10.1097/IAE.0000000000003488 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: To assess the long-term efficacy of intravitreal antivascular
		"endothelial growth factor injections (IVI), alone or in combination with"
		"verteporfin photodynamic therapy (IVI/PDT), for management of choroidal"
		neovascularization secondary to presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome (POHS).
		"METHODS: Retrospective, comparative, interventional case series analyzing 82 eyes"
		in 74 patients treated with either IVI or IVI/PDT for presumed ocular
		histoplasmosis syndrome choroidal neovascularization from January 2006 to January
		2021. RESULTS: The average logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution VA in
		"year 5 was 0.40 (20/50) and 0.52 (20/67) for IVI versus IVI/PDT groups,"
		"respectively ( P = 0.33), and in year 10 was 0.53 (20/58) and 0.64 (20/86),"
		respectively ( P = 0.50). The average number of annual injections over the first
		"5 years of follow-up was 3.3 versus 1.7 for IVI versus IVI/PDT groups,"
		"respectively ( P < 0.001), and over 10 years was 3.3 versus 1.6, respectively ( P"
		< 0.001). Treatment-free interval of 5 years was reached by 39% versus 60% in IVI
		"versus IVI/PDT groups, respectively ( P = 0.95). CONCLUSION: Our study found both"
		IVI and IVI/PDT to be effective in long-term management of presumed ocular
		"histoplasmosis syndrome choroidal neovascularization, with a fewer number of"
		annual injections and longer treatment-free interval in the combination group.
		"However, given the limitations of a retrospective study, a prospective randomized"
		study is necessary to determine whether the addition of PDT significantly
		decreases treatment burden.

AB	-	A wild badger (Meles meles) with a severe nodular dermatitis was presented for
		post mortem examination. Numerous cutaneous granulomas with superficial
		"ulceration were present especially on head, dorsum, and forearms were found at"
		necropsy. Histopathological examination of the skin revealed a severe
		granulomatous dermatitis with abundant intralesional round to spherical
		"yeast-like cells, 2-5 μm in diameter, altogether consistent with the clinical"
		appearance of histoplasmosis farciminosi. The structures stained positively with
		"Grocott's methenamine silver and Periodic acid-Schiff stains, but attempts to"
		isolate the etiologic agent at 25 and 37°C failed. DNA was directly extracted
		from tissue samples and the ribosomal genes ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 were partially
		"sequenced. This revealed 99% identity to sequences from Ajellomyces capsulatus,"
		"the teleomorph of Histoplasma capsulatum, which was derived from a human case in"
		"Japan, as well as from horses from Egypt and Poland. Phylogenetic multi-locus"
		sequence analysis demonstrated that the fungus in our case belonged to the
		Eurasian clade which contains members of former varieties H. capsulatum var.
		"capsulatum, H. capsulatum var. farciminosum. This is the first study of molecular"
		"and phylogenetic aspects of H. capsulatum, as well as evidence for histoplasmosis"
		"farciminosi in a badger, further illuminating the role of this rare pathogen in"
		Central Europe.

TI	-	Infectious causes of carpal tunnel syndrome: case report and review.
PG	-	911-7
AB	-	A case of carpal tunnel syndrome caused by Histoplasma capsulatum is presented
		and the medical literature is reviewed for cases of carpal tunnel syndrome that
		resulted from infection. Over 100 cases of carpal tunnel syndrome secondary to
		"fungal, bacterial, mycobacterial, viral, and parasitic infections are reviewed."
		"In most of these cases, infectious causes of the syndrome were not suspected; the"
		etiology was often determined incidentally at surgery. Although infection is not
		"a common cause of carpal tunnel syndrome, it should be considered in patients"
		with persistent or recurrent symptoms. For those patients who require surgical
		"exploration or carpal tunnel release, specimens should be submitted for"
		histopathologic evaluation and culture. Most patients respond well to appropriate
		chemotherapy or surgery plus chemotherapy.

TI	-	"Outbreak of histoplasmosis among employees in a paper factory--Michigan, 1993."
PG	-	1220-3
AB	-	"In December 1993, four reported cases of histoplasmosis among employees in a"
		Michigan pulp paper factory prompted an investigation. A cohort of employees was
		surveyed to identify additional cases. A case of acute histoplasmosis was defined
		as an influenza-like illness in a plant employee with the onset of illness during
		October or November 1993 and laboratory evidence of recent infection with
		"Histoplasma capsulatum. Among the 96 employees surveyed, 18 persons met the case"
		definition; all of these had illness onset during the last week of October in
		1993. The attack rate among maintenance employees (16 of 53 [30%]) was much
		greater than that among nonmaintenance employees (2 of 43 [5%]) (relative risk =
		"6.5; 95% confidence interval = 1.6 to 26.7; P = 0.003). On October 22, a dry,"
		"windy day, one maintenance worker swept bird guano, approximately 10 cm deep,"
		from an adjacent roof < 20 m from the maintenance building. The disturbance of
		the bird guano was the likely event which caused this outbreak. H. capsulatum
		remains an important pathogen among immunocompetent hosts. We recommended that
		the plant authorities (i) discourage birds from roosting at the facility and (ii)
		use safe procedures for the cleanup and disposal of soil contaminated with bird
		droppings.

PG	-	687-690
LID	-	10.1007/s15010-017-0989-0 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: The prevalence of the Histoplasma capsulatum var. capsulatum (Hcc)
		"histoplasmosis may be underestimated West Africa, both because the diagnosis is"
		not mentioned in the early stages of the disease and due to limited biological
		resources available. CASE REPORT: We report a case of disseminated histoplasmosis
		due to Hcc in a Senegalese HIV patient. The diagnosis was suspected following the
		demonstration of small encapsulated yeasts within neutrophils on a thin blood
		smear. It was further confirmed using a specific real-time PCR applied on a DNA
		specimen extracted from the thin blood smear. CONCLUSION: To the best of our
		"knowledge, this is the first case of Hcc infection diagnosed in Senegal. Blood"
		smear may be a valuable screening tool in the case of bloodstream dissemination
		and can be used for further molecular approaches to confirm the diagnosis.

PG	-	1110-1118
LID	-	10.1177/1098612X16662310 [doi]
AB	-	Case series summary This case series describes the clinical utility of antigen
		testing for the diagnosis of feline ocular histoplasmosis. Four cats with
		suspected (n = 2) or confirmed (n = 2) ocular histoplasmosis are described: three
		"from Oklahoma and one from California. In one case, serial urine antigen tests,"
		"as well as a serum antigen test for Histoplasma capsulatum, were negative;"
		"however, light microscopy identified microorganisms consistent with H capsulatum"
		in ocular tissues at necropsy. In a further two cats with recurrent ocular
		"histoplasmosis following long-term systemic antifungal therapy, Histoplasma"
		"species urine antigen concentrations were negative, but both cats improved"
		clinically following systemic antifungal therapy and remained in apparent
		clinical remission after treatment cessation (9-16 months). The final cat
		"displayed profound bilateral endophthalmitis; however, Histoplasma species"
		antigen testing of vitreous humor and subretinal fluid from the left eye was
		"negative. Intralesional organisms were detected on histopathology of both eyes,"
		and H capsulatum was subsequently isolated and sequenced from tissue of one eye.
		Relevance and novel information These cases highlight the potential difficulty in
		definitively diagnosing ocular histoplasmosis in cats when conducting antigen
		"testing of serum, urine and even ocular fluids. Although antigen testing has"
		"previously proven useful in the diagnosis of disseminated feline histoplasmosis,"
		it may not be adequate in cats with only ocular signs.

AB	-	We conducted a multicenter case-control study to identify risk factors for
		histoplasmosis among persons with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and
		to evaluate predictors of a poor outcome (defined as death or admission to the
		"intensive care unit). Patients with histoplasmosis were each matched by age, sex,"
		"and CD4 lymphocyte count to 3 controls. From 1996 through 1999, 92 case patients"
		"and 252 controls were enrolled. Of the case patients, 81 (89%) were men, 50 (55%)"
		"were black, 78 (85%) had a CD4 lymphocyte count of <100 cells/microL, 80 (87%)"
		"were hospitalized, and 11 (12%) died. Multivariable analysis found that receipt"
		of antiretroviral therapy and of triazole drugs were independently associated
		with a decreased risk of histoplasmosis. Chronic medical conditions and a history
		of infections with herpes simplex virus were associated with poor outcome.
		"Triazoles should be considered for chemoprophylaxis for persons with AIDS,"
		especially those who take part in high-risk activities that involve frequent
		"exposure to soil, who have CD4 lymphocyte counts of <100 cells/microL, and who"
		live in areas where histoplasmosis is endemic.

AB	-	Endemic deep fungal infections are still under recognised diseases in daily
		medical practice because of their rarity in sub-Saharan area. The African
		histoplasmosis Histoplasma capsulatum var. duboisii (H. capsulatum duboisii) is
		the most frequent variety described in Mali through limited studies in adult
		"patients, since the first case described by Catanei and Kervran (1945). Our case"
		report is a disseminated histoplasmosis in a young 6-year-old african child. He
		"was male and rural. The infectious localisations were mucosae, skin, lymphnodes,"
		urinary tract and bones. Evolution has been marred by an episode of worsening of
		symptoms despite initial clinical improvement with ketoconazole. After healing of
		"mucocutaneous lesions, we noticed a limitation of ampliation of both wrists. The"
		radiographic bone lesions were lysis of the right lower end of the right radius
		and cubitus and fragmentation of cubital epiphysis of the same arm. Lacunes were
		present on the fifth right finger in metatarsus and phalanx; lacune and blowing
		aspect of the second phalanx of the left third finger was noted. The disseminated
		form of African histoplasmosis may occur in HIV-negative subject. The prognosis
		depends on early diagnosis and administration of appropriate and well-conducted
		therapy.

TI	-	Adrenal histoplasmosis: clinical presentation and imaging features in nine cases.
PG	-	703-8
AB	-	BACKGROUND: We describe a retrospective analysis of the clinical presentation and
		imaging features in nine patients with adrenal histoplasmosis in
		"nonimmunocompromised patients from a nonendemic region. METHODS: Clinically, a"
		tuberculosis-like presentation in four patients and a tumor-like presentation in
		five patients were seen. All patients were seronegative for the human
		"immunodeficiency virus. Ultrasound (US) in all patients, computed tomography (CT)"
		"in six, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in three showed suprarenal masses."
		CT-guided (in five) and US-guided (in four) biopsy and fine-needle aspiration
		cytology established a definite diagnosis. The work-up for malignancy and
		"tuberculosis was negative. RESULTS: On cross-sectional imaging, eight patients"
		had bilateral adrenal masses and one had a unilateral adrenal mass. Imaging
		"features were variable. All adrenal masses were hypoechoic on US, homogeneous in"
		"five, and heterogeneous in four patients. All adrenal masses were hypodense on"
		"CT, homogeneous in four, and heterogeneous in two. Heterogeneous enhancement was"
		"seen in three, homogeneous enhancement in two, and no enhancement in one patient."
		MRI in three patients showed that the masses were of variable signal intensity on
		all pulse sequences. CONCLUSION: Our case series showed that adrenal
		histoplasmosis does occur in immunocompetent persons living in areas not endemic
		for the disease. The imaging features were variable.

AB	-	Disseminated histoplasmosis (DH) is a systemic granulomatous disease caused by
		the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum. This disease occurs mainly in
		immunocompromised individuals with CD 4 counts less than 200 cell/µL and is
		"rarely noted in immunocompetent person. In India, this disease has been reported"
		from several parts of the country of which most cases are from eastern India
		which is considered to be endemic for this disease. Inhalation of the spores can
		lead to a self-limiting flulike illness in immunocompetent hosts. The most common
		"organs involved are liver, spleen, bone marrow, lymphoreticular system, and"
		gastrointestinal tract. Cutaneous manifestations of histoplasmosis are rare and
		are seen predominantly in persons with advanced human immunodeficiency virus
		(HIV) infections. We present a case of DH with generalized cutaneous lesions in a
		non-HIV infected adult which posed a diagnostic challenge to our clinical
		colleagues.

AB	-	"Histoplasmosis is a common endemic mycosis in North, Central, and South America,"
		but Korea is not known as an endemic area. We treated an immunocompetent Korean
		patient who had histoplasmosis. A 65-year-old Korean man presented with multiple
		pulmonary clumps of tiny nodules in the both lungs. He had been diagnosed 40
		years earlier with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and a fungus ball had been
		diagnosed 4 years earlier. He denied any history of overseas travel. The patient
		"visited our hospital with dyspnea, blood-tinged sputum, and weight loss, which"
		had appeared 2 months earlier. The patient underwent video-assisted thoracic
		surgery (VATS) lung biopsy. The biopsy sample showed necrotizing granuloma and
		the presence of multiple small yeast-like fungi. Tissue culture confirmed
		"Histoplasma capsulatum, and he was finally diagnosed with pulmonary"
		histoplasmosis. Therapy was initiated with 200 mg itraconazole orally once per
		day. The symptoms disappeared 1 week after the start of treatment. After 4
		"months, low-dose chest computed tomography showed improvement in the ground glass"
		"opacity and size of the lung lesions. In conclusion, we report a case of an"
		immunocompetent patient who developed histoplasmosis in Korea. When a patient
		"shows unexplainable progressive infiltrative lung lesions, histoplasmosis should"
		be considered as one of differential diagnoses although Korea is not an endemic
		area.

PG	-	468-70
AB	-	To determine whether the initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy
		"(HAART) had any influence on the incidence of disseminated histoplasmosis, a"
		retrospective cohort study was performed on 1551 patients followed for up to 12
		"years. After controlling for CD4 counts, age, and sex, patients taking HAART for"
		2 months or less were more likely to develop disseminated histoplasmosis than
		"untreated patients (respectively, hazard ratio, 3.7 [95% confidence interval,"
		"1.57-8.7]; P = 0.003). In contrast, after 6 months of HAART, treated patients"
		were less likely to develop disseminated histoplasmosis than untreated patients
		"(hazard ratio, 0.6 [95% confidence interval, 0.37-0.98], P = 0.04). This"
		increased incidence suggests that the initiation of HAART and the subsequent
		immune reconstitution may reveal undiagnosed latent disseminated histoplasmosis.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Histoplasmosis is one of the invasive fungal infections and presents
		with symptoms mainly in the lungs. Disseminated histoplasmosis (DH) is rare and
		its lesions in the gastrointestinal tract are even uncommon. The concomitant
		involvement of the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract has never been
		described in the immunocompetent individuals. CASE PRESENTATION: A 44-year-old
		"immunocompetent Chinese man presented with fever, hepatosplenomegaly, fungal"
		esophagitis and protuberant lesions with central depression and erosion along the
		mucous membrane of the colon. The patient was diagnosed as disseminated
		histoplasmosis by gastrointestinal endoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: Histoplasmosis should
		be taken caution in patients with fever and hepatosplenomegaly. Actions should be
		taken to avoid its disseminated infection associated high mortality.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Histoplasmosis is a fungal disease caused by Histoplasma capsulatum,"
		"commonly found in the Americas, and Histoplasma duboisii, located in Africa. In"
		"the United States, H. capsulatum is prevalent in the Ohio and Mississippi river"
		"valleys. In rare circumstances, central nervous system (CNS) histoplasmosis"
		infection can be caused by shunt placement. We present a case report of a
		45-year-old woman in whom CNS histoplasmosis developed after having a
		ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt placed for communicating hydrocephalus. A review
		of the literature on fungal infections after CNS shunt placement as well as
		treatment options for this subset of patients was undertaken. METHODS: The PubMed
		database current to 1958 was filtered and limited to English-language articles.
		Fifty-eight articles were selected for review based on evidence of information
		"regarding the fungal organism responsible for shunt infection, symptoms,"
		"treatment, and/or outcomes. Also included in this review is our case study."
		RESULTS: A thorough analysis of the PubMed database revealed 58 reported cases of
		CNS shunt-related fungal infections in the English-language medical literature as
		well as 7 therapeutic agents used to treat patients in whom postshunt fungal
		infections developed. CONCLUSIONS: We describe the steps in diagnosis of
		"histoplasmosis after shunt placement, provide an effective therapeutic regimen,"
		and review the present understanding of CNS fungal infections. The medical
		literature was surveyed to compare and analyze various CNS fungal infections that
		can arise from shunt placement as well as treatments rendered.

AB	-	"A 33-year-old brown bear (Ursus arctos) was evaluated for chronic cough, partial"
		"anorexia, and lethargy in early fall of 2009. Radiographs revealed a generalized"
		increase in interstitial density with focal lung field consolidation and air
		bronchograms more prevalent in the cranial lung lobes. Tracheal sputum and wash
		fluid grew mixed bacteria and 2 species of Candida on bacterial and fungal
		"cultures, respectively. Serum was negative for antibodies to Aspergillus,"
		"Blastomyces, Coccidioides, and Histoplasma by semiquantitative radial"
		immunodiffusion. Antimicrobial and antifungal treatment was administered. The
		bear died 1 month after entering hibernation. Gross necropsy revealed coalescent
		nodules and sheets of firm tan tissue covering pleural surfaces of the thoracic
		"cavity and within pulmonary parenchyma, enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes, and"
		intestinal ulcerations. Histopathology revealed granulomatous inflammation with
		"intrahistiocytic yeast, consistent with Histoplasma organisms, in lung,"
		"diaphragm, mesenteric lymph nodes, intestine, and adrenal glands. Molecular"
		"analysis performed on DNA isolated from lung tissue, including conventional"
		polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the internal transcribed spacer region
		for the ribosomal RNA gene complex and real-time PCR targeting the gene encoding
		"a unique region of M specific protein, identified the organism to be 100%"
		identical to Histoplasma capsulatum with an average of 4.9 × 10(7) gene copies
		per gram of tissue. The present report describes histologic and molecular
		techniques for diagnosing histoplasmosis.

PG	-	233-47
AB	-	"A recent case of canine histoplasmosis, the first confirmed case of disseminated"
		"infection accompanied by carcinoma in Japan, was diagnosed by clinical"
		"characteristics, histopathological examination, chest radiographs, ocular"
		fundoscopy and molecular biological data. The clinical manifestations were not
		"limited to cutaneous symptoms but were referable to disseminated infection,"
		similar to human autochthonous cases. The partial sequences of the internal
		transcribed spacer (ITS1/2) regions of the ribosomal DNA genes of this and other
		Japanese canine histoplasmosis strains were 99-100% identical to the sequence
		"AB211551 derived from a human isolate in Thailand, and showed a close"
		relationship to the sequences derived from Japanese autochthonous systemic and
		cutaneous human cases. The phylogenetic analysis of 97 sequences of the ITS1/2
		region disclosed six genotypes. The genotypes derived from Japanese autochthonous
		human and dog cases belonged to the cluster consisting of Histoplasma capsulatum
		"var. capsulatum and H. capsulatum var. farciminosum sequences, indicating that"
		"these varieties might cause not only cutaneous but also systemic histoplasmosis,"
		regardless of their host species. The current status of the 3 varieties of
		Histoplasma capsulatum according to the host species remains a subject of further
		investigation.

		a rare complication with a poor prognosis. There are few data on HLH within the
		"Amazon region. The objective was to describe epidemiological, clinical and"
		therapeutic features of HIV-related HLH in French Guiana. Methods: A
		retrospective analysis of adult HIV patients at Cayenne hospital with HLH between
		2012 and 2015. A diagnosis of HLH was given if the patient presented at least 3
		of 8 criteria of the HLH-2004 classification. Results: Fourteen cases of HLH were
		tallied during the study period. The mean age was 46 years with a sex ratio of
		1.8. The most frequent etiology of HLH was an associated infection (12/14).
		"Confirmed disseminated histoplasmosis, was found in 10 of 14 cases, and it was"
		suspected in 2 other cases. The CD4 count was below 200/mm(3) in 13/14 cases. An
		"HIV viral load >100,000 copies/ml was observed in 13/14 cases. An early treatment"
		with liposomal amphotericin B was initiated in 12/14 cases. The outcome was
		favorable in 12/14 of all cases and in 10/12 cases involving histoplasmosis. Case
		fatality was 2/14 among all cases (14.3%) et 1/10 among confirmed disseminated
		histoplasmosis with HLH (10%). During the study period 1 in 5 cases of known
		HIV-associated disseminated histoplasmosis in French Guiana was HLH. Conclusion:
		Histoplasmosis was the most frequent etiology associated with HLH in HIV-infected
		"patients in French Guiana. The prognosis of HLH remains severe. However, a"
		probabilistic empirical first line treatment with liposomal amphotericin B seemed
		to have a favorable impact on patient survival.

PG	-	909-14
AB	-	BACKGROUND: A histoplasmosis outbreak occurred in an Indiana high school in
		"November-December 2001. METHODS: To describe the risk factors for this outbreak,"
		we conducted a cohort study of all available students and staff (N = 682) and an
		environmental investigation. RESULTS: Of the 523 (77%) persons who displayed
		"serologic evidence of recent Histoplasma capsulatum infection, 355 (68%)"
		developed symptoms consistent with acute pulmonary histoplasmosis. Rototilling of
		soil in a school courtyard known to be a bird roosting site had been performed
		"during school hours on November 12, 2001, 14 days before both the peak of the"
		"onset of illness and a rise in student absenteeism. Being a student (odds ratio,"
		"3.3; 95% confidence interval, 2.2-5.0) and being a student in a classroom near"
		"the courtyard during the rototilling (odds ratio, 3.1; 95% confidence interval,"
		1.8-5.2) were independently associated with infection and symptomatic illness. H.
		"capsulatum was isolated from environmental samples, including soil from the"
		"courtyard and dust collected from a filter of a heating, ventilating and"
		air-conditioning system. CONCLUSIONS: Soil-disrupting activities within a school
		courtyard caused the largest outbreak to date of histoplasmosis among
		adolescents. Improved efforts are needed to educate the community in endemic
		areas about histoplasmosis to prevent the occurrence of such outbreaks in the
		"future. In addition, increased awareness among health care providers of this"
		disease would facilitate appropriate diagnosis and treatment.

AB	-	Histoplasmosis duboisii (Histoplasma capsulatum var duboisii) is uncommon disease
		especially in children. It is observed in Africa where the incidence is unknown.
		The authors report a series of three pediatric cases. The report concerned 2
		"girls and one boy who were 3, 9 and 4 year-old, respectively. Symptoms evolved"
		"for more than two months in each case. At admission, we found fever and poor"
		general condition. Observed lesions were lymphnodes localisation disseminated
		"(cases 1 and 2), subcutaneous (cold abscess) and cutaneous simulating molluscum"
		"contagiosum (case 2), osteoarticular (cases 2 and 3), abdominal including"
		"peritoneal and hepatosplenic (case 1). In all cases, a mild leukocytosis was"
		found and an accelerated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) greater than 70mm.
		The HIV serology was negative. The treatment consisted of itraconazole in 2 cases
		"and ketoconazole in one case. The evolution was insidious, leading to the"
		discharge against medical advice. The death occurred at home in all cases.
		CONCLUSION: Histoplasmosis duboisii can realize two main clinical presentations
		"(localized or disseminated), affecting the skin, lymph nodes, bones, sometimes"
		the intra-abdominal organs. HIV serology is not always positive in disseminated
		forms. The evolution is unpredictable and capricious under antifungal treatment.
		The disease should be well explained to prevent a possible discharge against
		"medical advice, often pejorative."

PG	-	187-9
AB	-	We report a case of gastrointestinal histoplasmosis in a 45-year-old HIV positive
		man who was misdiagnosed as a case of colonic cancer. The patient presented with
		"low-grade fever, pain in lower abdomen, anorexia and weight loss of six months"
		duration. On examination a lump in the left iliac fossa was detected. Colonoscopy
		revealed stricture and ulcerated growth in the sigmoid colon. Radiological
		investigations suggested malignant/inflammatory mass in the sigmoid colon with
		luminal compromise. Patient was operated and ulcerated tissue was sent for
		"histopathological examination, which revealed numerous intracellular, 2-4 microm,"
		"oval, narrow-based budding yeast cells suggestive of Histoplasma capsulatum."
		"Subsequently, the patient developed fluffy opacities on X-ray chest. Examination"
		of sputum revealed presence of acid-fast bacilli and yeast forms of H.
		capsulatum. Patient was started on amphotericin B but died on the seventeenth
		postoperative day. The diagnosis of histoplasmosis was made retrospectively.
		Atypical presentation and rarity of the disease led to this diagnostic pitfall.
		To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of gastrointestinal
		histoplasmosis presenting as colonic pseudotumour from India.

AB	-	The authors report a case of multifocal African histoplasmosis with polymorphic
		skin involvement occuring in a patient without proven immunosuppression. He was a
		young 22-year-old patient from eastern Senegal - but born in Ouganda - who
		"presented with polymorphic skin lesions: ombilicated papulo-nodules, gums and"
		ulcerative and budding lesions. He showed lymphadenopathies without clinical
		inflammation and with a cheesy appearance of the biopsy but without tuberculosis
		and also hepatosplenic and bone involvement. Mycological samples of the skin and
		lymph nodes biopsies revealed yeasts of Histoplasma capsulatum var. duboisii with
		"a positive culture on Sabouraud medium. HIV serology, HTLV1et 2, the serum"
		proteins electrophoresis were unremarkable. Treatment with amphotericin B was
		irregular because of its inaccessibility in the national territory and its cost.
		The patient died of sepsis together with the aggravation of his disease.

PG	-	165-8
AB	-	"INTRODUCTION: Hypercalcemia is a known, but rare complication of histoplasmosis,"
		a granulomatous disease. We present a case of chronic disseminated
		"histoplasmosis, complicated by hypercalcemia, transiently worsening after"
		initiation of antifungal treatment. CASE PRESENTATION: A 61-year-old gentleman
		"presented with shortness of breath, cough, weight loss, but no fever or"
		hemoptysis. His physical exam was unremarkable except for decreased air entry on
		"both lung fields, and axillary and inguinal lymphadenopathies. Computed"
		"tomography of the chest showed bilateral cavitary lung lesions, biopsy of which"
		"showed non caseating granulomas, and tissue culture showing Histoplasma"
		"capsulatum. Itraconazole was started. One month later, patient presented with"
		transient acute renal failure and worsening hypercalcemia. His workup showed a
		"non-PTH mediated hypercalcemia, with a normal PTH-rP, and low calcifediol, but"
		high normal calcitriol level. Hypercalcemia secondary to histoplasmosis was
		"reported in six cases, none of which worsened after antifungal treatment. Several"
		mechanisms have been elucidated. CONCLUSION: We recommend monitoring of serum
		"calcium after initiation of antifungal treatment, especially in patients with"
		underlying hypercalcemia. More studies are needed to understand the
		pathophysiology.

LID	-	e11486
AB	-	RATIONALE: Disseminated histoplasmosis is a rare fungal infection and most
		documented cases are in immunocompromised individuals such as those with acquired
		"immunodeficiency syndrome. However, histoplasmosis easily goes unrecognized in"
		immunocompetent populations. PATIENT CONCERNS: We report a rare case of
		histoplasmosis that was manifested as persistent fever and abnormal liver
		function in a 45-year-old immunocompetent female from Jiangsu Province.
		DIAGNOSES: Investigations revealed anemia and thrombocytopenia. Giemsa-stained
		"bone marrow aspirate showed yeast-like cells, suggestive of Histoplasma"
		capsulatum. Wright-stained bone marrow aspirate confirmed the diagnosis.
		INTERVENTIONS: The patient was treated by amphotericin B (amphotericin B
		liposome) and itraconazole. OUTCOMES: Our patient responded well to the
		treatment. LESSONS: Emphasizing histoplasmosis as a cause of fever of unknown
		"origin in an immunocompetent patient, this case highlights the need for an index"
		"of suspicion and the importance of prompt diagnosis, as any delay of treatment"
		can be life threatening.

AB	-	African histoplasmosis is a granulomatous mycosis caused by Histoplasma
		capsulatum var. duboisii. Treatment is usually extrapolated from guidelines for
		"classical histoplasmosis, and includes 2-4 weeks of amphotericin B followed by a"
		"step-down maintenance therapy with itraconazole. Pediatric usage of posaconazole,"
		"an oral second-generation azole, remains off-label, but recent surveys show that"
		it is safe and well tolerated in children. We report a case of disseminated
		African histoplasmosis in a 12-year-old boy from Guinea-Bissau. Therapy with
		amphotericin B and itraconazole led to a progressive clinical deterioration. A
		dramatic and lasting improvement was observed using posaconazole. He completed 12
		months of therapy. No relapse was noted during or 3 months after treatment. We
		report that posaconazole may be a safe and efficacious drug in the salvage
		"management of disseminated AH, either in patients with disease refractory to"
		"conventional anti-fungal therapy, or in patients whose serious adverse effects of"
		first-line drugs preclude its use.

PG	-	423-6
AB	-	Histoplasma capsulatum organisms were identified by cytologic evaluation in the
		thoracic and abdominal effusions of a 5-year-old sexually intact male Cocker
		Spaniel that was referred because of anorexia and lethargy. Treatment with
		amphotericin B and ketoconazole was instituted. The dog developed respiratory
		"arrest, a complication of the disseminated disease, and died. Necropsy findings"
		"included pleural effusion, hepatomegaly, and enlarged tracheobronchial, hilar,"
		"mediastinal, and mesenteric lymph nodes. Granulomas containing periodic"
		acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive yeast-like organisms identified as H capsulatum were
		"seen in the lungs, liver, and lymph nodes. The lymphatic vessels were dilated,"
		and fibrosis of the portal and periportal regions of the liver was noticed.
		Identification of Histoplasma organisms by cytologic examination of pleural and
		abdominal effusions is a rare laboratory finding and can provide a minimally
		invasive and inexpensive definitive diagnosis of histoplasmosis.

		histoplasmosis.
PG	-	656-61
LID	-	10.1177/0956462413516299 [doi]
AB	-	"In Western French Guiana, there was a dramatic increase in HIV prevalence between"
		1990 and 2000. The present study describes the causes of fever among HIV patients
		hospitalized in the medical ward of the only hospital in the western part of
		French Guiana. A retrospective descriptive study was conducted between 1 January
		2008 and 30 June 2010 in the department of medicine of Saint Laurent du Maroni
		Hospital. The main characteristics of 67 patients having presented with fever in
		the first 48 hours of hospitalization were described. Among patients with CD4
		<200/mm(3)the main febrile opportunistic infection was disseminated
		histoplasmosis (41.1%). Among patients with CD4 counts <50/mm(3)and fever without
		focal points 85.7% had disseminated histoplasmosis. Three patients died and all
		had disseminated histoplasmosis. Disseminated histoplasmosis is the most common
		febrile opportunistic infection in western French Guiana. Primary prophylaxis
		with itraconazole among immunocompromised patients seems warranted.

PG	-	518-21
LID	-	10.4314/ahs.v13i2.45 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Disseminated histoplasmosis is a rare fungal infection and most
		documented cases are in immune-compromised individuals such as those with
		acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To describe a case of
		disseminated histoplasmosis in an adolescent girl. METHOD: We report a case of
		disseminated histoplasmosis in a 13-year-old adolescent girl. She was admitted
		"for 16 days because of neck masses of 3 years duration, generalized body swelling"
		of 3 months and reduction in urinary output of 2 months. She tested negative for
		human immunodeficiency virus antibodies. RESULT: An autopsy was performed because
		a definitive diagnosis could not be made while the patient was still alive. The
		autopsy revealed central caseating areas in the lymph nodes and
		membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. The periodic acid-Schiff staining
		technique for tissues showed viable yeast cells suggestive of histoplasmosis.
		Zeihl-Neelsen's staining for mycobacteria tuberculosis was negative. CONCLUSION:
		Undiagnosed case of disseminated histoplasmosis while the patient was alive is
		being reported in a 13-year-old girl. Disseminated histoplasmosis should be
		considered as a differential diagnosis of childhood chronic infections and
		malignancies as in Nigeria.

TI	-	Disseminated cutaneous histoplasmosis and AIDS: case report.
PG	-	255-61
AB	-	Histoplasmosis is caused by the dimorphic fungus Histoplasma capsulatum. It
		manifests by the presence of fever as the only symptom in most individuals. The
		"disease may present as self-limited pneumonia, or as an hematogenous widespread"
		fungal infection with a potentially fatal outcome in elderly individuals and
		"people with compromised T-cell mediated immunity. Here, we report a case of"
		disseminated cutaneous histoplasmosis in a patient with AIDS. The patient was a
		"33 year old male homosexual, intravenous drug user, who had been diagnosed with"
		"HIV infection 5 years earlier. He was in good health, but had erythematous"
		"papules and pustules in the skin of the scalp, face, back, thighs, abdomen,"
		"palms, and soles. He was placed on anti-retroviral therapy, fluconazole for"
		"mucosal candidiasis, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for pneumocystis prophylaxis,"
		and antibiotics for the skin pustules. The skin lesions improved remarkably
		within 14 days. He was discharged and soon lost to follow-up. After his
		"discharge, skin biopsy and fungal culture results revealed H. capsulatum. He was"
		seen again 1 year later. The interim history revealed that he had taken
		fluconazole 100 mg/day for 1 month and fluconazole 150 mg/week for 7 months. He
		"had not continued anti-retroviral therapy, nor taken other antifungal drugs. The"
		clinical evolution of the disease was exceptional in that there was disappearance
		of all the skin lesions attributed to histoplasmosis with fluconazole. Although
		itraconazole remains the drug of choice for histoplasmosis. Cutaneous
		histoplasmosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of atypical
		cutaneous lesions in individuals infected with HIV.

TI	-	Disseminated histoplasmosis in an African pygmy hedgehog.
PG	-	74-6
LID	-	10.2460/javma.232.1.74 [doi]
AB	-	CASE DESCRIPTION: A 2-year-old captive-bred sexually intact female African pygmy
		hedgehog (Atelerix albiventris) was evaluated because of vague signs of illness
		"including inappetence, weakness, lethargy, and weight loss over a 20-day period."
		CLINICAL FINDINGS: Abnormalities detected via initial clinicopathologic analyses
		"included anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, hypoproteinemia, and hypoglycemia."
		Results of a fecal flotation test were negative. Three weeks after the initial
		"evaluation, splenomegaly was detected via palpation and ultrasonography."
		TREATMENT AND OUTCOME: The hedgehog was treated with broad-spectrum antibacterial
		"agents, resulting in an initially favorable response. Fenbendazole was also"
		administered against possible occult parasitic infestation. After 3 weeks of
		"illness, the hedgehog's condition had worsened and supportive care and"
		administration of additional antibacterial agents were instituted. The hedgehog
		"died, and pathologic examinations revealed severe splenomegaly; granulomatous"
		"infiltrates were evident in multiple organs, and Histoplasma capsulatum yeasts"
		were detected intralesionally. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Histoplasmosis can develop in
		a wide range of mammalian species. African pygmy hedgehogs are becoming
		"increasingly popular as exotic pets, and vague signs of illness and splenomegaly"
		"are often attributed to hemolymphatic malignancies, which are somewhat common in"
		this species. Practitioners should be aware that similar clinical signs may be
		associated with histoplasmosis in these animals. Although the hedgehog of this
		"report was confined indoors, it originated from an area where histoplasmosis was"
		endemic; this indicates that the disease should be included as a differential
		diagnosis for hedgehogs that develop vague signs of illness and are known to
		originate from such geographic regions.

AB	-	"Two 6-month-old raccoon kits, which had been rescued and fostered in preparation"
		"for return to the wild, became acutely ill and died 3 weeks before scheduled"

		"infiltrates of macrophages containing yeast organisms were identified in lung,"
		"liver, kidney, spleen, lymph nodes, intestinal tissues, brain, adrenal gland,"

		"spleen, and intestinal sections. Fungal organisms were observed on sheep blood"
		"agar plates; however, repeated subcultures to fungal media designed to induce"
		conidial structures for fungal identification were unsuccessful. Partial DNA
		sequencing of the 28S ribosomal RNA gene of the blood agar isolate identified
		100% homology with Ajellomyces capsulatus (anamorphic name Histoplasma
		capsulatum). The kits were rescued and fostered in the San Francisco Bay area and
		it is likely that the exposure to H. capsulatum occurred in this area.
		Histoplasma sp. infection in wild mammal species is often used as an indication
		of spore contamination of a geographic region. Northern California is not known
		"to be an endemic region for H. capsulatum, which is not a reportable disease in"
		"this state. The presence of severe, disseminated disease and the need for"
		molecular identification associated with the isolate from a nonendemic region
		identified in the present report may indicate genetic adaptation and altered
		characteristics of this agent and may warrant further investigation.

TI	-	Histoplasmosis infection in Spanish travelers to Latin America.
PG	-	839-41
AB	-	The aim of the study presented here was to assess the incidence of histoplasma
		infection in a cohort of 342 individuals in Spain who had traveled to Latin
		America for the first time. The histoplasmin skin test was positive in 20% of the
		"travelers, and Central America posed a higher risk for infection than South"
		America (p=0.013). Sleeping outdoors (p=0.031) and the duration of travel
		(p=0.016) were also identified as significant risk factors. Serological testing
		"demonstrated poor overall sensitivity for detecting infection in the travelers,"
		but for the symptomatic acute cases the results were improved. Histoplasmosis
		must be considered in patients presenting with fever (odds ratio=3.51
		[1.52-8.12]) or cough (odds ratio=4.24 [1.32-13.58]) after visiting Latin
		America. The results of this study have public health implications and indicate
		the risks of acquiring histoplasmosis should be included in pre-travel
		counseling.

		endemic in many areas of the world but is relatively rare in China. Although the
		majority of cases present as a mild to moderate flu-like disease requiring only
		"supportive therapy, approximately 1% of patients experience more serious"
		"pulmonary and extrapulmonary disease, which can be life-threatening if diagnosis"
		is delayed or the treatment is not initiated rapidly. Definitive diagnosis is
		"usually made by a combination of culture, detection of the organism in tissues,"
		"measurement of antibodies, and detection of antigen. We present the case of a"
		"51-year-old patient who presented with histoplasmosis only, with several"
		"ulcerated lesions in the oral cavity and without HIV infection, who did not show"
		any detectable signs and symptoms of systemic disease or extra-oral
		manifestations. Histopathological analysis indicated a chronic inflammatory
		process with granulomas with yeast-like organisms. Isolation of H. capsulatum and
		molecular identification provided the definitive diagnosis. Treatment with oral
		itraconazole led to remission of the oral lesions. This is the first Chinese case
		report of localized histoplasmosis with lesions restricted to the mouth in an

AB	-	Histoplasmosis usually occurs in specific endemic areas. Sporadic cases have also
		"been reported in mainland China. Here, we described an indigenous case of"
		disseminated histoplasmosis. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the Histoplasma
		capsulatum isolated in our case belongs to the Australian clade. Combined with
		"previous studies, it revealed high genetic diversity among Chinese H. capsulatum"
		isolates.

AB	-	Cutaneous histoplasmosis is an uncommon infection and can occur as a primary
		"infection. A manifestation imitating a cutaneous neoplasm is rare, and eyelid"
		involvement is rarer still. The authors report a case of histoplasmosis that
		presented as an ulcerated lesion on the lower eyelid margin that clinically
		"resembled a basal cell carcinoma. Given its worldwide distribution, it is"
		important to include this disease in the differential diagnosis of nonhealing
		eyelid lesions. Biopsy and tissue culture are paramount to establishing the
		diagnosis. This case describes a rare presentation of histoplasmosis on the
		eyelid and highlights the importance of histopathologic evaluation.

AB	-	"Very commonly encountered in the United States, histoplasmosis is rare in Europe,"
		"where only 27 patients have so far been infected by this mycosis. In Africa, two"
		varieties of histoplasmosis have been observed: those due to H. capsulatum and H.
		duboisii. Histoplasmosis due to H. capsulatum is one of the twelve secondary
		infectious diseases listed in the surveillance definitions of AIDS. This
		complication has been described only in approximately 20 patients with AIDS; all
		patients had stayed on the American Continents. We report the case of a
		30-year-old African male who lived in Switzerland and in Zaïre. With AIDS and
		"multiple Kaposi's sarcoma, the patient died from disseminated histoplasmosis due"
		to H. capsulatum; a peripheral blood smear obtained a few hours before death
		revealed numerous typical yeast forms of H. capsulatum inside polymorphonuclear
		leukocytes. Post-mortem examination and cultures confirmed the diagnosis of
		disseminated histoplasmosis. Histoplasmosis should be suspected in AIDS patients
		"even in Europe, especially where they have stayed in endemic areas. Examination"
		of blood smears and bonemarrow aspirate may allow early recognition of the
		disease and permit appropriate treatment with amphotericin B and ketoconazole.

		"vaginal delivery, the patient presented with dyspnea, fever, hypotension,"
		"tachycardia, and painful hepatomegaly. Yeast-like Histoplasma capsulatum features"
		were isolated in the buffy coat. The phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the
		fungal isolate was similar to other H. capsulatum isolates identified in HIV
		"patients from Ceará and Latin America. Thus, histoplasmosis development in"
		individuals with transitory immunosuppression or during the period of
		immunological recovery should be carefully examined.

		Mexico].
PG	-	181-186
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Infectious endocarditis of fungal origin is rare but of high
		mortality. The agents involved are mainly opportunists of the genus Candida and
		Aspergillus; however other fungi can also cause this disease. CLINICAL CASE: The
		case of a woman who suffered unknown origin intermittent fever for several
		"months; and in who, by blood culture (after lysis-centrifugation) and molecular"
		"biology techniques, Histoplasma capsulatum was identified as etiological agent."
		The histological study showed abundant intracellular yeasts and hyphae in
		intracardiac vegetations. CONCLUSION: This first report of infectious
		endocarditis by H. capsulatum in Mexico highlights the importance of using in
		"addition to manual blood culture (lysis-centrifugation) and histological study,"
		"faster and more sensitive diagnostic methods, such as serology and molecular"
		"biology, to confirm or rule out an invasive fungal infection and identify the"
		agents.

PG	-	227-34
AB	-	"Six new cases are described for African histoplasmosis, Histoplasma capsulatum"
		"var. duboisii, from Congo. The first was an HIV sero-negative child who has been"
		"monitored for the last three years. While under treatment with ketoconazole,"
		"amphotericin B, and finally itraconazole, the development of the infection was"
		"accompanied by purulent lesions, mainly cutaneous, but also superficial and deep"
		"lymphadenopathies. As a last option, itraconazole gave very satisfactory results"
		"both during the acute phase and during long-term treatment. However, eight months"
		"after treatment had ceased, there was a relapse and the long-term treatment had"
		to be restarted. The other cases concerned HIV sero-positive patients with
		disseminated infections that had all been mistaken for tuberculosis. After
		"diagnosis of the infection in two cases, the following two years of treatment"
		"could not prevent death. A fourth case, diagnosed in December 1994, is currently"
		undergoing treatment. The fifth subject was lost after diagnosis during
		"follow-up, but inquires made after the discovery of the patient's death strongly"
		"indicated acquired immunodeficiency as the cause. The last of these six cases,"
		"determined as HIV sero-negative, showed large bony lesions of the spinal column"
		"associated with a sore on the thorax. Thus, in a short period of time, three or"
		four cases of African histoplasmosis occurred which were associated with HIV
		infection. Only seven identical observations have previously been reported in the
		"literature. Therefore, we believe that this mycosis should now be included in the"
		criteria for the diagnosis and definition of AIDS in the tropics.

OAB	-	"In Congo, the parasitology-mycology laboratory in Brazzaville diagnosed six new"
		cases of African histoplasmosis (Histoplasma capsulatum var. duboisii) in a
		3-year period. Three cases had AIDS. Another case was strongly suspected of being
		HIV seropositive. The first case was a 4-year-old child from Brazzaville who had
		been monitored for more than 3 years. Health providers treated him first with
		"ketoconazole, then amphotericin B, and finally itraconazole. The child's African"
		"histoplasmosis was characterized by purulent lesions, particularly cutaneous, but"
		also superficial and deep lymphadenopathies. Itraconazole adequately treated the
		child's condition both during the acute phase and during long-term treatment.
		"Eight months after the end of itraconazole treatment, the child suffered a"
		"relapse, resulting in re-administration of longterm treatment. The remaining"
		"African histoplasmosis cases had disseminated infections, which were initially"
		"suspected to be tuberculosis. After diagnosis, two cases died despite two years"
		of treatment. The fourth case was diagnosed in December 1994 and is still
		"receiving treatment. After diagnosis, the fifth case was lost to follow-up."
		Health providers later learned that AIDS was probably responsible for the
		"patient's death. The sixth case did not have HIV infection. The 32-year-old man,"
		"a nurse in the central army hospital in Brazzaville, had large bony lesions of"
		the spinal column associated with a sore on the thorax. The literature shows only
		seven other African histoplasmosis cases infected with HIV. These HIV-infected
		African histoplasmosis cases along with the seven cases in the literature suggest
		that African histoplasmosis should be included in the criteria for the diagnosis
		and definition of AIDS in tropical countries.

TI	-	Histoplasmosis as cause of penile ulcer in acquired immune deficiency syndrome
		(AIDS): three case reports.
PG	-	295-9
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Histoplasma capsulatum is the causative agent of American
		histoplasmosis. The relationship between disseminated histoplasmosis and AIDS has
		been well established. Widespread hematogenous dissemination of Histoplasma
		capsulatum in HIV positive patients can cause a plethora of clinical
		"manifestations; virtually any organic system can be affected. However, genital"
		ulceration by H. capsulatum in patients with AIDS is a real challenge during
		investigation of the infection due to the great variety of differential diagnoses
		that are involved. METHOD: The diagnosis was performed by histopathologic study;
		H. capsulatum was detected by silver staining (Grocott staining) and confirmed by
		immunocytochemistry. RESULTS: We report three cases of histoplasmosis in patients
		"with AIDS, in which we observed genital ulcers, an unusual form of presentation"
		"of this disease. In one of these cases, the treatment resulted in total cure."
		CONCLUSION: The cases reported herein are to illustrate the plurality of
		"pathologies and clinical manifestations, which may affect immunocompromised"
		patients. The correct diagnosis of fungal diseases in these patients following
		well established treatment will improve the prognosis.

AB	-	"In recent years, the incidence of superficial fungal infections involving"
		nondermatophytic and noncandidal fungi increased considerably. The objective of
		"this work was to analyze the epidemiological, clinical and mycological fungal"
		infections due to nondermatophytic and noncandidal fungi diagnosed in the
		laboratory of parasitology-mycology of Le Dantec hospital in Dakar. With a
		retrospective study of the various cases of nondermatophytic and noncandidal
		fungi isolated in the laboratory of parasitology-mycology during the period of
		"November 2013 to December 2014, we collected 22 cases of infections in 11 men and"
		11 women; age ranging from 17 to 75 years with a mean of 45.3 years (sex
		"ratio=1): eight cases of intertrigo, seven cases of onychomycosis, four cases of"
		"palmoplantar keratoderma (KPP), a case of onychomycosis associated with"
		"interdigital intertrigo, a case of infectious myositis and one case of African"
		histoplasmosis. We have isolated and identified a total of 22 nondermatophytic
		"and noncandidal fungi: ten Fusarium, five Trichosporon, two Chrysosporium, two"
		"Geotrichum, one Rhodotorula, one Neoscytalidium dimidiatum and one Histoplasma"
		capsulatum var. duboisii. So we are seeing the emergence of nondermatophytic and
		noncandidal increasingly isolated from superficial and local lesions. These
		"fungi, generally contaminants or commensal, cause a problem regarding their"
		direct involvement in pathological processes in which they are isolated. So we
		should respect the recommendations proposed for their involvement in pathological
		"processes and, by a collaboration between clinician and biologist, demonstrate"
		"their real involvement through effective, targeted treatment."

AB	-	"Histoplasmosis, caused by Histoplasma capsulatum, is an endemic mycosis in many"
		countries of the world except for Japan. Outbreaks of histoplasmosis among
		Japanese people are very rare and are mainly imported by travelers. We report an
		outbreak of histoplasmosis among healthy Japanese people who traveled to a resort
		"area in Southeast Asia. Three young Japanese women traveled to Langkawi island,"
		"Malaysia and stayed on the island for five days without visiting caves, a known"
		reservoir of H. capsulatum. All three individuals developed flu-like symptoms
		with multiple nodule shadows on chest X rays or chest CT scans at around ten days
		after their return to Japan. Serum samples obtained from the three subjects were
		positive for anti-Histoplasma antibody and specific PCR for H. capsulatum on lung
		biopsy specimens and the serum from one patient was positive. The clinical course
		of all three patients improved without the use of anti-fungal agents and no
		recurrence has been confirmed. Clinical attendants should consider histoplasmosis
		when they see patients with flu-like symptoms with abnormal chest X-rays after
		"visiting H. capsulatum endemic areas, especially Southeast Asia."

AB	-	Pulmonary spindle cell proliferations have been reported in association with a
		limited group of infectious agents. These lesions are rare and identified most
		often in the setting of immunosuppression. Because their appearance can simulate
		"a spindle cell neoplasm, they are diagnostically treacherous, sometimes delaying"
		antimicrobial therapy or resulting in unnecessary surgery. We report a case of a
		"spindle pseudotumor of the lung resulting from Histoplasma capsulatum infection,"
		a previously unreported cause of a spindle cell lesion in the lung. The patient
		was a 67-year-old woman in whom positron emission tomography-positive nodules
		developed in the left lung and left mediastinum. The patient had undergone renal
		"transplantation and was receiving immunosuppressive therapy with mycophenolate,"
		"tacrolimus, and low-dose prednisone. Infection with H capsulatum was confirmed by"
		"culture of pleural effusion fluid, DNA probe analysis of the pleural fluid"
		"culture isolate, urinary Histoplasma antigen detection, and Grocott methenamine"
		"silver stains of tissue sections. To our knowledge, this is the first case of a"
		"spindle cell ""pseudotumor"" of the lung resulting from histoplasmosis. It"
		highlights the importance of performing special stains for organisms when
		evaluating pulmonary spindle cell lesions in an immunocompromised host.

PG	-	271-4
AB	-	This paper reviews the Italian literature and illustrates the results of a survey
		on Histoplasma capsulatum var. capsulatum infection carried out in the Bergamo
		"area of Italy over the last 10 y. During the period January 1989-July 1999, 7"
		patients were diagnosed as being affected by the H. capsulatum var. capsulatum
		infection. Until 1999 41 cases have been described in the Italian literature (9
		"before the 1980s, 6 in the 1980s and 26 in the 1990s). The epidemiological"
		profile of histoplasmosis is well-defined: risk factors are activities such as
		"visiting caves or building sites, travelling and immigration, and it affects both"
		"immunocompetent and patients with AIDS. However, in the past, the Italian soil"
		was considered as a low-endemic pabulum for H. capsulatum var. capsulatum and
		"only a few autochthonous cases of histoplasmosis have been reported in Italy,"
		"specifically in the Po valley. In the present series, the identification of new"
		cases in the Po valley in Lombardy suggests the possible autochthonous presence
		of histoplasmosis in Italy.

PG	-	1195-8
LID	-	10.4269/ajtmh.13-0082 [doi]
AB	-	Histoplasmosis is the first cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)
		and AIDS-related deaths in French Guiana. Cohort data were used to determine
		whether primary prophylaxis with 100 mg itraconazole for patients with CD4 counts
		< 150/mm(3) was cost-effective with different scenarios. For a scenario where 12%
		"of patients died, 60% were aware of their human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)"
		"infection and adherence was only 50%, primary prophylaxis would prevent 1 death"
		"and 9 cases of histoplasmosis for a cost of 36,792 Euros per averted death, 1,533"
		"per life-year saved, 4,415 Euros per averted case, when only counting the costs"
		of itraconazole prophylaxis. Taking into account the total costs of
		"hospitalization showed that primary prophylaxis would allow a savings of 185,178"
		"Euros per year. Even in a scenario of low adherence, primary prophylaxis would be"
		"cost-effective in French Guiana, and presumably in the rest of the Guianas and"
		the Amazon.

PG	-	899-903
AB	-	"In June 1994, 18 people developed serologically confirmed histoplasmosis"
		following cave exploration associated with the annual National Speleological
		"Society Convention in Bracketville, Texas. Six others had an undiagnosed illness"
		suspected to be histoplasmosis. Two persons were hospitalized. We conducted a
		survey of convention attendees and a nested case-control study of those entering
		caves. We also conducted a histoplasmin skin test survey of a subgroup of the
		"society, the Texas Cavers Association, who were attending a reunion in October"
		"1994. Among the national convention attendees, exposure to two caves was"
		identified as responsible for 22 (92%) of the 24 cases; 12 (75%) of 16 people
		exploring one cave (Cave A) and 10 (77%) of 13 exploring a separate cave (Cave B)
		developed acute histoplasmosis. Additional risk-factors included fewer years of
		"caving experience, longer time spent in the caves, and entering a confined crawl"
		"space in Cave A. Of 113 participants in the separate skin test survey, 68 (60%)"
		"were found to be skin test positive, indicating previous exposure to Histoplasma"
		capsulatum. A positive skin test was significantly associated with male sex and
		more years of caving experience. Those less experienced in caving associations
		"should be taught about histoplasmosis, and health care providers should pursue"
		histories of cave exposure for patients with bronchitis or pneumonia that does
		not respond to initial antibiotic therapy.

TI	-	Prosthetic valve endocarditis caused by Histoplasma capsulatum: the first case
		report in Thailand.
PG	-	S262-5
AB	-	The authors report a rare case of fungal endocarditis caused by Histoplasma
		capsulatum in an immunocompetent woman with mitral valve prosthesis. The patient
		presented with chronic fever and embolic phenomenon. Transthoracic and
		transesophageal echocardiography revealed a mobile mass attached to mitral
		prosthetic valve and her blood cultures were negative for both bacteria and
		fungi. The diagnosis was made by presence of budding yeasts in the
		histopathological findings of the vegetation and recovery of H. capsulatum from
		tissue culture of the excised vegetation. The patient was improved after a 6-week
		course of amphotericin B. Fungal endocarditis caused by Histoplama capsulatum is
		rare but should be considered as a possible causative organism in
		"culture-negative endocarditis. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of"
		H. capsulatum endocarditis in Thailand.

TI	-	Epidemiology of histoplasmosis in the French West Indies (Martinique).
PG	-	264-7
AB	-	The Caribbean islands are presumed to be an endemic zone for Histoplasma
		"capsulatum infection, but no epidemiological studies have been done in this area."
		Our purpose was to report the epidemiology of histoplasmosis from 1991 to 1997 in
		the French West Indies (Martinique). Cases identified from the register of the
		mycology laboratory were analysed retrospectively. Ten cases (9 male and 1
		female) were identified; 8 of the patients were infected with HIV (average T4
		lymphocyte count in these 8 patients was 32/mm3). Eight patients had cutaneous
		involvement. The incidence in AIDS patients was 1.7%. The annual incidence in the
		"general population was 0.34/100,000. Our data showed that histoplasmosis is"
		"endemic in Martinique, with an incidence in AIDS patients slightly inferior to"
		that in endemic areas of the USA. The high rate of cutaneous forms (80%) is
		uncommon.

PG	-	411-6
LID	-	10.5326/JAAHA-MS-5799 [doi]
AB	-	Three dogs were examined for clinical signs ultimately attributed to systemic
		"fungal infections. One dog was evaluated for chronic, ulcerated dermal lesions"
		and lymphadenomegaly; one dog was examined for acute onset of unilateral
		blepharospasm; and one dog had diarrhea and hematochezia. Two of the dogs were
		diagnosed with blastomycosis (one with disseminated disease and the other with
		the disease localized to the left eye). The third dog was diagnosed with
		"disseminated histoplasmosis. None of the dogs originated from, or had traveled"
		"to, typical regions endemic for these fungal diseases. All diagnoses were"
		established from histopathology and either polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or
		cytology and culture. The two dogs diagnosed with blastomycosis were treated with
		either itraconazole or ketoconazole with apparent resolution of the infections.
		The dog with ocular involvement had an enucleation prior to beginning therapy.
		The dog diagnosed with histoplasmosis was euthanized without treatment. In
		"patients with characteristic clinical features, systemic fungal infections should"
		still be considered as differential diagnoses regardless of their travel history.

AB	-	"Three male college students from Florida developed acute onsets of fever, chills,"
		"shortness of breath, and cough within one day of each other, and all were"
		eventually hospitalized for four to 29 days. All chest x-ray films showed diffuse
		reticulonodularities in both lung fields. Laboratory studies confirmed the
		diagnosis of histoplasmosis. The three students had been 'spelunking' (cave
		exploring) 6 to 7 days before their onset of symptoms. One of four soil samples
		collected in the caves was positive for Histoplasma capsulatum by the indirect
		mouse inoculation procedure. Of three investigators who entered the implicated
		"caves, two developed acute febrile illness within 15-21 days. One investigator"
		was hospitalized for 18 days with a confirmed diagnosis of histoplasmosis.
		Investigation identified an additional case (the person had entered the caves 6
		"months before this episode), but was not reported to health authorities."
		Spelunkers should be aware of the potential risk of histoplasmosis and how to
		avoid infection. Physicians should be cognizant of cave-associated
		"histoplasmosis, inquire about spelunking in persons who develop febrile"
		"respiratory illnesses with diffuse nodularities on chest x-ray films, and report"
		such cases to their health department. A review of 42 reported outbreaks of
		cave-associated histoplasmosis and the approach to environmental control of
		infected caves are included.

AB	-	STUDY OBJECTIVE: Determine the sensitivity and specificity of
		[F-18]-fluorine-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in
		differentiating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from benign solitary pulmonary
		nodules (SPNs) in a region with a high endemic rate of histoplamosis. DESIGN:
		"Prospective, clinical study. SETTING: University, tertiary referral hospital in"
		the upper Mississippi River valley. PATIENTS: Ninety patients with SPNs.
		"INTERVENTIONS: Independent interpretation of FDG-PET imaging, computed tomography"
		and pathologic evaluation of the SPNs. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: To detect
		"malignant SPNs, FDG-PET imaging had a sensitivity of 93%, a specificity of 40%, a"
		positive predictive value (PPV) of 88% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of
		55%. CONCLUSIONS: In a region with a high prevalence of pulmonary fungal
		"infection, FDG-PET is sensitive but has a low specificity and NPV for identifying"
		"NSCLC. In our study cohort, FDG-PET does not appear to reduce the need for SPN"
		biopsies.

AB	-	Mud runs are an increasingly popular recreational fitness activity across the
		"United States, combining a running race through an obstacle course with"
		submersion in mud. Recent reports estimate 4 million people have participated in
		these types of events over the last 5 years. We describe an atypical case of

		mud run. Although cases of histoplasmosis-associated endocarditis and
		"pericarditis have been reported in the literature, cases of histoplasmosis"
		myocarditis are rare.

		importance of careful history taking in returning travelers since exposure to bat
		(or fowl) excrement can be easily overlooked.

AB	-	"INTRODUCTION: In many settings, the lack of sensitive biomarkers of disseminated"
		histoplasmosis (DH) leads to a clinical reliance on older diagnostic methods and
		delayed treatment initiation. The early recognition of DH is critical for
		"survival, especially in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This"
		study aimed to identify clinical and laboratory findings associated with the
		definitive diagnosis of DH in low-income HIV patients in endemic areas. METHODS:
		Febrile AIDS patients with suspected DH who were admitted to a reference hospital
		in northeastern Brazil from January 2006 to January 2007 were evaluated for
		clinical and laboratory findings associated with DH diagnosis. RESULTS: One
		"hundred seventeen patients with fever were included, and 48 (41%) cases of DH"
		were determined by Histoplasma capsulatum identification. A higher fever
		"(≥38.5ºC), maculopapular/papular rash, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, wheezing,"
		"hemoglobin ≤9.5g/dL, platelets ≤80,000/µL, CD4 count ≤75/µL, aspartate"
		"aminotransferase (AST) level ≥2.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), lactate"
		dehydrogenase (LDH) ≥5times the ULN; and international normalized ratio (INR) >2
		times the ULN were significantly associated with DH. A multivariable analysis
		identified hepatomegaly [adjusted (a) prevalence ratio (PR)= 1.96; 95% confidence
		"interval (CI): 1.21-3.16), CD4 count ≤75/µL (aPR = 2.02; 95% CI: 1.06-3.83), LDH"
		"≥5 times the ULN (aPR = 2.23; 95% CI: 1.44-3.48), and maculopapular/papular rash"
		(aPR = 1.70; 95% CI: 1.02-2.83) were independent risk factors for DH.
		CONCLUSIONS: These easily assessed parameters can facilitate clinical
		decision-making for febrile AIDS patients with suspected DH in low socioeconomic
		and Histoplasma-endemic regions.

TI	-	A large outbreak of histoplasmosis among American travelers associated with a
		"hotel in Acapulco, Mexico, spring 2001."
PG	-	663-9
AB	-	"During spring 2001, college students from Pennsylvania reported an acute febrile"
		"respiratory illness after returning from spring break vacation in Acapulco,"
		Mexico. Acute pulmonary histoplasmosis was presumptively diagnosed and the
		cluster of illness was reported to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention.
		"A large investigation then ensued, which included finding student-travelers for"
		interviews and requesting sera for histoplasmosis testing. We defined a clinical
		"case by fever and at least one of the following: cough, shortness of breath,"
		"chest pain, or headache, in an Acapulco traveler during March-May 2001. A"
		laboratory-confirmed case had positive serology. An initial study determined that
		the likely site of histoplasmosis exposure was Hotel H; we therefore performed a
		"large cohort study among travelers who stayed at Hotel H. Of 757 contacted, 262"
		"(36%) met the clinical case definition. Of 273 serum specimens tested, 148 (54%)"
		"were positive. Frequent use of Hotel H's stairwells, where construction was"
		"ongoing, was associated with increased risk of illness (relative risk = 10.5, 95%"
		confidence interval = 3.7-30.5; P < 0.001). This is the first histoplasmosis
		outbreak associated with a hotel undergoing construction. Hotels in endemic areas
		should consider construction precaution measures to prevent histoplasmosis among
		their guests.

PG	-	835-40
AB	-	"Ophthalmologists are becoming increasingly aware of the need for well-designed,"
		controlled studies to investigate etiology and treatment of ocular conditions.
		"While patients with the conditions of interest, or with characteristics that"
		"place them at high risk of eventual development of such conditions, may be"
		"readily identified in the ophthalmology clinic, identification of appropriate"
		"controls to be used for comparison may be quite difficult. In this article,"
		epidemiologic principles for selection of controls for retrospective
		(case-control) and prospective (cohort) studies are reviewed. Two related
		"studies, a case-control study in which multiple control groups were employed and"
		"a 15-year cohort study of all cases and controls, provided an opportunity to"
		compare controls selected at random from an ophthalmology practice with controls
		selected at random from the general population. Participation rates were higher
		"among office patients selected for study, both in the case-control study and in"
		"the cohort study. In the cohort study, office controls were more likely to lose"
		visual acuity and to develop new degenerative eye conditions. These differences
		between control groups selected from two different sources emphasize the need for
		careful evaluation of potential groups of controls with respect to biases that
		each may bring to interpretation of clinical research findings.

AB	-	HISTORY AND CLINICAL FINDINGS: A 24-year-old woman (student of biology) was part
		"of a study group in Uganda. She developed fever and headache, which was"
		"empirically treated as malaria. After she had returned to Switzerland, a chest"
		x-ray showed bilateral miliary nodular infiltrates. In assumption of an atypical
		"pneumonia, she was treated with levofloxacin, although without success. On"
		"admission, she was in a bad general condition and was markedly dyspneic. Rales"
		"were heard over both lungs. INVESTIGATIONS AND DIAGNOSIS: CRP, liver enzymes and"
		LDH were elevated. A lung function test revealed a marked impairment of the
		diffusion capacity. The chest x-ray showed a progression of the lung infiltrates.
		The informal medical data exchange among the group members by a virtual social
		"network abbreviated our diagnostic workup substantially, since we heard that"
		histoplasmosis had been assumed in another group member. It turned out that the
		affected persons had visited a colony of bats living in a cave inside the trunk
		of a tree. Antibodies against Histoplasma capsulatum were positive. TREATMENT AND
		COURSE: We began a treatment with itraconazole. The condition improved gradually;
		chest x-ray and lung function normalized after the 8 week treatment. CONCLUSION:
		"Histoplasmosis with such a severe course is rare in immunocompetent humans, which"
		indicates that the inoculum must have been very high. Soil contaminated with bats
		guano favours the proliferation of Histoplasma capsulatum. Our case is also an
		illustration of how the widespread use of electronic media can sometimes
		facilitate our work.

TI	-	HIV infection with concomitant cerebral toxoplasmosis and disseminated
		histoplasmosis in a 45-year-old man.
PG	-	51-5
AB	-	Although disseminated histoplasmosis is a common opportunistic infection in HIV
		"patients in endemic areas, it is not widely known in Japan. We report a rare case"
		of a man from Ghana infected with HIV who was hospitalized in Japan and who
		suffered from coinfection with cerebral toxoplasmosis and disseminated
		histoplasmosis. The diagnosis of cerebral toxoplasmosis was confirmed by a brain
		"biopsy, and the therapy for the disease resulted in almost complete resolution of"
		"the brain lesion. However, fever of unknown origin continued for 2 weeks, and"
		disseminated histoplasmosis was diagnosed by examination of a blood smear and by
		the detection of the histoplasma genome in the peripheral blood by means of
		polymerase chain reaction. The isolate was confirmed to be Histoplasma capsulatum
		"var. duboisii. Therapy with amphotericin B was initiated, and no histoplasma"
		"genome in the peripheral blood was detected 3 days later. Unfortunately, the"
		patient died after 10 days from acute respiratory syndrome. This case highlights
		that histoplasmosis should be included in the differential diagnosis of
		opportunistic infections in AIDS patients when patients have a history of travel
		to or arrival from endemic areas.

TI	-	Chronic pulmonary histoplasmosis with an oral lesion.
PG	-	73-6
AB	-	Histoplasmosis is a fungal disease resulting from inhalation of airborne spores
		of the organism Histoplasma capsulatum. The disease is endemic to the Ohio and
		"Mississippi river valleys. Oral lesions are not common, but when present, they"
		are usually associated with the severe disseminated form of histoplasmosis. This
		particular case is presented as an example of chronic pulmonary histoplasmosis in
		which a localized gingival lesion represented the initial clinical manifestation
		of the disease. Diagnosis was based on a positive biopsy and the results of chest
		"radiographic examination. If, as in this case, serologic, hematologic, and"
		"physical examination results are negative, the biopsy of suspicious lesions is of"
		paramount importance to the clinical differential diagnosis.

PG	-	95-8
AB	-	A case is reported of American histoplasmosis due to Histoplasma capsulatum
		presenting as a hepatic granulomatosis. The patient was a young adult from Haiti
		and investigations revealed the presence of an ulcerous enterocolitic suggesting
		tuberculosis or Crohn's disease. The condition became worse after antituberculous
		"therapy and corticoids, and operation was necessary. Extemporaneous histological"
		"examination, of the colonic ulcerations showed Histoplasma capsultaum yeasts. The"
		"patient, who had a cellular immunity deficiency, died during antifungal treatment"
		with amphotericin B of the disseminated histoplasmosis is rare: 1 case in 5000
		"American histoplasmosis cases. Digestive tract lesions, usually detected during"
		"operation or autopsy, are found in about 20% of cases. In the present"
		observations the diagnosis of American histoplasmosis was based on the country of
		"origin of the patient, but this was not confirmed: the immunological reactions"
		were and remained negative and no yeasts were demonstrated after staining of
		"pre-operative biopsy specimens (colon and liver particularly). Also, serial"
		sections conducted after the diagnosis had been established demonstrated the
		presence of Histoplasma capsulatum in the colon sample removed during
		colonoscopy.

PG	-	176-81
AB	-	Histoplasma capsulatum is endemic to the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys.
		Exposure to H. capsulatum is very common in this region and usually follows a
		"benign clinical course. However, immunocompromised hosts, like those with"
		"HIV/AIDS, are more susceptible to symptomatic infection, and have a greater"
		chance of developing disseminated disease. We report an unusual case of a patient
		with AIDS presenting with a single ring-enhancing brain lesion and a focal
		"neurological deficit. Workup was unrevealing, and brain biopsy was felt to"
		represent too much risk as the lesion was located at the right tegmentum. The
		"lesion enlarged over a period of months, and he underwent radiation therapy after"
		the lesion caused obstructive hydrocephalus. He expired soon after completion of
		"radiation therapy. At autopsy, the mass lesion was noted to contain organisms"
		"constant with H. capsulatum, pathologically consistent with a histoplasmoma."

AB	-	"In January 1981, informal surveillance of acute histoplasmosis in Indianapolis,"
		"Indiana, revealed a marked increase in disease activity for the last quarter of"
		1980. Fifty-one patients with onset of acute histoplasmosis during this period
		"were identified through review of hospital admissions, emergency room visits, and"
		serologic records at Indianapolis hospitals and the Indiana State Board of
		"Health. In a retrospective case-control study, the authors found a significant"
		association between developing acute histoplasmosis during this period and
		working or attending classes in a 2 sq mi (5.2 sq km) area encompassing the
		"Indiana University-Purdue University campus (p = 0.015, Fisher's exact test). A"
		review of construction activities on or near the campus during the epidemic
		period suggested that the probable source of infection was excavation activity
		for a large new indoor swimming complex (natatorium). Skin tests and serosurveys
		of students on campus by a newly developed radioimmunoassay for histoplasmal
		immunoglobulin M antibodies supported the association of infection with exposure
		to this site (p less than 0.05).

AB	-	We report a case of bilateral adrenal incidentaloma caused by the capsulatum
		variety of Histoplasma capsulatum diagnosed in a 74 years old man born in and a
		"life time resident of Treviso, Italy, with the exception of two years spent in"
		Pakistan (1964-1966) as a well-driller. The patient was hospitalized in 1995 for
		"alcoholic chronic hepatitis, chronic Helicobacter pylori gastritis and"
		post-infarction ischemic cardiomyopathy. Abdominal ultrasound incidentally showed
		bilateral adrenal masses (the right one 6.3 cm in diameter) confirmed by computed
		"tomography, with adrenal function within normal limits. After three months, the"
		"patient was again hospitalized due to evening fever, asthenia, anorexia, weight"
		loss and occasional hyperhidrosis. Abdominal ultrasound showed an increase of the
		right adrenal lesion with normal adrenal function. Ultrasound-guided fine needle
		"aspiration did not prove useful for diagnosis. Accordingly, a laparotomy with"
		bilateral biopsy was performed; histology showed the presence of numerous tissue
		form cells of H. capsulatum variety capsulatum. Serum anti-H. capsulatum
		"antibodies were negative. Since March, 1996, the patient was given itraconazole"
		"and his symptoms quickly regressed but the computed tomography findings, however,"
		have not changed and the patient has adrenal hypofunction that is being treated
		with cortisone acetate.

AB	-	This paper reports the positive results obtained in the sera of 70 patients with
		"histoplasmosis, the clinical presentation of the disease, and the possibilities"
		for an appropriate follow-up of the clinical course of these patients by means of
		titers of the sera taken during the persistence of the signs and symptoms of the
		disease and following its resolution. The most frequent clinical presentation was
		acute pulmonary disease and the single m precipitation band was found in a higher
		number of sera than the association of h and m bands. The authors report a case
		"diagnosed as acute pulmonary histoplasmosis, that 9 months after a clinically and"
		serologically negative continuum showed again precipitation bands and Histoplasma
		capsulatum was isolated from his oral mucosa lesions. The significance of
		serologic follow-up in patients with histoplasmosis until their total
		negativization and the feasibility of this follow-up by means of the titering of
		sera by the counterimmune electrophoresis technique.

TI	-	Bilateral adrenal [corrected] nodules due to histoplasmosis in an elderly.
PG	-	160-2
AB	-	We report a case history of an 84-year-old elderly male patient that presented
		with a clinical picture suggestive of adrenal failure and bilateral adrenal
		nodules detected by abdominal computed tomography. A fine needle-guided biopsy
		was inconclusive for achieving a final diagnosis. The patient died due to septic
		shock and the autopsy disclosed histoplasmosis with extensive bilateral necrosis
		of the adrenal glands. Although the adrenal involvement in chronic disseminated
		"histoplasmosis has been described, there have been few reports of the infection"
		being associated with adrenal insufficiency.

PG	-	147-9
AB	-	Histoplasmosis is a subcutaneous mycosis caused by dimorphic fungus which is to
		be found in two types: the capsulatum and duboisii types. The capsulatum type has
		had an increasing incidence with the HIV-AIDS epidemics but it is not
		demonstrated that the duboisii one has had the same upward incidence. Signs in
		children and immunocompetent patient are rarely described during this disease.
		The diagnosis is often late in the child as it looks like Molluscum contagiosum
		lesions. We report a case of skin histoplasmosis of duboisii type non associated
		with HIV infection in a child. Diagnosis has been confirmed by a
		histopathological test of a nodule biopsy. Medical treatment was successfully
		based on itraconazol.

PG	-	118-22
AB	-	"Acute histoplasmosis is usually a benign, self-limited infection in endemic"
		areas. Since protection against Histoplasma capsulatum infection requires
		"specific, cell-mediated immunity, histoplasmosis is well documented in patients"
		with acquired T cell deficiencies e.g. due to HIV infection. We report here for
		the first time a case of pleural effusion due to H. capsulatum infection in a
		patient with idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia (ICL). A 25-year-old woman presented
		"with chest pain, dyspnea on exertion and a moderate weight loss. Chest X-ray"
		"showed a large left pleural effusion, and thoracentesis yielded an exudate."
		Histologic examination of pleural biopsies identified H. capsulatum. Laboratory
		tests revealed lymphocytopenia with low CD4+ T cell counts (<100/microl) and a
		"decreased CD4/CD8 ratio. Serology, including HIV, was repeatedly negative. The"
		diagnosis of pleural effusion due to H. capsulatum infection in a patient with
		idiophatic ICL was established. There was no evidence of any other opportunistic
		infection. Treatment with itraconazole was initiated and pleural effusion
		"resolved within 2 weeks of treatment. Moreover, the patient was found to have"
		"idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, as confirmed by the detection of"
		"autoantibodies against thrombocytes. In a 1-year follow-up, the patient remained"
		asymptomatic without relapse or any new infection. Treatment with itraconazole
		was given for 12 months. Because of persistent CD4+ T cell counts below
		"100/microl, prophylactic antibiotic treatment is continued."

PG	-	1533-7
AB	-	Previously reported cases of Histoplasma capsulatum infection of prosthetic heart
		valves have been first diagnosed at autopsy. A patient had an H capsulatum
		infection that was diagnosed by serologic means 1 1/2 years before involvement of
		the patient's prosthetic mitral valve was found at surgery. Numerous previous
		attempts to demonstrate organisms by culture and histologic study of bone marrow
		and liver biopsy specimens were unsuccessful. Various serologic tests were used
		in the diagnosis and evaluation of treatment of H capsulatum endocarditis. The
		management of this case was compared with 29 other previously reported cases of
		endocarditis caused by H capsulatum.

PG	-	135-40
AB	-	A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the prevalence of Histoplasma
		"farciminosum in 2,907 carthorses using clinical and microbiological examinations"
		"at three towns (Debre Zeit, Mojo and Nazareth), Central Ethiopia, between"
		"December 1999 and January 2001. An overall prevalence of 26.2% (762/2,907) was"
		recorded; the highest prevalence (39.1%) being recorded at Mojo whereas the
		lowest (21.1%) was recorded at Nazareth. The difference in prevalence among the
		"three towns was highly significant (chi(2) = 76.92, P<0.0001). Carthorses found"
		"at Mojo [OR =2.4, CI=(1.9-3.0), P<0.0001] and Debre Zeit [OR=1.9, CI=(1.5-2.3),"
		P<0.0001] were at higher risk of infection than those found at Nazareth. The
		mycelial and yeast forms of the Histoplasma capsulatum variety farciminosum were
		isolated on the Sabouraud's dextrose agar. The results of the present study
		showed the rampant occurrence of histoplasmosis farciminosi at the three towns
		and indicates the need for further nationwide investigation into the disease to
		design sound control strategy.

TI	-	Histoplasmosis in the lung of a race horse with yersiniosis.
PG	-	1229-31
AB	-	A 4-year-old female thoroughbred race horse died of acute peritonitis caused by
		necrotizing granulomatous duodenitis. Yersinia enterocolitica was
		immunohistochemically demonstrated in macrophages in granulomas developed in the
		"duodenum, lung, liver and abdominal lymph nodes. The yeast-like fungi were found"
		in the cytoplasmic vacuoles of macrophages in the lung that infiltrated into the
		granulomas and surrounding alveoli with congestive edema. The yeast-like fungi
		were positively stained by Gomori-Grocott chromic acid methenamine silver stain
		"and immuno-histochemically stained with anti-histoplasma antibody. In this case,"
		"it was considered that granulomas formed in the duodenum, lung, liver and"
		abdominal lymph nodes were primarily caused by Yersinia enterocolitica due to
		idiopathic weakening of the immune system. Yeast-like fungi immunohistochemically
		identified as histoplasmas secondarily infected the lung. This is the first case
		regarded as equine histoplasmosis capsulati in Japan.

TI	-	Tissue morphology of Histoplasma capsulatum in acute histoplasmosis.
PG	-	317-20
AB	-	Reports of histopathology in acute histoplasmosis are rare. A case of fulminating
		acute histoplasmosis with hematogenous dissemination is described in which
		Histoplasma capsulatum was identified in transbronchial biopsy. This report
		represents the first morphologic description of H. capsulatum within human
		pulmonary tissue in the early phase of acute histoplasmosis. The yeast forms
		"observed were of typical size, but they were present within the alveoli and were"
		budding. No tissue granulomata were noted. This unusual morphology is in sharp
		contrast to the classic description of the organism in tissues and presented
		"diagnostic difficulties, which are discussed in this report. Hematogenous"
		dissemination is considered to be an important part of the pathogenesis of the
		"disease, but it is rarely documented during the symptomatic phase of acute"
		histoplasmosis. Cultural documentation of hematogenous dissemination was obtained
		in this patient. These observations stress the importance of obtaining culture
		material from extrapulmonary sites early in the course of acute histoplasmosis
		when a specific diagnosis is necessary.

TI	-	A multinational outbreak of histoplasmosis following a biology field trip in the
		Ugandan rainforest.
PG	-	83-7
LID	-	10.1111/jtm.12012 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Outbreaks of histoplasmosis have been increasingly reported in
		association with travel to endemic areas. Multiple outbreaks have been reported
		"following travel to the Americas, but reports of pulmonary histoplasmosis in"
		short-term immunocompetent travelers to Africa are rare. METHODS: A biology
		student was referred to our unit with suspected pulmonary histoplasmosis
		following her return from a field trip in the Ugandan rainforest. The patient
		informed us that several of her multinational student colleagues on the same
		expedition had developed a similar illness. Using an alert in ProMED-mail and a
		"questionnaire forwarded to each of the symptomatic students, we accumulated data"
		on the other cases involved in this apparent outbreak of pulmonary
		histoplasmosis. RESULTS: Thirteen of 24 students developed respiratory symptoms
		following the expedition. Chest X-ray appearances were often suggestive of
		miliary tuberculosis but in most cases a final diagnosis of histoplasmosis was
		"made (confirmed with serology in five cases, clinically diagnosed in six, and"
		retrospectively suspected in two). Detailed questioning indicated that the likely
		source was a large hollow bat-infested tree within the rainforest. CONCLUSIONS:
		This is an unusual outbreak of histoplasmosis following short-term travel to
		Africa. Pulmonary histoplasmosis should always be considered in the differential
		diagnosis of an acute febrile respiratory illness in travelers returning from
		endemic areas or reporting activities suggesting exposure.

AB	-	Ocular histoplasmosis syndrome (OHS) is a significant cause of vision loss in
		young and middle-aged adults. We report here a case of an immunocompetent
		"37-year-old man who presented fever, malaise, headache, and anterior cervical"
		"lymphadenopathy for one week, after which he started to experience a sudden loss"
		in visual acuity of his right eye. Fluorescent angiography and an optical
		coherent tomography demonstrated the presence of a type II choroidal neo-vascular
		"membrane in the right eye, suggesting a diagnosis of OHS. A peripheral blood"
		sample was tested by nested PCR to detect Histoplasma capsulatum using a set of
		primers known to amplify a DNA sequence coding for a specific 100-kDa protein of
		this fungus (Hc100-PCR). The blood sample was Hc100-PCR-positive and sequence
		analysis showed an identity of 97% with the reference sequence. The patient
		"received intravitreal bevacizumab injection and itraconazol therapy, leading to"
		"an improvement in media vision acuity. In this case, the molecular test provided"
		evidence linking the ocular lesions with an earlier infection by H. capsulatum
		and demonstrated that the Hc100-nested PCR assay is a valuable tool in the
		diagnosis of histoplasmosis.

LID	-	10.4103/IJPM.IJPM_898_19 [doi]
AB	-	Histoplasmosis is an opportunistic systemic infection caused by inhaling spores
		of a thermal dimorphic fungus Histoplasma capsulatum. Disseminated histoplasmosis
		is the most common form associated with acquired immune deficiency syndrome
		"(AIDS). However, only a few cases of disseminated histoplasmosis are reported in"
		immuno-competent hosts. Most infections in the immunocompetent hosts are
		asymptomatic or result in mild pulmonary disease. However the presence of
		Disseminated Histoplasmosis in immunocompetent host probably results due to
		prolonged exposure and delayed presentation We report two cases of progressive
		disseminated histoplasmosis in two immunocompetent patients from non-endemic
		"region in Western Rajasthan, India. Also in both the cases, the first diagnosis"
		"was suggested by a peripheral blood smear, which is not a classical biological"
		diagnostic method for fungal infection. Careful examination of Peripheral blood
		smear along with correct clinical history can aid in early diagnosis of
		disseminated histoplasmosis even in immunocompetent patients.

		patients exposed to histoplasmosis develop only subclinical infection. Liver
		"involvement as a part of disseminated histoplasmosis is well known; however,"
		isolated hepatic histoplasmosis without any other stigmata of dissemination is
		extremely rare and the literature is limited to only two case reports. We present
		a rare case of isolated granulomatous hepatitis due to histoplasmosis in a
		35-year-old female with dermatomyositis receiving low-dose prednisone and
		methotrexate. There was no evidence of fungal dissemination elsewhere. High
		clinical suspicion is critical for early diagnosis and treatment.

		underrecognized imported mycosis in Japan.
PG	-	443-5
LID	-	10.1007/s10156-010-0073-5 [doi]
AB	-	Histoplasmosis caused by Histoplasma capsulatum is found worldwide. Japan is
		known to be non-endemic area. Progressive disseminated histoplasmosis (PDH) is a
		severe form of histoplasmosis. We report a case of PDH in a 54-year-old male who
		was not immunocompromised. His last travel history to an endemic region was
		2 years before onset. He was diagnosed as histoplasmosis by 18S rRNA-PCR from
		serum and ascites and immunodiffusion test. We treated him with parental
		"liposomal amphotericin B for 2 weeks then changed to oral itraconazole, which was"
		"continued for 6 months. Rigorous work up, including HIV status, lymphocyte"
		"counts, and adrenal function did not reveal any evidence of immunosuppression of"
		the patient. Our case suggests that PDH can occur in immunocompetent patients as
		"previously described, and must be included in the differential diagnoses if"
		"presentation is consistent. In addition, the skills of travel history taking are"
		emphasized.

PG	-	139-46
AB	-	Progressive disseminated histoplasmosis (PDH) has now been described in acquired
		immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients from areas both endemic and nonendemic
		"for histoplasmosis. We review the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and therapy"
		of PDH in patients with AIDS by comparing 64 patients from our series collected
		retrospectively from Houston and the surrounding area with the case summaries of
		61 patients reported in the medical literature. PDH occurred as the first
		"manifestation of AIDS half of the time. Fever, weight loss, enlargement of the"
		"liver, spleen, or lymph nodes, and anemia were the most common clinical symptoms"
		and signs. Pulmonary symptoms were less common. The chest roentgenogram showed
		diffuse interstitial infiltrates in slightly more than half of the patients. Bone
		"marrow biopsy and culture, examination and culture of pulmonary tissue and"
		"secretions, and blood culture were the most common initial means of establishing"
		a diagnosis. Ketoconazole alone was ineffective in the majority of cases.
		Patients treated with amphotericin B (AMB) in a dose of at least 30 mg/kg
		experienced a significantly longer period of follow-up than those treated with
		"less AMB. However, relapses were observed in four of 16 patients (25%) receiving"
		at least 30 mg/kg of AMB followed by ketoconazole suppression. It appears that
		"long-term suppression with 50 to 100 mg of AMB weekly, after completion of"
		"initial therapy, has the best chance of maintaining a satisfactory functional"
		status.

TI	-	Rapid PCR-based diagnosis of disseminated histoplasmosis in an AIDS patient.
PG	-	821-3
AB	-	Disseminated histoplasmosis is an unusual opportunistic infection in patients
		with advanced HIV infection living outside endemic areas. Diagnosis usually is
		made on the basis of isolation of Histoplasma capsulatum from clinical specimens
		or histologic examination. Reported is the case of an HIV-infected Columbian
		individual in whom the diagnosis of histoplasmosis was established within 24 h of
		collection of an adequate bronchoalveolar lavage specimen. The diagnosis was made
		by detection of specific fungal DNA and confirmed by isolation of Histoplasma
		"capsulatum from blood, bone marrow and respiratory specimens 10 days later. The"
		patient recovered under antifungal treatment and remained asymptomatic up to the
		last follow-up visit 6 months later. The polymerase chain reaction assay might be
		a powerful and rapid diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of non-European invasive
		fungal infections and should be further evaluated.

AB	-	Histoplasmosis is an endemic fungal infection that causes no symptoms or minor
		self-limited illnesses in most cases. Severe forms are commonly reported in
		patients with immunodeficiency disorders; histoplasmosis is considered to be an
		opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS. We report a case of disseminated
		histoplasmosis in a patient with no induced active suppression of the immune
		"response. The infection was fulminant, and antifungal treatment was delayed"
		because of a misdiagnosis of tuberculosis.

		Territory.
PG	-	888-90
AB	-	Endemic histoplasmosis occurs uncommonly in Australia and has not previously been
		"reported in the tropical Northern Territory, nor in Aboriginal Australian"
		patients. We report one suspected and one confirmed case of severe disseminated
		histoplasmosis in Aboriginal Australians from the Northern Territory. Underlying
		"illness included chronic cardiac disease and Type 1 diabetes mellitus,"
		"respectively, and neither patient was infected with HIV. The clinical"
		presentations resembled malignancy. Diagnosis of histoplasmosis was made on the
		"basis of bowel histology in Case 1, demonstrating characteristic yeasts, and"
		lymph node histology and culture in Case 2. Histoplasmosis should be considered
		"in relevant clinical situations, even in HIV-negative patients who have not left"
		Australia.

PG	-	309-311
LID	-	10.4103/IJPM.IJPM_792_18 [doi]
AB	-	Histoplasma capsulatum is an opportunistic dimorphic fungus caused by inhalation
		of spores present in the soil. It is extremely rare in the northern Himalayan
		region of India and is usually asymptomatic. It may rarely progress to
		disseminated histoplasmosis which is usually observed in immunocompromised
		"patients associated with malignancy, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or"
		diabetes. The present case is being reported because of unusual cutaneous
		presentation of disseminated histoplasmosis in an immunocompetent patient of
		non-endemic region. The case also highlights the importance of fine needle
		aspiration cytology for its precise early diagnosis and avoiding of further
		complications.

		out on a presumed 10-year-old Japanese cat showing vomiting and emaciation. On
		"cytologic examination of the mass of the upper abdominal cavity, many yeast-like"
		"organisms were detected in the macrophages. At necropsy, the upper part of colon"
		was markedly dilated with a thickened wall. The lung did not show significant
		"changes. Histologically, severe necrotic and granulomatous lesions were observed"
		"in the colon. In the colonic lesion, the cytoplasm of the macrophages contained"
		"yeast-like organisms with irregularly shaped dots, and the cell walls of these"
		organisms were stained black by Grocott-Gomori methenamine-silver stain.
		"Immunohistochemically, they were found to be positive for anti-histoplasma yeast"
		antibody. This is the first report of feline histoplasmosis in Japan.

AB	-	"Histoplasma infections in Europe are rare, and acute disseminated histoplasmosis"
		has only been observed in immunocompromised persons. We describe a case of acute
		"disseminated histoplasmosis in a young, nonimmunocompromised European woman. The"
		probable source of infection was Sri Lanka or the Maldives. At presentation she
		"was severely ill with fever, lymphadenopathy, anemia, thrombocytopenia,"

		osteosclerosis were observed with extramedullary hematopoiesis. Histoplasma
		capsulatum yeasts were detected in bone marrow trephine biopsy by methenamine
		silver staining. Treatment with conventional and liposomal amphotericin B and
		subsequent itraconazole led to rapid and complete recovery.

TI	-	Diffuse ulcerations due to disseminated histoplasmosis in a patient with HIV.
PG	-	189-91
AB	-	"Disseminated histoplasmosis is a serious disease that affects the skin, lungs,"
		and internal organs. It is one of the diseases that characterize acquired
		"immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and in endemic areas is one of the more"
		commonly observed infections in AIDS patients. The mortality rate in patients
		with AIDS and histoplasmosis is high if untreated. Disseminated histoplasmosis
		"may have a variety of dermatological manifestations. In this article, we provide"
		the first report of diffuse ulcerations due to disseminated histoplasmosis. These
		"ulcers developed while the patient was on stavudine, lamivudine, and indinavir,"
		and had a CD-4 count of 525 mm3. The patient's histoplasmosis resolved with
		itraconazole monotherapy. Histoplasmosis is a well-described opportunistic
		infection that accompanies human-immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. We
		report an unlikely victim of disseminated histoplasmosis who suffered this
		infection while on antiretroviral therapy and with a CD-4 count of 525/mm3.
		"Notably, he had a normal chest x-ray and disseminated cutaneous ulcers. The"
		"diagnosis was made by skin biopsy, and his infection responded promptly to"
		itraconazole therapy. This case serves as a reminder that the immunological
		derangements and cutaneous alterations wrought by HIV remain unpredictable in
		nature and extent.

		patient.
PG	-	102-5
AB	-	A 77 year-old Belgian man was admitted for weight loss and elevated liver
		enzymes. He used to live in Central Africa until 1986 and denied any travel
		outside Belgium during the last decade. Physical examination was unremarkable
		except for a lip ulceration. Blood tests showed increases of liver enzymes and
		"CEA. In the search of an abdominal cancer, CT showed a normal liver but enlarged"
		"surrenal glands, while colonoscopy disclosed multiple mucosal lesions. Colic and"
		lip biopsies identified Histoplasma capsulatum var capsulatum. HIV serology was
		negative. Lymphocyte count was normal but lymphocyte function was depressed. The
		patient dramatically improved under oral treatment with Itraconazole 400 mg daily
		for six months. This case indicates that chronic disseminated Histoplasmosis can
		reactivate in a healthy and apparently non-immunocompromised person living in
		Europe.

		a large skin tear measuring 5 cm × 5 cm was obvious over the dorsal cervical
		region. The patient was previously treated with short-term prednisone that was
		discontinued 6 wk before presentation. Initial diagnostics (complete blood count
		"and biochemistry) did not indicate an endocrine disorder, the most common cause"
		of acquired feline skin fragility. Necropsy revealed diffuse histoplasmosis (most
		"significantly affecting the skin), epidermal atrophy, dermal collagen separation,"
		and infiltration in the dermis and subcutis by inflammatory cells containing
		yeast organisms consistent with Histoplasma spp. Infiltrative fungal infection
		should be considered as a potential cause of acquired feline skin fragility.

		Indianapolis Veterans Administration Hospital had erythema nodosum complicating a
		"histoplasmosis infection. A massive, severe outbreak of histoplasmosis occurred"
		in Indianapolis between September 1978 and August 1979. Four hundred thirty-five
		"laboratory-confirmed cases were reported, although serologic findings suggested"
		"that from 20,000 to 200,000 persons were actually infected. During this epidemic,"
		18 (4.1%) of 435 patients were initially seen with erythema nodosum. Ten of 11
		"patients seen at the Indiana University Medical Center were women, and nine of 11"
		patients were seen during the first half of the epidemic; race was not a
		predisposing factor. Seven of 11 patients had respiratory or rheumatologic
		"complaints. None of these 11 patients had evidence of dissemination, died, or"

AB	-	Histoplasmosis is an infectious disease caused by the inhalation of Histoplasma
		"capsulatum spores, a fungus encountered in many diverse areas around the world."
		"Although this infection is often asymptomatic, it may become dramatic in"
		"immunocompromised patients. In November 2005, an endocarditis due to Histoplasma"
		capsulatum was diagnosed in a French woman treated for rheumatoid arthritis and
		who had traveled to South America 2 years earlier. We confirmed the biological
		"diagnosis by mycological, serological, and histological methods. In spite of"
		"receiving the appropriate treatment, the patient died 3 months later of cardiac"
		"insufficiency. We report here this additional case of Histoplasma endocarditis,"
		by hoping to help rapid and accurate diagnosis of such infections in their early
		"stages of development, in non-endemic areas."

		few cases reported from North-West India. Adrenal histoplasmosis is an even more
		uncommon mycotic disease. We describe five immunocompetent men with adrenal
		histoplasmosis presenting with constitutional symptoms. Four patients had
		"bilateral adrenal involvement, whereas one had unilateral adrenal mass. Three"
		patients had adrenal insufficiency at presentation and the other two developed
		adrenal insufficiencies during follow-up. All the patients received amphotericin
		B and itraconazole treatment which led to symptomatic improvement but adrenal
		insufficiency persisted in all patients at the end of the follow-up.

PG	-	1316-8
AB	-	"A case of pulmonary histoplasmosis, which is rare in Japan, is reported herein. A"
		43-year-old man who had worked in Mexico for 2 years and had come back to Japan 3
		"months earlier, presented at our hospital because of an abnormal shadow on his"
		chest roentogenogram with no symptoms. His chest roentogenogram as well as chest
		computed tomograms revealed a 2-cm-diameter nodule in the anterior basal segment
		of his right lung and an enlargement of the subcarinal lymph node. Although these
		"pictures seemed to indicate an advanced lung cancer, no malignant cells were"
		found based on the brushing cytology findings after bronchoscopy. An exploratory
		thoracoscopic tumor resection and biopsy of the enlarged lymph node led to a
		histological diagnosis of an abscess due to histoplasma. The hospital course was
		"uneventful. Postoperatively, amphotericin B was administered for 1 year. This is"
		the eighth case of pulmonary histoplasmosis reported in Japan. A pulmonary nodule
		together with mediastinal lymphoadenopathy seems to be characteristic in these
		patients. Histoplasmosis should therefore be considered in the differential
		"diagnosis, since overseas travel has now become common-place for the Japanese."

		presenting with an enlargement of the tongue that also exhibited white
		"pseudomembranes. There were also nodular lesions in the dorsum of the tongue,"

		Histoplasma capsulatum. Serology was positive for the histoplasmine antigen. The
		"patient was treated with Itraconazole 200 mg/day, experiencing 40% remission of"
		lesions during the first month of treatment.

		region of fungal rRNA gene from a paraffin-embedded skin sample from a dog in
		Japan.
PG	-	219-24
AB	-	The lesions of histoplasmosis in dogs in Japan differ from those in dogs in North
		America. Affected dogs in Japan have had multiple granulomatous or ulcerated foci
		in skin or gingiva and have not had pulmonary or gastrointestinal lesions. The
		present report introduces a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) diagnosis of canine
		histoplasmosis and the characteristic of disease in Japan. The surgically removed
		skin ulcerate samples from a 5-years-old female Shiba-inu native to Japan without
		traveling out of the country were evaluated. Tissue samples had many yeast-like
		organisms in the macrophages. DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded tissue
		samples. A nested PCR technique was applied. The detected sequence of the
		internal transcribed spacer of ribosomal RNA gene had 99.7% in homology with
		Ajellomyces capsulatus (the teleomorph of Histoplasma capsulatum). Clinical
		"manifestations, historical background of equine epizootic lymphangitis in Japan,"
		and a human autochthonous case of histoplasmosis farciminosi indicated that this
		dog might have been infected with H. capsulatum var. farciminosum as a
		heteroecism.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Histoplasma capsulatum is a dimorphic fungus predominately found in
		soils enriched with bird and bat excreta. Although several cases of
		"histoplasmosis have been reported in India, diagnosis using cytology has been"
		done in very few cases. CASE PRESENTATION: We report here a case of disseminated
		histoplasmosis in a 46-year-old Indian man. CONCLUSION: Skin scrape cytology is a
		"simple, safe, and rapid technique to establish the initial diagnosis, thus"
		"promoting early treatment and favorable outcome, in cutaneous fungal infections."

TI	-	[Disseminated histoplasmosis caused by Histoplasma capsulatum in a renal
		transplant patient: first case report in the Reunion Island].
PG	-	391-4
AB	-	The purpose of this report is to describe the first case of indigenous
		disseminated histoplasmosis caused by Histoplasma capsulatum in a patient on
		immunosuppression 22 months after renal transplantation in the Reunion Island.
		Involvement was predominantly pulmonary and outcome was rapidly fatal. Diagnosis
		based on isolation of characteristic intramacrophagic Histoplasma capsulatum
		yeast cells from bronchoalveolar fluid was delayed since indigenous cases of this
		opportunistic infection were unprecedented. In addition to demonstrating the
		difficulty of achieving diagnosis in places located outside endemic areas without
		"modern facilities, this case underlines the potentially the poor prognosis of"
		disseminated histoplasmosis. This disease should be included in differential
		diagnosis in the Reunion Island where many patients undergo immunosuppresion and
		receive organs shipped in from outside locations.

		immunodeficiency virus infection: case report.
PG	-	E1146; discussion E1146
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: Spinal intramedullary histoplasmosis is an extremely rare condition.
		We report a case of isolated intramedullary histoplasmosis as the initial
		manifestation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. CLINICAL
		PRESENTATION: A 27-year-old man presented with a rapidly progressive paraparesis.
		Magnetic resonance imaging scans revealed an enhancing lesion at C7-T1 with edema
		extending as far as the cervicomedullary junction. He improved with steroid
		medications. INTERVENTION: The patient underwent laminectomy and biopsy of the
		"lesion. The diagnosis of histoplasmosis was made by histology, culture, and"
		polymerase chain reaction identification of fungal deoxyribonucleic acid. The
		"patient did not have disseminated histoplasmosis. Subsequent to the biopsy, the"
		patient was discovered to have HIV infection. CONCLUSION: The isolated spinal
		histoplasmosis lesion thus represented the initial presentation of HIV infection.
		Management of the case and diagnostic issues are discussed.

		immunodeficiency.
PG	-	268-72
AB	-	"Histoplasma capsulatum, a ground fungus, can infect humans, normally in endemic"
		areas; the resulting disease can be asymptomatic or it can have a benign
		"development, but in rare cases it can develop into a serious clinical condition"
		"and can even be fatal. Its most characteristic initial location is in the lungs,"
		"resembling tuberculosis, often accompanied by mediastinitis and an exuberant"
		fibrotic response. The spread of this infection can be caused by the concomitance
		of another illness that alters the immunological balance. Sometimes such an
		"association is not clear. Therefore, disseminated histoplasmosis is defined as a"
		clinical condition where the fungus is present in more than one location. Common
		variable immunodeficiency is characterized by a generalized failure in the
		"synthesis of antibodies, leading the affected individuals to present recurrent"
		"infections, especially those caused by encapsulated bacteria, most often"
		involving the respiratory tract. We studied a serious case of disseminated
		"histoplasmosis, accompanied by common variable immunodeficiency, observed at the"
		Infirmary of the department of Medical Practice of the Federal University at
		Paraná Hospital das Clínicas.

		findings in two cases.
PG	-	422-4
AB	-	Two cases of disseminated histoplasmosis associated with reactive hemophagocytic
		syndrome are described. The clinical presentation was with prolonged unexplained
		"fever and hepatosplenomegaly. On a strong clinical possibility of tuberculosis,"
		"antitubercular treatment was initiated in both patients. Lymph node (case 1),"
		"splenic (case 2), and bone marrow aspiration, however, showed sheets of"
		"proliferating histiocytes, and intracellular and extracellular histoplasma"
		organisms. Aspiration cytology was thus valuable in establishing the final
		diagnosis. The patients had a fulminant clinical course and died of hemorrhagic
		shock within 48 hr of hospital admission before specific therapy could be
		initiated. Histoplasmosis can mimic tuberculosis clinically. There is a need for
		"an increased awareness of the clinicopathological spectrum of histoplasmosis,"
		especially its rarer manifestations as hemophagocytic syndrome. In suspected
		"cases, aspirations from the lymph node, liver, and spleen can be performed safely"
		and should be utilized for early diagnosis.

AB	-	Histoplasmosis is an endemic disease in various regions such as North America and
		South-East Asia but remains rare in Europe. Disseminated histoplasmosis is
		"unusual in HIV-negative patients. Here, we describe a case of disseminated"
		histoplasmosis in an HIV-negative patient diagnosed after oral presentation.

		report.

AB	-	We report a rare case of chronic disseminated histoplasmosis with several
		ulcerated lesions in the oral cavity in an alcoholic patient without human
		"immunodeficiency virus infection, with no detectable signs and symptoms of"
		systemic disease or extraoral manifestations. Histopathological analysis revealed
		chronic inflammatory process with granulomas containing Histoplasma-like
		organisms. The isolation of Histoplasma capsulatum provided the definitive
		diagnosis. Treatment with itraconazole resulted in complete remission of oral
		"lesions. As far we aware, this is the second case report of oral histoplasmosis"
		in an HIV negative patient described in Brazil.

PG	-	69-71
AB	-	Histoplasmosis is a granulomatous disease of worldwide distribution caused by a
		dimorphic fungus Histoplasma capsulatum. Majority of primary infections in
		immunocompetent hosts are asymptomatic or may present with flu-like illness.
		"Histoplasmosis may occur in three forms: (i) Primary acute pulmonary form, (ii)"
		chronic pulmonary and (iii) disseminated form. The manifestations of disseminated
		"form of histoplasmosis are fever, weakness, weight loss, hepatosplenomegaly, and"
		mucocutaneous lesions. The mucosal involvement could be oropharyngeal or
		laryngeal involvement. We report an unusual case of histoplasmosis presenting as
		a laryngeal ulcer in an immunocompetent host.

AB	-	A 7-year-old intact male mixed dog was presented with a history of acute and
		progressive paraparesis. Abnormal clinical signs consisted of non-ambulatory
		"paraparesis, hind limbs hypertonia and severe thoracolumbar pain. Magnetic"
		"resonance imaging demonstrated an isointense in T1 and T2 WI epidural lesion,"
		"with good contrast enhancement, extending from T-10 to T-13. Laminectomy was"
		carried out to remove the epidural mass. Histological examination revealed a
		pyogranulomatous lesion characterized by numerous macrophages containing
		yeast-like Grocott and PAS-positive bodies. Immunohistochemistry and PCR
		performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue confirmed Histoplasma
		capsulatum as the causative agent. H. capsulatum has a worldwide distribution in
		temperate and subtropical climates but its presence as an autochthonous fungus in
		Europe is now recognized. To the authors' knowledge this is the first report of

AB	-	"A 64-year-old man presented with gradual onset of confusion, ataxia and 25-pound"
		weight loss over 3 months. MRI of the brain revealed two enhancing cerebellar
		lesions suspicious for metastases. Positron emission tomography-CT showed
		enhancement of cervical and axillary lymph nodes. Left axillary lymph node biopsy
		showed no evidence of malignancy but instead showed fungal organisms
		morphologically consistent with Histoplasma spp. Disseminated histoplasmosis with
		central nervous system involvement was suspected. Further history revealed that
		the patient had been having subjective fever for the past several months. He has
		"had mild pancytopenia for about 2 years, which had not been further evaluated."
		"Additionally, he had an oesophagogastroduodenoscopy 3 months prior to admission,"
		"which had shown granulomatous gastritis. Subsequently, the diagnosis of"
		disseminated histoplasmosis was confirmed by serological testing and bone marrow
		"biopsy. The patient was started on liposomal amphotericin B. Unfortunately, the"
		patient had a catastrophic stroke and was transitioned to comfort care measures.

AB	-	We present a case of colonic histoplasmosis in a young HIV antibody-positive
		homosexual male who presented with acute diarrhea. The diagnosis was made by
		flexible sigmoidoscopy with biopsy which revealed organisms morphologically
		"consistent with Histoplasma capsulatum, and was later confirmed by fungal culture"
		"of the biopsy specimens. At colonoscopy, skip areas with plaques, ulcers, and a"
		pseudopolyp were observed. The colitis resolved endoscopically after a 6-wk
		"course of intravenous amphotericin B, and the patient has had no recurrence of"
		"symptoms while on maintenance therapy with amphotericin B. However, the organisms"
		continue to be noted on biopsies of normal-appearing areas in the rectum and
		"sigmoid 5 months after diagnosis. Colonic involvement with H. capsulatum, an"
		"organism endemic to the Midwest, may be seen more frequently as the total number"
		of cases of HIV-infected individuals increases in this region.

PG	-	842-4
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Histoplasma capsulatum infection in adults is most often subclinical
		"but can result in disseminated disease with weight loss, fever,"
		"hepatosplenomegaly, and oropharyngeal ulcerations. Genital ulceration as the"
		presenting sign of the disease has been reported rarely. CASE: A 63-year-old
		woman presented with multiple vaginal ulcerations due to chronic disseminated H
		capsulatum infection. Initial diagnosis was made by Papanicolaou and
		Giemsa-stained vulvar smears. Ketoconazole therapy resulted in clearing of the
		lesions in 5 weeks. CONCLUSION: Chronic disseminated histoplasmosis is an
		insidious and potentially fatal disease that can present rarely as genital
		mucocutaneous ulcerations in women. Prompt presumptive diagnosis can be
		"accomplished by examination of smears obtained by ulcer abrasion, permitting"
		institution of appropriate therapy.

PG	-	18-29
AB	-	The involvement of the central nervous system by histoplasma is an infrequent
		complication. The clinical diagnosis is difficult because the microscopic
		examination and the culture of the spinal fluid are frequently negative. In this
		article we report two cases of meningitis by Histoplasma capsulatum in patients
		with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The first case is a meningitis without
		evidence of disseminated histoplasmosis in a patient who had been treated with
		amphotericin B. The histologic appearance was that of a granulomatous
		inflammation of the meninges and the underlying nervous tissue. The second case
		is a disseminated histoplasmosis with involvement of the central nervous system.
		This consists of macrophages filled with histoplasma invading the meninges and
		underlying nervous tissue without associated inflammation.

		hospitalized in France for the treatment of the most severe disseminated type of
		African histoplasmosis (Histoplasma duboisii). In addition to a severe infectious
		"syndrome, the child presented with 3 associated typical involvements: diffuse"
		"lymphadenopathy, skin lesions consisting of nodules of the face and trunk and"
		suppurative osteo-articular lesions with an impressive radiological appearance:
		"extensive bone lysis and metaphyseal fractures, without any sign of bone"
		"reconstruction, even after several months of treatment. This is rare a disease,"
		"but one that should be recognized, especially in its onset localized form, in a"
		patient presenting with infectious osteoarthritis with a torpid evolution leading
		"to the diagnosis of tuberculous or pyogenic infection, or even of osteosarcoma."
		The disseminated lesions may be difficult to distinguish from the multifocal bone
		lesions of sickle-cell disease osteomyelitis.

TI	-	Fatal reactive hemophagocytosis related to disseminated histoplasmosis with
		endocarditis: an unusual case diagnosed at autopsy.
PG	-	208-11
AB	-	Reactive hemophagocytic syndrome (RHS) is an uncommon life-threatening disorder.
		It is believed to be caused by widespread non-neoplastic proliferation and
		"inappropriate activation of mature macrophages, resulting in excessive cytokine"
		activation which leads to hematophagocytosis by cells of the macrophage-monocyte
		lineage and multiorgan dysfunction. RHS may be associated with infections caused
		"by bacterial, viral and fungal organisms as well as lymphoproliferative"
		"disorders, nonhematopoietic malignancies, autoimmune diseases and some"
		therapeutic drugs. Immunosuppression is a frequent underlying condition in RHS.
		The following case presentation describes a patient with a history of chronic
		"hepatitis C, cryoglobulinemia, renal failure and Staphylococcus aureus"
		"perinephric abscess and bacteremia, who, at autopsy, was found to have"
		disseminated histoplasmosis with fungal endocarditis and RHS.

		The Histoplasma capsulatum var. capsulatum infection was probably acquired in a
		previous stay in Equatorial Guinea 45 years before. Diagnosis of mild chronic
		pulmonary histoplasmosis was performed by histopathology of lung biopsy plus
		antibodies detection against H. capsulatum. Treatment with oral itraconazol
		"during three months leaded to a complete clinical cure, and antibodies"
		disappeared after four years of follow up.

		returning from Ecuador.
PG	-	59-62
AB	-	"Exploring caves is, without doubt, a very exciting adventure; however, it carries"
		some dangers. Three of four travellers were admitted to hospital with lung
		"changes after returning from Ecuador, successively. Epidemiological studies"
		"revealed that the travellers visited caves infested by bats, and had contact with"
		"bats' guano. They gave a history of fever, fatigue, myalgia, dry cough, and chest"
		"pain during the stay or just after returning from Ecuador. In two patients,"
		symptoms persisted in mild nature. Chest X-ray films showed diffuse nodules
		(coin-like lesions) in the lungs in each case. Histoplasmosis was taken into
		"consideration. Differential diagnosis included paragonimiasis, pulmonary"
		"tuberculosis, and pulmonary infection of other causes. Direct examination of"
		sputum was negative. Cultures were negative. Final diagnosis was made on
		"epidemiological histories, as well as typical radiological changes, and was"
		supported by positive tests for antibodies to Histoplasma capsulatum.
		"Immunodiffusion test (ID), complement fixation test (CFTs), and Western blot test"
		were positive. In two cases antifungal treatment was established. Ketoconazole
		followed by Itraconazole were used. Persons who are going to explore caves should
		be equipped with anti-dusk masks to prevent pulmonary histoplasmosis. The threat
		of Histoplasma capsulatum infection in bat-inhabited caves should be emphasized
		to travellers and also to physicians.

		"syndrome (AIDS) and disseminated histoplasmosis, with discussion of diagnosis and"
		treatment of this combination. The patient in case 1 developed disseminated
		histoplasmosis as the first significant symptomatic medical condition of his
		"life. The patient in case 2 presented with severe pharyngitis, but without signs"
		or symptoms specific to the lungs. Amphotericin B alone does not eradicate
		histoplasmosis in an AIDS patient. The best therapy at present is a full course
		of amphotericin B followed by a lifetime regimen of ketoconazole to prevent
		"relapse. Family physicians in the District of Columbia, Texas, Maryland,"
		"Louisiana, Missouri, Illinois, Arizona, and Puerto Rico should be particularly"
		vigilant in looking for the combination of these two diseases.

PG	-	388-90
AB	-	A 40-year-old man presented with chronic mouth ulcer for the last six months.
		Histopathological examination of the biopsy from the lesion confirmed a diagnosis
		of histoplasmosis. Although histoplasmosis commonly manifests in
		"immunocompromized patients, like HIV, the present case was negative for HIV."
		Histoplasmosis is endemic in certain parts of the world and it is comparatively
		"rare in the South Asian region, particularly Malaysia. Thirty-seven cases of"
		"histoplasmosis were reported from Malaysia (Ng and Siar, 1996), between July 1967"
		"and October 1997. Despite the apparent rarity of the disease, clinicians and"
		pathologists should be aware of the possibility of histoplasmosis when cases of
		oral ulcer are encountered.

PG	-	1296-8
AB	-	Infective colitis can be a cause of massive lower gastrointestinal bleeding
		requiring acute surgical intervention. Causative organisms include entamoeba and
		"histoplasma species. However, concurrent colonic infection with both these"
		"organisms is very rare, and the in vivo consequences are not known. A 58-year-old"
		male presented initially to the physicians with pyrexia of unknown origin and
		"bloody diarrhea. Amoebic colitis was diagnosed based on biopsies, and he was"
		"treated with metronidazole. Five days later, the patient developed massive lower"
		gastrointestinal bleeding with hemorrhagic shock. Emergency total colectomy with
		"end-ileostomy was performed. However, he deteriorated and died on the second"
		postoperative day. Histopathological examination revealed multiple deep ulcers at
		the hepatic flexure where fungal bodies of mycelial and yeast forms were noted.
		Isolated lymph nodes showed abscess formation with fungal bodies. Infective
		"fungal colitis with Histoplasma capsilatum was diagnosed. In vitro, amoebic"
		parasites can increase virulence and pathogenicity of histoplasma which may
		"account for the fulminant presentation in this patient. Although rare, this"
		unusual dual infection should be considered in the differential diagnosis of
		"infective colitis, as appropriate antimicrobial treatment may prevent progression"
		"to massive lower gastrointestinal bleeding, obviating the need for urgent"
		surgical intervention.

		acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
PG	-	182-5
AB	-	"OBJECTIVE: Presentation of a case of disseminated histoplasmosis, observed in a"
		"non-endemic area, in which cutaneous lesions and fever were the dominant clinical"
		signs of the infection. CASE: A 54-year-old homosexual man with acquired
		immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) related Kaposi's sarcoma presented with
		cutaneous lesions and fever due to disseminated histoplasmosis. The patient was
		successfully treated with itraconazole 200 mg/day. He died after 8 months from
		AIDS dementia complex: disseminated histoplasmosis relapse was not observed.
		CONCLUSION: The case shows that infection with Histoplasma capsulatum must be
		"considered by dermatologists in HIV/AIDS patients, even in non-endemic areas."

		var. capsulatum in an African patient with AIDS (born in Ghana) and living in
		"France. This opportunistic fungal infection has never been reported in Ghana,"
		"maybe because of limited means of investigation or ignorance. Nevertheless, it"
		"was reported in a Ghanaian immigrant living in Italy. In our patient, the first"
		"diagnosis was suggested by a peripheral blood smear, which is not a classical"
		biological diagnostic method. The diagnostic interest and the frequency of
		positive peripheral blood smears in the course of disseminated histoplasmosis are
		probably under estimated.

		"weight loss, fever, and kidney failure. Kidney biopsy showed severe granulomatous"
		interstitial nephritis with numerous giant cells. Silver stains identified fungal
		micro-organisms consistent with Histoplasma species. Despite antifungal
		"treatment, the patient died of overwhelming infection a few weeks later. This"
		report emphasizes the importance of diagnosing histoplasmosis early. A high
		degree of suspicion is required to make the diagnosis of histoplasmosis in a case
		of granulomatous interstitial nephritis.

PG	-	330-2
AB	-	"The usual tissue form of Histoplasma capsulatum is a small intracellular yeast,"
		though extracellular organisms of unusually large size have also been described.
		The production of hyphae in tissue has been regarded as rare and we believe not
		generally appreciated. We report a case of probable Histoplasma endocarditis from
		which an embolus demonstrated abundant mycelial forms on histologic examination.
		Of previously reported cases of H capsulatum endocarditis with detailed
		"pathologic description, nine of 27 cases are found to demonstrate hyphal forms."
		Hyphal structures should be considered a common morphologic variant of H
		capsulatum in intravascular lesions.

		carcinoma.
PG	-	871-3
AB	-	Histoplasmosis is a usually asymptomatic deep fungal infection of tropical origin
		"with respiratory entry and possible oral, pharyngeal, or metastatic localization."
		The condition represents an important imported systemic mycosis with oral
		involvement. We report the case of a patient who developed an oropharyngeal
		reactivation of a latent Histoplasma infection after receiving local antitumoral
		radiation therapy of the neck. H capsulatum was shown to be present in the lesion
		"by both histopathology and staining, and was deduced to be the causative organism"
		of the disease.

PG	-	161-164
AB	-	Refractory hypoxemia secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is
		associated with high mortality. Extracorporeal membraneoxygenation (ECMO) is an
		accepted strategy for treating refractory hypoxemia in patients with ARDS but is
		relatively contraindicated in the setting of systemic infections. We present a
		case of successful ECMO use in a host with refractory hypoxemia secondary to
		disseminated histoplasmosis with fungemia and discuss our management approach to
		this difficult patient.

PG	-	777-81
AB	-	Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of a solitary subcutaneous nodule in the
		upper arm of a patient being treated with corticosteroids for chronic obstructive
		"pulmonary disease contained numerous spherical, unstained, refractile particles"
		mixed with necrotic cellular material and rare intact histiocytes with yeastlike
		inclusions. The morphology of the extracytoplasmic spheroids and cytoplasmic
		"inclusions, as demonstrated with Gomori methenamine silver stain, was"
		characteristic of Histoplasma capsulatum var capsulatum. This organism's
		identification was confirmed by excisional biopsy and microbiologic testing. If
		"the characteristic intrahistiocytic, yeastlike forms are rare or absent,"
		"recognition of this peculiar, uncommonly encountered extracellular pattern is"
		crucial to the diagnosis of infection with H capsulatum. This pattern may become
		more common with increased numbers of immunosuppressed patients and increased use
		of FNAB.

PG	-	478-80
AB	-	A 5-year-old male Siberian husky bred outdoor in Tokyo had a swollen paw with
		interdigital granulomatous lesions in the left hindlimb. The dog had no apparent
		pulmonary or gastrointestinal involvement. Histopathological analysis of the skin
		lesions demonstrated yeast-like organisms predominantly within macrophages.
		Sequence analysis of fungal ribosome RNA gene isolated from a paraffin sample
		revealed a 100% homology with the teleomorph of Histoplasma capsulatum. The
		present case may support the concept of primary cutaneous canine histoplasmosis
		as an endemic phenotype recognized in Japan.

PG	-	140-6
AB	-	The authors report a case of a 35-year-old man with acquired immunodeficiency
		syndrome (AIDS) and a left colonic mass with Histoplasma capsulatum (H.
		capsulatum). The look-up performed looking for disseminated infection was
		"negative. In the absence of positive cultures, the diagnosis was determined"
		morphologically based on the presence of yeast observed by light and electron
		microscopy. The diagnosis was also verified by positive immunofluorescence using
		specific anti-Histoplasma antibodies. Gastrointestinal histoplasmosis is a
		"frequent complication of AIDS, particularly in some endemic areas of America."
		Association with a disseminated mycotic infection is then common. Histoplasmosis
		is less frequently diagnosed in Europe and isolated involvement of the colon is
		"exceptional. When the mycological study is not performed or is negative, only"
		morphological and immunohistochemical methods are able to establish the diagnosis
		and eliminate other mycotic diseases occurring during AIDS.

AB	-	The purpose of this report is to describe the first Cameroonian case of
		disseminated histoplasmosis due to Histoplasma capsulatum capsulatum in
		association with HIV infection. The patient was a 34-year-old HIV1 infected
		woman. Diagnosis of histoplamosis was made in post-mortem. The similarity of the
		clinical symptoms with disseminated tuberculosis makes diagnosis of mycosis
		difficult. Active and effective care of histoplasmosis is urgently necessary for
		the HIV infected persons.

PG	-	258-60
AB	-	"Histoplasmosis is endemic in certain areas of North, Central, and South America,"
		especially within the Ohio and Mississippi River Valleys of the United States. We
		describe a case of histoplasmosis in a farm-dwelling resident of Kentucky who
		"probably had multiple prior opportunities for exposure. However, during the"
		"gathering of topsoil containing chicken droppings for use as fertilizer, he was"
		likely to have been exposed to such a high inoculum of the organism that he
		developed a severe pulmonary infection. He presented with a one-week history of
		"malaise, myalgias, fever to 103 degrees F, and headaches. A chest X-ray showed"
		bilateral reticulonodular infiltrates. He was initially treated for
		"community-acquired pneumonia. When his symptoms did not resolve, a bronchoscopy"
		was performed. Washings from the broncho-alveolar lavage grew Histoplasma
		"capsulatum, and he responded well to itraconazole therapy. This case is presented"
		to emphasize risks from high-inoculum exposure and the hazard imposed by
		harvesting certain types of organic material for use as fertilizer.

TI	-	Clinical evidence of spinal and cerebral histoplasmosis twenty years after renal
		transplantation.
PG	-	692-5
AB	-	Disseminated infection with Histoplasma capsulatum frequently involves the
		"nervous system, but the CNS process is generally not clinically apparent. We"
		report an unusual case of a renal transplant recipient with long-standing
		immunosuppression who presented with clinical evidence of mass lesions in both
		"his cerebral cortex and his spinal cord. Findings of CSF examination were normal,"
		but stereotaxic biopsies of his cortical lesions demonstrated yeast forms and
		cultures of biopsy specimens yielded H. capsulatum. Clinical defects referable to
		both the cortical and spinal lesions decreased in severity after the patient
		received antifungal therapy. Our case illustrates that disseminated
		histoplasmosis can present in myriad ways and that widespread disease in the CNS
		can be occult in immunocompromised patients.

TI	-	Histoplasmosis presenting with progressively worsening backache--a case report.
PG	-	656-8
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Bilateral adrenal enlargement is often the result of disseminated
		"malignant disease, and this diagnosis is particularly likely in a patient with"
		severe weight loss. We describe a case with bilateral adrenal enlargement
		presenting with progressively worsening backache as a prominent symptom. CLINICAL
		PICTURE: A 55-year-old man presented with intermittent low back pain which was
		"progressively worsening, fever, anorexia, low back pain and a 10-kg weight loss."
		He had underlying diabetes mellitus and ischaemic heart disease. He gave a
		"history of travel to caves for worship. Clinically, the most significant findings"
		included nodular lesions in the anterior fauces and left palatoglossal region.
		Computed tomographic scan revealed bilateral adrenal masses. Biopsies were taken
		"from the palatal nodules, which revealed histiocytes with numerous histoplasma"
		organisms. TREATMENT: He was commenced on itraconazole 200 mg daily for a period
		of 9 months. There was a dramatic initial response with settling of his fever and
		this was followed by subjective improvement in his well-being. OUTCOME: He is
		presently on follow-up and has completed 9 months of itraconazole therapy with
		resolution of all his symptoms and has gained about 10 kg of weight.

		"mimicking neoplasm: difficulties in diagnosis, failure in management]."
PG	-	389-93
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Infection with Histoplasma capsulatum (Hc) is a rare importing
		"disease in metropolitan France, the most often minor but sometimes letal in its"
		"spread form. EXEGESIS: A 58 years old French man, HIV seronegative, was admitted"
		"for an alteration of its general condition, disorder and buccal ulcerations. He"
		had a prostate cancer history and came back in France after 17 years in Central
		"Africa. The imaging showed numerous cerebral nodes, a bilateral adrenal tumor,"
		and pulmonary calcifications. Histoplasmosis diagnosis has been done after
		neurosurgical cerebral biopsy which displayed characteristic Hc. The sick man
		"died 4 months later with multivisceral failures, in spite of amphotericine B"
		treatment followed by oral then intraveinous itraconazole. CONCLUSION: Even in an
		"old tropical residence, ones can be able to conjure up a deep exotic fungal"
		"infection, and most specifically Hc histoplasmosis, in front of meaningful"
		multivisceral lesions. Disseminated histoplasmosis (HD) with neurological
		"location is misleading, mimicking tuberculosis or cancer. In order to obtain"
		"formal mycological evidence, ones have to make adapted biopsies. Antifungal"
		"agents must take into account medicinal interaction. Therefore, prognosis is bad,"
		"according to inoculum, immunodeficiency, age of disease and diagnosis delay."

		years after returning from an endemic area].
PG	-	567-70
AB	-	We report the case of a Spanish nonimmunosuppressed patient who was a chronic
		alcoholic and who developed chronic cavitary pulmonary histoplasmosis. He had
		been living in Venezuela until 10 years ago. The diagnosis was established when
		Histoplasma capsulatum was cultured from bronchoscopy samples. The patient was
		treated with itraconazole and progressed favorably until cure. This case suggests
		"that histoplasmosis can reactivate years after exposure, even when significant"
		immunodeficiency is not present. In the absence of another immunosuppressive
		"factor, alcoholism may have played a role in the development of the condition."

PG	-	89-93
AB	-	"The epidemiological, clinical and therapeutical findings are described in a case"
		"of recurrent pulmonary histoplasmosis due to Histoplasma capsulatum. The patient,"
		"a bulldozer-operator, worked in Africa for a long period in extremely dusty"
		conditions without any protection. Three different episodes of H. capsulatum
		pneumonia recurred during eighteen months after his return from Africa. A full
		dose treatment by Amphotericin B failed to eliminate disease recurrence on three
		occasions. The high concentration of airborne H. capsulatum spores inhaled could
		have been the main cause of the difficulty obtaining a rapid sterilization of the
		microorganism by Amphotericin B and disease recurrence. The late start of the
		treatment or the unexplained ability of some persons to develop repeated
		infections even with normal immunological parameters could be another explanation
		for the reported phenomenon.

		lymphadenopathy.
PG	-	"37-8, 40"
AB	-	Intrathoracic lymphadenopathy is a common clinical problem encountered in
		Histoplasma endemic zones. It is challenging for clinicians to distinguish the
		infectious lesions from the neoplastic ones. Bronchoscopy with or without lung
		sampling and transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) is commonly the first
		"diagnostic procedure employed. If non-diagnostic, the next step is usually"
		"surgical biopsy. In our experience, a significant number of patients who go for"
		surgical biopsy are diagnosed with histoplasmosis. A positron emission tomography
		(PET) scan with dual-time imaging may help us distinguish benign from malignant
		"lesions, thus obviating the need for surgical sampling. We report a case of a"
		young female who presented with progressively increasing intrathoracic
		"lymphadenopathy and was treated successfully based on dual-time PET scan results,"
		without proceeding to surgical lung biopsy.

AB	-	"We have studied eight patients, six children and two adults, during a"
		microepidemic of soil- and patient-proven histoplasmosis. Pulmonary function
		"tests were performed between the 15th and 23rd days after the onset of symptoms,"
		"and repeated between the fifth and sixth, the ninth and tenth and the 15th and"
		22nd months afterward. Initial abnormalities were mild in seven cases and severe
		in one. There was a restrictive pattern in three cases and an obstructive pattern
		in two. The fraction of CO extraction was reduced in five cases and the diffusing
		capacity for CO was reduced in five of six cases so tested. Hypoxemia was present
		"in three cases. On follow-up, the obstructive defect had disappeared by the sixth"
		"month, the restrictive pattern by the tenth month, and the diffusing defect still"
		remained in three cases by the end of follow-up. Hypoxemia remained only in the
		severe case.

TI	-	Disseminated histoplasmosis in a patient from a nonendemic area who has acquired
		immunodeficiency syndrome.
PG	-	651-3
AB	-	Disseminated histoplasmosis is a serious opportunistic infection in patients with
		"the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), often seen as the first"
		"manifestation of the syndrome. However, cases are reported almost exclusively"
		from patients who live in or have traveled to endemic areas. We describe a case
		of disseminated histoplasmosis in a black woman with a 50-lb weight loss and
		marked weakness that occurred over a 6-month period. This case is one of the few
		in which disseminated histoplasmosis occurred as the first manifestation of AIDS
		in a patient in a nonendemic area. We believe it to be the first case reported in
		Michigan in which the patient has no history of prior residence in an endemic
		area. Disseminated histoplasmosis should be suspected in patients with AIDS and
		"unexplained febrile illness, even in nonendemic areas."

TI	-	Histoplasmosis as a late infectious complication following heart transplantation
		in a patient with Chagas' disease.
PG	-	403-8
AB	-	Infectious complications following heart transplantation are an important cause
		"of morbidity and mortality. Generally, bacterial infections are predominant;"
		"however, fungal infections can be responsible for up to 25% of infectious events."
		We report the case of a patient who presented with histoplasmosis as an
		infectious complication five years after heart transplantation due to a chagasic
		cardiopathy. This association has rarely been reported in the international
		literature.

PG	-	1359-64
AB	-	"Eight Chilean teenagers traveled to Ecuador in January 1999, where they were"
		"bitten by mosquitoes, had contact with parakeets and lodged in poorly hygienic"
		places; 6/8 visited for 5-10 minutes the interior of a bat cave. About a week
		"later these 6 began with headache, myalgia and fever that lasted 2-3 weeks. 5/6"
		had dry cough with no respiratory distress. The index case was seen in the 2nd
		week of symptoms. A chest x-ray showed multiple nodular infiltrates as in the
		"other five. Two had histoplasma serology, one was negative and the other positive"
		at a low titer; histoplasmin skin test showed induration of 17-27 mm in all six.
		An acute histoplasmosis with massive exposure was diagnosed and treated with
		itraconazole for 3 weeks. All became asymptomatic and chest x-rays returned to
		"normal. Histoplasmosis (non existent endogenously in Chile) is, among other"
		"geographic and tropical diseases, a risk for Chilean travelers. Awareness of this"
		in the general population and development of expertise in these diseases by local
		health care providers is required.

TI	-	Bilateral adrenal masses as the sole clinical key for diagnosing a Histoplasma
		capsulatum infection.
PG	-	242-5
AB	-	We describe a case of a 52-year-old man presenting with bilateral adrenal masses.
		"A Histoplasma capsulatum infection was diagnosed on the basis of culture,"
		"pathological findings, Histoplasma antigen detection and molecular testing. The"
		patient was treated with itraconazole and initially showed a good response.
		"However, after discontinuation of one year of therapy, a relapse was seen and"
		therapy was restarted. This case illustrates that histoplasmosis should be
		considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with bilateral
		"adrenal enlargement. Of all the diagnostic tests that are available, serology and"
		antigen detection are the only rapid and non-invasive tests. Antigen detection
		can also be used for further follow-up of the disease.

TI	-	Disseminated histoplasmosis presenting as bilateral adrenal masses.
PG	-	254-56
AB	-	Histoplasma capsulatum is a universal dimorphic fungus found mainly in soil
		contaminated with excrement of birds and bats. Bilateral adrenal masses with
		massive tissue destruction are a rare primary presentation of disseminated
		histoplasmosis. As it behaves as an opportunistic pathogen there is a higher
		susceptibility for dissemination on those patients with immunodeficiency or
		immunosuppression. We report a case in an elderly diabetic patient with bilateral
		"adrenal enlargement, diagnosed as histoplasmosis only after surgical exploration,"
		with symptoms probably occurring at least 60 years after the original infection.
		She was successfully treated with itraconazole.

AB	-	The purpose of this report is to describe the results of a prospective study on
		pulmonary histoplasmosis in French Guiana. Chest radiographs were performed in
		232 French legionnaires returning from a two-year assignment in French Guiana.
		Further examinations were performed in a total of 8 subjects in whom chest
		radiographs demonstrated the presence of nodules in the lungs. No evidence of
		cancer or tuberculosis was found. Findings confirmed histoplasmomas in two cases
		and demonstrated probable histoplasmosis nodules in 6 cases including three
		involving calcified lesions. Five of these eight patients had been in high-risk
		rain forest environments. Pulmonary histoplasmosis should be considered as a
		possible diagnosis in subjects returning from endemic zones. Confirmation depends
		on a spectrum of findings. Calcified nodules require only radiographic
		surveillance with follow-up at six months. Non-calcified nodules require further
		"investigation including CT-scan, bronchoscopy, and serological tests. Surgical"
		biopsy may be necessary to achieve exact histological and mycological
		identification of the lesion and is recommended in smokers.

PG	-	191-2
AB	-	Disseminated histoplasmosis is the most serious form of the disease produced by
		the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum. Histoplasmosis was first described by Darling
		"in 1906, and it is endemic in certain areas of Central and Southeastern regions"
		"of USA, and most Latin America countries, including the Pampa húmeda and"
		"Mesopotamia regions in Argentina, but in other continents it has a limited"
		"regional distribution. Lung involvement predominates in 90% of cases, but H."
		capsulatum may involve bone and soft tissues. Bone lesions without other signs of
		"infection are very rare, and are often misdiagnosed as cancer. We report a case"
		of disseminated histoplasmosis in a man with a myelodysplasia who presented a
		"left tibial abscess, without any clinical evidence of pulmonary involvement. The"
		patient was successfully treated with itraconazole.

AB	-	The advent of AIDS has resulted in an increase in diseases which were previously
		"rare. In HIV-infected subjects, histoplasmosis takes a disseminated and"
		"particularly severe form, with a fatal outcome in our country, the more so"
		because the clinical presentation resembles tuberculosis and is generally treated
		as such. The authors report a case of disseminated histoplasmosis in a patient
		"dually-reactive to HIV-1 and HIV-2, in whom the clinical presentation was fever,"
		mediastinal lymphadenopathy and pulmonary infiltrates. The diagnosis of
		histoplasmosis was made at autopsy.

TI	-	Proton-beam irradiation of subfoveal choroidal neovascular membranes in presumed
		ocular histoplasmosis syndrome: a case report.
PG	-	493-9
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome (POHS) refers to a
		choroidopathy that is characterized by the presence of multiple peripheral
		"atrophic chorioretinal scars, peri-papillary atrophy, and choroidal neovascular"
		"membranes (CNVM), usually in or adjacent to the fovea. In the United States, POHS"
		is an important cause of loss of central visual acuity in patients between the
		ages of 20 and 50 years. A number of treatment options for subfoveal and
		"juxtafoveal CNVMs in POHS have been under investigation, including laser"
		"photocoagulation, surgical excision of the CNVM, and radiation therapy. CASE"
		REPORT: A 28-year-old women was referred to our office reporting decreased depth
		perception and finger-counting vision in the right eye for the duration of 1
		month. A diagnosis of POHS with subfoveal CNVM was made and the patient was
		referred for an experimental protocol of proton-beam irradiation. Four months
		"after her initial visit, the patient returned, reporting blurry vision with a"
		blind spot in her left eye. A subfoveal CNVM in the left eye was subsequently
		"treated with irradiation as well. Seven months after the initial treatment,"
		visual acuities were 20/20 in each treated eye. CONCLUSION: Although is currently
		"an experimental procedure, proton-beam irradiation appears to be a promising"
		treatment for subfoveal CNVM in patients with POHS.

TI	-	Histoplasmosis presenting as acute respiratory distress syndrome after exposure
		to bat feces in a home basement.
PG	-	103-6
AB	-	This report describes the clinical and epidemiological findings of an outbreak of
		"histoplasmosis in Brazil involving four persons of the same family, one adult and"
		three children. Contamination by fecal material of bats in the basement of the
		house was found to be the most likely cause of this outbreak. None of the
		patients had evidence of immune deficiency. The adult died of acute respiratory
		distress syndrome. A more severe presentation of the disease in this patient may
		be partly explained by a heavier exposure to the feces of bats.

PG	-	341-3
AB	-	The cytologic findings in a case of disseminated histoplasmosis diagnosed by fine
		needle aspiration (FNA) of the adrenal gland are presented. Bilateral adrenal
		enlargement was discovered on CT scan in a patient whose systemic symptoms had
		"been attributed to tuberculosis, but were resistant to antituberculous"
		chemotherapy. The aspirate contained numerous histiocytes containing
		intracytoplasmic organisms with the morphologic features of Histoplasma
		capsulatum. The case shows that radiographically directed FNA of the adrenal
		"gland, which has been recognized as a valuable aid in the confirmation of primary"
		"and secondary neoplasia, may also be quite useful in the less common setting of"
		infectious disease involving this organ.

TI	-	[A case of AIDS-associated histoplasmosis in Germany].
PG	-	325-9
AB	-	In a thirty-year-old patient with AIDS the diagnosis of disseminated
		histoplasmosis was established via biopsy and culture. The patient had grown up
		"in Argentina, where histoplasmosis is endemic. He had not been in an endemic"
		region during the last two years anteceding the manifestation of systemic
		"histoplasmosis. Accordingly, in patients with a progressive immunodeficiency"
		"syndrome, reactivation of a former (possibly inapparent) infection with"
		Histoplasma capsulatum must be considered. Therapy with Amphotericin B lead to a
		"remarkable improvement of clinical, laboratory and sonographic findings. Due to"
		the fact that total eradication of H. capsulatum from the infected host cannot be
		"achieved with any known drug regimen, a life-long follow-up therapy was begun."
		The patient showed no signs of relapse after a follow-up of 7 months.

PG	-	700-3
AB	-	Disseminated histoplasmosis is frequent in patients with HIV infection from
		endemic zones of Africa and South America. It is infrequent in Europe. Four cases
		"diagnosed as disseminated histoplasmosis among a total of 1,100 AIDS cases"
		reported from 1984 to 1994 were reviewed. Four males with a mean age of 40 years
		"were reviewed. Two were from Argentina, one from Gambia with HIV-2 infection and"
		the remaining case was a Spanish man who had made numerous travels to endemic
		zones. Prolonged fever without an apparent focci in the previous weeks was the
		clinical manifestation at the onset in all the cases. Diagnosis was performed by
		"bone marrow aspirate (1 case), histologic study of the cutaneous lesions (1 case)"
		and on autopsy with the diagnosis not being suspected during life (2 cases).
		Tracheal ulcers and hyperferritinemia are the main peculiarities of the two cases
		presented. Antifungal treatment with amphotericin B and secondary prophylaxis
		with itraconazole were effective in one of the cases. It is important to take
		histoplasmosis into account in the differential diagnosis of prolonged fever in
		patients with HIV infection from endemic zones.

		"infection in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). However,"
		cases reported in the literature have been predominantly in adult patients. Here
		"we report an infant with AIDS who presented with fever, cough, rhinorrhea,"
		"hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia and coagulopathy, and died of respiratory"
		failure. Autopsy revealed disseminated histoplasmosis involving multiple organs
		"including lungs, intestines, liver, spleen, bone marrow, lymph nodes, kidneys,"
		and meninges. The diagnosis was established based on histomorphology and
		confirmed by blood culture.

TI	-	Combined ketoconazole and amphotericin B treatment of acute disseminated
		histoplasmosis in a renal allograft recipient.
PG	-	1368-70
AB	-	We have reported the first case of successful treatment of disseminated
		histoplasmosis in a renal allograft recipient using a short course (14 days) of
		amphotericin B in combination with prolonged therapy (161 days) with
		ketoconazole. This regimen should decrease the risk of antibiotic induced
		"nephrotoxicity, but it requires further study. Five days of treatment with"
		ketoconazole alone was ineffective in our patient's infection. Our protocol might
		"not be as efficacious in patients who are more profoundly immunocompromised, eg,"
		bone marrow allograft recipients. Because relapse of histoplasmosis may occur as
		"long as nine years after treatment, immunocompromised patients being treated with"
		ketoconazole must have close long-term clinical follow-up.

		hemodialysis patient that presented with fever of unknown origin and had an
		"unremarkable physical examination. During the investigation, a Gallium scan"
		showed uptake in the oral cavity and soon after the oral cavity examination
		revealed a granulomatous lesion on the tooth 26. Histopathologic findings were
		compatible with histoplasmosis. The treatment regimen included liposomal
		"amphotericin B followed by itraconazole consolidation therapy, and side effects"
		did not occur. Both clinical evolution and outcome were favorable. Oral
		histoplasmosis in a non-immunosuppressed patient is extremely rare.

AB	-	Acute disseminated histoplasmosis is a frequent condition in HIV carriers.
		Thirty-five cases of endocarditis caused by Histoplasma capsulatum have been
		"reported in international literature, and all these descriptions correspond to a"
		context of subacute disseminated histoplasmosis. This paper presents the case of
		"a HIV-positive patient with fever, dyspnea, weight loss, vomiting and"
		polyadenopathies to whom histoplasmosis was diagnosed following blood-cultures
		"and isolation of the agent responsible for cutaneous lesions, and in whom"
		aortic-valve vegetations were found during an echocardiogram. The patient was
		treated with amphotericin B and had a good outcome; subsequent echocardiograms
		"showed no vegetations. Literature on the subject is reviewed, with special"
		emphasis on diagnosis and treatment of previously described cases.

TI	-	Histoplasmosis in solid organ transplant recipients: 10 years of experience at a
		large transplant center in an endemic area.
PG	-	710-6
LID	-	10.1086/604712 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Many clinical scenarios have been encountered by patients who
		developed histoplasmosis after receiving a solid organ transplant at a large
		transplant center in an endemic area. METHODS: Cases of posttransplantation
		"histoplasmosis were identified by use of multiple methods, including reviews of"
		"microbiology test results, transplant databases, and billing codes. Data were"
		obtained retrospectively. Descriptive statistics were used. RESULTS: During the
		"1997-2007 study period, 3436 patients received a solid organ transplant, and 38"
		patients were identified as having posttransplantation histoplasmosis. Of these
		"38 patients, 9 were excluded from our study because the diagnosis was solely"
		"clinical. Of the remaining 29 patients, 14 had posttransplantation histoplasmosis"
		"(incidence, 1 case per 1000 person-years); 14 showed histologic evidence of"
		"histoplasmosis in the recipient or donor tissue, which was encountered"
		unexpectedly at the time of transplantation; and 1 had histoplasmosis before
		receiving the transplant. Of the 14 patients who developed histoplasmosis after
		"transplantation, 5 were heart transplant recipients, 3 were lung transplant"
		"recipients, 3 were kidney transplant recipients, 1 was a liver transplant"
		"recipient, 1 was a pancreas transplant recipient, and 1 was a kidney-pancreas"
		transplant recipient. The median time from transplantation to diagnosis was 17
		"months (interquartile range, 8.1-46 months), and the median time from onset of"
		"symptoms to diagnosis 3 weeks (interquartile range, 1.9-6.5 weeks). All"
		recipients had disseminated disease. The most common treatment was amphotericin B
		"and itraconazole. All were cured, or still on treatment, but symptom-free. Of the"
		14 patients who had an explanted organ or donor tissue that showed histologic
		"evidence of histoplasmosis, 13 (93%) were lung transplant recipients, and 1 (7%)"
		was a liver transplant recipient. None of these patients developed active
		"histoplasmosis, but all received prophylactic treatment. Finally, 1 patient had"
		histoplasmosis before transplantation; he was treated with itraconazole 3 months
		"before and after transplantation, and he did well. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion,"
		posttransplantation histoplasmosis is rare (1 case per 1000
		"transplant-person-years; 95% confidence interval, 0.6-1.7), even in endemic"
		areas. Prognosis is good but requires protracted therapy. Patients with latent
		infection did not develop posttransplantation histoplasmosis when prophylaxis was
		used.

TI	-	Mediastinal histoplasmosis presenting with esophageal involvement and dysphagia:
		case study.
PG	-	53-8
AB	-	"Esophageal involvement with histoplasmosis is uncommon, but has been recognized"
		"in two clinical settings. Most commonly, the esophagus becomes involved as a"
		result of contiguous mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Such patients usually present
		with dysphagia secondary to midesophageal compression or stricture. The esophagus
		can also be involved in cases of disseminated histoplasmosis. Esophageal ulcers
		or nodular lesions are the usual clinical manifestations in this setting. We
		report a case of mediastinal histoplasmosis with esophageal narrowing and mucosal
		ulceration that presented with dysphagia. The diagnosis was established at
		thoracotomy by the histologic finding of necrotizing granulomas and a positive
		fungal stain. The case was successfully treated with amphotericin B. The
		literature on esophageal and gastrointestinal histoplasmosis is reviewed.

TI	-	[Disseminated histoplasmosis: 2 cases in patients with human immunodeficiency
		virus infection in French Guiana].
PG	-	767-70
AB	-	The authors report two cases of disseminated histoplasmosis occurring in
		HIV-infected patients living in French Guiana. The first case was an acute
		disseminated histoplasmosis with a rapid fatal evolution. The second case was
		"diagnosed on a mucosal localisation, and improved under itraconazole therapy."
		These two cases show the diversity of the clinical course of this opportunistic
		infection. The authors focus on the difficulty of the diagnosis and the need for
		direct microscopic examination to identify histoplasma and to enable a swift
		therapeutic intervention.

LID	-	186-193
AB	-	Infective endocarditis is an uncommon manifestation of infection with Histoplasma
		"capsulatum. The diagnosis is frequently missed, and outcomes historically have"
		been poor. We present 14 cases of Histoplasma endocarditis seen in the last
		"decade at medical centers throughout the United States. All patients were men,"
		and 10 of the 14 had an infected prosthetic aortic valve. One patient had an
		infected left atrial myxoma. Symptoms were present a median of 7 weeks before the
		diagnosis was established. Blood cultures yielded H. capsulatum in only 6 (43%)
		patients. Histoplasma antigen was present in urine and/or serum in all but 3 of
		the patients and provided the first clue to the diagnosis of histoplasmosis for
		several patients. Antibody testing was positive for H. capsulatum in 6 of 8
		patients in whom the test was performed. Eleven patients underwent surgery for
		"valve replacement or myxoma removal. Large, friable vegetations were noted at"
		"surgery in most patients, confirming the preoperative transesophageal"
		echocardiography findings. Histopathologic examination of valve tissue and the
		myxoma revealed granulomatous inflammation and large numbers of organisms in most
		specimens. Four of the excised valves and the atrial myxoma showed a mixture of
		both yeast and hyphal forms on histopathology. A lipid formulation of
		"amphotericin B, administered for a median of 29 days, was the initial therapy in"
		"11 of the 14 patients. This was followed by oral itraconazole therapy, in all but"
		2 patients. The length of itraconazole suppressive therapy ranged from 11 months
		to lifelong administration. Three patients (21%) died within 3 months of the date
		of diagnosis. All 3 deaths were in patients who had received either no or minimal
		(1 day and 1 week) amphotericin B.

PG	-	175-8
AB	-	The clinical manifestations of chronic disseminated histoplasmosis are
		non-specific and resemble those of other chronic infections and malignancies. We
		"report the radiographic, sonographic and contrast-enhanced CT appearances of"
		"histoplasmosis in an adult male with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, who"
		was HIV negative and presented with weight loss and pyrexia. Imaging studies
		"simulated tuberculosis with mediastinal lymphadenopathy, bilateral fibrotic lung"
		"lesions, hepatomegaly and bilateral hypoattenuating adrenal enlargement, without"
		clinical or laboratory evidence of hypoadrenalism. Computed tomography-guided
		fine-needle aspiration biopsy of adrenal glands revealed Histoplasma capsulatum.
		We report our experience to increase awareness of the imaging spectrum of
		"disseminated histoplasmosis and its similarity to tuberculosis as, with"
		"increasing incidence of AIDS, the chances of these infections are likely to"
		"increase. Moreover, awareness of this entity is important because it is known"
		that untreated disseminated histoplasmosis is fatal.

AB	-	Central nervous system (CNS) involvement occurs in 5 to 10% of individuals with
		disseminated histoplasmosis. Most experience has been derived from small single
		"center case series, or case report literature reviews. Therefore, a larger study"
		of central nervous system (CNS) histoplasmosis is needed in order to guide the
		"approach to diagnosis, and treatment.A convenience sample of 77 patients with"
		histoplasmosis infection of the CNS was evaluated. Data was collected that
		"focused on recognition of infection, diagnostic techniques, and outcomes of"
		treatment.Twenty nine percent of patients were not immunosuppressed. Histoplasma
		"antigen, or anti-Histoplasma antibodies were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid"
		(CSF) in 75% of patients. One year survival was 75% among patients treated
		"initially with amphotericin B, and was highest with liposomal, or deoxycholate"
		"formulations. Mortality was higher in immunocompromised patients, and patients 54"
		"years of age, or older. Six percent of patients relapsed, all of whom had the"
		"acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and were poorly adherent with"
		treatment.While CNS histoplasmosis occurred most often in immunocompromised
		"individuals, a significant proportion of patients were previously, healthy. The"
		"diagnosis can be established by antigen, and antibody testing of the CSF, and"
		"serum, and antigen testing of the urine in most patients. Treatment with"
		liposomal amphotericin B (AMB-L) for at least 1 month; followed by itraconazole
		"for at least 1 year, results in survival among the majority of individuals."
		"Patients should be followed for relapse for at least 1 year, after stopping"
		therapy.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Histoplasmosis is a fungal infection caused by Histoplasma
		capsulatum var. capsulatum. It shows pulmonary or multivisceral involvement.
		Infective spores are inhaled from soils that contain bat or bird guano. The
		clinical picture depends on the intensity of the exposure and the immune status
		of the host. CASE REPORTS: We report two cases of histoplasmosis that reflect its
		variability in clinical and histopathological expression: a pseudo-tumoral
		nodular form or histoplasmoma in a pauci-symptomatic immunocompetent patient and
		a disseminated form with severe respiratory and mucocutaneous involvement in an
		"immunocompromised patient. The histoplasmoma presented as a spiculated,"
		"hypermetabolic, solitary pulmonary nodule. Histopathological examination showed"
		well-formed epithelioid granulomas with caseous central necrosis containing
		"numerous histoplasma yeasts. In the patient with disseminated infection, the"
		diagnosis was confirmed by seeing yeast forms in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and
		skin biopsy. CONCLUSIONS: These patients are the second and third cases of
		histoplasmosis reported on Reunion Island. Both had traveled in endemic areas
		several years previously. The most likely pathophysiological mechanism is the
		"reactivation of an old latent infection. There is, therefore, no argument at"
		present in favor of the presence of contaminated soils on Reunion Island.

AB	-	"IMPORTANCE: Histoplasmosis, a systemic mycosis caused by the fungus Histoplasma"
		"capsulatum, primarily affects immune-suppressed patients and commonly involves"
		"the lung and rarely the central nervous system (CNS). Herein, we report a case of"
		isolated CNS histoplasmosis presenting with pontine stroke and meningitis.
		"OBSERVATIONS: A 35-year-old, white, immune-competent man was transferred from an"
		outside facility with worsening dysarthria and confusion after having presented 4
		"weeks prior with dysarthria, gait ataxia, and bilateral upper extremity weakness."
		"Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed bilateral pontine strokes, and the"
		"working diagnosis was ischemic infarctions, presumed secondary to small vessel"
		vasculitis. Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) examination showed marked abnormalities
		"including an elevated protein level (320 mg/dL), low glucose level (2 mg/dL), and"
		"high white blood cell count (330/mm(3); 28% lymphocytes, 56% neutrophils, and 16%"
		"monocytes) suggestive of a bacterial, fungal, or tuberculosis meningitis."
		Empirical antibiotics and a second trial of intravenous steroids were started
		before infectious etiologies of meningitis were ultimately ruled out. Repeated
		magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed no evidence of new ischemic
		"lesions. On hospital day 11, results of his CSF Histoplasma antigen and urine"
		antigen tests were positive. His CSF culture also was positive for H capsulatum.
		"The patient was treated initially with liposomal amphotericin B, 430 mg daily,"
		"but changed to voriconazole, 300 mg twice daily, secondary to renal insufficiency"
		"and eventually continued treatment with itraconazole cyclodextrin, 100 mg twice"
		"daily. Computed tomographic imaging revealed obstructive hydrocephalus, and a"
		ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed that successfully decompressed the
		"ventricles. At 1 year, the patient demonstrated good clinical improvement and"
		results of follow-up CSF cultures were negative. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: While
		"pulmonary involvement of histoplasmosis in immune-suppressed patients is common,"
		systemic presentation of this fungal infection in immune-competent patients is
		rare and self-limiting. Isolated CNS histoplasmosis is exceedingly rare.
		Clinicians should consider CNS histoplasmosis in the differential diagnosis in
		"atypical stroke cases, particularly those presenting with meningitis."

PG	-	84
LID	-	10.1186/s12969-021-00581-7 [doi]
LID	-	84
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Children with rheumatic diseases (cRD) receiving immunosuppressive
		"medications (IM) are at a higher risk for acquiring potentially lethal pathogens,"
		"including Histoplasma capsulatum (histoplasmosis), a fungal infection that can"
		"lead to prolonged hospitalization, organ damage, and death. Withholding IM during"
		serious infections is recommended yet poses risk of rheumatic disease flares.
		"Conversely, reinitiating IM increases risk for infection recurrence. Tumor"
		necrosis factor alpha inhibitor (TNFai) biologic therapy carries the highest risk
		"for histoplasmosis infection after epidemiological exposure, so other IM are"
		preferred during active histoplasmosis infection. There is limited guidance as to
		when and how IM can be reinitiated in cRD with histoplasmosis. This case series
		"chronicles resumption of IM, including non-TNFai biologics, disease-modifying"
		"anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), and corticosteroids, following histoplasmosis"
		among cRD. CASE PRESENTATION: We examine clinical characteristics and outcomes of
		9 patients with disseminated or pulmonary histoplasmosis and underlying rheumatic
		"disease [juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), childhood-onset systemic lupus"
		"erythematosus (cSLE), and mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD)] after"
		reintroduction of IM. All DMARDs and biologics were halted at histoplasmosis
		"diagnosis, except hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), and patients began antifungals."
		"Following IM discontinuation, all patients required systemic or intra-articular"
		"steroids during histoplasmosis treatment, with 4/9 showing Cushingoid features."
		"Four patients began new IM regimens [2 abatacept (ABA), 1 HCQ, and 1 methotrexate"
		"(MTX)] while still positive for histoplasmosis, with 3/4 (ABA, MTX, HCQ) later"
		clearing their histoplasmosis and 1 (ABA) showing decreasing antigenemia.
		"Collectively, 8/9 patients initiated or continued DMARDs and/or non-TNFai"
		"biologic use (5 ABA, 1 tocilizumab, 1 ustekinumab, 3 MTX, 4 HCQ, 1 leflunomide)."
		"No fatalities, exacerbations, or recurrences of histoplasmosis occurred during"
		"follow-up (median 33 months). CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort of cRD, histoplasmosis"
		"course following reintroduction of non-TNFai IM was favorable, but additional"
		studies are needed to evaluate optimal IM management during acute histoplasmosis
		"and recovery. In this case series, non-TNFai biologic, DMARD, and steroid"
		treatments did not appear to cause histoplasmosis recurrence. Adverse events from
		corticosteroid use were common. Further research is needed to implement
		"guidelines for optimal use of non-TNFai (like ABA), DMARDs, and corticosteroids"
		in cRD following histoplasmosis presentation.

AB	-	Histoplasmosis is the second most common fungal infection reported in the cat.
		"The disseminated form involving lung, liver, lymph nodes, spleen, and bone marrow"
		is a frequent manifestation of the disease. Limited information is available in
		the literature regarding the ultrasonographic appearance of the spleen in cats
		with disseminated or splenic histoplasmosis. A retrospective review of splenic
		ultrasound images from 15 cats confirmed to have histoplasmosis by splenic
		"aspirates was performed. Size, echotexture, echogenicity, margin appearance,"
		"presence of nodules, and the overall shape of the spleen were reported in each"
		case. Splenomegaly was documented in all cases (15/15) and a hypoechoic
		appearance of the spleen was documented in 14/15 of cases. The spleen was
		diffusely and uniformly affected in 14/15 (six homogenous and eight with a subtle
		mottled appearance) and had discrete nodules in 1/15 cats. Histoplasmosis should
		be included in the differential list for an enlarged and hypoechoic spleen in
		"cats with consistent clinical findings. Additionally, ultrasound guided splenic"
		aspirate may be a useful method to obtain a cytology sample for diagnosis.

		syndrome.
PG	-	368-71
AB	-	PURPOSE: We report a case of infection-associated hemophagocytic syndrome in the
		setting of disseminated histoplasmosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 6-year-old boy
		with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis developed a fulminant hemophagocytic
		"syndrome. Evaluation for an infectious cause included bacterial, mycobacterial,"
		"viral, and fungal cultures, serological assessment, and histological examination"
		of bone marrow and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. RESULTS: Culture of bone marrow
		"aspirate, blood, and bronchoalveolar lavage showed disseminated histoplasmosis as"
		the cause for this patient's hemophagocytic syndrome. The patient was treated
		with amphotericin B with complete resolution of his hemophagocytic syndrome.
		CONCLUSIONS: Disseminated histoplasmosis is another cause of IAHS in children
		with an underlying immunodeficiency. Diagnostic difficulties associated with the
		hemophagocytic syndromes of childhood are discussed.

PG	-	407-12
AB	-	Histoplasma capsulatum histoplasmosis occurs frequently in endemic areas and with
		"the AIDS outbreak, it appears as an opportunistic fungus involved in disseminated"
		"disease. We report the clinical, biological and treatment features of seven cases"
		"diagnosed in the CISIH of the Eastern part of Paris. Clinically, four patients"
		"were suffering from pulmonary symptoms, in three cases digestive disorders and in"
		"three cutaneous lesions. In all cases, the mycologic diagnosis was necessary."
		Amphotericin B and itraconazole were used as treatment for five patients (two
		"died before the diagnosis was completed). Among these five subjects, four died"
		(death was attributed to histoplasmosis in only one case). These observations
		emphasize the importance of this infection in HIV-infected patients coming from
		endemic areas.

OAB	-	A 27-year old female from Nairobi was admitted to the medical wards of the
		Kenyatta National Hospital in May 1991. She presented with a 4-week history of
		"productive cough, fever, weight loss, and night sweats. She acknowledged a"
		history of contact with a patient known to have pulmonary tuberculosis. She has
		never received a blood transfusion. She was single and para 3 + 0. Examination
		"revealed a sick patient, with moderate pallor, fever of 38 degrees Celsius, and"
		who was wasted with moderate dehydration and oral thrush. There was no finger
		"clubbing, lymphadenopathy, or pedal edema. Chest examination revealed bilateral"
		basal pneumonia. The spleen was palpable 4 cm below the costal margin; the liver
		"was not enlarged. The rest of the examination was normal. On admission, complete"
		"blood count showed a haemoglobin of 5.4 g/dl, total white cells were 12.5 x"
		"10-9/L, with 82% polymorphonuclear cells and 18% lymphocytes, erythrocyte"
		"sedimentation rate (ESR) was 85 mm/hour, and platelet count was normal. The"
		"anemia was normocytic, normochromic, and no malaria parasites were seen. Urea and"
		electrolytes and liver function tests were normal. Sputum showed no acid fast
		bacilli on Ziel-Neelson Stain. HIV-1 antibodies were positive by enzyme-linked
		immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot. Bone marrow aspirate revealed a
		"hypercellular marrow with reversed M:E ration, dyserythropoesis, reticulum cell"
		"hyperplasia, plentiful golden yellow pigment, and clumps of Histoplasma"
		capsulatum. Chest X-ray showed bilateral basal pneumonia. She was treated with
		"antibiotics and intravenous fluids, but she remained febrile, her general"
		"condition progressively deteriorated, and she died a week after admission."
		"Treatment for histoplasmosis had not been commenced, and no postmortem"
		examination was carried out.

		Infection caused by the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum is the most common cause of

		"rare than all other fungal infections. However, their atypical forms of arthritis"
		and the importance of early diagnosis and treatment cannot be over-emphasized.
		Herein we report a case of knee monoarthritis in an immunocompetent patient with
		"histoplasmosis arthritis following an arthroscopic meniscetomy, diagnosed by"
		synovial biopsy and culture performed during a second arthroscopic procedure. The
		joint was debrided in this second intervention and the patient received
		itraconazole initially and fluconazole latter on. The arthritis subsided after 10
		months of treatment.

PG	-	229-35
AB	-	"Histoplasmosis is distributed in tropical, subtropical and temperate zones of the"
		"world. The disease is one of the imported mycoses in Japan. To date, although"
		more than 30 human and one canine case of histoplasmosis have been reported in
		"Japan, some including that of the canine might have been infected domestically,"
		since the patients have no history of going abroad. The pathogen of
		histoplasmosis is thus believed to be present in our country. We examined skin
		"biopsies from two dogs in Tokyo and Kumamoto, and found fungal elements 1-2 or"
		2-4 microEm in diameter in the macrophages. The homology of DNA sequences for the
		ITS rRNA gene were correspondent to Ajellomyces capsulatus at a rate of more than
		"97.4%. Therefore, the two dogs were diagnosed as having been infected with"
		Histoplasma capsulatum which is the anamorph of A. capsulatus. Since the dogs had
		no history of having been outside Japan and had not been brought from an endemic
		"area, they might have been infected domestically. Further epidemiological surveys"
		on canine histoplasmosis may be able to estimate autochthonous human cases in
		Japan.

AB	-	"The incidence of tuberculosis in India is quite high. In such a situation,"
		"empirical antitubercular therapy (ATT) is often resorted to, when some of the"
		investigation findings are clearly diagnostic of tuberculosis. This may mean
		missing out on coinfections. Whereas this is particularly true for
		"immunosuppressed patients, rarely even immunocompetent patients may present with"
		such diagnostic dilemmas. We present the case of an adolescent boy who had been
		"previously asymptomatic and who presented with fever with lymphadenopathy,"
		"splenomegaly, and pancytopenia. Initially, ATT was administered based on the"
		"detection of acid-fast bacteria in lymph node, caseating granulomas with Langhans"
		"giant cells, and a positive cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test"
		"specific for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. However, when the patient failed to"
		"respond fully to the treatment, additional investigation in the form of bone"
		marrow fungal culture led to the diagnosis of histoplasmosis.

TI	-	Disseminated histoplasmosis presenting as thrombotic microangiopathy.
PG	-	1221-5
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA) are systemic vasoocclusive
		disorders associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Rapid and reliable
		diagnosis of TMA is critical. The diagnosis is complicated by a lack of objective
		"and sensitive laboratory testing as well as multiple concurrent diseases,"
		including infectious processes. CASE STUDY: We report two cases of disseminated
		"histoplasmosis associated with TMA manifestations in renal transplant recipients,"
		including one patient with histologically documented renal microthrombi; both
		patients were referred for plasma exchange. After the diagnosis of
		"histoplasmosis, the treatment plan was changed to antifungal medications, reduced"
		"immuno-suppression, and supportive care, with progressive resolution of TMA"
		manifestations. CONCLUSION: TMA occurs in transplant populations in association
		"with infections, medications, and other factors. Appropriate management includes"
		recognition and treatment of possible etiological factors. Disseminated
		histoplasmosis should be considered in transplant patients presenting with TMA.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive fungal infections are a major cause of morbidity and
		mortality among solid organ transplant (SOT) and hematopoietic cell transplant
		"(HCT) recipients, but few data have been reported on the epidemiology of endemic"
		fungal infections in these populations. METHODS: Fifteen institutions belonging
		to the Transplant-Associated Infection Surveillance Network prospectively
		"enrolled SOT and HCT recipients with histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, or"
		coccidioidomycosis occurring between March 2001 and March 2006. RESULTS: A total
		of 70 patients (64 SOT recipients and 6 HCT recipients) had infection with an
		"endemic mycosis, including 52 with histoplasmosis, 9 with blastomycosis, and 9"
		with coccidioidomycosis. The 12-month cumulative incidence rate among SOT
		recipients for histoplasmosis was 0.102%. Occurrence of infection was bimodal; 28
		"(40%) infections occurred in the first 6 months post transplantation, and 24"
		(34%) occurred between 2 and 11 years post transplantation. Three patients were
		documented to have acquired infection from the donor organ. Seven SOT recipients
		with histoplasmosis and 3 with coccidioidomycosis died (16%); no HCT recipient
		died. CONCLUSIONS: This 5-year multicenter prospective surveillance study found
		"that endemic mycoses occur uncommonly in SOT and HCT recipients, and that the"
		period at risk extends for years after transplantation.

TI	-	Endobronchial histoplasmosis: a masquerade of primary endobronchial neoplasia--a
		clinical study of four cases.
PG	-	277-81
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Histoplasma capsulatum is a dimorphic fungus with both hyphal and
		microconidial elements and is endemic in certain areas of the central United
		"States. Most clinically recognized syndromes are self-limited, presenting in more"
		than 80% of cases as an influenza-like acute pulmonary illness. We encountered
		four patients with an endobronchial presentation of histoplasmosis masquerading
		as a bronchogenic malignancy. METHODS: The patient files from one of the authors
		"(PR) uncovered four patients diagnosed with, and treated for, endobronchial"
		histoplasmosis; all cases were referred for a presumptive diagnosis of
		"endobronchial neoplasia. RESULTS: The case study group comprised three women,"
		"ages 52, 68, and 81 years, respectively, and one man age 29 years, all presenting"
		with recurrent hemoptysis. An obstructing adherent lesion was apparent on
		"bronchoscopy in three, involving the right upper lobe bronchus in two, and right"
		"mainstem bronchus in one. In one patient, blood was observed in the bronchus"
		intermedius; there was no gross lesion. Recurrent hemoptysis necessitated a right
		"upper sleeve lobectomy in one, a right upper lobe lobectomy and right lower wedge"
		"resection in one, a right middle lobectomy in one, and wedge resection of the"
		right upper lobe in one. CONCLUSIONS: Endobronchial histoplasmosis may mimic
		"primary bronchogenic carcinoma, presenting as a fixed obstructing endobronchial"
		lesion associated with hemoptysis; the latter potentially necessitating surgical
		intervention. Endobronchial histoplasmosis should be considered in the
		differential diagnosis of obstructing endobronchial lesions associated with
		"hemoptysis, especially when prior and(or) concurrent biopsies fail to disclose"
		malignancy.

AB	-	Histoplasmosis is a common endemic mycosis that is usually asymptomatic but
		"occasionally results in severe illness. Histoplasmosis and its causative agent,"
		"Histoplasma capsulatum, are found worldwide but rarely in Japan. In recent years,"
		"however, the number of histoplasmosis patients in Japan has increased. In"
		"addition, to our knowledge, there are no previous reports of increased serum"
		soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) levels in patients with histoplasmosis.
		We report a case series of histoplasmosis in three Japanese temporary workers in
		"Manzanillo, Mexico. All three patients developed a persistent high fever and"
		general fatigue. Laboratory tests showed increased C-reactive protein levels and
		mild liver dysfunction. All patients also showed increased soluble interleukin-2
		receptor (sIL-2R) levels. Chest computed tomography revealed multiple nodules in
		both lung fields. All patients were positive for serum anti-Histoplasma
		"antibodies, and two patients were positive for Histoplasma on polymerase chain"
		"reaction tests. After treatment that included antifungals, their conditions"
		gradually improved and laboratory data normalized. Although one patient developed
		"respiratory failure, this patient recovered with antifungal therapy in"
		combination with methylprednisolone. Serum sIL-2R levels in all patients
		"gradually declined to normal levels, indicating their recovery from Histoplasma"
		"infection. From our experience with these patients, sIL-2R levels may be a useful"
		biomarker for patients with histoplasmosis.

TI	-	[Laryngeal tuberculosis: considerations on the most recent clinical and
		epidemiological data and presentation of a case report].
PG	-	196-201
AB	-	"According to the ""Global Tuberculosis Control"" performed in 1999--the third"
		"complete, international, global report on tuberculosis infection--173 countries"
		reported their infection data to the WHO; of these countries 102 met the criteria
		"for ""DOTS programs"" at the end of 1997. The DOTS programs are the only control"
		strategy able to produce a cure rate of 85%. Both at the national and
		"international (Centers of Disease Control) levels, guidelines have been drawn up"
		to improve and coordinate the fight against tuberculosis. New indicators and
		methods of analysis should be developed to quantify the full impact on the
		"control of infection transmission, incidence, prevalence, mortality and"
		"prevention of drug resistance. In addition, two significant world-wide events"
		have affected the increase morbidity rate seen in the last decade in the more
		highly industrial countries: immigration from countries outside the European
		Community and HIV infection. The tuberculosis infection worsens the evolution of
		"HIV, facilitating viral replication. In the present work the authors discuss the"
		most recent epidemiological data regarding tuberculosis infection and review the
		Literature on the primary laryngeal location of the disease. Then they present a
		clinical case which recently came under observation. This case is a typical
		example of the clinical picture of the laryngeal tuberculosis seen today. It must
		not be forgotten that in recent years there has been an increase in morbidity in
		"Italy, in both the pulmonary and extrapulmonary forms of the disease, although in"
		our country the problem of delayed or incomplete reporting is quite widespread.
		The data show that the age ranges with the highest incidence of both pulmonary
		and extrapulmonary forms are the 25-35 and 60-70 year groups. Distribution by
		"sex, on the hand, shows that the pulmonary forms are most often seen in males"
		while the extrapulmonary forms have practical the same frequency in both sexes.
		In recent years the clinical and morphological aspects of tubercular laryngitis
		have changed significantly from what they were before chemotherapy and the most
		common clinical form is pseudotumoral tuberculosis. This form requires a
		differential diagnosis to distinguish it from neoplasms because they present a
		similar objective picture and have no signs of simultaneous or previous pulmonary
		involvement.

		the Spanish literature].
PG	-	316-21
AB	-	The characteristics of two cases of histoplasmosis in AIDS patients in our
		institution are presented together with a review of the 11 cases published in
		Spain since 1988 in addition to the current knowledge on histoplasmosis in
		patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV). In all except 2 of
		the 13 patients there was epidemiologic history of a stay in a country in which
		histoplasmosis is endemic. The 12 cases described in which this information is
		available had CD4 counts under 100/microL. The clinical manifestations of
		presentation were fever (92.3%) associated or not with other unspecific symptoms
		"(asthenia, anorexia, cough, diarrhea) with a subacute course of two or three"
		months. Physical examination demonstrated hepatosplenomegaly in 76.9% of the
		cases and 61.5% of the patients presented cutaneous lesions. Thoracic radiography
		was abnormal in 55% (61.5% had respiratory symptoms). Diagnosis was achieved by
		isolation of the fungus in the cutaneous biopsies in all the patients with
		dermatologic involvement and in 7 cases identification was performed in the bone
		marrow. In all the cases induction treatment was with anphotericin B and in those
		who reached the maintenance phase itraconazol was used in 7 cases and ketoconazol
		"in one case. None of the patients treated with itraconazol, including the two in"
		"our center, presented recurrence at the time of completion of follow up. In"
		"conclusion, histoplasmosis is frequently presented as a prolonged febrile"
		"syndrome with unspecific characteristics, thus emphasizing the importance of"
		including travel history to other countries in the anamnesis. The increase in
		journeys to endemic countries and immigration from these areas had led to an
		increase in the number of cases of histoplasmosis in patients with HIV infection
		in Spain.

PG	-	274-7
LID	-	10.1002/hed.20882 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Histoplasmosis is a localized or systemic fungal infection which may
		"present as an acute primary or ""reactivation"" infection in the setting of"
		"immunosuppression. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) antagonists, used in"
		"the management of rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn disease, have been linked to"
		"reactivation of quiescent histoplasmosis. Microscopically, granulomas are either"
		not evident or are infrequent in histoplasmosis when associated with TNF
		antagonist therapy presumably due to the suppression of macrophage activity.
		METHODS AND RESULTS: This article describes an unusual presentation of oral
		"histoplasmosis in a 75-year-old-woman patient on TNF-alpha antagonist, namely"
		"infliximab. Microscopically, cellular atypia resulted in a work-up to rule out"
		lymphoma. Gomori's methenamine silver stain demonstrated Histoplasma capsulatum
		leading to a diagnosis of histoplasmosis. She was treated successfully with
		"itraconozole. CONCLUSION: This is the first reported case, insofar as the authors"
		"are able to determine, of oral histoplasmosis, in a patient undergoing treatment"
		with infliximab.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND Cavitary lung lesions are commonly identified on thoracic imaging, but"
		"typically require further workup for definitive diagnosis. CASE REPORT Here, we"
		present the case of a 40-year-old Middle Eastern male who presented with an
		unusual cause of cavitary lung lesion with associated pleural mass and pleural
		thickening. He underwent bronchoscopic biopsy and computer tomography (CT)-guided
		"core needle biopsy, both of which were non-diagnostic. Surgical biopsy"
		"subsequently revealed hyalinized necrotizing granulomatous tissue, consistent"
		"with histoplasmosis, and the patient was treated with itraconazole, which he"
		responded well to. CONCLUSIONS This case demonstrates the importance of
		identifying unusual causes of cavitary lung lesions and emphasizes the role of
		using proper tissue sampling for diagnosis.

AB	-	PURPOSE: To investigate the relationship of smoking to choroidal
		neovascularization (CNV) secondary to presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome
		"(POHS). DESIGN: Retrospective, case-control study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 568"
		"patients 18 to 50 years of age, 142 of whom were diagnosed with CNV secondary to"
		"POHS in a private retina practice between July 1, 2000, and August 1, 2010. Four"
		hundred twenty-six were controls selected from a private comprehensive
		ophthalmology practice at the same location. METHODS: A retrospective medical
		"record review was performed for all participants. Age, gender, zip code, CNV"
		"diagnosis date, insurance status, and smoking status at CNV diagnosis date were"
		"collected first for the POHS patients. For each of these 142 patients, 3 randomly"
		"selected comprehensive clinic patients, whose visit date fell within 3 months of"
		"the corresponding POHS patient's CNV diagnosis date, served as controls. Age,"
		"gender, zip code, visit date, reason for visit, insurance type, and smoking"
		status were recorded. Descriptive statistics were calculated for cases and
		controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Logistic regression analyses were performed for
		"both univariate and multivariate models, with CNV secondary to POHS as the main"
		"outcome variable and smoking as the main predictor variable, while adjusting for"
		"age, gender, insurance type, median household income, and education level."
		"RESULTS: The mean age of patients with CNV secondary to POHS was 39.0±7.1 years,"
		whereas that of the control patients was 35.7±9.1 years. Of the patients with CNV
		"secondary to POHS, 47.2% were current or former smokers (42.3% current, 4.9%"
		"former). Of the control patients, 22.5% were current or former smokers (21.8%"
		"current, 0.7% former). Age, insurance type, median income, educational"
		"attainment, and smoking status were significant in the univariate models. In the"
		"final adjusted logistic regression model, only age (odds ratio [OR], 1.04; 95%"
		"confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.07; P = 0.001), level of educational attainment"
		"by zip code (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.92-0.98; P = 0.001) and smoking status (OR,"
		"2.83; 95% CI, 1.86-4.31; P<0.0001) were significant. CONCLUSIONS: The odds of a"
		smoker having CNV secondary to POHS are almost 3 times that of a nonsmoker. In
		"this study, the odds of having CNV secondary to POHS increased with age and"
		decreased with increasing level of educational attainment.

AB	-	The frequency of histoplasmosis among solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients
		"appears to be low where there are only a few case series, mostly among renal and"
		liver transplant recipients. Herein we report a case of a 44-year-old woman who
		"underwent a living-related renal transplant 18 years prior to evaluation,"
		developed a nodule after followed by ulceration upon her posterior right leg and
		"a second one upon her left leg 3 months and 2 months before her hospitalisation,"
		respectively. The biopsy of lesion revealed the presence of Histoplasma spp. Bone
		marrow aspiration was performed and also revealed the same organism. She had
		"initially received itraconazole without improvement of lesions, while a new"
		lesion appeared on her left arm. Healing of all lesions could be observed after
		40 days of liposomal amphotericin B when she was submitted to skin grafts on the
		"legs and a surgical treatment on the arms, and the myelosuppression improved"
		simultaneously. Histoplasmosis seems to be very uncommon among patients who
		underwent to organ solid transplantation. Most cases occur within 12-18 months
		"after transplantation, although unusual cases have been presented many years"
		"post-transplant. There are cases reported in the literature, occurring from 84"
		"days to 18 years after organ transplantation, but without cutaneous involvement."
		Our patient developed lesions on limbs and myelosuppression after 18 years of
		chronic immunosuppression medication. This case suggests that besides cutaneous
		histoplasmosis is an uncommon infection following iatrogenic immunosuppression
		and even rarer over a long period after the transplantation. Clinicians who care
		SOT recipient patients must bear in mind histoplasmosis infection as differential
		diagnosis in any case of cutaneous injury with prolonged fever and try to use as
		"many tools as possible to make the diagnosis, once this disease presents a good"
		prognosis if it is diagnosed and treated promptly.

AB	-	Histoplasmosis is an infection caused by the dimorphic fungus Histoplasma
		capsulatum. The disease is endemic in several regions of tropical and temperate
		"climate. The fungus presents opportunistic behavior, causing widespread infection"
		"in immunocompromised patients, resulting from complication of primary pulmonary"
		"infection, due to exogenous reinfection or reactivation of a quiescent source. In"
		"immunocompetent individuals, approximately 95% of pulmonary infections are"
		"asymptomatic. However, prolonged exposure to high amount spores may lead to acute"
		"or chronic lung infection. Due to the low amount of inoculum, primary cutaneous"
		histoplasmosis caused by traumatic implantation is extremely rare and effectively
		"treated with triazoles. Thus, the present study aims to report a case of primary"
		cutaneous histoplasmosis that is difficult to treat in an immunocompetent
		"patient, and to review the literature on the incidence of drug-resistant"
		Histoplasma capsulatum strains in clinical practice.

AB	-	HISTORY AND ADMISSION FINDINGS: A 29-years-old Brazilian woman was admitted to
		"hospital because of progressive dyspnoea, shivering and fever. She reported a"
		noticeable swelling at the right mandible and an ulcerative tumor at the side of
		"the nose. INVESTIGATIONS: Laboratory tests showed normocytic, normochromic anemia"
		with an elevation of the inflammatory parameters. Radiology showed an enlargement
		"of the upper mediastinum. Computed tomography revealed extensive, confluent"
		"lymphoma. There were groups of cervical lymph nodes, especially in the area of"
		the right jaw. Bronchoscopy showed extensive space-occupying lesions with severe
		"inflammation of the trachea. DIAGNOSIS: Bronchial biopsy revealed necrotizing,"
		granulomatous inflammation with dense infiltration of lymphatic cells. Small and
		spheroidal pathogens were seen within giant cells. Grocott-silver stain was
		"positive, indicating histoplasmosis. Histological work-up of the ulcerating tumor"
		at the side of the nose also showed Histoplasma capsulatum. TREATMENT AND COURSE:
		8 weeks after starting specific treatment with oral itraconazole the inflammatory
		parameters had fallen to normal and computed tomography showed regression of the
		mediastinal bulge. CONCLUSION: Large mediastinal and cervical lymphatic masses
		"with space-occupying bronchial lesions suggest should, in the differential"
		"diagnosis, consider not only malignant tumor but also infections. If the patient"
		"had been abroad (in this case in Brazil), pathogens like Histoplasma capsulatum,"
		"which is not present in Europe, have to be considered. In this immunocompetent"
		"patient the severe progression and dissemination of the disease, involving"
		"mediastinum, throat and skin, is most unusual."

AB	-	Histoplasmosis is an infection caused by the dimorphic fungus Histoplasma
		"capsulatum. While the lungs are the most common site of infection, disseminated"
		"disease affecting multiple organs can occur, particularly in immunocompromised"
		patients. Gastrointestinal histoplasmosis is usually diagnosed in the context of
		"disseminated disease and can present in any part of the digestive system, the"
		ileum being the most frequently affected. We report the case of a 60-year-old
		female patient who underwent liver transplant for alcoholic liver cirrhosis. The
		patient had a 10 mm polypoid lesion in the sigmoid colon diagnosed in a screening
		"colonoscopy performed 8 months prior to the transplant, but biopsy was not done"
		for fear of bleeding due to extensive anorectal varices. There were no other
		"lesions in the rest of the colon at that time. Four months after the transplant,"
		"the patient was asymptomatic and was submitted to a control colonoscopy, which"
		"showed 8 polypoid lesions in different parts of the colon, all of which were"
		biopsied. Histologic results showed extensive infiltration of the colonic mucosa
		by Histoplasma capsulatum. Imaging and laboratorial screening for other sites of
		"infection was negative, and the patient was treated with itraconazole for 12"
		months. A marked reduction in the dose of tacrolimus was necessary to maintain
		therapeutic levels during itraconazole treatment. Asymptomatic isolated colonic
		histoplasmosis is an uncommon manifestation of infection by Histoplasma
		"capsulatum, with no previous reports in the literature of this condition"
		affecting liver transplant recipients. This manuscript is compliant with the
		Helsinki Congress and the Istanbul Declaration.

		tuberculosis. We present here a case of adrenal histoplasmosis in a 65 year-old
		male diabetic with marked weight loss. Laboratory investigations noticed an
		inflammatory syndrome and the abdominal computed tomography scanner reported an
		heterogenous left adrenal mass of 6 cm in diameter. Hormonal as well as
		bacteriological studies were negative. The patient was operated and the
		histopathological examination proved that the mass was a tuberculoma and an
		"anti-tuberculous treatment was started. Four months later, the patient suffered"
		from recurrence of symptoms and laboratory investigations confirmed the
		inflammatory syndrome and the abdominal computed tomography scanner showed a
		right adrenal mass. A surgical biopsy was performed and specific fungal
		researches proved that the lesion was due to Histoplasma capsulatum. The patient
		experienced a remarkable improvement under anti-fungal treatment.

PG	-	56-8
AB	-	Histoplasmosis is the most common endemic respiratory mycosis in the United
		States. Disseminated histoplasmosis generally is initially seen with systemic or
		respiratory complaints. Presentation of histoplasmosis as a neck mass is rare.
		"Due to this unusual presentation and the diagnostic implications, we present a"
		case of disseminated histoplasmosis that presented as a neck abscess. Unusual
		presentations of histoplasmosis may occur even in patients who are not
		immunocompromised. The diagnosis and management of histoplasmosis is reviewed.
		Histoplasmosis should be considered in the workup of a cervical abscess even in
		the immunocompetent host.

PG	-	527-8
AB	-	A case of disseminated histoplasmosis diagnosed by percutaneous needle biopsy
		cytology is reported. The patient presented with fever and pancytopenia. Computed
		tomography (CT) revealed retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Cytology smears
		prepared from a CT-guided screw needle biopsy of one of the lymph nodes showed
		numerous histiocytes with intracytoplasmic yeast forms consistent with
		Histoplasma capsulatum. Fungal cultures prepared from additional needle biopsy
		material confirmed the diagnosis. This case illustrates the utility of needle
		biopsy in the evaluation of radiographically detected retroperitoneal
		lymphadenopathy and in the rapid diagnosis of infectious disease in certain
		clinical settings.

PG	-	386-8

AB	-	"Histoplasmosis is a rare systemic fungal infection, primarily affecting the"
		pulmonary system. Oral lesions are usually a manifestation of the disseminated
		form of the disease and most frequently observed in severely immunocompromised
		"patients, such as those with advanced human immunodeficiency virus infection"
		and/or frank acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The clinical presentation of
		the oral lesions may be difficult to distinguish from oral squamous cell
		"carcinoma. The histopathological features are usually characteristic, but"
		"occasionally the organisms are scanty and not readily identified, which can"
		preclude obtaining the correct diagnosis and ensuring appropriate management.
		Histoplasmosis is an unusual and rare cause of chronic non-healing ulceration in
		the oral cavity. A case of histoplasmosis involving the oral cavity in an
		"immunocompetent patient is reported, which was not recognized, resulting in the"
		inappropriate management of the condition.

PG	-	571-2
AB	-	Histoplasmosis is caused by a dimorphic fungus Histoplasma capsulatum.
		Transmission is via inhalation and lungs are the most commonly affected site.
		Other sites are involved uncommonly and genitals are rarely involved. The case is
		reported herein of a man with penoscrotal histoplasmosis following bladder
		carcinoma that had been treated with intravesical bacille Calmette-Guerin. He
		"presented with multiple ulcers on the penis and scrotum that coalesced, followed"
		by the appearance of cutaneous lesions. The condition responded well to
		"itraconazole. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of penoscrotal"
		histoplasmosis following bladder carcinoma.

TI	-	[Pulmonary histoplasmosis exhibiting solitary pulmonary nodule resected by
		thoracoscopic surgery: a case report and review of the Japanese literature].
PG	-	909-14
AB	-	We reported a case of pulmonary histoplasmosis showing solitary nodular shadow. A
		43-year-old man was referred to our hospital because of an abnormal shadow on
		chest X-ray films during a routine checkup. He had traveled to Honduras for 7
		days. Chest computed tomographic (CT) scans showed a 13 x 12 mm nodular shadow
		with unclear margin in the left upper lobe (S3). Both transbronchial lung biopsy
		and CT guided transcutaneous needle biopsy failed to yield a definitive
		diagnosis. Thoracoscopic resection of the nodule was performed due to suspicion
		"of lung cancer. Pathologically, the nodule displayed central caseous necrosis"
		with many round yeast-like fungi. The fungi measured 3 to 4 microns in diameter
		and were well-stained by Grocott stain. Immunohistochemical staining was positive
		"for anti-Histoplasma capsulatum antibody, resulting in the final diagnosis of"
		"pulmonary histoplasmosis. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and"
		"no recurrence was observed. Histoplasmosis is a rare disease in Japan. However,"
		it is important to keep imported infectious diseases in mind when examining and
		treating patients who have a history of travel abroad.

TI	-	Epididymal histoplasmosis diagnosed by isolation of Histoplasma capsulatum from
		semen.
PG	-	173-7
AB	-	An autochthonous case of epididymal histoplasmosis masquerading as tuberculosis
		in a 55-year-old male patient is reported from India. It was diagnosed by culture
		of Histoplasma capsulatum from semen and by demonstration of the fungus upon
		re-examination of epididymal biopsy sections previously misinterpreted as
		tuberculous granuloma. The patient's main complaints were painful epididymal
		"swelling, occasional fever and cough. He was treated successfully by excision of"
		epididymis and vas deferens combined with amphotericin B therapy. This is
		believed to be the first case of epididymal histoplasmosis to be reported outside
		the American continent and the fourth of its type reported in the English
		literature. The case is also noteworthy in that H. capsulatum was isolated for
		"the first time from semen, and it underlines the importance of mycological"
		culture of semen specimens for diagnosis of genitourinary infections of obscure
		etiology.

AB	-	Systemic histoplasmosis is uncommonly reported in patients who have undergone
		bone marrow or solid organ transplantation. Diagnosis of systemic histoplasmosis
		in recipients of transplants may be hampered by lack of consideration of this
		infection in the differential diagnosis and may be confounded by conflicting
		information from other testing performed to evaluate for opportunistic infections
		in this population. We report successful treatment of a case of disseminated
		histoplasmosis in a patient with Hodgkin's lymphoma who had undergone autologous
		stem cell transplantation. The diagnosis was delayed by the finding of a positive
		serum galactomannan assay.

TI	-	Screening for invasive fungal disease using non-culture-based assays among
		inpatients with advanced HIV disease at a large academic hospital in South
		Africa.
PG	-	478-487
LID	-	10.1111/myc.13071 [doi]
AB	-	"INTRODUCTION: Despite widespread access to antiretroviral therapy (ART), the"
		burden of advanced HIV disease in South Africa is high. This translates into an
		"increased risk of AIDS-related opportunistic infections, including invasive"
		"mycoses. METHODS: Using a limited number of non-culture-based diagnostic assays,"
		we aimed to determine the prevalence of invasive mycoses and tuberculosis among
		hospitalised adults with very advanced HIV (CD4 counts < 100 cells/µL) at a large
		academic hospital. We conducted interviews and prospective medical chart reviews.
		We performed point-of-care finger stick and serum cryptococcal antigen lateral
		flow assays; serum (1 → 3) ß-D-glucan assays; urine Histoplasma galactomannan
		antigen enzyme immunoassays and TB lipoarabinomannan assays. RESULTS: We enrolled
		"189 participants from 5280 screened inpatients. Fifty-eight per cent were female,"
		with median age 37 years (IQR: 30-43) and median CD4 count 32 cells/µL (IQR:
		"13-63). At enrolment, 60% (109/181) were receiving ART. Twenty-one participants"
		"(11%) had a diagnosis of an invasive mycosis, of whom 53% (11/21) had"
		cryptococcal disease. Thirteen participants (7%) had tuberculosis and a
		concurrent invasive mycosis. ART-experienced participants were 60% less likely to
		have an invasive mycosis than those ART-naïve (adjusted OR: 0.4; 95% CI 0.15-1.0;
		P = .03). Overall in-hospital mortality was 13% (invasive mycosis: 10% [95% CI
		1.2-30.7] versus other diagnoses: 13% (95% CI 8.4-19.3)). CONCLUSIONS: One in ten
		participants had evidence of an invasive mycosis. Diagnosis of proven invasive
		fungal disease and differentiation from other opportunistic infections was
		challenging. More fungal-specific screening and diagnostic tests should be
		applied to inpatients with advanced HIV disease.

TI	-	Treatment of thoracolumbar spinal cord compression associated with Histoplasma
		capsulatum infection in a cat.
PG	-	1018-23
AB	-	CASE DESCRIPTION: A 7-year-old domestic shorthair cat with a 2-month history of
		decreased appetite and weight loss was examined because of paraparesis of 1
		week's duration that had progressed to paraplegia 3 days earlier. CLINICAL
		FINDINGS: Neurologic examination revealed normo- to hyperreflexia and absence of
		deep pain sensation in the hind limbs and thoracolumbar spinal hyperesthesia.
		"Neuro-anatomically, the lesion was located within the T3 through L3 spinal cord"
		segments. Biochemical analysis and cytologic examination of CSF revealed no
		abnormalities. Radiography revealed narrowing of the T11-12 intervertebral disk
		space and intervertebral foramen suggestive of intervertebral disk disease.
		Myelography revealed an extradural mass centered at the T12-13 intervertebral
		disk space with extension over the dorsal surfaces of T11-13 and L1 vertebral
		bodies. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME: A right-sided hemilaminectomy was performed over
		"the T11-12, T12-13, and T13-L1 intervertebral disk spaces, and a space-occupying"
		mass was revealed. Aerobic bacterial culture of samples of the mass yielded
		"growth of a yeast organism after a 10-day incubation period; histologically,"
		Histoplasma capsulatum was identified. Treatment with itraconazole was initiated.
		"Nineteen days after surgery, superficial pain sensation and voluntary motor"
		"function were evident in both hind limbs. After approximately 3.5 months, the cat"
		was ambulatory with sling assistance and had regained some ability to urinate
		voluntarily. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In cats with myelopathies that have no overt
		"evidence of fungal dissemination, differential diagnoses should include CNS"
		histoplasmosis. Although prognosis associated with fungal infections of the CNS
		"is generally guarded, treatment is warranted and may have a positive outcome."

PG	-	171-4
AB	-	Histoplasmosis Histoplasma capsulatum is a common systemic mycosis in
		immunocompromised subjects. It has not been reported in Maghreb countries. The
		purpose of this report is to describe a case with cutaneous presentation
		involving a Moroccan woman undergoing long-term corticosteroid therapy for
		systemic inflammatory diseases (rheumatoid polyarthritis and scleroderma). In
		"addition to the main pathophysiological features of the disease, the authors"
		present the causal agent and clinical manifestations. They stress the importance
		of laboratory findings in the diagnosis of this fungal disease.

TI	-	Blastomycosis in indiana: digging up more cases.
PG	-	1377-82
LID	-	10.1378/chest.10-0627 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: The endemic region of blastomycosis historically has included the
		"state of Indiana. However, few published reports of blastomycosis exist to"
		substantiate this distinction. A surge of patients with blastomycosis in central
		Indiana (Indianapolis and surrounding counties) beginning in 2005 prompted us to
		review our local experience. We propose that this surge was related to major
		highway construction around Indianapolis. METHODS: We reviewed all
		microbiologically confirmed cases from four hospitals serving central Indiana.
		"Chart review was completed for adult patients, and data were collected on"
		"clinical presentations, methods of diagnosis, comorbidities, radiologic findings,"
		"treatment, and outcomes. We plotted patient residence addresses with sites of"
		highway construction. RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients were identified from
		"laboratory results and physician referral. Interestingly, a surge of"
		blastomycosis incidence occurred in 34 patients between 2005 and 2008 during
		which time major highway projects were under way around the Indianapolis
		metropolitan area. The majority of these patients presented acutely and with
		pulmonary involvement. Fungal culture and antigen testing were the most sensitive
		means to diagnosis. Antifungal therapy was highly effective. CONCLUSIONS: This
		urban outbreak of blastomycosis in Indianapolis should prompt clinicians to
		consider blastomycosis in this highly endemic area of histoplasmosis.

AB	-	Renal disease in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) often
		presents with significant proteinuria and progressive renal failure; focal
		glomerulosclerosis is the most common renal pathology identified. To our
		"knowledge, we report the first case of nephrotic-range proteinuria and preserved"
		renal function in an HIV-infected patient in association with disseminated
		histoplasmosis. The initial level of proteinuria was 12.5 g/24 h. The patient
		"developed a concomitant lesion on his neck, which was biopsied and identified as"
		Histoplasma capsulatum by fungal stains and culture. The serum CF titer of
		antibody against yeast antigens of H. capsulatum was 1:8. The level of serum
		"albumin decreased to 2.0 g/dL, and the level of serum cholesterol increased to"
		284 mg/dL. Immunohistochemical staining of renal biopsy tissue demonstrated
		immune complexes within the mesangium; H. capsulatum antigen was also
		demonstrated in the mesangium. Therapy with oral itraconazole resulted in marked
		clinical improvement. The findings in this case emphasize the need to rule out
		"treatable causes of the nephrotic syndrome in AIDS, especially in cases of"
		immune-complex glomerulonephritis.

AB	-	Infections with Histoplasma are rarely seen in immunocompromized patients. We
		report the case of a renal transplant recipient who presented with disseminated
		histoplasmosis 3.5 years after transplant. He presented severe lactic acidosis
		"(LA), sepsis complicated by circulatory failure, renal failure, and liver"
		dysfunction. We describe the successful use of continuous venovenous
		"hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) with regional citrate anticoagulation, treatment that"
		stabilized our patient until infectious focus was identified and treated. The
		"lactate was decreasing, concomitant with hemodynamic improvement, with reduction"
		and suspension of the norepinephrine. The serum lactate level normalized 52 hours
		after CVVHDF initiated (from 28.9 to 2.2 mmol/L). Continuous renal replacement
		therapy was safely applied and can be recommended as an efficient method on
		adjuvant treatment of hyperlactatemia.

TI	-	Treating oral histoplasmosis in an immunocompetent patient.
PG	-	1373-6
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Histoplasmosis is a deep fungus infection that occurs worldwide and
		is caused by Histoplasma capsulatum. Oral histoplasmosis has been of considerable
		importance in recent years because it occurs frequently in immunosuppressed
		"patients, more often in those who test positive for the human immunodeficiency"
		"virus (HIV). However, the literature contains reports of histoplasmosis in"
		"immunocompetent patients, especially in endemic areas. CASE DESCRIPTION: The"
		"authors describe a case of an HIV-negative, immunocompetent 60-year-old man with"
		ulcerative and painful oral lesions. The clinician included squamous cell
		carcinoma and systemic mycosis in the differential diagnosis. After the patient
		"underwent a biopsy and a definitive diagnosis was reached, his initial treatment"
		"regimen included itraconazole (200 milligrams per day for one month), nystatin"
		"and chlorhexidine mouthrinse (0.12 percent, 10 milliliters, two times a day). The"
		itraconazole treatment was continued for three more months (100 mg daily) until
		the lesions had resolved completely. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Clinicians need to
		conduct a careful clinical evaluation and make an accurate diagnosis of ulcerated
		oral lesions. Knowledge of the oral manifestations of histoplasmosis may enable
		clinicians to reach a diagnosis earlier and initiate therapy more quickly.

PG	-	362-4
AB	-	"Histoplasmosis is endemic in some areas of United States and in South America,"
		and generally causes an acute self-limiting respiratory infection. In elderly and
		"immunosuppressed patients the infection can spread through the blood, causing a"
		severe systemic illness. Here we describe two cases of disseminated
		histoplasmosis in AIDS patients. The first was observed in an Italian woman who
		"had never visited endemic countries, and was recognized only at autopsy; the"
		"second was observed in a trans-sexual patient, arrived in Italy from Brazil."
		Clinical suspicion of histoplasmosis is important in immunocompromised patients
		of non-endemic areas as symptoms are often aspecific and misdiagnosis is
		frequent.

TI	-	Colonic histoplasmosis presenting as colon cancer in the nonimmunocompromised
		patient: report of a case and review of the literature.
PG	-	959-63
AB	-	Histoplasma capsulatum is an important pathogen that is the most commonly
		diagnosed endemic mycosis in the gastrointestinal tract of immunocompromised
		hosts. Failure to recognize and treat disseminated histoplasmosis in AIDS
		patients invariably leads to death. Gastrointestinal manifestations frequently
		"involve the terminal ileum and cecum, and depending on the layer of bowel wall"
		"involved present as bleeding, obstruction, perforation, or peritonitis. Because"
		"they can be variable in appearance, they may be mistaken for Crohn's disease or"
		malignant tumors. Four distinct pathologic patterns of GI histoplasmosis have
		been described that all have differing clinical presentations. We report a case
		of a non-AIDS patient who presented with a near-obstructing colonic mass
		suspicious for advanced malignancy but was found to have histoplasmosis on final
		"pathology. The patient underwent successful operative resection, systemic"
		"anti-fungal therapy, and extensive workup for immunosuppressive disorders, which"
		were negative. The patient was from an area in Mexico known to be endemic for
		histoplasmosis. This is the first report of a colonic mass lesion occurring in a
		"non-AIDS patient, and review of the worldwide literature regarding GI"
		histoplasmosis reveals excellent long-term survival with aggressive therapy. We
		discuss the surgical and medical management of colonic histoplasmosis in this
		report.

PG	-	150

LID	-	150
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Histoplasmosis is a mycosis caused by soil-based fungus Histoplasma
		"capsulatum endemic in the USA, Latin America, Africa and South-East Asia. The"
		"disease is usually self-resolving, but exposure to a large inoculum or"
		accompanying immune deficiencies may result in severe illness. Symptoms are
		"unspecific with fever, cough and malaise as the most common. Thus, this is a case"
		"of disease which is difficult to diagnose and very rare in Europe. As a result,"
		it is usually not suspected in elderly patients with cough and dyspnea. CASE
		"PRESENTATION: This is a case of a 78-year-old patient, admitted to our department"
		"due to respiratory failure, cough, shortness of breath, fever and weight loss"
		with no response to antibiotics administered before the admission. Chest CT
		revealed numerous reticular and nodular infiltrations with distribution in all
		lobes. The cytopathology of BAL showed small parts of mycelium and numerous oval
		spores. Considering clinical presentation and history of travel to Mexico before
		"onset of disease, pulmonary histoplasmosis was diagnosed. After introduction of"
		antifungal treatment rapid improvement was achieved in terms of both clinical
		picture and respiratory function. CONCLUSIONS: Since the risk of Histoplasma
		"exposure in Europe is minimal, patients, who present with dyspnea, fever and"
		"malaise are not primarily considered for diagnosis of histoplasmosis. However,"
		"taking into account increasing popularity of travelling, also by elderly or"
		"patients with impaired immunity, histoplasmosis should be included into"
		differential diagnosis.

AB	-	Histoplasmosis has emerged as an important opportunistic fungal infection in
		immunocompromised patients. Histoplasma is a dimorphic fungus that primarily
		involves lung and the environmental reservoir is soil. Although several cases of
		histoplasmosis have been reported in India but cytological diagnosis was made in
		a few cases. We are presenting two cases of histoplasmosis diagnosed on
		"fine-needle aspiration cytology. In the first case, pulmonary histoplasmosis was"
		diagnosed on transbronchial needle aspiration of lung in a 41-year-old
		"immunocompetent male, while second case was of disseminated histoplasmosis in"
		40-year-old immunocompromised female diagnosed on cytology of cervical lymph
		"node. FNAC is a simple, safe, and rapid technique to establish the initial"
		"diagnosis, thus promoting early treatment and favorable outcome especially in the"
		immunocompromised patients.

AB	-	Invasive histoplasmosis is the most common AIDS-defining event in endemic regions
		"such as South America. In non-endemic regions, less familiar to the diagnosis,"
		invasive histoplasmosis can be mistakenly diagnosed as miliary tuberculosis
		leading to a high mortality rate. Here we present the case of an invasive
		histoplasmosis mistakenly diagnosed as tuberculosis. The diagnosis of
		"histoplasmosis was considered later on, in light of patient's clinical"
		deterioration and positive Aspergillus galactomannan antigens. This case
		highlights the importance of considering other opportunistic infections when
		facing a culture-negative miliary tuberculosis without clinical improvement
		despite anti-tuberculosis therapy. It also draws our attention to the tools
		available in non-endemic regions that can be helpful in the diagnosis of invasive
		histoplasmosis.

AB	-	This is a case report of a 37-year-old woman evaluated with 18F-fludeoxyglucose
		(18F-FDG) positron emission computed tomography/CT with recurrent fever after
		treatment with itraconazole for 6 weeks for histoplasmosis. The examination
		demonstrated a decrease in the dimensions of the pulmonary opacities previously
		identified in the left lower lobe and attributed to histoplasmosis. In addition
		"to these pulmonary opacities, increased FDG uptake was also observed in lymph"
		"nodes present in the cervical region, mediastinum, left lung hilum, and hepatic"
		"hilum. Notably, other pulmonary opacities with ground-glass pattern that were not"
		present in the previous computed tomography were detected in the right lower
		"lobe, with mild 18F-FDG uptake. Nasal swab performed shortly after the"
		"examination was positive for COVID-19. In this case, the 18F-FDG positron"
		emission computed tomography/CT study demonstrated findings consistent with
		active COVID-19 infection coexisting with inflammatory changes associated with
		histoplasmosis infection.

AB	-	While adrenal gland histoplasmosis has been previously diagnosed by fine needle
		"aspiration utilizing the percutaneous approach, EUS-FNA has not been employed in"
		the diagnosis of this infection affecting both adrenal glands. We report a
		patient with massive bilateral adrenal enlargement due to histoplasmosis that was
		diagnosed by EUS-FNA. Trans-duodenal and trans-gastric fine needle aspiration
		biopsy of both adrenal glands was performed. Rapid onsite cytopathologic
		"evaluation (ROSE) revealed epithelioid histiocytes, singly and in clusters"
		consistent with granulomas. Apparent intracytoplasmic inclusions suggestive of
		organisms were visible. A Gomori Methenamine Silver stain (GMS) revealed abundant
		"small intracellular budding yeasts, morphologically consistent with Histoplasma;"
		the patient was admitted for amphotericin B intravenous infusion. His fever
		abated on the second day after amphotericin B was started. His urine Histoplasma
		antigen was positive. Fungal cultures from both adrenal EUS-FNA samples grew
		"Histoplasma capsulatum. After a one week hospital stay, he was discharged home on"
		itraconazole 200 mg po bid for one year. Four months after initiation of
		"treatment, his urine Histoplasma antigen was undetectable. Nine months after"
		"initial diagnosis, the patient regained his energy level, and returned to work"
		with complete resolution of his initial symptoms. This case highlights that
		EUS-FNA with ROSE can be a highly effective tool in the diagnosis of uncommon
		infections of the adrenal glands.

TI	-	Indigenous case of disseminated histoplasmosis from the Penicillium marneffei
		endemic area of China.
PG	-	47-50
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-010-9295-4 [doi]
AB	-	This is the first indigenous case of disseminated histoplasmosis reported from
		the Penicillium marneffei endemic area in southern China. It was diagnosed by
		"histopathology of tissue, gross and microscopic morphology of the culture and PCR"
		assay of the isolated fungus. Successful antifungal treatment was with
		itraconazole 400 mg/day for 5 months. This case suggests that histoplasmosis
		should be an important differential diagnosis in immunocompromised patients in
		southern China and South East Asia (the only endemic area for P. marneffei).

PG	-	199-205
AB	-	"INTRODUCTION: Laryngeal histoplasmosis was first described in 1952. Since then,"
		fewer than 100 cases had been reported. This dimorphic fungus is endemic in the
		Mississippi and Ohio River Valleys. The yeast phase is responsible for human
		infection. METHODS: We report a 44-year-old woman who developed laryngitis. The
		"markedly abnormal larynx, which could have been mistaken for papillomatosis, was"
		"biopsied, at which time the diagnosis of histoplasmosis was confirmed. Treatment"
		with oral ketoconazole was instituted. RESULTS: Objective voice assessment showed
		"abnormalities of maximum phonation time, speaking fundamental frequency,"
		"perturbation, percent voicing, mean flow rate, and spectral pattern. Subsequent"
		"to antifungal therapy, objective measures were improved. CONCLUSION: This"
		represents the first case of laryngeal histoplasmosis in which response to
		therapy is documented by objective vocal assessment.

AB	-	Fingolimod is an immune-modulating drug used in the treatment of multiple
		sclerosis. Histoplasma capsulatum is a dimorphic fungus that can infect humans.
		"Infection with the pathogen typically affects the lungs, but it is usually"
		"asymptomatic and self-limited. However, immunocompromised patients infected with"
		"the pathogen can present atypically, including the development of primary"
		cutaneous lesions. We describe an interesting clinical case of a cutaneous H
		capsulatum infection in a patient treated with fingolimod.

PG	-	464-6
AB	-	Gastrointestinal involvement with histoplasmosis in patients with the acquired
		immunodeficiency syndrome is a rare but documented phenomenon. Most patients
		"present with diarrhea, fever, and abdominal pain. We present a case of a woman"
		who tested positive for the human immunodeficiency virus antibody who developed
		an intestinal perforation due to Histoplasma capsulatum of the ileum. The
		"patient, whose only risk factor was a blood transfusion 8 years earlier, had been"
		previously diagnosed as having disseminated histoplasmosis with gastrointestinal
		"involvement. While receiving oral antifungal treatment (itraconazole), she"
		developed two separate areas of ileal perforation due to H capsulatum.
		"Complications from gastrointestinal involvement with histoplasmosis, such as"
		"perforation, should be considered in patients infected with the human"
		immunodeficiency virus with signs and symptoms suggesting abdominal disease.

TI	-	Disseminated histoplasmosis from a calcified lung nodule after long-term
		corticosteroid therapy in an elderly Japanese patient: A case report.
PG	-	e15264
LID	-	10.1097/MD.0000000000015264 [doi]
LID	-	e15264
AB	-	RATIONALE: Histoplasmosis occurs most commonly in Northern and Central America
		and Southeast Asia. Increased international travel in Japan has led to a few
		annual reports of imported histoplasmosis. Healed sites of histoplasmosis lung
		infection may remain as nodules and are often accompanied by calcification.
		Previous studies in endemic areas supported the hypothesis that new
		"infection/reinfection, rather than reactivation, is the main etiology of"
		symptomatic histoplasmosis. No previous reports have presented clinical evidence
		of reactivation. PATIENT CONCERNS: An 83-year-old Japanese man was hospitalized
		with general fatigue and high fever. He had been treated with prednisolone at
		13 mg/d for 7 years because of an eczematous skin disease. He had a history of
		"travel to Los Angeles, Egypt, and Malaysia 10 to 15 years prior to admission."
		"Five years earlier, computed tomography (CT) identified a solitary calcified"
		nodule in the left lingual lung segment. The nodule size remained unchanged
		"throughout a 5-year observation period. Upon admission, his respiratory condition"
		"remained stable while breathing room air. CT revealed small, randomly distributed"
		"nodular shadows in the bilateral lungs, in addition to the solitary nodule."
		"DIAGNOSIS: Disseminated histoplasmosis, based on fungal staining and cultures of"
		autopsy specimens. INTERVENTIONS: The patient's fever continued despite several
		"days of treatment with meropenem, minocycline, and micafungin. Although he"
		"refused bone marrow aspiration, isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and"
		prednisolone were administered for a tentative diagnosis of miliary tuberculosis.
		"OUTCOMES: His fever persisted, and a laboratory examination indicated severe"
		thrombocytopenia with disseminated intravascular coagulation. He died on day 43
		"postadmission. During autopsy, the fungal burden was noted to be higher in the"
		"calcified nodule than in the disseminated nodules of the lung, suggesting a"
		pathogenesis involving endogenous reactivation of the nodule and subsequent
		hematogenous and lymphatic spread. LESSONS: Physicians should consider
		histoplasmosis in patients with calcified nodules because the infection may
		reactivate during long-term corticosteroid therapy.

		Case Report and a Review of Literature.

AB	-	Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is traditionally regarded as a rapidly
		"progressive and often fatal illness. In patients with AIDS, HLH usually occurs"
		secondary to opportunistic infections. Although popular guidelines exist for the
		"diagnosis and management of HLH in general, no formal study has evaluated their"
		applicability among adult patients who develop HLH in the setting of AIDS and
		opportunistic infections. The study reports on a case of HLH in a patient with
		AIDS and disseminated histoplasmosis. Eighteen other previously reported cases of
		HLH in the setting of AIDS and histoplasmosis were reviewed. Majority of the
		cases occurred in patients with a CD4 count of less than 70 cells/mm(3). Overall
		mortality was 44%. Not getting antifungal treatment and having Histoplasma in
		blood were the 2 main risk factors for death. Among the patients who had a timely
		"diagnosis of histoplasmosis and were initiated on antifungal therapy, the"
		"survival rates were significantly better, especially in the post-2000 ad period."

TI	-	Histoplasmosis as a cause of nodular myositis in an AIDS patient diagnosed on
		fine needle aspiration cytology. A case report.
PG	-	89-91
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Histoplasmosis, extrapulmonary or disseminated, with positive HIV"
		serology is an indicator of AIDS. Infection by Histoplasma capsulatum (HC) has
		"been found on fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) in the lung, breast,"
		"adrenal, gastrointestinal tract, lymph nodes, subcutaneous tissues and other"
		sites. We could not find any reports of isolated nodular myositis caused by HC
		"and diagnosed on FNAC. CASE: A 42-year-old, HIV-1-positive, heterosexual man"
		"presented with generalized myalgia, fever and multiple painful nodules in the"
		skeletal muscles. The CD4 count was 66 cells per microliter. FNAC from multiple
		"nodules contained numerous intracytoplasmic and a few extracellular, 3-5-microm,"
		"oval, pale yeasts, occasionally showing single budding with a narrow base."
		"Morphology of the yeasts, as demonstrated by May-Grünwald-Giemsa and Gomori"
		"methenamine silver stain, was characteristic of HC. The patient's condition"
		"improved, and the nodules disappeared rapidly within 5 days of treatment with"
		"fluconazole, 400 mg daily. CONCLUSION: The cytomorphology of HC is"
		characteristic. An unusual presentation of rare infections can cause considerable
		diagnostic difficulties for both the clinician and cytopathologist. Awareness of
		"these rarities is important to ensure optimal patient care. Thus, the role of"
		FNAC is critical and remains unchallenged.

TI	-	The role of the dentist in diagnosing infection in the AIDS patient.
PG	-	315-8
AB	-	A case report of an AIDS patient afflicted with disseminated histoplasmosis is
		presented. Characteristic granulomatous-appearing lesions on the tongue were
		"observed during the patient's initial workup, but the patient became unavailable"
		"for a scheduled biopsy. Consequently, the diagnosis of a histoplasmosis infection"
		"was established only after the performance of several time-consuming, stressful,"
		"and, at times, invasive diagnostic procedures. It is proposed that early"
		histologic evaluation of the suspicious oral lesions would have resulted in the
		"diagnosis, thus making more extensive diagnostic testing unnecessary. This case"
		illustrates the need for the dentist to pursue an aggressive approach in
		evaluating oral lesions in the AIDS patient.

		Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of rapid onset histoplasmosis in
		"patients receiving anti-tumor necrosis factor agents. In such cases, these agents"
		"should be immediately stopped, investigations performed, and appropriate"
		treatment started.

AB	-	Voriconazole is an antifungal agent that is commonly used in immunocompromised
		patients who develop fungal infections. We report a case of severe recurrent
		hyperkalemia that developed after starting voriconazole for the treatment of
		histoplasmosis in a kidney transplant patient who was maintained on
		tacrolimus-based immunosuppression. Hyperkalemia developed despite reducing the
		tacrolimus dose to maintain levels in a low therapeutic range. Although
		"interactions between azoles and calcineurin inhibitors are widely recognized,"
		this is the 1st report describing new-onset hyperkalemia following initiation of
		voriconazole in a kidney transplant patient receiving tacrolimus.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: American histoplasmosis is a mycosis caused by Histoplasma
		capsulatum. A variety of clinical features of histoplasmosis have been commonly
		described ranging from asymptomatic infections to severe pulmonary infections. In
		"immunocompromised individuals, progressive disseminated forms are frequent,"
		"leading to fatal outcome if untreated. However, H. capsulatum sinusitis is"
		unusual with a few cases documented over the last three decades and may be
		"underdiagnosed or confused with other fungal aetiologies, especially outside"
		"endemic regions. CASE PRESENTATION: In this study, we report an atypical case of"
		Histoplasma capsulatum sinus fungus ball-like in a patient with Acquired
		Immunodeficiency Syndrome due to Human Immunodeficiency Virus complicated by a
		disseminated histoplasmosis with a death ending. Diagnosis relied on CT-Scan
		imaging and on both direct examination of H. capsulatum yeast forms (Gomory
		"methenamine Grocott) in the sinus specimen (aspirate, biopsy) and on positivity"
		"of the culture further confirmed by qPCR. CONCLUSIONS: Since last few decades,"
		"among the eight reviewed patients, H. capsulatum sinusitis occurred mostly in"
		HIV-immunocompromised patients and for three cases as a sinusitis with
		"disseminated histoplasmosis. Even if this is a rare clinical presentation, its"
		diagnosis is crucial as it could represent an early expression of an Histoplasma
		capsulatum exposure that can evolve into a disseminated fatal infection when
		immunity decreases.

		case report and literature review.
PG	-	143
LID	-	10.1186/1471-2334-13-143 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Histoplasmosis is a common opportunistic fungal infection that is
		"observed almost exclusively in immunodeficient patients, especially those with"
		AIDS. Immunocompetent individuals that suffer from histoplasmosis are rarely
		"reported, especially those with disseminated lesions, such as disseminated"
		histoplasmosis. The observation of disseminated histoplasmosis with prominent
		"gastrointestinal involvement, no respiratory symptoms (which is presumed to be"
		"the portal of infection), gastrointestinal pathological changes, and minor"
		digestive system disorders make this case study exceedingly rare. CASE
		PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 33-year-old immunocompetent male who
		"presented with fever and weight loss. Based on investigations, the patient showed"
		"pancytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, bone marrow involvement and marked colonic"
		"involvement. Finally, disseminated histoplasmosis was diagnosed and confirmed by"
		stained smears of fine needle aspirates and biopsy from lesions in the bone
		marrow and colon. The patient showed appreciable regression of lesions following
		"prompt treatment with amphotericin B deoxycholate, and was treated thereafter"
		with oral itraconazole following discharge from hospital. CONCLUSION:
		Disseminated histoplasmosis could be underestimated in immunocompetent patients.
		A high degree of clinical suspicion is essential in both immunocompromised and
		"immunocompetent patients, regardless of pulmonary symptoms, and whether in"
		endemic or non-endemic areas. Early and accurate diagnosis is extremely important
		for the appropriate treatment of infection and to improve disease outcome.

		"AIDS, is an opportunistic fungal infection caused by Histoplasma capsulatum. The"
		authors report a case of PDH in a HIV-infected African child from a Histoplasma
		"capsulatum non-endemic area. An 8-year-old girl from Kwazulu/Natal, South Africa,"
		was admitted to King Edward VIII hospital with pyrexia and respiratory distress.
		"Pale with generalized lymphadenopathy, she had been sick with general malaise and"
		fever for 3 weeks. A punched-out painless ulcer was present on the child's lower
		left leg and she had ulcerative lesions on the tip of her tongue and the angle of
		"her mouth. There was a tender hepatomegaly and clinical signs of pneumonia, while"
		a chest roentgenogram showed right upper lobe consolidation with early
		cavitation. The purified protein derivative tuberculin skin test was negative and
		no acid-fast bacilli were detected on three sputum samples taken on different
		days. A Western blot test conducted for antibodies to HIV was positive.
		Additional laboratory tests were conducted. The patient was treated with
		"parenteral acyclovir for herpesvirus infection, ceftriaxone for severe"
		"community-acquired pneumonia, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole because"
		Pneumocystis carinii infection was part of the clinical differential diagnosis.
		Bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy revealed yeast forms of H. capsulatum.
		"The girl died on the second day of hospital admission, before antifungal therapy"
		could be commenced.

		Philippines.
PG	-	141-5
AB	-	The incidence and prevalence of histoplasmosis in Southeast Asia has not been
		extensively described. The first microbiologically documented case of
		disseminated histoplasmosis with cutaneous papulonodules in a 56-year-old woman
		from the Philippines is reported. She presented with fever and generalized
		"papulonodular lesions in various stages, which evolved into vesicles with central"
		necrosis that resembled molluscum contagiosum with an indurated erythematous
		halo. Biopsies revealed a granulomatous mass of lymphohistiocytic and epithelioid
		cells with intracellular budding yeast cells and dark nuclei. Cultures were
		positive for Histoplasma capsulatum. The patient was treated with amphotericin B
		"(3 g) and 5-fluorocytosine (50 mg/kg/day), followed by ketoconazole (400 mg/day)."
		Her clinical course was complicated by intractable hemolytic anemia that was
		initially treated with corticosteroids. A splenectomy was subsequently performed.
		Pneumonia and a brain abscess caused by Nocardia asteroides were secondary
		"complications. Nine months after her admission, repeat testing was diagnostic for"
		systemic lupus erythematosus. This patient serves to re-emphasize that cutaneous
		lesions in an immunocompromised patient must be evaluated by biopsy and culture
		analysis. Disseminated histoplasmosis in the immunocompromised host may present
		"with unusual cutaneous lesions, and must be considered even in a nonendemic area."

		the retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy revealed Histoplasma capsulatum. Intestinal
		"obstruction and peritonitis requiring surgical intervention developed, despite"
		amphotericin B therapy. Histoplasmosis should be included in the differential
		"diagnosis in AIDS patients who present with colon tumors, retroperitoneal"
		"lymphadenopathy, and peritonitis."

TI	-	Photodynamic therapy of subfoveal choroidal neovascularization with verteporfin
		"in the ocular histoplasmosis syndrome: one-year results of an uncontrolled,"
		prospective case series.
PG	-	1499-505
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and effect on visual acuity of photodynamic
		"therapy with verteporfin (Visudyne, Novartis AG) in patients with subfoveal"
		choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary to the ocular histoplasmosis
		"syndrome (OHS). DESIGN: Open-label, three-center, noncomparative prospective case"
		series. PARTICIPANTS: OHS patients with subfoveal CNV lesions no larger than 5400
		micro m in greatest linear dimension (GLD) with classic or occult CNV extending
		under the geometric center of the foveal avascular zone and best-corrected visual
		acuity letter score of 73 to 34 (approximate Snellen equivalent 20/40-20/200).
		METHODS: Twenty-six patients received verteporfin (6 mg/m(2)) infused IV over 10
		"minutes. Fifteen minutes after the start of infusion, a laser light at 689 nm"
		delivered 50 J/cm(2) at an intensity of 600 mW/cm(2) over 83 seconds using a spot
		size with a diameter 1000 micro m larger than the GLD of the lesion. At 3-month
		"follow-up examinations, retreatment with the same regimen was applied if"
		angiography showed fluorescein leakage. Safety assessments were also made. MAIN
		OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual function measurements were the changes from baseline in
		"visual acuity and contrast sensitivity scores and the proportion of patients who,"
		"based on best-corrected visual acuity scores, (1) gained 7 or more letters, (2)"
		"lost 8 or more letters, and (3) lost 15 or more letters. RESULTS: One patient was"
		omitted from the study at the month 3 examination for not meeting the visual
		"acuity eligibility requirements at baseline. By the month 12 examination, but"
		"excluding any retreatment at that visit, patients had received an average of 2.9"
		treatments of a maximum of 4 possible treatments. The month 12 median improvement
		"from baseline in visual acuity of the remaining 25 patients was 7 letters, and"
		median contrast sensitivity improved by 2 letters. Median visual acuity
		"improvement was also 7 letters when three patients, who failed to meet all"
		"photographic eligibility requirements at baseline, were excluded. At the month 12"
		"examination, 14 (56%) patients gained 7 or more letters of visual acuity from"
		"baseline, whereas 4 (16%) patients lost 8 or more letters, of which 2 (8%) lost"
		15 or more letters. No serious systemic or ocular adverse events were reported.
		CONCLUSIONS: Median visual acuity improved after verteporfin therapy for at least
		1 year in a small uncontrolled prospective case series of patients with subfoveal
		CNV caused by OHS. Verteporfin therapy seemed to be safe and well tolerated in
		"these patients. Two-year data from this study will provide important, additional"
		information on the safety and effect of verteporfin therapy for the treatment of
		subfoveal CNV secondary to OHS.

TI	-	Intramedullary histoplasmosis spinal cord abscess in a nonendemic region: case
		report and review of the literature.
PG	-	212-5
AB	-	An immunocompetent patient from a nonendemic region developed a rare
		"intramedullary thoracic histoplasmoma. A native Arizonan, with no history of"
		"travel to endemic regions, received 3 months of itraconazole for confirmed"
		gastrointestinal histoplasmosis at an outside institution. Two years later she
		experienced the rapid onset of paraplegia and lost bowel and bladder function.
		Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a ring-enhancing intramedullary lesion at
		T2 and signal abnormality from C2 to T5. Emergent T2-T3 laminectomy was performed
		with ultrasonographically guided intradural exploration and midline myelotomy.
		"The intramedullary abscess was drained. She was nonambulatory, but motor function"
		was partially restored. An Ommaya reservoir was later placed to deliver
		"amphotericin and a new antifungal agent, voriconazole. Magnetic resonance imaging"
		confirmed that the infection had resolved. Intramedullary spinal histoplasmoma is
		"a rare manifestation of disseminated histoplasmosis, particularly in nonendemic"
		regions. Surgery for focal mass lesions and aggressive antifungal chemotherapy
		are the optimal treatment. Newer central nervous system-penetrating antibiotics
		show promise in refractory cases.

LID	-	bcr2015212774
AB	-	We report a case of a 29-year-old man who presented with intermittent haemoptysis
		"for about 18 months. Previously, his symptoms had been diagnosed as"
		musculoskeletal pain and later as pneumonia. CT found a venous infarct in the
		right lung in addition to extensive lymphadenopathy in the mediastinum and
		"pulmonary hila, with associated calcifications almost completely occluding the"
		superior vena cava and azygos vein. Further questioning revealed that the patient
		had once worked on an organic farm in Colorado. Subsequent work up was positive
		for histoplasmosis yeast antibodies. The patient was diagnosed with fibrosing
		mediastinitis (FM) and started on itraconazole for 3 months. We note that FM is a
		rare complication of histoplasmosis and can present as chronic haemoptysis.
		Travel history is an important aspect of the clinical evaluation. Antifungal
		agents have shown some efficacy in treating histoplasmosis-related FM.

PG	-	235-8
AB	-	Immunodeficiency with hyperimmunoglobulinemia M is a rare disease characterized
		by very low levels of IgG and IgA and normal or high levels of serum IgM and IgD.
		Recurrent and severe systemic infections with pathogenic bacteria are frequent if
		immunoglobulin replacement therapy is not given. Histoplasmosis is a systemic
		granulomatous mycosis due to Histoplasma capsulatum and characterized by a
		particular affinity for the reticuloendothelial system. Glabrous skin involvement
		in histoplasmosis is highly unusual except in patients with advanced human
		immunodeficiency viral disease. Cutaneous histoplasmosis and granulomatous
		reaction were diagnosed in a 5-year-old boy with hyper-IgM disease. The lesion
		"improved after oral ketoconazole therapy. To our knowledge, this is the first"
		case of cutaneous histoplasmosis associated with hyper-IgM to be reported.

AB	-	Histoplasma in patients with impaired cellular immunity can disseminate to
		various organs and is known as progressive disseminated histoplasmosis. Similarly
		cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common opportunistic pathogen in an
		immunocompromised host. The authors report an older male with symptoms and
		radiological evidence of subacute intestinal obstruction. The patient had
		concerns for compromised immune system as he was on chronic prednisone and
		methotrexate therapy. Follow-up colonoscopy revealed a stricture in the proximal
		ascending colon. Biopsy of the stricture revealed ulcer with granulomatous
		inflammation including well-formed granulomas and an infiltrate of histiocytes
		within the lamina propria. Special stains on the specimen showed fungal
		structures consistent with Histoplasma capsulatum. Immunochemistry showed
		presence of CMV in the tissue. The patient had good response to antimicrobial
		therapy and did not have progression of intestinal obstruction. This case
		highlights the need to consider infectious pathology in immunocompromised
		patients presenting with obstructive symptoms.

AB	-	Nodular bilateral pulmonary histoplasmosis: cyto-histological correlation. A case
		of nodular pulmonary histoplasmosis is reported. A 29 year old man was admitted
		to hospital with temperature and general weakness following a short stay in a
		tropical country. Laboratory investigation showed an increased E.S.R. and a
		routine chest-roentgenogram revealed multiple bilateral nodular lesions confirmed
		by CT scan. Smears obtained from fine-needle-aspiration biopsy showed the
		presence of epithelioid cell's clusters with a few giant-cells in a background of
		inflammatory elements and necrotic debris. The cytological picture was consistent
		with an inflammatory process with necrotizing granulomatous features. The
		"clinical evolution and the radiological picture progression caused, nevertheless,"
		suspicion of a metastatic tumor. The histological examination of a resected
		"peripheral nodule confirmed the inflammatory nature of the process, revealing the"
		presence of multiple roundish encapsulated conidia 2-4 microns in diameter
		scattered within a granulomatous and necrotic tissue. The fungi are clearly
		pinpointed by using special stains like Grocott method. Serological and
		microbiological investigations are necessary in order to confirm the diagnosis.

AB	-	"To compare clinical features, diagnosis and therapeutic effect between pulmonary"
		histoplasmosis and progressive disseminated histoplasmosis.  Methods: A
		"retrospective analysis for 12 cases of hospitalized patients with histoplasmosis,"
		"who was admitted in Xiangya Hospital, Central South University during the time"
		"from February 2009 to October 2015, was carried out. Four cases of pulmonary"
		histoplasmosis and 8 cases of progressive disseminated histoplasmosis were
		"included. The differences of clinical features, imaging tests, means for"
		diagnosis and prognosis were analyzed between the two types of histoplasmosis. 
		"Results: The clinical manifestations of pulmonary histoplasmosis were mild, such"
		"as dry cough. However, the main clinical symptoms of progressive disseminated"
		"histoplasmosis were severe, including recurrence of high fever, superficial lymph"
		"node enlargement over the whole body, hepatosplenomegaly, accompanied by cough,"
		"abdominal pain, joint pain, skin changes, etc.Laboratory examination showed"
		"pancytopenia, abnormal liver function and abnormal coagulation function. One"
		"pulmonary case received the operation of left lower lung lobectomy, 3 cases of"
		pulmonary histoplasmosis and 6 cases of progressive disseminated histoplasmosis
		"patients were given deoxycholate amphotericin B, itraconazole, voriconazole or"
		fluconazole for antifungal therapy. One disseminated case discharged from the
		"hospital without treatment after diagnosis of histoplasmosis, and 1 disseminated"
		case combined with severe pneumonia and active tuberculosis died ultimately. 
		"Conclusion: As a rare fungal infection, histoplasmosis is easily to be"
		misdiagnosed. The diagnostic criteria depends on etiology through bone marrow
		"smear and tissues biopsy. Liposomeal amphotericin B, deoxycholate amphotericin B"
		and itraconazole are recommended to treat infection for histoplasma capsulatum.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Infection of local bone with Histoplasma capsulatum is rare and
		"difficult to diagnosis, and occurs particularly in immunocompetent subjects, who"
		are more likely to be affected by a wide range of organisms. CASE PRESENTATION:
		An 11-year-old boy presented with localized histoplasmosis osteomyelitis in the
		left fibula without any evidence of abnormal immunological function or systemic
		"disease. After surgical clearance of the lesion and homologous cancellous bone,"
		the patient was treated orally with voriconazole for 6 months. The patient
		completely recovered with full function of his left leg during the 5-year
		follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Histoplasmosis osteomyelitis can occasionally occur in
		immunocompetent individuals and can be complete cured by surgical clearance of
		the lesion and antibiotic treatment.

PG	-	482-5
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between mediastinal fibrosis and human
		leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Vanderbilt
		University Medical Center. SUBJECTS: Nineteen consecutive patients with
		mediastinal fibrosis who presented to the pulmonary clinic at Vanderbilt
		"University Medical Center from 1987 to 1996. The control subjects were 21,086"
		whites who were cadaveric kidney donors from October 1987 through December 1993.
		MEASUREMENTS: HLA testing was performed on blood samples from all 19 cases.
		Information on HLA typing for the control subjects was obtained from the United
		Network for Organ Sharing. Frequency of HLA class I and II antigens found in the
		cases was compared with the frequency in the control subjects. RESULTS: The
		relative risk of mediastinal fibrosis among subjects with the HLA-A2 antigen was
		"3.32 times that of those who lacked this antigen (95% confidence interval, 1.19"
		"to 9. 2). CONCLUSION: HLA-A2 was strongly associated with mediastinal fibrosis,"
		suggesting that an abnormal immune response is important in the pathogenesis of
		this disease. Key words: Histoplasma capsulatum; human leukocyte antigen-A2;
		mediastinal fibrosis

TI	-	Histoplasma capsulatum reactivation with haemophagocytic syndrome in a patient
		with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.
PG	-	418-21
AB	-	We describe a case of haemophagocytic syndrome caused by Histoplasma capsulatum
		reactivation in a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia treated with
		"fludarabine and alemtuzumab. He presented with fever, pancytopenia, increased"
		"serum ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase and soluble interleukin-2 receptor. A bone"
		marrow aspirate showed haemophagocytosis and possibly a yeast infection.
		"Treatment with cyclosporine, dexamethasone, etoposide and caspofungin was"
		started. After initial improvement his condition deteriorated. A second bone
		marrow examination confirmed a Histoplasma infection. After treatment with
		"amphotericin B, the fever resolved and blood counts normalised. Haemophagocytic"
		syndrome is a critical condition with high mortality that requires
		immunosuppressive therapy. The underlying cause should be investigated and
		treated. In this case a Histoplasma reactivation is described in a severely
		immunocompromised host years after the patient had left the endemic area.

AB	-	Spindle cell neoplasms are rarely reported in liver allografts; most are benign
		and associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection. We present a case of a
		malignant spindle cell neoplasm arising in a liver allograft. The patient
		underwent orthotopic liver transplant for cirrhosis secondary to nonalcoholic
		"steatohepatitis. After 2 years, he presented with vague abdominal complaints."
		Imaging studies revealed a 10-cm right hepatic lobe mass. The patient underwent
		"right-sided hepatectomy. The tumor displayed areas of broad, relatively"

		mild to moderate nuclear pleomorphism; and relatively abundant eosinophilic
		cytoplasm. Mitotic activity ranged from 2 to 4 mitotic figures per 20 high-power

		"vimentin, CD99, BCL2, cytokeratin, and human herpesvirus 8. Interphase"

		localization of silver-positive yeast.
PG	-	710-2
AB	-	A case of histoplasmosis in a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome is
		presented. Intracytoplasmic organisms were found in Diff-Quik- and
		Papanicolaou-stained bronchoalveolar lavage fluid sediment. Budding yeasts were
		found in the silver methenamine-stained material. It was initially thought that
		"the yeasts might represent another infecting organism, especially in view of the"
		patient's history of esophageal candidiasis. When the silver-stained material was
		"counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin, simultaneous demonstration of"
		cytologic detail and silver positivity showed that the silver-positive yeasts
		"were intracellular, confirming that they were Histoplasma capsulatum."
		Counterstaining with hematoxylin and eosin allows localization of argyrophilic
		organisms to either intracellular or extracellular sites and is technically
		simple to perform. It is useful in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients
		"and other immunocompromised hosts, in whom multiple organisms are often found."

		found to have H capsulatum in peripheral blood. The evolution of the infection
		was fulminant and all died within the first 96 hours following hospitalization.
		"In every case the presence of the characteristic mycelium and ""tuberculate"""
		macroconidia of Histoplasma was established in cultures. All cases showed the
		hematological abnormalities common in other AIDS associated diseases. In
		"addition, there was an increase in serum lactic dehydrogenase over ten times our"
		normal level: the lowest LDM assay was 2137 IU/mL and the highest 4839 IU/mL.
		This clinical course resembling septicemia and the demonstration of H capsulatum
		in a peripheral blood smear has had a rate of 12% in our experience (four out of
		the 34 cases of AIDS with histoplasmosis seen in our institution from January
		1984 to March 1991).

AB	-	Biologic agents are effective treatments for rheumatoid arthritis but are
		"associated with important risks, including severe infections. Tumor Necrosis"
		Factor (TNF) α inhibitors are known to increase the risk of systemic fungal
		infections such as disseminated histoplasmosis. Abatacept is a biologic agent
		with a mechanism different from that of TNFα inhibitors: It suppresses cellular
		immunity by competing for the costimulatory signal on antigen-presenting cells.
		The risk of disseminated histoplasmosis for patients on abatacept is not known.
		We report a case of abatacept-associated disseminated histoplasmosis and review
		the known infectious complications of abatacept. While the safety of resuming
		biologic agents following treatment for disseminated histoplasmosis is also not
		"known, abatacept is recommended over TNFα inhibitors for rheumatoid arthritis"
		patients with a prior serious infection. We discuss the evidence supporting this
		recommendation and discuss alternative treatments for rheumatoid arthritis
		patients with a history of a serious infection.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Histoplasma capsulatum is the most common endemic mycosis in the
		United States and frequently presents as an opportunistic infection in
		immunocompromised hosts. Though liver involvement is common in disseminated
		"histoplasmosis, primary gastrointestinal histoplasmosis of the liver in absence"
		"of lung involvement is rare. Similarly, cholestatic granulomatous hepatitis in"
		liver histoplasmosis is rarely seen. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a rare case of
		primary gastrointestinal histoplasmosis manifesting with acute granulomatous
		"hepatitis and cholestasis in a 48-year-old female with psoriatic arthritis,"
		"receiving methotrexate and infliximab. The epidemiology, risk factors, clinical"
		"presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of histoplasmosis is discussed."
		"Furthermore, we review the published cases of biopsy-proven disseminated"
		histoplasmosis with cholestatic jaundice to highlight histoplasmosis involvement
		in the liver. CONCLUSION: Histoplasmosis should be considered in immunosuppressed
		"patients with fever, chills, abdominal pain and cholestasis with progressive"
		"jaundice, particularly in subjects without evidence of biliary obstruction."
		"Future studies are needed to accurately assess the risk of this fungal infection,"
		specifically in patients on immunomodulatory therapy for autoimmune disease.

AB	-	The clinical histories of 12 AIDS patients whose histoplasmosis diagnosis has
		been confirmed by histopathological studies were reviewed aimed at knowing the
		main clinical and microbiological aspects of the disseminated progressive
		histoplasmosis. In every case it appeared as a febrile and waste disease with an
		elevated hepatomegaly frequency and generalized adenopathies. More than 50% of
		the patients had anemia and an accelerated erythrocyte sedimentation. The chest
		"X-ray showed pulmonary lesions in 50% of the patients, whereas, the abdominal"
		ultrasound allowed to observe hepatomegaly and splenomegaly in 58.3 and 41.6% of
		"the patients, respectively. A low sensitivity was found in the culture of"
		different clinical specimens as well as in the antibody detection techniques. It
		"is discussed the need to improve tha laboratory diagnosis methods, particularly"
		those which make possible the antigen detection in a fast and specific way.

PG	-	1155-1160
LID	-	10.1111/cup.12792 [doi]
AB	-	Disseminated histoplasmosis most commonly occurs in immunosuppressed individuals
		and involves the skin in approximately 6% of patients. Cutaneous histoplasmosis
		with an intraepithelial-predominant distribution has not been described. A
		47-year-old man was admitted to our institution with fever and
		vancomycin-resistant enterococcal bacteremia. He had been diagnosed with T-cell
		prolymphocytic leukemia 4 years earlier and had undergone matched-unrelated-donor
		"stem cell transplant 2 years earlier; on admission, he had relapsed disease. His"
		medical history was significant for disseminated histoplasmosis 6 months before
		"admission, controlled with multiple antifungal regimens. During this final"
		"hospitalization, the patient developed multiple 2-5 mm erythematous papules, a"
		"hemorrhagic crust across the chest, shoulders, forearms, dorsal aspect of the"
		"fingers, abdomen and thighs. Skin biopsy revealed clusters of oval yeast forms"
		mostly confined to the cytoplasm of keratinocytes and within the stratum corneum;
		scattered organisms were present in the underlying superficial dermis without any
		significant associated inflammatory infiltrate. Special stains and
		immunohistochemical studies confirmed these to be Histoplasma organisms. We
		highlight this previously unrecognized pattern of cutaneous histoplasmosis to
		ensure its prompt recognition and appropriate antifungal therapy.

AB	-	Endemic deep or systemic mycoses are common in specific geographical areas of the
		"world. Coccidioidomycosis is present in semi-desert areas, histoplasmosis and"
		paracoccidioidomycosis in tropical regions and blastomycosis belongs to temperate
		climates. The two former are widely distributed in the American continent and
		some tropical regions of the world; the third is limited to Central and South
		"America, and the last to North America and Central and East Africa. These mycoses"
		"all have a similar pathogenesis, as the inoculum enters the host through the"
		respiratory tract. Cutaneous manifestations are secondary to lymphatic and
		hematogenous dissemination. These deep mycoses are exceptional in Europe. Most
		"cases are observed in returning travelers from endemic areas, aid workers,"
		"archaeologists, speleologist and immigrants. However, there have been some"
		autochthonous cases of histoplasmosis due to Histoplasma capsulatum var.
		capsulatum reported in European countries such as Italy and Germany. In this
		"article, we provide up-to-date epidemiological, clinical, diagnostic and"
		therapeutic data on the four most important imported systemic mycoses in Europe.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Tumor necrosis factor antagonist inhibitors have transformed the
		"approach to patients with severe autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid"
		"arthritis. Although the therapy can be highly effective, TNF-α inhibitors are"
		associated with an increased risk of opportunistic infections. CASE PRESENTATION:
		"Here, we report a case of concomitant disseminated histoplasmosis and"
		tuberculosis in a 65-year-old female with rheumatoid arthritis treated with TNF-α
		inhibitor. Both conditions can be found in disseminated form in immunosuppressed
		"hosts, but co-infection is rare with only a few cases having been reported, to"
		"our knowledge, all in HIV patients. CONCLUSIONS: This case posed a considerable"
		challenge for diagnosis and treatment due to the unusual disseminated
		"co-infection, the overlapping symptoms, and the interactions between medications."

TI	-	Surgical removal of subfoveal neovascularization in the presumed ocular
		histoplasmosis syndrome.
PG	-	7-Jan
AB	-	"We treated two patients with presumed ocular histoplasmosis, subfoveal"
		"neovascular membranes, and progressive visual acuity loss to 20/400."
		Vitreoretinal surgical techniques were used to remove the subfoveal membranes.
		Visual acuity returned to 20/20 with seven months of follow-up in one patient
		(Case 1) and to 20/40 with three months of follow-up in the other patient (Case
		2). No evidence of persistent or current subretinal neovascular membranes in
		either patient have been noted. These preliminary results suggest that
		vitreoretinal surgical techniques may be successful in mechanically removing
		subfoveal neovascular membranes with preservation of overlying neurosensory
		retina and thus preservation of central visual acuity.

AB	-	Disseminated histoplasmosis can have a varied presentation when it affects the
		skin. Presentation mimicking a cutaneous neoplasm is an uncommon manifestation.
		We present the case of an 86-year-old man presenting with a cutaneous lesion
		clinically suspicious for malignancy that was ultimately determined to be his
		first clinical manifestation of disseminated histoplasmosis after biopsy for
		"histopathologic analysis. Microscopically, the lesion was a nodule with an eroded"
		epidermis overlying a dense dermal inflammatory process. The infiltrate was
		characterized by numerous epithelioid histiocytes admixed with acute and chronic
		"inflammation. On closer inspection, numerous 2-4 mum intracellular spores"
		surrounded by a clear halo were identified. The organisms were highlighted with
		periodic acid schiff (PAS) stain. We present this case to highlight a unique
		presentation of disseminated histoplasmosis. Although this presentation is
		"uncommon, it serves as a reminder that histopathologic confirmation of clinical"
		diagnoses is important before undertaking more invasive procedures such as
		excision.

		review of the literature.
PG	-	338-46
AB	-	Sclerosing mediastinitis is an uncommon disease associated with a multiplicity of
		clinical syndromes. The cause of this disorder is probably an abnormal
		"fibroproliferative response to an inflammatory stimulus, most commonly a"
		granulomatous infection secondary to Histoplasma capsulatum. The pathophysiology
		of this disease is predicated on the encasement of mediastinal vital organ
		structures within a dense fibrotic mass. This mass appears to emanate from an
		invasive chronic inflammatory process causing erosion as well as external
		compression of these structures. The following case reports illustrate the
		"diversity of this disease entity, representing a patient population from the Ohio"
		"River Valley, endemic for histoplasmosis. The purpose of this report is to"
		elucidate the various clinical manifestations of sclerosing mediastinitis and to
		correlate the pathologic process with a rational approach to treatment.

		Clinical signs consisted of dorsal spinal syndrome in both cases and a paraplegia

		reconstruction in both cases and a prevertebral abscess in one case. Diagnosis
		was confirmed by mycological and pathological examinations of surgical specimen
		"which revealed Histoplasma duboisii fungus. Medical treatment, after surgical"
		"repair, consisted in ketoconazola with positive results after 12 months. This"
		localisation is rare. It raises diagnosis problems with tuberculous
		spondylodiscitis because of their radio-clinical resemblance.

AB	-	"OBJECTIVES: On December 1905 Darling, resident histopathologist on the Panama"
		"Channel area, observed a parasite in the large mononuclear cells of different"
		"organs. Negroni in 1914 described the first Argentinean case. Lung, oral, nasal,"
		"and laryngeal involvement are common. On the other hand, genital involvement is"
		uncommon. The objective of this war is to communicate the case of a patient with
		genital histoplasmosis. METHODS/RESULTS: A 60-year-old Argentinian male started
		two years before with penile lesions and pruritus. Two partial penile resections
		"had been performed in 1999, but pathology reports were not available. The lesions"
		evolved towards ulceration and bleeding. Surgical toilette was carried out. A
		partial penectomy and glanuloplasty with an original technique were performed.
		Pathology revealed intracellular and extracellular spherical microorganisms.
		Morphologically it was histoplasma capsulatum. The histoplasmosis is an endemic
		mycosis. The infection takes place when inhaling the microconidiae of the fungus
		filamentous phase. Only a small number of people develop the disease after
		infection. Diagnosis is made by discovering of 2-3 micron yeasts with Giemsa
		stain. CONCLUSIONS: If a patient from the histoplasmosis endemic area has a
		"granular lesion, a mycotic disease should be considered."

		"bacterial origin, and three were successfully treated by surgical drainage and"
		antibiotic therapy. The authors present the history of a patient with a
		histoplasmoma of the thalamus. As is often the case with solitary thalamic
		"lesions, this lesion was initially assumed to be a tumor and was first treated"
		"with radiotherapy. Despite the sensitive location of the lesion, tissue diagnosis"

AB	-	CASE PRESENTATION: We analysed a 38-year-old woman with disseminated
		histoplasmosis for primary immunodeficiency. Her blood showed no IFN-γ response
		while her peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) did. We identified IFN-γ
		autoantibodies of the IgG class in her serum. CONCLUSION: IFN-γ autoantibodies
		"leading to infections were so far mainly detected in people from Asian descent,"
		where it was found to be associated with certain HLA types. This may be the first
		"patient of African descent, and without the typical HLA types that predispose to"
		"this problem, that produces IFN-γ autoantibodies."

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Disseminated histoplasmosis (DH) is an opportunistic fungal infection
		in severely immunocompromised patients with HIV infection. Haemophagocytic
		"syndrome (HFS), which can occur in these co-infected patients when the immune"
		"response is significantly altered, is often associated with high mortality. AIMS:"
		"To describe the epidemiological, clinical, analytical and microbiological"
		"characteristics, along with studying the presence of HFS, in patients with"
		DH-HIV. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on a case series using data
		from the clinical records of patients diagnosed with DH and HIV infection during
		the years 2014 and 2015. RESULTS: DH was diagnosed in 8 (1.3%) of 597 HIV
		"patients. All patients were in stage C3, and 75% (6/8) were not receiving"
		combined antiretroviral therapy (CART). The remaining two patients had recently
		begun CART (possible immune reconstitution syndrome). Five (62.5%) of the 8
		patients met criteria for HFS. The most frequent clinical symptoms were
		"lymphoproliferative and consumptive syndrome, respiratory compromise, and"
		"cytopenia. Histoplasma was isolated in lymph nodes of 75% (6/8) of the patients,"
		"in blood samples in 25% (2/8), and also in intestinal tissue in one patient. The"
		"antifungal therapy was amphotericin B deoxycholate, without adjuvants. The"
		"overall mortality was 50%. CONCLUSIONS: In this case series, DH-HIV co-infection"
		frequently progressed to HFS with high mortality. The clinical picture may
		"resemble that of other systemic opportunistic infections, such as tuberculosis,"
		or can take place simultaneously with other infections. Clinical suspicion is
		important in patients with severe cytopenia and lymphoproliferative and
		consumptive syndrome in order to establish an early diagnosis and prescribing a
		timely specific therapy.

AB	-	Aortic graft infections are a feared complication of aortic bypass operations and
		impart significant morbidity and mortality when they occur. The most common
		"etiology is bacterial, with a presentation ranging from subclinical to acutely"
		symptomatic depending on the organism. Fungal infections of prosthetic grafts are
		"rare, especially in immunocompetent patients. Graft infections remain a clinical"
		diagnosis. We report a rare case of an aortobifemoral graft infection with
		"Histoplasma capsulatum that was diagnosed on surgical pathology, as the"
		preoperative infectious evaluation was negative. The neoaortoiliac system
		operation was successfully used to solve this patient's highly morbid condition.

TI	-	B cells and CD4-CD8- T cells are key regulators of the severity of reactivation
		histoplasmosis.
PG	-	1763-71
AB	-	"The fungus, Histoplasma capsulatum, produces a persistent infection. Reactivation"
		"histoplasmosis is largely a result of impaired immunity, but the perturbations"
		associated with escape of the fungus from host defenses remain ill-defined. We
		analyzed a murine model of reactivation to elucidate the host defects that permit
		"reactivation. C57BL/6 mice were infected intranasally and, 42 days later, they"
		"were depleted of CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells. Elimination of these cells, but not"
		"either alone, produced a persistent infection over several weeks. Neutralization"
		"of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, or both did not induce reactivation. Endogenous IL-10"
		exacerbated reactivation. Depletion of T cells in B cell(-/-) mice induced a
		"markedly higher burden in organs when compared with wild type. However, the"
		infection remained persistent. Elimination of CD4(+) cells alone or
		neutralization of cytokines increased the fungal load. The persistent infection
		was not dependent on gammadelta T cells or NK cells. Elimination of Thy-1.2(+)
		cells in mice given mAb to CD4 and CD8 transformed reactivation into a
		"progressive, lethal infection in B cell(-/-) and wild-type mice, but the tempo of"
		progression was accelerated in the former. The data reveal the complex control by
		the host to prevent reactivation of this fungus.

AB	-	"Histoplasmosis and leishmaniasis are neglected and endemic diseases in Argentina,"
		and generally are found associated with immunosuppression. We report the case of
		an immunocompetent 16-years-old man with simultaneous occurrence of central
		"nervous system histoplasmosis and cutaneous leishmaniasis. Upon admission, the"
		patient showed a one-month old skin lesion in a leg and mild paraparesis. Imaging
		studies detected thickening and edema in the spinal cord and the cerebrospinal
		fluid analysis was within normal range. The case was diagnosed as a demyelinating
		disorder and treated with high-dose short-term steroids. Seventy-two hours later
		the patient showed severe paraparesis and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging
		revealed nodular lesions in the spinal cord. Histoplasma capsulatum belonging to
		the phylogenetic species LamB was isolated from cerebrospinal fluid samples. The
		"patient received intravenous antifungal therapy with amphotericin B for 30 days,"
		followed by oral fluconazole and itraconazole for one year. Three months after
		"initiation of antifungal treatment, the cutaneous lesion recrudesced and"
		Leishmania amastigotes were observed on microscopic examination. The cutaneous
		leishmaniasis was treated with intramuscular meglumine antimoniate. The patient's
		outcome was favorable after treatment for both diseases.

AB	-	"Disseminated histoplasmosis, with the adrenal glands as being the only site of"
		"demonstrable disease in an immunocompetent adult, is a rare infection leading to"
		adrenal insufficiency. This disease carries high mortality when unrecognised. We
		describe the first reported case of adrenal histoplasmosis in the Philippines in
		"a 72-year-old immunocompetent, Filipino man who presented with a 3-month history"
		"of intermittent flank pain, weight loss and generalised weakness. His imaging"
		demonstrated bilateral adrenal masses on ultrasonography and contrast-enhanced CT
		"scan. The initial impression was adrenal cancer, however, fine-needle aspiration"
		cytology revealed the presence of yeast cells and blood culture grew Histoplasma
		capsulatum The diagnosis of the case represents a diagnostic challenge in
		immunocompetent individuals because they manifest with non-specific symptoms. A
		heightened suspicion is therefore needed to prevent significant morbidity and
		mortality.

PG	-	664-6
LID	-	10.1001/jamaoto.2014.806 [doi]
AB	-	IMPORTANCE: Benign granulomatous disease may mimic malignant disease in the
		"evaluation of mediastinal or pulmonary lesions. However, histoplasmosis as a"
		cause of cervical lymphadenopathy is relatively rare. We report the first case of
		Histoplasma infection mimicking malignant adenopathy discovered during diagnostic
		"thyroid lobectomy. OBSERVATIONS: A 2.5-cm, calcified, right paratracheal lymph"
		node intimately involving the recurrent laryngeal nerve was discovered during
		lobectomy for a follicular lesion of undetermined significance with a positive
		NRAS mutation. Although metastatic thyroid cancer was the most probable
		"diagnosis, results of gross inspection of the bisected thyroid nodule suggested a"
		"benign process. Partial removal of the node, sparing the nerve, established the"
		diagnosis of Histoplasma capsulatum infection. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:
		Histoplasmosis is a rare cause of cervical adenopathy that should be considered
		in cases in which a discordance arises between the malignant gross appearance of
		the adenopathy and the benign gross appearance of an associated thyroid nodule.

		"knowledge, no case of a co-existing polyoma virus nephropathy and pulmonary"
		histoplasmosis in a renal allograft recipient has been reported so far in the

		graft biopsy for asymptomatic graft dysfunction. The graft biopsy showed features
		"of polyoma virus nephropathy. Soon after, he developed fever with pulmonary"
		nodules. Fine-needle aspiration from lung nodules showed intracellular yeast
		forms of histoplasma. The patient responded well to amphotericin B with
		subsidence of fever. The co-existence of renal allograft-limited infection like
		polyoma virus and systemic fungal infection such as histoplasmosis should be kept
		in mind in a transplant recipient with graft dysfunction and non-specific
		systemic symptoms. Prompt recognition of these infections permits the clinician
		to institute appropriate therapeutic modification and improved survival.

		histoplasmosis in the setting of HIV.
PG	-	19
AB	-	A 66-year-old Columbian man presented with a 15-day history of generalized
		"weakness, cough, fever, and verrucous, ulcerating plaques of the face, upper"
		"chest and back, and arms. The patient proved to be HIV positive. Histopathologic"
		examination showed a diffuse lymphocytic infiltrate coupled with a striking
		number of yeast forms within macrophages. The clinical presentation and
		histopathologic alterations are consistent with the diagnosis disseminated
		Histoplasma capsulatum. This case emphasizes the importance of increasing
		awareness of histoplasmosis in nonendemic areas as a result of the large subgroup
		of immunocompromised patients at risk. Disseminated histoplasmosis can be a
		"treatable HIV complication if recognized early, though is unfortunately a"
		harbinger for an overall poor prognosis.

LID	-	377
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Systemic histoplasmosis is a disease of high morbidity and mortality
		in immunocompromised patients. Patients with AIDS get the infection through
		"inhalation of spores, triggering a primary lung infection with a subsequent"
		"hematogenous spread to multiple organs, including the skin. Tissue necrosis have"
		been documented in cutaneous histoplasmosis with multiple clinical manifestations
		that mimic other diseases. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of nasal
		cartilage destruction associated to cutaneous histoplasmosis in AIDS. A
		"24-year-old man, resident in Ecuadorian coast, with a history of HIV for 7 years"
		"without any treatment. In the last 3 months, he has been presenting a"
		molluscum-like lesions on his nasal bridge with subsequent dissemination to the
		"trunk and extremities. He was admitted to the emergency department for dyspnoea,"
		"cough, and malaise. Due to his respiratory failure, he was admitted to the"
		intensive care unit (ICU) with mechanical ventilation. Physical examination
		"reveals a crusted surface ulcer that involves the nose and cheeks, associated"
		"with erythematous papules, some with a crusted surface which are spread to the"
		"face, trunk, and upper limbs. The patient has a specific skin involvement with a"
		butterfly-like ulcer appearance and destruction of the upper and lower lateral
		cartilage of the nose. At admission CD4 cell count was 11/mm(3) with a HIV viral
		"load of 322,908 copies. Mycological cultures identified Histoplasma capsulatum. A"
		"treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was stablished,"
		associated with liposomal amphotericin B at a dose of 3 mg/kg/day and
		itraconazole 200 mg twice a day for 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Cutaneous
		histoplasmosis is a rare manifestation of pulmonary histoplasmosis in patients
		"with AIDS. The cutaneous manifestations included papules, nodules, plaques, and"
		ulcers. A histology examination is required to rule out other fungal or parasitic
		"infections. Treatment includes highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART),"
		"amphotericin B liposomal and itraconazole, the latest for at least 12 months."

		Review.
PG	-	330-333
LID	-	10.7883/yoken.JJID.2018.354 [doi]
AB	-	Histoplasmosis is occasionally encountered in non-endemic countries owing to more
		"frequent international travel and migration, as well as an increase in the number"
		"of vulnerable hosts (e.g., patients with cellular immunodeficiencies). However,"
		the diagnosis of endemic mycoses may be challenging because of its rarity and the
		limited availability of diagnostic tests. We report a case of disseminated
		histoplasmosis in a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected Japanese man who
		had often travelled to histoplasmosis-endemic countries. We also reviewed the
		reported cases of HIV-associated histoplasmosis in Japan. To the best of our
		"knowledge, this is the ninth case report of co-infection with Histoplasma and HIV"
		in Japan and the second involving a Japanese patient. This case emphasizes the
		"importance of noting the details of not only the present residence of patients,"
		"but also their previous residence and travels. If histoplasmosis is suspected,"
		physicians should inform laboratory personnel that fungal cultures should be
		"incubated for 6 weeks, and compliance with biosafety guidelines for handling the"
		specimens should be practiced. Since death occurs in nearly 50% of HIV-associated
		"histoplasmosis cases in Japan, early recognition, timely diagnosis, and"
		appropriate treatment are mandatory.

AB	-	A 63-year-old white man with a history of rheumatoid arthritis on adalimumab was
		admitted to the hospital for left arm swelling and erythema. On physical
		"examination, the patient was afebrile and non-toxic appearing and there was tense"
		oedema of the left forearm. Initial laboratory work was unremarkable except for
		elevated inflammatory markers. MRI of the arm showed non-specific findings of
		inflammation. The patient was started on empiric antibiotics but did not improve.
		"Given the patient's immunosuppression, early consideration was given to fungal or"
		mycobacterial causes. Initial serum fungal studies were negative and the patient
		was taken for diagnostic local incision and biopsy of the left volar forearm.
		Grocott's methenamine silver and periodic acid-Schiff staining revealed fungal
		organisms resembling Histoplasma and intraoperative fungal cultures grew
		Histoplasma capsulatum confirming the diagnosis. The patient was treated with a
		6-month course of itraconazole with improvement in his condition and eventual
		complete resolution.

PG	-	430-1
AB	-	Histoplasmosis is the most common cause of fungal infection in the Ohio River
		Valley of the United States. Ninety-nine per cent of patients exposed to
		histoplasmosis develop only subclinical infections. Liver involvement is common
		"in disseminated histoplasmosis, which usually originates in the lungs. There has"
		been only one prior case described in the literature of histoplasmosis presenting
		as an isolated liver mass. We report a rare case that presented as a solitary
		"right-sided liver lesion invading the diaphragm, with review of the literature"
		for therapy of histoplasmosis of the liver.

AB	-	A 53-year-old man with Crohn's disease treated with adalimumab was hospitalised
		"with abdominal pain, fatigue, fever and chills. CT scan of the abdomen showed"
		chronic thickening of the terminal ileum and cecum and new-onset ascites. Further
		studies revealed weakly positive urine and serum histoplasma antigen. Laparoscopy
		revealed metastatic caking of the omentum and abdominal wall; peritoneal biopsy
		demonstrated organisms morphologically consistent with Histoplasma capsulatum No
		dissemination outside of the peritoneal cavity was evident. The patient completed
		2 weeks of liposomal amphotericin B followed by oral itraconazole for 1 year.
		"Adalimumab therapy was held for 10 weeks, then restarted. Presenting symptoms"
		resolved following initiation of antifungal therapy. Follow-up MRI of his abdomen
		"demonstrated resolution of ascites. To our knowledge, this is the first reported"
		case of histoplasmosis presenting as peritonitis in a patient with Crohn's
		disease receiving antitumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) therapy. Many
		clinicians are aware that patients receiving anti-TNF-α therapy are at increased
		"risk for histoplasmosis, but may fail to consider the diagnosis in the absence of"
		lung involvement.

		"etiology, share many clinical features, including typical manifestations of"

TI	-	Clinical application of rapid serial fourier-domain optical coherence tomography
		for macular imaging.
PG	-	1425-31
AB	-	PURPOSE: To introduce and examine the utility of a retinal imaging technique
		using high-speed optical coherence tomography (OCT) for creating a more complete
		retinal structural map to aid in the evaluation of patients with macular
		pathology. DESIGN: Prospective observational case series. PARTICIPANTS: Five
		patients with a variety of macular pathologies. METHODS: Patients were imaged
		with a Fourier-domain high-speed high-resolution OCT system built at our
		institution. A sweeping serial OCT B-scan of the macula was acquired to create a
		detailed retinal structural map. The data were then used to make individual
		clinical observations. RESULTS: Rapid serial OCT B-scans produced detailed
		macular maps for all 5 patients. Diagnoses of imaged patients included macular
		"hole, lamellar macular hole, regressed macular hole or macular microhole,"
		"choroidal neovascular membrane (CNV) from age-related macular degeneration, and"
		CNV from presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome. Reconstructed B-scans and
		C-scans are shown for selected patients to illustrate the additional perspectives
		gained by obtaining a detailed retinal map. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid serial
		Fourier-domain OCT B-scanning can be used to create a detailed retinal structural
		map. This technique provides additional information that can be missed on single
		"OCT images and provides an accurate way to image large or complex lesions, and"
		allows B-scan and C-scan reconstructions to be made that provide additional
		perspectives into retinal structures that may be missed using traditional imaging
		methods.

AB	-	We report a case of disseminated histoplasmosis in a renal transplant recipient
		who presented with a nodular pulmonary lesion and elevated serum and
		bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) Aspergillus galatomannan. This almost led to an
		erroneous diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis since the donor respiratory tract
		"was known to be colonized with Aspergillus terreus. However, distinctive"
		intracelluar Histoplasma yeasts on peripheral blood smear led to early diagnosis
		and appropriate treatment. The cross-reactivity between Aspergillus galactomannan
		and Histoplasma antigen is discussed further.

PG	-	595-604
AB	-	The product limit method of Kaplan and Meier for estimating survival functions
		and the logrank test of Mantel are widely employed for analysis of longitudinal
		"medical data. Developed for analysis of one-time events such as death, survival"
		analysis is also commonly adapted to more complex states such as loss of vision
		or cancer remission by restricting analysis to first occurrences. The
		nonparametric discrete time nonhomogeneous Markov process is proposed as a better
		model for any applications of the latter type. This simple stochastic model
		allows for an arbitrary number of possible states and for transitions in any
		direction. Maximum likelihood estimators are easily computed for the stochastic
		model and are identical to the product-limit estimates in the special case
		represented by the Kaplan-Meier model. The logrank test extends to evaluation of
		differences between populations with respect to any specified transition.

AB	-	Histoplasmosis is the second most common fungal infection reported among domestic
		felines in the United States. Dissemination of the organism after inoculation is
		"common and affected organ systems include the respiratory tract, gastrointestinal"
		"tract, reticuloendothelial organs, skeletal system, integument, and ocular"
		"system. However, histoplasmosis presenting as a discrete granulomatous mass"
		identified on echocardiogram has never been reported in the veterinary
		"literature. Here, we describe the first case of feline histoplasmosis presenting"
		"as a granuloma with cardiac involvement. The patient, a 6-year-old male neutered"
		"domestic longhair feline, was referred for tachypnea and dyspnea. A mass in the"
		cranial mediastinum abutting the heart was diagnosed via two-dimensional
		echocardiography. Cytology of fine needle aspirates from the mass revealed round
		yeast structures consistent with Histoplasma spp. The patient was treated with
		"oral fluconazole therapy, and subsequent rechecks have shown marked improvement"
		"in clinical parameters, lesion size, and antigen concentrations."

AB	-	HISTORY AND ADMISSION FINDINGS: We report on a 57-year-old patient presenting
		"with progressive malaise, joint pain and skin rashes one month after visiting"
		Costa Rica. After exclusion of common tropical diseases empiric antibiotic
		"therapy was initiated, however, the patient's symptoms did not improve."
		INVESTIGATIONS: CT scan of the chest demonstrated an intrapulmonary nodular
		lesion. Bronchoscopy revealed no pathological changes. Microbiologic analysis of
		the bronchoalveolar lavage fluids identified no pathogen. An abdominal ultrasound
		examination did not reveal pathological findings. Serological tests were positive
		for Histoplasma capsulatum. TREATMENT AND COURSE: Treatment with itraconazole
		"resulted in a fast initial clinical improvement, but complete resolution of all"
		symptoms only occurred after completion of a 6-months course of itraconazole.
		Serial CT scans demonstrated a continuous regression of the pulmonary lesion.
		"CONCLUSION: Histoplasmosis has a low incidence among travelers. However,"
		histoplasmosis should be considered in patients with respiratory symptoms and
		"history of travel to endemic countries, specifically when common traveler"
		"diseases have been excluded. Diagnosis is confirmed by serology, imaging and"
		"ultimately by biopsy for histological, cultural and molecular identification of"
		the pathogen. Antimycotic drug therapy is the recommended treatment of choice for
		symptomatic cases.

TI	-	Progressive disseminated histoplasmosis in the HIV population in Europe in the
		HAART era. Case report and literature review.
PG	-	611-20
LID	-	10.1007/s15010-014-0611-7 [doi]
AB	-	"INTRODUCTION: In highly endemic areas, up to 20 % of human immunodeficiency virus"
		(HIV)-infected persons will develop progressive disseminated histoplasmosis
		"(PDH). Europe is not endemic to histoplasmosis, and the disease is mainly found"
		in immigrants often co-infected with HIV. METHODS: We present a case of a patient
		with HIV and PDH highlighting the possible diagnostic difficulties that may arise
		in a non-endemic area and review the literature of histoplasmosis in the context
		of HIV infection with special focus on Europe. DISCUSSION: When cellular immunity
		"wanes (usually at CD4 T-lymphocyte counts <150 cells/μL) histoplasma infection,"
		"acquired earlier, can reactivate and disseminate. PDH is an acquired immune"
		"deficiency syndrome(AIDS)-defining disease and a life-threatening infection, with"
		"a clinical spectrum ranging from an acute, fatal course with lung infiltrates and"
		"respiratory failure, shock, coagulopathy and multi-organ failure, to a more"
		"subacute disease with focal organ involvement, pancytopenia and"
		"hepatosplenomegaly. Mortality rates remain high for untreated patients, but early"
		"diagnosis, proper antifungal treatment and early initiation of antiretroviral"
		therapy have improved the prognosis. CONCLUSION: European infectious diseases
		"physicians, microbiologists and pathologists must be aware of histoplasmosis,"
		particularly when facing HIV-infected immigrants from endemic areas. This is
		increasingly important due to migration and travel activities from these areas.

		Addisonian crisis.
PG	-	687-91
AB	-	"A 56-year-old man with persistently elevated liver enzyme levels, fatigue,"
		lethargy and a 9.0 kg weight loss over six months underwent a percutaneous liver
		biopsy that demonstrated multiple granulomas. Screening serologies were positive
		"for histoplasmosis, and he was started on itraconazole treatment. He returned to"
		hospital the same night with coffee-ground emesis and in Addisonian crisis
		requiring parenteral steroids and intensive care unit support. An abdominal
		"computed tomography scan revealed bilaterally enlarged, nonenhancing adrenal"
		"glands suggestive of infarcts, presumed secondary to histoplasmosis. Treatment"
		"was initiated with amphotericin B, and Histoplasma capsulatum was cultured from"
		his urine and cerebrospinal fluid. A serum immunodiffusion test was also positive
		"for both H and M bands, indicating active infection with Histoplasmosis species."
		His serum and urine samples were also weakly positive for the antigen. Despite
		"complications of renal failure, pneumonia and congestive heart failure, he"
		recovered with medical therapy and was discharged home to complete a prolonged
		course of itraconazole therapy. While hepatic granulomas often reflect an occult
		"disease process, the cause may remain undiscovered in 30% to 50% of patients"
		despite exhaustive investigations. H capsulatum is an uncommon cause of
		"granulomatous liver disease, and with its protean clinical presentation, a high"
		index of suspicion is needed to make the diagnosis and avoid the potentially high
		fatality rate associated with disseminated infection.

TI	-	[Central nervous system histoplasmosis].
PG	-	129-34
AB	-	Central nervous system (CNS) histoplasmosis is one of the important endemic
		mycoses in America and Africa. Although the incidence of CNS histplasmosis in
		"non-endemic areas is increasing, the diagnosis of isolated CNS histoplasmosis in"
		"these areas remains challenging. Since the diagnosis is often missed, the outcome"
		of CNS histoplasmosis is occasionally poor. One of the important complications of
		"this condition is hydrocephalus, which may be identified before meningitis is"
		diagnosed. Antigen or serological tests are useful for the diagnosis of CNS
		"histoplasmosis; however, it should be noted that false positive results may be"
		"obtained because of cross reactions due to infections by other fungi. Further,"
		repeated culture with a large volume of cerebrospinal fluid is essential because
		"of the low sensitivity of culture. Thus, it is recommended that tests for CNS"
		"histplasmosis be repeated, even if negative results are obtained initially."
		Liposomal amphotericin B is the usual initial therapy for CNS histoplasmosis.
		"However, the rate of failure of initial treatment is high and relapse can occur"
		"in the next few years, which calls for careful management of patients with CNS"
		histoplasmosis. Continued therapy with antifungal agents such as fluconazole or
		itraconazole is often required. We report a case of a patient with chronic
		"meningitis in whom the tests for other causes were negative for about 10 years,"
		and who was eventually diagnosed with CNS histoplasmosis. Treatment with
		"fluconazole was initiated, and the patient's symptoms gradually improved. Further"
		cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and brain computed tomography (CT) during the
		follow-up period of 2 years and 9 months did not reveal recurrence of meningitis
		"or hydrocephalus, thereby indicating the successful treatment of CNS"
		histoplasmosis with fluconazole. CNS histoplasmosis should always be included in
		the differential diagnoses of chronic meningitis in non-endemic areas even in the
		case of immunocompetent individuals.

TI	-	Disseminated histoplasmosis in an adopted infant from El Salvador.
PG	-	474-6
AB	-	An HIV-negative 4-month-old infant recently adopted from El Salvador was admitted
		"for high fever. Hepatosplenomegaly, anaemia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia,"
		"increased transaminases, and diffuse interstitial pulmonary infiltration were"
		present on admission. Granulomas were seen in bone marrow and liver biopsies
		without any organism. Disseminated histoplasmosis was diagnosed 2 weeks later
		when bone marrow and blood cultures taken on admission became positive for
		Histoplasma capsulatum and when histoplasmic antigen was detected in blood. The
		outcome was good after treatment with amphotericin B followed by itraconazole
		which was administered for a 6-month period without significant toxicity.
		CONCLUSION: Disseminated histoplasmosis is very rarely seen in Europe but should
		be suspected in case of unexplained fever in immigrants from the endemic areas in
		"the world, particularly when hepatosplenomegaly and pancytopenia are present."
		"Bone marrow examination and culture, blood cultures, and antigen testing are the"
		mainstays of the diagnosis.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Ruxolitinib is a highly potent janus kinase inhibitor that places its
		users at risk for various bacterial infections and viral reactivation. However
		new reports are also emerging that suggest greater immunosuppression and risk for
		fungal disease. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 51 year-old veteran
		"from Guam, treated with ruxolitinib for polycythemia vera, who developed"
		disseminated histoplasmosis and concurrent cryptococcal meningitis. CONCLUSION:
		This case draws attention to the degree of immunosuppression that may be seen
		with this drug and the need for heightened vigilance for opportunistic infections
		in those treated with inhibitors of janus kinase/signal transducers and
		activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) such as ruxolitinib.

		pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis. On the basis of direct mycological
		"examination, culture, and serological testing, we made a diagnosis of concomitant"
		histoplasmosis and paracoccidioidomycosis. The patient presented arterial
		hypotension that was diagnostic of adrenocortical insufficiency. Although the
		"pulmonary fibrosis and pneumonia were irreversible, the clinical condition of the"
		patient improved after antifungal treatment. This was an exceptional case of two
		pulmonary fungal infections occurring simultaneously in the same patient.

AB	-	We report the first Congolese case of African histoplasmosis in a patient with
		AIDS which represents the third case to be described in the literature. This
		contrasts with the now frequent occurrence of Histoplasma capsulatum
		histoplasmosis in HIV-infected subjects in North America; the difference is
		likely to be due to differences in exposure to the fungus rather than to
		differences in behaviour of the fungus or in the epidemiology of HIV.

AB	-	The authors report a new case of African Histoplasmosis in a 60-year-old patient.
		It was an humeral localization revealing a pathological fracture which grew into
		an extension of osteolysis and a cutaneous fistulization likely to be a malignant
		bone tumor. The case has been diagnosed by surgical biopsy and histological
		analysis. Its antifungal treatment in progress resulted in the drainage of the
		out-flow that should permit the bone reconstruction by graft. The authors stress
		"on the need to focus on this affection whenever, in a tropical area, one is faced"
		with any chronic bone fistula that cannot positively be cured in spite of sound
		medical cares.

AB	-	We report a case of ileo-colonic Histoplasmosis without apparent respiratory
		involvement in a patient who had previously undergone an orthotopic liver
		transplant (OLT) for primary biliary cholangitis 15 years earlier. The recipient
		"lived in the United Kingdom, a non-endemic region for Histoplasmosis. However,"
		she had previously lived in rural southern Africa prior to her OLT. The patient
		"presented with iron deficiency anaemia, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and progressive"
		"weight loss. She reported no previous foreign travel, however, it later became"
		known that following her OLT she had been on holiday to rural southern Africa. On
		"investigation, a mild granulomatous colitis primarily affecting the right colon"
		"was identified, that initially improved with mesalazine. Her symptoms worsened"
		after 18 mo with progressive ulceration of her distal small bowel and right
		"colon. Mycobacterial, Yersinia, cytomegalovirus and human immunodeficiency virus"
		infections were excluded and the patient was treated with prednisolone for a
		working diagnosis of Crohn's disease. Despite some early symptom improvement
		"following steroids, there was subsequent deterioration with the patient"
		"developing gram-negative sepsis and multi-organ failure, leading to her death."
		Post-mortem examination revealed that her ileo-colonic inflammation was caused by
		Histoplasmosis.

AB	-	Disseminated histoplasmosis has a diverse and non-specific range of clinical
		"signs and symptoms. In a significant minority of patients, cutaneous lesions are"
		"apparent at the time of initial presentation, affording an opportunity to"
		establish the diagnosis from a skin biopsy. The most frequently reported clinical
		scenario in immunocompromised patients with cutaneous involvement is that of
		"multiple papulo-nodular lesions on the face, trunk or extremities. The following"
		report features an immunocompetent patient who presented with a solitary
		ulcerated plaque on the buttocks close to the anal verge. This case presentation
		underscores the broad spectrum of clinical presentations as well as the potential
		for diagnostic confusion with protozoa such as Leishmania or Trypanosoma species
		during histopathologic examination if special stains for fungal organisms are not
		performed.

TI	-	Disseminated histoplasmosis with orofacial involvement in HIV-I-infected patients
		with AIDS: manifestations and treatment.
PG	-	184-7
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Histoplasmosis is a deep mycosis which is increasingly seen in HIV
		"disease. It has emerged as a relatively common infection in Argentina, mainly in"
		"HIV-infected and other immunocompromised persons, and is often disseminated (DH)."
		OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe 32 HIV-I-seropositive patients
		"with AIDS who had DH, 21 of whom presented orofacial manifestations, and their"
		treatment. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study of 876 HIV-seropositive
		patients revealed 32 with a clinical diagnosis of DH confirmed by special stains
		"on histopathologic specimens, or by culture. RESULTS: Thirty-two HIV-infected"
		"patients had DH. Two-thirds (21 patients) had oral lesions of histoplasmosis, of"
		which six presented with oral cavity (OC) lesions as the sole orofacial
		"manifestation of disease, nine patients presented oral and facial (OF) lesions"
		and six presented facial lesions only. A unique case of submandibular
		histoplasmosis is also reported. Antifungal therapy cleared more than 90% of the
		orofacial and disseminated lesions of histoplasmosis. Over the 7-year period
		there was a mortality of 85%. CONCLUSION: DH should be considered as a possible
		diagnosis in HIV patients with chronic ulcerative or nodular orofacial or oral
		lesions. Itraconazole is an effective and acceptable therapy.

PG	-	"452, 454-5"
AB	-	"Histoplasmosis is an opportunistic infection. In HIV-seropositive subjects,"
		histoplasmosis tends to have a progressive and disseminated course. Oral lesions
		occur frequently and multiple sites within the mouth can be affected. Diagnosis
		of histoplasmosis is made by microscopic identification and culture of the fungus
		in material taken from the affected site. We present a case of oral
		histoplasmosis in which the mouth was the primary site of the fungal disease and
		this was the initial indicator of HIV infection. There were lesions of the
		gingivae and there was destruction of the hard palate with extension into the
		right maxillary sinus and the right nasal cavity.

		presentation.
PG	-	841-4
AB	-	"Among bone lesions of African histoplasmosis, those affecting the jaw are"
		"relatively rare and concern, with other facial involvements, particularly infants"
		and adolescent patients with an usual uncompromised immunologic status. As
		"clinical and radiologic features are not specific, the differential diagnosis to"
		other mandibular diseases is difficult. We report on a case of African
		histoplasmosis that involved the right mandibula of a 17-year-old Congolese boy
		with a persistent and fungiform cutaneous ulceration. As mycologic tests had not
		"been carried out initially, the disease was histologically diagnosed on the basis"
		of the presence of numerous intra-cytoplasmic large yeasts in a granulomatous
		lesion containing giant cells. As it is impossible to confront the histologic
		"diagnosis with mycologic tests in such a situation, the problems of the"
		differential diagnosis to other deep fungus infections and to some yeast-like
		foreign body-granulomas encountered at the microscopical level underline the
		importance of culturing organisms from lesions to confirm the histologic
		diagnosis. It is worth considering this pathology at least for three reasons: it
		usually mimicks a malignant jaw tumor; it may constitute a migrant pathology; and
		prognosis is commonly favorable with amphotericin B treatment.

		available for choroidal neovascularization secondary to the presumed ocular
		"histoplasmosis syndrome. RESULTS: Each treatment modality is reviewed, with the"
		studies summarized and presented to support or refute the method of treatment.
		Two case reports are presented to demonstrate the treatment regimens. CONCLUSION:
		This is a comprehensive review of the treatment modalities available to address
		choroidal neovascularization secondary to the presumed ocular histoplasmosis
		syndrome. Investigators will continue to strive toward higher efficacy and safety
		with future innovations in the field.

PG	-	1655-60
AB	-	Demographic and clinical parameters among patients with acquired immunodeficiency
		syndrome and histoplasmosis in Brazil and United States were compared. The
		Brazilian isolates were typed by restriction-fragment length polymorphism
		analysis and were DNA fingerprinted by random amplification of polymorphic DNA
		(RAPD)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Skin lesions occurred in 66% of Brazilian
		"case patients, compared with 1%-7% of US case patients. Of 21 treated case"
		"patients, 4 (19%) died, a rate similar to that of the US case patients (5%-13%)."
		"By nuclear gene typing, the Brazilian isolates were equally divided between South"
		"American classes 5 and 6, and RAPD-PCR showed 18 distinct genetic fingerprints in"
		20 isolates. Skin lesions are more common in infection with class 5 or 6
		organisms than with class 2 Histoplasma capsulatum. The role of genetic
		differences in the organism as a cause for the clinical differences requires
		investigation.

PG	-	514-24

AB	-	Histoplasmosis is a rare disease caused by inhalation of the fungus Histoplasma
		capsulatum. It can spread via cerebral circulation to the central nervous system
		as a manifestation of a disseminated infection; particularly in patients with
		"immune suppression, which can result in isolated ring-enhancing lesions and"
		inflammation in the brain. Of the reported disseminated histoplasmosis cases
		"(approximately 1 in 2000 per year), only 5-20% have evidence of central nervous"
		system involvement. This paper reviews a single case study of a 57-year-old
		female diagnosed with disseminated CNS histoplasmosis. Patient's complaints
		"included reduced short-term memory, word-finding problems, and difficulty"
		"organizing, making decisions, getting lost while driving, recalling names,"
		"retaining information while reading, and slowed processing speed. There was also"
		a history of mild depression and anxiety. Direct testing revealed deficits in
		"multiple cognitive domains including complex attention, processing speed,"
		"semantic fluency, visual scanning, motor speed, set-shifting, naming, nonverbal"
		"memory, and verbal memory. Neuropsychological deficits suggest cortical and"
		"subcortical brain dysfunction, including anterior, temporal, and mesial-temporal"
		regions. This case illustrates the need for neuropsychologists to understand
		"histoplasmosis, the related pathophysiology, and the neuropsychological impact;"
		particularly with the potential for delayed progression.

TI	-	Disseminated histoplasmosis in a juvenile lupus erythematosus patient.
PG	-	276-9
AB	-	"INTRODUCTION: Histoplasmosis is an infection caused by dimorphic fungus,"
		"Histoplasma capsulatum, and it has not been reported in juvenile systemic lupus"
		"erythematosus (JSLE) patients, particularly progressive disseminated"
		histoplasmosis (PDH) subtype. CASE REPORT: We reported herein a 14-year old girl
		"who was diagnosed with JSLE. Six months later, she had abdominal distension and"
		"received prednisone, hydroxychloroquine and azathioprine. Computer tomography"
		"evidenced hepatosplenomegaly and multiple mesenteric, mediastinal and"
		"retroperitoneal enlarged lymph nodes, forming large conglomerates at the"
		"mesentery, suggestive of lymphoproliferative disorder. After 10 days, she had"
		"acute surgical abdominal, and underwent a laparotomy and intestinal perforation"
		and conglomerates of lymph nodes were observed. The jejunum biopsy showed
		"perforated acute enteritis with hemorrhage and necrosis, and Grocott staining"
		identified Histoplasma sp. and the culture showed a heavy growth of Histoplasma
		capsulatum. At that moment liposomal amphotericin B (1.0 mg/Kg/day) was
		introduced. Despite this treatment she died due to septic shock eight days later.
		Diffuse Histoplasma capsulatum was evidenced at autopsy. CONCLUSION: We reported
		a severe opportunistic infection in JSLE patient with adenopathy and multiple
		intestinal perforations. This study reinforces the importance of early diagnosis
		"and antifungal therapy, especially in patients with these uncommon clinical"
		manifestations.

TI	-	Discrete cutaneous lesions in a critically ill patient treated only for AIDS and
		miliary tuberculosis: a case report of disseminated histoplasmosis.
LID	-	13030/qt9v5109zz [pii]
AB	-	Histoplasmosis is a systemic mycosis caused by the dimorphic fungus Histoplasma
		"capsulatum, with disseminated histoplasmosis (HD) being one of its clinical"
		"forms. As a consequence of the HIV-AIDS pandemic, HD has become prevalent not"
		only in regions that are recognized as endemic but also in areas not considered
		"endemic, such as Europe and Asia. Its clinical manifestations are varied and"
		"mimic several infectious diseases, mainly tuberculosis. In endemic areas, it is"
		the first manifestation of AIDS in 50 to 70% of patients. The diagnosis of
		histoplasmosis is difficult and HD can lead to death if not diagnosed early and
		if proper treatment is not instituted. The present report presents a patient with
		"a recent diagnosis of HIV-AIDS, in treatment for miliary tuberculosis, who was"
		diagnosed with disseminated histoplasmosis because of his dermatological
		manifestations.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: Histoplasmosis is a fungal infection caused by the dimorphic fungi
		"Histoplasma capsulatum. Its incidence in Spain has increased in recent years,"
		mainly due to the increased presence of immigrants from Latin America and
		increased travel to the continent for tourism and cooperation. Our aim was to
		review the clinical characteristics of cases of histoplasmosis diagnosed in our
		hospital during the last six years. CASE REPORTS: We diagnosed 4 cases from 4
		"patients from South America, 3 of whom were HIV positive and 1 diagnosed with"
		dermatomyositis was treated with immunosuppressive drugs. The laboratory
		"diagnosis was carried out by histological and microbiological study, by culture"
		and specific PCR directly on the sample. DISCUSSION: As it is an imported
		infection there needs to be a high level of suspicion and a detailed history
		taken to get a diagnosis. This infection requires a differential diagnosis
		"between febrile syndrome in immunosuppressed patients, both HIV positive and"
		"immunosuppressive therapy, which originate from endemic areas, or who have a"
		history of staying in them.

		"vertebral tuberculosis. The complications of the treatment with amphotericin B,"
		"such as, vomiting and severe hypokalemia, led to several interruptions in the"

AB	-	Laryngeal histoplasmosis is a fungal infection that is frequent in Colombia.
		Laryngeal histoplasmosis usually occurs in immunocompromised patients through the
		dissemination of the fungus from the lungs to other organs. Histoplasmosis
		isolated laryngeal (primary) is rare. If a patient presents with a history of
		"immunosuppression by renal transplant, primary laryngeal histoplasmosis with"
		supraglottic granulomatous inflammation that was treated with amphotericin B and

		ulcer.
PG	-	45-6
AB	-	Disseminated histoplasmosis is an AIDS-defining illness which usually involves
		"the liver and gastrointestinal tract, most commonly the small bowel. Abdominal"
		"pain, diarrhea, GI bleeding, hepatosplenomegaly and small bowel obstruction are"
		well described presentations. Still gastrointestinal histoplasmosis often results
		in either vague symptomatology or no symptoms. Pancreaticobiliary disease related
		to disseminated histoplasmosis is not well characterized. We report the case of a
		young female with advanced HIV infection and biliary obstruction and a
		periampullary duodenal ulcer due to disseminated histoplasmosis.

PG	-	441-7
AB	-	A widespread maculo-papular cutaneous rash appeared on a HIV-positive young
		bisexual Cambodian man. He was treated for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and
		Pneumocystis carinii infections. He had been residing in France for seven years.
		"Histology showed, within the dermis, abundant extracellular and intramacrophagic"
		yeast-like organisms suggestive of histoplasmosis. Cultured specimens produced a
		growth of colonies after three weeks on Sabouraud 4 p. 100 dextrose agar at 25
		degrees C. Numerous macroconidia were found which made the species diagnosis of
		Histoplasma capsulatum possible. Despite initiation of therapy with amphotericin
		B the patient died. Cutaneous involvement with or without specific features is
		uncommon in disseminated histoplasmosis. The specific cutaneous lesions are
		protean. They rarely are the presenting sign of initial infection. Disseminated
		histoplasmosis has a poor prognosis in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome:
		amphotericin B is not curative. Maintenance suppressive therapy with ketoconazole
		"has been recommended following amphotericin B completion, although break-through"
		has been reported.

LID	-	D4813 [pii]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Histoplasma capsulatum is an endemic fungus in especially tropical
		"areas. While mostly asymptomatic, histoplasmosis can be life-threatening in"
		immunocompromised patients. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 60-year-old woman of Suriname
		"origin, with a history of renal transplantation and use of mycophenolate mofetil"
		"and prednisone, presented with abdominal pain and diarrhea. Colonoscopy revealed"
		ulcerative ileocolitis and biopsy showed active granulomatous inflammation.
		Morbus Crohn was considered the most plausible diagnosis after ruling out several
		"infectious and pharmacological causes. Despite prednisone treatment, symptoms"
		persisted and infliximab was initiated. The patient developed constitutional
		symptoms and radiological examination revealed disseminated granulomatous
		disease. Liver biopsy and re-evaluation of previous intestinal histopathology
		confirmed suspected histoplasmosis. CONCLUSION: Histoplasmosis should be
		considered in immunocompromised patients with ileocolitis who have been in
		endemic regions (South America). Physicians need to assess the risk of previous
		exposure to histoplasmosis before starting anti-TNF-α therapy.

		"transplant recipient in Argentina. The patient exhibited respiratory symptoms,"
		and a chest computed tomography scan (CT) showed multiple bilateral centrilobular
		opacities with a tree-in-bud pattern in both lobes. The patient was initially
		"treated as having bacterial community-acquired pneumonia, and then tuberculosis."
		"A month later, histoplasmosis was diagnosed, and Histoplasma capsulatum LAmB"
		"clade was isolated from sputum, skin and oral lesions. The patient was"
		hospitalized and treatment was started with intravenous liposomal amphotericin B.
		"During the course of the antifungal therapy the respiratory symptoms worsened, a"
		new chest CT showed a unilateral lesion with a ground glass appearance and
		"SARS-CoV-2 was detected in a new nasopharyngeal sample. In addition, plasma"
		"therapy was administered, and the immunosuppressive regimen was adjusted"
		"(everolimus was interrupted, mycophenolate mofetil reduced, and meprednisone"
		"increased). Finally, the patient's progress was favorable and was discharged"
		after five days on oral itraconazole treatment for histoplasmosis.

		healthy adult with hepatitis C (HCV) presenting with neurological symptoms
		refractory to antifungal therapy and ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunting 4 months
		after initial diagnosis. Persistent symptoms were thought to be inflammatory
		rather than infectious given negative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum fungal
		antigens. The patient promptly improved after initiation of corticosteroid
		therapy. Elevated CSF cytokines and regional enhancement on brain MRI resolved
		with corticosteroid treatment. This is the first case of Histoplasma-associated
		post-infectious inflammatory response syndrome (Histo-PIIRS) documented by CSF
		cytokine reduction in response to corticosteroid therapy.

PG	-	105-10
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-015-9882-5 [doi]
AB	-	Human infection with Histoplasma capsulatum and Cryptococcus runs the gamut from
		asymptomatic illness to disseminated disease. Though both are the most prevalent
		"systemic mycoses in HIV-infected patients, simultaneous infection by both the"
		pathogens rarely occurs. We document the first case from Asian subcontinent with
		concurrent infection with disseminated cryptococcosis and histoplasmosis
		infections in a HIV-infected Indian patient diagnosed by morphological
		examination of fine-needle aspiration cytology samples obtained from the enlarged
		lymph nodes on light microscopy and were later confirmed by culture studies. A
		"prompt, accurate and timely diagnosis of the disseminated form of dual mycosis"
		(or either of the mycosis as well) is of utmost importance which has obvious
		impact on early initiation of treatment. Fine-needle aspiration cytology is a
		"rapid, cost-effective and reliable method to identify infection with Cryptococcus"
		and Histoplasma and is comparable with the essential culture studies.

PG	-	502-507
LID	-	10.1111/myc.12902 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Many patients with histoplasmosis are treated with anti-tubercular
		therapy (ATT) in tuberculosis endemic regions as diagnosis of histoplasmosis
		requires invasive sampling. We sought to study the utility of urinary Histoplasma
		antigen detection test. METHODS: Case records of patients with a diagnosis of
		histoplasmosis prior to (Period A) and after (Period B) introduction of urinary
		Histoplasma antigen detection test were analysed in this single centre
		"retrospective study. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients (18 in Period A, and 19"
		patients in Period B) were studied. There was nearly a threefold increase in
		diagnoses (from 0.39 cases to 1.18 cases per month) after the introduction of
		antigen test. Nine patients (24.3%) were immunocompromised (6 had HIV infection
		"and 3 were on steroids), and 28 (75.6%) were immunocompetent. Empirical ATT had"
		been given to 10 patients prior to histoplasmosis diagnosis. Invasive tissue
		sampling was required in only two patients in Period B to confirm the diagnosis.
		"Immunocompromised patients were younger, were more likely to have skin and"
		"mucosal findings, anaemia and leucopenia as compared to immune-competent"
		patients. CONCLUSION: This study emphasises that histoplasmosis cases may be
		missed and patients may receive ATT unnecessarily. Histoplasma antigen increased
		the diagnostic yield by almost threefold in our study.

TI	-	Imaging of pediatric mediastinal histoplasmosis.
PG	-	365-81
AB	-	Histoplasmosis can present a diagnostic dilemma if unusually large masses of
		"lymph nodes, invasive mediastinal fibrosis, or pericarditis result from the"
		"infection. These rare, late sequelae are often first suspected from findings on"
		chest radiographs obtained for unrelated reasons. Organisms are not always
		evident at histologic analysis at this stage. Mediastinal granulomas consist of
		"lobulated masses of enlarged lymph nodes with central caseation, a peripheral"
		"thin capsule, and, occasionally, calcification. The mass does not invade or"
		compromise adjacent anatomic structures. Mediastinal fibrosis invades and can
		"seriously compromise the function of the tracheobronchial tree, superior vena"
		"cava, pulmonary arteries and veins, and esophagus; its symptoms mimic those of"
		many other disorders. Pericarditis is commonly accompanied by pericardial
		"effusion, pneumonia, and adenopathy. Although the radiologic findings of these"
		"conditions are nonspecific, they can be used with the clinical findings to"
		suggest a diagnosis. Complications of histoplasmosis should be included in the
		differential diagnosis for patients residing in areas endemic to Histoplasma
		capsulatum.

PG	-	662-4
AB	-	Disseminated histoplasmosis in immunosuppressed patients rarely occurs in
		nonendemic areas. Reported here is a case of disseminated histoplasmosis in a
		patient who had undergone orthotopic liver transplantation and had never traveled
		outside of France. The infection was most likely transmitted via the liver
		"allograft, since the organ donor had lived in an area highly endemic for the"
		"disease (French Guiana) 20 years earlier. Two years post-transplantation, none of"
		"the other patients who received allografts (heart, cornea, kidneys) from the same"
		donor had developed signs of infection.

PG	-	397-400
AB	-	Histoplasma capsulatum is a dimorphic pathogenic fungus that produces a variety
		"of self-limiting disease syndromes in healthy persons, but commonly disseminates"
		in immunocompromised hosts. Although histoplasmosis has been recently described
		"in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, it is an uncommon finding,"
		occurring in fewer than 0.5 percent of patients with acquired immunodeficiency
		syndrome. We are reporting a second case of disseminated histoplasmosis
		presenting as keratotic papules with transepidermal elimination of Histoplasma
		capsulatum. Our case demonstrates the importance of including histoplasmosis in
		the differential diagnosis of keratotic papules occurring in patients with
		acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.

TI	-	Photodynamic therapy of subfoveal and juxtafoveal choroidal neovascularization in
		ocular histoplasmosis syndrome: a retrospective case series.
PG	-	863-70
AB	-	PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and effect on visual acuity of photodynamic
		therapy (PDT) with verteporfin in patients with subfoveal and juxtafoveal
		choroidal neovascular membranes from ocular histoplasmosis syndrome (OHS).
		METHODS: Retrospective case series. The visual outcome of 11 patients with
		subfoveal (n = 6) and juxtafoveal (n = 5) choroidal neovascularization treated
		"with PDT was reviewed. At 1 to 3 months of follow-up, retreatment with PDT was"
		"performed if angiography showed leakage. RESULTS: Within the subfoveal group, 3"
		patients (50%) had improved vision (two or more lines better than initial
		"vision), 2 patients (33.3%) had no change in vision (within 1 line), and 1"
		"(16.7%) lost four lines of vision. At last follow-up, 3 patients (50%) had vision"
		between 20/20 and 20/40 compared with only 1 patient (16.6%) at the initial
		"visit. Mean follow-up was 13.7 months. Within the juxtafoveal group, 3 patients"
		"(60%) had improved vision, 1 patient (20%) had no change in vision, and 1 patient"
		"(20%) lost nine lines of vision. At last follow-up, 3 of 5 patients (60%) had"
		vision between 20/20 and 20/40 compared with 2 patients (40%) at the initial
		visit. Mean follow-up was 10.2 months. No significant adverse effects were
		reported. CONCLUSION: PDT is a safe and promising option for patients with OHS
		with choroidal neovascularization that is subfoveal or juxtafoveal.

TI	-	Histoplasmosis of kidneys presenting as chronic recurrent renal disease.
PG	-	490-4
AB	-	Histoplasmosis is a well-known infectious disease that can sometimes run a
		mysterious and unexpected course. A case is reported that presented as a chronic
		"renal process, with right pyelocutaneous fistula and prolonged purulent discharge"
		as well as focal calcifications of the left kidney with recurrent stone
		"formation. Histopathologic examination of the right kidney, removed in 1975,"
		"showed noncaseating granulomas, but the precise diagnosis was not made until"
		"1983, when histopathologic re-examination followed partial resection of the left"
		"kidney, for recurrent stone formation. This article emphasizes the difficulty in"
		diagnosing a noncaseating granulomatous disease in general and histoplasmosis in
		"particular, especially when the urogenital tract is involved, with isolated local"
		manifestations. It underlines the progressive and damaging character of this
		"chronic disease, the variety of its manifestations, and attempts to increase"
		awareness of this potentially treatable disease.

		"histoplasmosis. Common underlying diseases included HIV infection, diabetes"
		mellitus and liver diseases. Fever was the most frequently reported clinical
		"feature in disseminated histoplasmosis, followed by splenomegaly and"
		hepatomegaly. Cases of histoplasmosis had a prominent geographical distribution
		in China. Histoplasmosis should be considered in the diagnosis of patients with
		relevant symptoms and a history of travel to or residence in these areas.

PG	-	406-409

AB	-	The most common cause of granulomatous lymphadenitis in countries like ours is
		"mycobactrium tuberculosis followed by atypical mycobacterial infection, fungal"
		"infections, parasitic infection, cat scratch disease, lymphogranuloma venereum"
		"(inguinal lymphadenopathy), and leprosy Here, we present three cases of"
		lymphadenopathy due to histoplasmosis in immunocompetent children. Two of them
		"presented with fever, lymphadenopathy, initially diagnosed as granulomatous"
		lymphadenitis consistent with tuberculosis on FNAC and were put on antitubercular
		"drugs. However, their condition gradually became worse. As the patients continued"
		"to deteriorate, subsequent lymph node biopsies were done and diagnosed as"
		histoplasmosis. Third case presented with acute loss of vision with
		"hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy. Initially considered as acute leukemia,"
		but eventually established as histoplasmosis. Histoplasmosis should be considered
		as one of the possible causes of granulomatous lymphadenitis in children.

LID	-	10.1136/bcr-2013-202906 [doi]
LID	-	bcr2013202906
AB	-	We report a case of a young woman with advanced HIV/AIDS who presented with a
		"short duration of fever and shortness of breath, with no recent travel history or"
		"previous hospitalisation, accompanied by non-specific abdominal symptoms and"
		suspicious upper gastrointestinal bleed. Her CD4 count was 1 cell/μL raising the
		suspicious for various opportunistic aetiologies. The initial suspicion was for
		pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) and the patient was treated empirically with
		"antimicrobials. Peripheral smear findings, urinary antigen tests and"
		bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were suggestive of disseminated histoplasmosis. PCP
		was ruled out in BAL. Transabdominal imaging was concerning for periaortic
		lymphadenopathy raising the suspicion of occult malignancy. Endoscopic evaluation
		of her digestive tract was unrevealing. Endoscopic ultrasound fine-needle
		aspiration (EUS-FNA) confirmed histoplasmosis. She received a liposomal
		amphotericin B for 10 days followed by itraconazole with significant improvement.
		Her CD4 count was found to be the lowest reported count with a single
		opportunistic pathogen.

TI	-	Disseminated histoplasmosis as a first clinical manifestation in a patient with
		small lymphocytic lymphoma: A case report.
PG	-	298-302
LID	-	10.7705/biomedica.v38i3.3739 [doi]
AB	-	The small lymphocytic lymphoma is a mature B cell neoplasm with a broad spectrum
		of clinical presentations. Opportunistic infections that are not related to the
		"treatment, even in advanced stages, have a low incidence rate. There are few case"
		reports in the medical literature of patients who have not received
		immunosuppressive therapy and present with small lymphocytic lymphoma associated
		with disseminated histoplasmosis at diagnosis. A female 82-year-old patient was
		"admitted due to an intermittent dry cough, asthenia, and adynamia that had"
		persisted for one month. Multiple studies to detect infections and
		"immuno-rheumatic conditions were performed and an extensive cervical, thoracic"
		and peritoneal adenopathic syndrome was diagnosed. A flow cytometry and a
		"cervical lymph node biopsy were performed reporting CD19+, CD20dim, CD5+, CD45+,"
		"CD23+, CD43neg, and CD10neg phenotypes with restriction in the light kappa chain"
		compatible with a small lymphocytic lymphoma. Epithelioid granulomas without
		necrosis were observed in the lymph node histopathology and special colorations
		showed no microorganisms. The culture from the lymph node was positive for
		Histoplasma capsulatum. We initiated treatment with amphotericin B and
		itraconazole with an adequate response. In the absence of compliance with
		"oncology treatment criteria, the patient was managed on a “watch and wait” basis."
		Opportunistic infections could be the initial clinical manifestation in patients
		with low-grade lymphoproliferative syndromes. This case report shows that they
		can develop even in the absence of chemotherapy.

		case report.
PG	-	1014-6
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To report a unique presentation of disseminated histoplasmosis. STUDY
		"DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: University hospital, tertiary referral center."
		"PATIENT: Our patient presented with vertigo, tinnitus, and unilateral hearing"
		"loss, and was initially found to have a 5-mm enhancing left internal auditory"
		"canal mass, as revealed by a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Subsequently,"
		the patient developed multiple focal neurologic deficits. INTERVENTIONS: Magnetic
		"resonance imaging and treatment with intravenously administered amphotericin B,"
		with subsequent oral administration of itraconazole. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
		Clinical presentation and imaging findings of Histoplasmosis involving the
		cranial nerve VIII. RESULTS: A subsequent MRI scan revealed enlargement of the
		initial lesion and multiple parenchymal lesions. Further workup revealed a
		pulmonary lesion; the diagnosis of disseminated histoplasmosis was made on the
		"basis of bronchoalveolar lavage culture. CONCLUSION: Infectious processes,"
		"including disseminated histoplasmosis, should be considered in the differential"
		"of internal auditory canal masses, especially in the setting of rapid progression"
		of symptoms.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Acute pulmonary histoplasmosis (APH) is rare in an immunocompetent
		patient. We report a case of APH diagnosed by culture of broncho-alveolar lavage
		(BAL) in a patient presenting a pseudo-tumoral form with nodules progressing to
		cavitation. OBSERVATION: A 41 year-old male smoker was hospitalized with a
		"persistent fever, dry cough and dyspnoea on exertion. The first CT scan showed a"
		reticulo-nodular interstitial infiltrate with lymphadenopathy that progressed
		rapidly to multiple pulmonary nodules with central cavitation. Bronchial
		"endoscopy, with BAL culture, provided the diagnosis of Histoplasma capsulatum,"
		variety capsulatum. The infection may have occurred during work in a hangar in
		Guadeloupe that was scattered with bats' guano. After two months of treatment by
		"itraconazole, the patient's condition improved clinically and radiologically with"
		reduction of the nodules and their cavitation. CONCLUSION: This case presents an
		"immunocompetent patient with pulmonary histoplasmosis and multiple,"
		"radiologically atypical, nodules. The diagnosis was established by BAL culture."

		challenging spectrum.
PG	-	399-403
LID	-	10.1016/j.athoracsur.2009.04.041 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Histoplasmosis may result in a spectrum of complications that require
		thoracic surgical intervention. We reviewed our 17-year experience in the
		management of histoplasmosis to determine outcomes as well as gain insight into
		the distribution of complications requiring surgical intervention. METHODS: The
		hospital records of patients who underwent surgical treatment for complications
		related to histoplasmosis from 1991 to 2008 were reviewed. Based on the
		"predominant presentation, patients were categorized with complications secondary"
		"to broncholithiasis, granulomatous disease, or fibrosing mediastinitis. Patients"
		who underwent diagnostic surgery and were found to have histoplasmosis were
		excluded. RESULTS: Of the 49 patients who underwent surgery for
		"histoplasmosis-related complications, 27 (55%) had granulomatous disease, 13"
		"(27%) had broncholithiasis, and 9 (18%) had fibrosing mediastinitis. The most"
		common clinical presentations were recurrent pneumonia (n = 16) and hemoptysis (n
		= 13); less common presentations included dysphagia (n = 3) and superior vena
		cava syndrome (n = 1). Two patients required cardiopulmonary bypass for
		resection; 1 of these died postoperatively (series mortality 2%). Seven patients
		(14%) had complications. Relief of symptoms was achieved in all surviving
		patients. CONCLUSIONS: Complications of histoplasmosis requiring thoracic
		surgical intervention are diverse with pulmonary complications predominating.
		"Although surgically challenging, excellent short- and long-term outcomes may be"
		expected.

		encephalopathy and third nerve palsy. On imaging it appeared as a hemorrhage or
		calcification. Cerebrospinal fluid studies were consistent with a chronic
		meningeal process uncomplicated by hemorrhage. Stereotactic biopsy of the choroid
		plexus was required to establish the diagnosis of cerebral histoplasmosis.
		"Pathologic examination also revealed prominent abnormal calcification, which"
		permitted the lesion of masquerade as a hemorrhage on computed tomographic and
		magnetic resonance images.

PG	-	737-42
AB	-	A 58-year-old man was admitted with complaints of pain in the right upper right
		side of the chest. Chest radiography and computed tomography (CT) revealed a
		cavitary lesion in the right upper lobe. A CT-guided percutaneous lung biopsy and
		transbronchial lung biopsy of this lesion did not yield a definitive diagnosis;
		"therefore, we performed video assisted thoracic surgery (VATS). We also"
		investigated various types of mycosis because he had several records of overseas
		"travel. At a later day, the histoplasma immunodiffusion test showed positive"
		results. We finally diagnosed pulmonary histoplasmosis based on the clinical
		"course, CT and radiographic images and serological tests. Voriconazole improved"
		the patient's subjective symptoms and laboratory findings. A positive reaction
		was obtained for anti-human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) antibody and
		"the HTLV-1 carrier, confirming his immunodeficiency disorder. We raised the"
		possibility that the development of pulmonary histoplasmosis might be associated
		with the HTLV-1 carrier.

AB	-	A 33-year-old Brazilian man presented with a painful ulcer on the glabella
		region. The patient was HIV-positive. Diagnosis of histoplasmosis was established
		"by histopathological examination. In Latin America, disseminated histoplasmosis"
		"frequently involves the skin of HIV-positive patients. When affecting the skin,"
		the disease has a wide range of clinical presentations. Our case highlights the
		importance of including this disease in the differential diagnosis of cutaneous
		ulcers in HIV patients from areas endemic for histoplasmosis.

AB	-	"Cases of empyema associated with Histoplasma infection are rarely reported. Here,"
		we discuss a case of Histoplasma-associated empyema successfully treated with
		amphotericin B intravenous and pleural infusion therapy and multiple medical
		thoracoscopies. A 57-year-old Chinese woman with preexisting diabetes mellitus
		and gastric cancer had massive left-sided pleural effusion diagnosed by chest
		computed tomography. Her pleural effusion was purulent through pleural catheter
		"drainage, and the culture of the pleural fluid showed Escherichia coli and"
		Streptococcus constellation. Histopathology of the thoracoscopic pleural biopsy
		after hexamine silver and PAS staining supported Histoplasma infection. The
		patient was treated with intravenous injection and local thoracic irrigation of
		amphotericin B and continuous oral administration of itraconazole. At the same
		"time, the patient received thoracic cannulation, daily thoracic lavage and"
		thoracoscopy for purulent and necrotic tissue removal three times during
		hospitalization. The patient's pleural effusion and necrotic tissue in the
		"pleural cavity were significantly reduced in a short time, and the clinical"
		"symptoms were significantly improved. After discharge, the patient recovered well"
		and had no obvious complications or sequelae. Intravenous injection and local
		thoracic irrigation of amphotericin B are safe and effective drug therapies to
		treat fungal-associated empyema such as Histoplasma. Medical thoracoscopy
		"effectively shortens the recovery time of empyema, improving the prognosis and"
		reducing complications.

TI	-	[An autopsy case with cerebral histoplasmoma: case report].
PG	-	795-800
AB	-	"Histoplasma capsulatum infection is, for the most part, asymptomatic or of little"
		clinical consequence. Disseminated infection due to H. capsulatum is rather
		"uncommon. Clinically apparent infection of central nervous system (CNS) is rare,"
		and involves in 10 to 50% of patients with disseminated histoplasmosis. Although
		"CNS histoplasmosis is frequently fetal or only discovered as an autopsy, some"
		patients can be effectively treated with anti-fungal agents. We describe a
		44-year-old civil man who is engineering contractor with headache without
		evidence of systemic infection. Magnetic resonance imaging showed enhancing
		"masses in the third and forth ventricles, right interpeduncular cistern, and"
		right cerebello-pontine angle. After biopsy of what was presumed to be a
		"malignant lymphoma, the patient died of rapidly progressive multiple cerebral"
		infarctions. The autopsy revealed the CNS histoplasmoma disseminating
		systemically. And we finally diagnosed him as histoplasmoma by gene analysis. It
		was extremely difficult to make a diagnosis based on his physical and
		radiological findings because it should be included in the differential diagnosis
		of a well or ring enhanced lesion. It is very important to ask patients about
		"their birthplace, past illness, occupation, and where they had traveled. In the"
		"present case, the patient working for the construction has visited many countries"
		including the African Continent and Central America. Clinicians should maintain a
		high index of suspicion in patients who are from any area endemic for
		"histoplasmosis. The clinical, radiological and pathological features of this"
		infection were reviewed in this report.

TI	-	Choroidal neovascularization with granulomatous inflammation in ocular
		histoplasmosis syndrome.
PG	-	247-50
AB	-	PURPOSE: To report pathologic examination of an excised choroidal neovascular
		membrane in a patient with ocular histoplasmosis syndrome that demonstrated
		granulomatous inflammation. METHOD: Case report. A 50-year-old woman with sudden
		vision loss in her left eye demonstrated clinical and fluorescein angiographic
		findings characteristic of choroidal neovascularization secondary to ocular
		histoplasmosis syndrome. RESULTS: Histopathologic examination of the surgically
		excised choroidal neovascular membrane disclosed granulomatous inflammation.
		CONCLUSIONS: This case suggests an important role of mononuclear phagocytic cells
		as primary mediators of angiogenesis or modifiers of choroidal
		neovascularization. This association of choroidal neovascularization with
		granulomatous inflammation did not respond to treatment with systemic
		corticosteroids.

PG	-	540-2
AB	-	Systemic histoplasmosis has various clinical presentations and is of especially
		concern in immunocompromised patients. A high index of suspicion is required for
		its diagnosis. A total of 38 cases had been reported from India up to 1996. The
		most frequent occurrence of cases was around Calcutta in eastern India where the
		"previous case was detected 20 years earlier. However, we have diagnosed 5 cases"
		in the past 2 years from eastern India which are reported here. These cases may
		indicate under-diagnosis and under-reporting of histoplasmosis in India. All 5
		patients had disseminated disease with multisystem involvement including 2 with
		bilateral adrenal enlargement. Two were diabetic and only 1 patient was infected
		with HIV.

AB	-	"OBJECTIVE: HIV-related mortality is still high, especially in developed"
		countries. The aim of this study is to investigate factors associated to death in
		HIV-infected patients. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study with all HIV
		"adult patients admitted to a tertiary infectious diseases hospital in Fortaleza,"
		"Northeast Brazil, from January 2013 to December 2014. Patients were divided into"
		"two groups: survivors and non-survivors. Demo-graphical, clinical and laboratory"
		data were compared and a logistic regression was performed in order to
		investigate risk factors for death. P values ≤0.05 were considered statistically
		significant. RESULTS: A total of 200 patients with mean age of 39 years were
		"including in the study, 69.5% males. Fifteen patients (7.5%) died. Non-survivors"
		"presented a higher percentage of males (93.3 vs. 67.3%, p = 0.037). Non-survivors"
		"presented AKI (73.3 vs. 10.3%, p < 0.001), liver dysfunction (33.3 vs. 11.5, p ="
		"0.031), dyspnea (73.3 vs. 33.0%, p = 0.002) and disorientation (33.3 vs. 12.4%, p"
		= 0.025) more frequently. Non-survivors also had higher levels of urea (73.8 ±
		"52.7vs. 36.1 ± 29.1 mg/dL, p < 0.001), creatinine (1.98 ± 1.65 vs. 1.05 ± 1.07"
		"mg/dL, p < 0.001), aspartate aminotransferase (130.8 vs. 84.8 U/L, p = 0.03),"
		"alanine aminotransferase (115.6 vs. 85.4 U/L, p = 0.045) and lactate"
		"dehydrogenase (LDH) (1208 vs. 608 U/L, p = 0.012), as well as lower levels of"
		"bicarbonate (18.0 ± 4.7 vs. 21.6 ± 4.6 mEq/L, p = 0.016) and PCO2 (27.8 ± 7.7 vs."
		"33.0 ± 9.3 mmHg, p = 0.05). In multivariate analysis, disorientation (p = 0.035,"
		"OR = 5.523, 95%CI = 1.130 - 26.998), dyspnoea (p = 0.046, OR = 4.064, 95%CI ="
		"1.028 - 16.073), AKI (p < 0.001, OR = 18.045, 95%CI = 4.308 - 75.596) and"
		"disseminated histoplasmosis (p = 0.016, OR = 12.696, 95%CI = 1.618 - 99.646) and"
		"LDH > 1000 U/L (p = 0.038, OR = 4.854, 95%CI = 1.093 - 21.739) were risk factors"
		for death.]CONCLUSION: AKI and disseminated histoplasmosis (DH) were the main
		risk factors for death in the studied population. Neurologic and respiratory
		impairment as well as higher levels of LDH also increased mortality in
		HIV-infected patients.

PG	-	142-4
AB	-	Disseminated histoplasmosis is an opportunistic infection which is commonly
		associated with HIV. Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) has been described
		"as a secondary phenomenon to infection, collagen-vascular disorders and"
		"malignancies. In patients with HIV, cases of reactive haemophagocytic syndrome"
		associated with disseminated histoplasmosis have been reported with CD4 counts of
		less than 50 cells/µl (450-1660 cells/µl). We report a case of a 25 year old man
		with HIV who presented with a CD4 count of 153 cells/µl and would suggest that
		this diagnosis should be considered at higher CD4 counts than previously
		reported.

		isolation of Histoplasma capsulatum in Sabouraud's-agar slants. Treatment with
		Amphoterecin B led to complete remission of the lesion.

PG	-	213-9
LID	-	10.2460/javma.238.2.213 [doi]
AB	-	CASE DESCRIPTIONS: A 4-year-old spayed female Golden Retriever (dog 1) was
		examined because of acute edema and erythema in the left hind limb and an
		"inguinal mass, and a 5-year-old female Jack Russell Terrier (dog 2) was examined"
		because of a recurring retro-peritoneal mass. CLINICAL FINDINGS: Dog 1 had an
		"edematous, hyperemic left hind limb with a fixed inguinal mass. Monocytic"
		neutrophilic leukocytosis and hypoalbuminemia were detected. Diagnostic imaging
		revealed abnormal tissue surrounding the larger vessels and ureters and complete
		occlusion of the left limb veins. Surgery resulted in incomplete removal of the
		mass. Histologic examination revealed fibrosing pyogranulomatous inflammation.
		"Results of a Histoplasma antigen test were positive, and reanalysis of the"
		tissues revealed yeast cells indicative of Histoplasma capsulatum. Dog 2 had
		incomplete removal of a retroperitoneal mass. Histologic examination revealed
		fibrosing pyogranulomatous inflammation. The mass recurred 8 months later in dog
		2; exploratory abdominal surgery at that time resulted in substantial hemorrhage
		from the adhered caudal aorta. Histologic examination of tissue sections from the
		second surgery revealed yeast cells consistent with Blastomyces dermatitidis.
		TREATMENT AND OUTCOME: Both dogs had temporary improvement after surgery. Full
		clinical resolution required treatment for fungal disease. Dog 1 was treated with
		"itraconazole, then fluconazole (total treatment time, 23 weeks). Dog 2 was"
		treated with fluconazole for 36 weeks. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Retroperitoneal
		pyogranulomatous fibrosis caused by fungal infections has not been reported in
		"veterinary medicine. There was substantial morbidity, but the prognosis can be"
		good when this abnormality is recognized and antifungal medications are
		administered.

TI	-	Disseminated histoplasmosis in systemic lupus erythematosus: case report and
		review of the literature.
PG	-	193-9
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To report a patient who developed both central nervous system
		systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and disseminated histoplasmosis and to review
		the literature regarding histoplasma infection in patients with SLE. METHODS:
		MEDLINE review of the medical literature published in English. RESULTS:
		Disseminated histoplasmosis occurs rarely in patients with SLE. The main risk
		"factor is treatment with corticosteroids at doses of 20 mg/d or greater. Fever,"
		"dyspnea, pleurisy, and weight loss are typical presenting symptoms. The most"
		"commonly involved tissues are lung, liver, and bone marrow. In our patient, both"
		SLE flare and disseminated histoplasmosis were present simultaneously.
		CONCLUSIONS: Opportunistic infection is an important complication of SLE and may
		"be difficult to diagnose. Symptoms of infection may mimic those of a lupus flare,"
		"or conversely, symptoms may be masked by the use of corticosteroids. Fever,"
		"unexplained tissue involvement, atypical clinical patterns, and poor response to"
		immunosuppressive therapy should alert the clinician to aggressively pursue
		evaluation of possible infection in patients with SLE.

PG	-	533-6
AB	-	Disseminated histoplasmosis is a fungal infection caused by Histoplasma
		capsulatum. It often involves immunodeficient patients and can occur in two
		"forms, i.e., the large- and small-celled variants. The purpose of this report is"
		to describe a case of disseminated histoplasmosis with cutaneous and digestive
		involvement observed four years after kidney transplantation in a man from
		Senegal. The patient developed severe sepsis secondary to colonic perforation.
		Outcome was fatal due to delayed diagnosis and extent of disease.

TI	-	The feared five fungal infections in kidney transplant recipients: A
		single-center 20-year experience.
PG	-	e13289
LID	-	10.1111/ctr.13289 [doi]
AB	-	Invasive fungal infections are a feared complication in kidney transplant
		recipients (KTRs). Here we present the University of Wisconsin experience with 5
		"invasive fungal infections-aspergillosis, cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis,"
		"blastomycosis, and coccidioidomycosis-in KTRs transplanted between 01/01/1994 and"
		"06/30/2014. During this period, there were 128 cases of fungal infections;"
		"aspergillosis was the most common (72), followed by cryptococcosis (29),"
		"histoplasmosis (14), blastomycosis (10), and coccidioidomycosis (3). The mean"
		interval from transplant to fungal infection was 3.19 ± 3.58 years (range
		"5 days-15.8 years). By 6 months postinfection, there were 53 (41%) graft failures"
		"and 24 (19%) deaths. Graft failure occurred in 46%, 38%, 21%, 40%, and 67% of"
		"patients with aspergillosis, cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, and"
		"coccidioidomycosis, respectively. Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) induction (HR,"
		"1.49; 95% CI, 1.03-2.16; P = .04), diabetes (HR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.05-2.21;"
		"P = .03), and age (HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.27-1.70; P ≤ .001) were associated with an"
		increased risk for infection in univariate analysis. Multivariate adjustment
		retained ATG induction and older age. A large proportion of kidney transplant
		recipients with invasive fungal infections suffer graft failure within 3 years.
		"Preventive, therapeutic, and monitoring strategies are needed to improve graft"
		and patient outcomes.

		cutting balloon angioplasty and endovascular stenting.
PG	-	170-3
LID	-	10.1177/1538574410393034 [doi]
AB	-	Cutting balloon angioplasty is a common treatment modality in the pediatric
		population for pulmonary artery stenosis. We present an adult with histoplasmosis
		induced fibrosing mediastinitis resulting in pulmonary artery stenosis that was
		successfully treated with cutting balloon angioplasty and subsequent stent
		deployment. Percutaneous endovascular stent placement has be shown to effectively
		"alleviate pulmonary artery stenosis, however in-stent restenosis does limit"
		durability. Pharmacologic therapy is indicated with either mediastinal adenitis
		or mediastinal granuloma with anti-fungal agents such as amphotericin B and
		itraconazole. Surgical intervention for histoplasmosis induced fibrosing
		mediastinitis is rarely indicated and may result in fatal complications that stem
		from mediastinal fibrosis due to resultant destruction of surgical planes. To our
		"knowledge, this is the first reported case of utilizing cutting balloon"
		angioplasty and stent insertion for the treatment of histoplasmosis induced
		fibrosing mediastinitis complicated by pulmonary artery stenosis.

		analyzed the clinical data of 8 patients with biopsy-confirmed histoplasmosis
		from 2004 to 2014 in the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University and

		lobectomy of lung lesions or wedge resection. Clinical and imaging manifestations
		"in 3 patients, who treated with amphotericin B or its liposomal, itraconazole or"
		"fluconazole, were improved. The clinical symptoms and imaging findings of"
		histoplasmosis are nonspecific. It is easy for the physicians to misdiagnose
		"histoplasmosis as bacterial infection, lung cancer, tuberculosis lymphoma, etc."

AB	-	A 27-year-old HIV-positive male patient with disseminated cutaneous
		histoplasmosis was treated with both HAART and amphotericin B (total accumulated
		dose of 0.5 g). Amphotericin B was later replaced with itraconazole (200mg/day).
		"Two months after therapy had been started and the cutaneous lesions had healed,"
		the patient interrupted both treatments voluntarily and his health deteriorated.
		HAART was then re-introduced and CD4+ cell count increased sharply at the same
		time as lymph node histoplasmosis was diagnosed. This paradoxical response? the
		relapse of histoplasmosis and concomitant increase in CD4+ cell count and
		undetectable viral load after resumption of HAART ? suggests that this was a case
		of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS).

AB	-	PURPOSE: Histoplasmosis is a known complication of systemic immunosuppressive
		"therapy, particularly among patients who are receiving tumor necrosis factor α"
		inhibitors. There are limited data on the development of disseminated or
		pulmonary histoplasmosis among patients who are receiving systemic
		immunosuppressive medication for noninfectious ocular inflammation. DESIGN:
		Retrospective case series. METHODS: We reviewed all patients with uveitis or
		scleritis who subsequently developed pulmonary or disseminated histoplasmosis at
		"the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota between September 1, 1994 and July 1,"
		"2017, with a 3:1 age- and sex-matched control cohort who did not develop"
		histoplasmosis. This was a single institutional study examining patients that
		developed histoplasmosis after the initiation of systemic immunomodulatory
		therapy (IMT). Patients had to develop either disseminated or pulmonary
		histoplasmosis while receiving systemic immunosuppressive therapy and have an
		ophthalmic examination at Mayo Clinic Rochester. The control group was comprised
		of patients who received systemic IMT for ocular inflammation but did not develop
		histoplasmosis. RESULTS: Nine cases of histoplasmosis were identified: 2
		disseminated and 7 pulmonary. Both patients with disseminated histoplasmosis were
		taking tumor necrosis factor α inhibitors. Seven of the 9 patients received
		"systemic antifungal medication, including both disseminated cases. Over a median"
		"follow-up of 4.4 years, none of the patients died, and there were no recurrences"
		"of histoplasmosis. When compared to the control cohort, there was no correlation"
		between length of time on IMT and the risk of histoplasmosis. CONCLUSIONS: Ocular
		inflammation patients on systemic immunomodulatory therapy may develop pulmonary
		or disseminated histoplasmosis. Most cases require treatment with systemic
		"antifungal medication, but it might not be necessary to stop systemic"
		immunomodulatory medication for ocular inflammation. Ophthalmologists should be
		aware that patients receiving systemic immunomodulatory therapy have a higher
		risk of developing Histoplasma infections. Prompt diagnosis and treatment using
		the expertise of an infectious diseases specialist may ensure low mortality for
		these patients.

		"occurs as an opportunistic disease, with dissemination to various organs."
		"Cutaneous involvement is observed in 38% to 85% of cases, with oral mucosal"
		involvement in 30% to 60% of cases. This article describes the case study of a
		32-year-old woman who presented an extensive tongue ulcer due to histoplasmosis
		and had the HIV infection diagnosis based on laboratory tests requested by the
		dentist.

AB	-	Histoplasmosis is a deep mycosis which occurs in America and Africa. It is
		extremely rare in France. The case presented involves a male subject who had
		spent time in the French colonies of Africa and in Brazil. He presented with
		"undiagnosed ulceration of the cheek, similar to that seen with cancer. Diagnosis"
		was made on histology on one hand and on mycological examination on the other.
		This case serves to remind us that tropical and sub-tropical pathology may be
		encountered in temperate zones due to population migration.

		histoplasmosis.
PG	-	287-90
AB	-	We present a case of hemophagocytosis in the setting of a disseminated
		Histoplasma infection in a patient with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia
		(CLL). A 68-year-old man with CLL presented with progressive pancytopenia and
		fevers after therapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine phosphate. Extensive
		evaluation for a source of infection revealed a pulmonary nodule. A biopsy
		specimen taken from the nodule showed granulomas containing Histoplasma
		organisms. A bone marrow biopsy specimen demonstrated disseminated histoplasmosis
		and intense hemophagocytosis. Antifungal therapy with amphotericin B was
		"initiated, and the fevers and cytopenias resolved. Hemophagocytic syndrome is an"
		uncommon condition with many origins. It is characterized by a proliferation of
		histiocytes with phagocytosis of formed elements of blood. Clinical
		manifestations include signs and symptoms of immune activation and decreased
		peripheral blood cell counts. This condition is often underdiagnosed because
		clinicians are unfamiliar with it.

LID	-	10.1684/mst.2014.0332 [doi]
AB	-	We report a case in which an HIV-infected man was cured of disseminated
		histoplasmosis (Histoplasma capsulatum var duboisii) after treatment by high-dose
		"fluconazole (1,600 mg taken four times daily) for 2 months, combined with active"
		antiretroviral therapy. The choice of fluconazole at this dosage was motivated by
		"its availability as a generic and thus inexpensive medication, the patient's"
		"precarious status, and his critical clinical condition. At the end of the second"
		"month of treatment, the patient chose to stop the fluconazole, which he could no"
		"longer afford, while continuing the antiretroviral treatment, which was free. The"
		clinical and laboratory improvement observed from the first week has continued to
		progress for more than 8 months after fluconazole treatment stopped. This single
		case needs - and deserves - to be confirmed in a series of patients. Nonetheless
		it makes it possible to envision fluconazole as a low-cost and efficacious
		antifungal agent for the treatment of disseminated histoplasmosis in AIDS
		patients in sub-Saharan Africa.

PG	-	483-91
AB	-	"Histoplasmosis is the most common endemic mycosis in individuals with AIDS,"
		occurring in 2%-5% of this population. Infection is more likely to be
		disseminated than in immunocompetent individuals and generally presents
		insidiously with nonspecific symptoms. The gastrointestinal tract is involved in
		"70%-90% of cases of disseminated histoplasmosis, yet gastrointestinal"
		histoplasmosis per se is infrequently encountered in patients with AIDS. The
		"diagnosis of gastrointestinal histoplasmosis is often not suspected, particularly"
		"in areas of nonendemicity, and a delay in diagnosis may lead to increased"
		morbidity and risk of death. Since antifungal therapy improves outcome for >80%
		"of AIDS patients with histoplasmosis, it is essential that caregivers be aware of"
		the varied presentations of gastrointestinal histoplasmosis in order to diagnose
		and to treat this potentially life-threatening infection effectively.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Histoplasmosis is an infection caused by the dimorphic fungus
		Histoplasma capsulatum and primarily presents with pulmonary symptoms.
		Immunocompromised individuals are at high risk for contracting disseminated
		"histoplasmosis, which can be fatal if left untreated. CASE: We present a case"
		involving a 50-year-old woman with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome with an
		ulcerated vulvar lesion concerning for carcinoma. Extensive workup revealed
		disseminated histoplasmosis without pulmonary manifestations. She was treated
		with an extended course of an antifungal agent. Her vulvar lesion resolved.
		CONCLUSION: Vulvar histoplasmosis is a rare etiology of vulvar pathology but one
		that should be considered in immunocompromised patients.

		epithelioid cell granulomatosis: A case report and review of the literature.
PG	-	91-100
LID	-	10.1111/ejh.12886 [doi]
AB	-	Histoplasmosis in central Europe is a rare fungal disease with diverse clinical
		presentations. Apart from acute pulmonary histoplasmosis and involvement of the
		"central nervous system, the most serious clinical presentation is progressive"
		disseminated histoplasmosis which is generally associated with severe
		"immunodeficiency and, in particular, advanced human immunodeficiency virus"
		"infection. Here, we report on an immunocompetent female residing in a non-endemic"
		"area, presenting with progressive disseminated histoplasmosis after a remote"
		travel history to Thailand and Costa Rica. Diagnosis was delayed by several
		months due to misinterpretation of epithelioid cell granulomatosis of the
		intestine as Crohn's disease and of similar lung lesions as acute sarcoidosis.
		Prompted by clinical deterioration with signs and symptoms consistent with
		"hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, a bone marrow aspiration was performed that"
		documented hemophagocytosis and intracellular organisms interpreted as Leishmania
		"sp., but later identified by molecular methods as Histoplasma capsulatum."
		Treatment with liposomal amphotericin B followed by posaconazole led to prompt
		clinical improvement and ultimately cure.

TI	-	Broncholith caused by donor-acquired histoplasmosis in a lung transplant
		recipient.
PG	-	407-10
AB	-	A broncholith is a calcified lymph node that erodes into and partially or
		completely obstructs the bronchial lumen. The natural history of broncholiths is
		poorly understood. They are frequently encountered in residents of areas that are
		endemic for Histoplasma capsulatum and Mycobacterium tuberculum. We report the
		first case of a broncholith in which the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum was
		transferred from a donor to a lung transplant (LTx) recipient. Our report
		highlights the time course of broncholith development and its successful
		management. We suspect that broncholithiasis and transmission of Histoplasma
		capsulatum from a donor to the recipient are under-reported in the LTx
		literature. We hypothesize that histoplasmosis can be transmitted from the donor
		to the recipient and the duration in the formation of calcification of the lymph
		node or the broncholith can be anywhere from 2 to 10 months.

PG	-	47-50
AB	-	Our medical staff identified a case of a forty-six years old Armed Force active
		duty female that presented with multiple systemic and pulmonary signs and
		"symptoms, such as hemoptysis, arthralgias, chest pain and dyspnea after being"
		exposed to a humid and old wooden building one year ago in the state of Georgia.
		"Various imaging studies (cervical & thoracic x-rays and CT Scans), revealed"
		"diffuse small nodules at cervical & thoracic areas, osteolytic lesions and"
		"lymphadenopathy. Suspecting a malignant process, a PET-CT Scan was performed"
		"revealing a right lung lower lobe nodule consistent with a primary malignancy,"
		"metastatic disease, active infectious or inflammatory process. She underwent a"
		CT-guided needle biopsy followed by an open thoracotomy. These results were
		negative for malignancy and positive for chronic granulomatous inflammatory
		"process. Therefore, special immunologic stains were undertaken revealing a"
		granulomatous process with Histoplasmosis capsulatum. This case was diagnosed in
		"the most unusual manner, given the presenting symptoms and pathological findings"
		"which suggested a malignant process, later confirmed by multiple specialized"
		imaging studies and tests. This presumptive diagnosis turned out to be an
		inflammatory/infectious (fungal) process. We must keep in mind that not all mass
		lesions encountered by special imaging studies should be considered malignant.
		This case exemplifies the need of clinicians to exercise strong clinical and
		critical thinking skills to consider the broad diagnostic possibilities of
		pulmonary nodules presenting as a malignancy.

PG	-	270-2
LID	-	10.1111/j.1439-0507.2009.01796.x [doi]
AB	-	Immune reconstitution syndrome (IRS) is an increasingly common condition that has
		been described in immunosuppressed individuals once immune function is restored.
		"In this case, we describe a patient who had a renal transplant and subsequently"
		developed pulmonary histoplasmosis. His course was also complicated by the
		development of a clinical syndrome that was originally attributed to
		thrombocytopenic thrombotic purpura (TTP). When he did not improve with
		"plasmapheresis and high dose prednisone, a bone marrow biopsy revealed"
		disseminated histoplasmosis and administration of prednisone was rapidly tapered.
		"While on 5 mg of prednisone, he developed an inflammatory syndrome characterised"
		"by haemoptysis and respiratory distress, full work-up with pathology was"
		consistent with immune reconstitution syndrome. Treatment for IRS consists of
		continuing treatment for the underlying infection and consideration of
		administering anti-inflammatory medication for supportive care. This syndrome
		should be considered in patients who develop worsening inflammatory symptoms
		while receiving appropriate treatment for their fungal infection in the setting
		of restoration of immune function.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Histoplasma capsulatum is an environmental fungus that causes
		opportunistic infections in AIDS patients in endemic areas but is uncommon in
		Europe. It shares clinical features with other opportunistic infections and
		lymphoproliferative disorders common in AIDS patients. The World Health
		Organization included Histoplasma antigen tests on the Lists of Essential In
		"Vitro Diagnostics, however, they are not routinely available in non-endemic"
		"countries. Consequently, mycoses can be a great challenge for clinicians in"
		non-endemic countries. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 42-year-old
		"Colombian woman admitted to an Italian university hospital with diarrhea, acute"
		"renal failure, psychomotor impairment and fever. When a screening HIV test came"
		"back positive, she was screened for opportunistic infections with no results."
		Given the severity of her clinical condition a broad spectrum antibacterial and
		antifungal therapy was started in addition to HAART. A blood smear documented
		"leucocytes inclusions, identified as capsular structures. On suspicion of"
		Histoplasma capsulatum the patient was started on empiric amphotericin B. The
		"diagnosis was confirmed by positive serology. Despite therapy, the patient died"
		"shortly after. In the following days, the mycology laboratory managed to grow"
		"Histoplasma capsulatum, thus confirming the diagnosis of invasive histoplasmosis"
		in AIDS. CONCLUSION: The case highlights the need for a high index of suspicion
		"for the diagnosis of endemic mycosis outside of endemic areas, and the necessity"
		"of expanding access to tests. Even if antigen/ antibody tests are not available,"
		"however, blood smear has worldwide feasibility and allows a rapid diagnosis."

AB	-	Histoplasmosis is a systemic mycosis caused by the thermally dimorphic fungus
		"Histoplasma capsulatum, which can be isolated from soil contaminated with"
		droppings from birds or bats. Chronic cavitary pulmonary histoplasmosis is one of
		the rarest clinical presentations of this disease. The differential diagnosis
		with tuberculosis should be made in patients presenting with cavitated lesions in
		upper lung segments. We report the case of a female patient with chronic cavitary
		pulmonary histoplasmosis who had presented with progressive dyspnea and worsening
		of the radiological pattern over a four-year period.

AB	-	"Severe cases of itraconazole-induced hepatotoxicity have been reported; however,"
		these events are thought to occur very rarely. The available literature is
		comprised largely of individual case reports and small series that do not report
		the itraconazole serum concentration at the time of the severe adverse event or
		apply an objective scale to assess probability of the event being related to drug
		exposure. We report a case of severe hepatotoxicity after 6 months of
		"itraconazole therapy for histoplasmosis, resulting in acute hepatic failure"
		"(aspartate transaminase >20× and alanine transaminase >15× upper limit normal),"
		in the setting of therapeutic serum concentrations (5 mg/mL). Both the Naranjo
		probability scale and the Roussel Uclaf causality assessment method were used to
		"assess the probability of a causality relationship showing a ""probable"" and"
		"""highly probable"" association with itraconazole exposure, respectively. The"
		available literature describing severe hepatotoxicity resulting in hepatic
		failure associated with itraconazole is also reviewed.

AB	-	The spectrum of cytomorphologic changes of pulmonary granulomas diagnosed by fine
		"needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy is reported, with a review of the pertinent"
		literature concerning the cytologic diagnosis of granulomatous disease. In our
		"cases, organisms were not seen in the Papanicolaou-stained smears. Recognition of"
		"the granulomatous cellular pattern, however, resulted in a thorough search for"
		"organisms by special stains, and an etiologic diagnosis was made in each case."
		These cases emphasize the need for routine staining and culture of FNA material
		when an initial diagnosis of malignancy is not made. One of the cases appears to
		be the first report of a nontuberculous Mycobacterium infection diagnosed by fine
		needle aspiration biopsy.

PG	-	255-8
LID	-	10.1111/crj.12185 [doi]
AB	-	Histoplasma capsulatum can rarely affect the trachea. We report the case of a
		68-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis on immunosuppressive therapy who
		"presented with fevers, worsening shortness of breath, nonproductive cough and"
		subjective throat hoarseness and fullness. Chest computed tomography demonstrated
		"no tracheal findings. Bronchoscopy found mucosal irregularity, nodularity and"
		vesicular regions in the proximal trachea extending seven centimeters distal to
		"the vocal cords. Also seen was an edematous, exudative left vocal cord with"
		polyps and an ulcerative lesion. Silver staining and culture and wash of the
		tracheal biopsy revealed Histoplasma capsulatum. She was treated with oral
		itraconazole then briefly on intravenous amphotericin for rising Histoplasma
		urinary antigen levels. She continued treatment 24 months following diagnosis
		with minimal dyspnea. Histoplasma tracheitis has been proposed as an indicator of
		"disseminated infection. However, our patient did not demonstrate other organ"
		manifestations. Histoplasma tracheitis should be considered in a differential
		diagnosis of tracheal lesions even in the absence of systemic involvement.

AB	-	Objective: To investigate the clinical and imaging characteristics of acute
		histoplasmosis. Methods: The clinical and imaging data of 10 patients with acute
		histoplasmosis were studied. Their clinical and imaging characteristics were
		analyzed. All the patients returned from a South American republic in April 2019
		and were treated at the Chongqing public health medical treatment center.
		"Results: All the 10 patients were male, aged 30-56 years old, with an average age"
		"of 43.8 years old. Four of them were engaged in soil clearing, 2 in gas cutting,"
		"2 in moving tools, and 2 in inspection. The disease in all the 10 patients was"
		"caused by inhaling a large amount of bacteria-bearing dust in a short time, with"
		"an incubation period of 9-13 days, and the main clinical manifestations were"
		"fever, insomnia, dizziness, headache, cough, poor appetite, rash and diarrhea."
		One patient's head CT showed extensive thickening and increased density of
		"bilateral frontotemporal, parietal and occipital meninges, while the other 9"
		patients showed no obvious abnormalities. Chest CT findings were as follows: (1)
		Multiple nodular shadow: the chest CT findings of 4 patients were miliary nodular
		shadow with diffuse distribution in both lungs. Most of the nodules were less
		than 5 mm in diameter and distributed evenly or unevenly. CT findings of 6 cases
		"showed scattered nodular shadows in both lungs, with diameters ranging from 2 to"
		"15 mm, and obvious distribution in subpleural and inferior lobes of both lungs."
		"(2) Consolidation shadow: in 2 cases, the size of the shadow was uneven and the"
		"density increased, mainly distributed in the subpleura and the lower lobe of both"
		"lungs. (3) Ground glass density shadow: mainly distributed around nodules, halo"
		signs can be seen around some nodules. (4) Mediastinum and/or hilar lymph nodes
		were enlarged. (5) Pleural effusion: a small amount of pleural effusion was found
		in 4 cases. (6) Pericardial effusion in 3 cases. Abdominal CT showed splenomegaly
		in 8 cases and hepatomegaly in 1 case. Conclusions: Acute histoplasmosis has no
		"specificity in clinical manifestations. However, there are still some features in"
		"CT manifestations, including multiple nodules in both lungs accompanied by halo,"
		"enlarged liver, spleen and mediastinal lymph nodes, and multiple serous cavity"
		effusions.

PG	-	327-32
LID	-	10.1016/j.ophtha.2011.08.032 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: To assess the long-term outcomes of intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) in
		the treatment of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary to presumed ocular
		"histoplasmosis syndrome (POHS). DESIGN: Retrospective, comparative case series."
		PARTICIPANTS: Interventional series of 150 eyes in 140 patients treated for
		subfoveal or juxtafoveal CNV secondary to POHS from January 2006 to January 2010.
		INTERVENTION: Intravitreal bevacizumab monotherapy or combination IVB and
		verteporfin photodynamic therapy (IVB/PDT). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual acuity
		(VA) at 12 and 24 months was analyzed. Secondary outcome measures included the
		number of injections per year and treatment-free intervals. RESULTS: A total of
		"117 eyes received IVB monotherapy, and 34 eyes underwent combination IVB/PDT"
		"treatment. For all patients, the average pretreatment logarithm of minimum angle"
		of resolution (logMAR) was 0.63 (Snellen equivalent 20/86) with a 12-month logMAR
		VA of 0.45 (Snellen equivalent 20/56) and a 24-month logMAR VA of 0.44 (Snellen
		equivalent 20/55). The mean follow-up was 21.1 months with an average of 4.24 IVB
		"injections per year. There was no significant difference in initial VA, VA at 12"
		"months, VA at 24 months, or number of eyes with a 3-line gain between the IVB"
		monotherapy and IVB/PDT groups. Thirty-eight percent (39/104) of eyes gained 3
		"lines or more, and 81.2% (84/104) of subjects had maintained or improved their"
		starting VA at 1 year. The proportion of subjects maintaining a 3-line gain in VA
		"was relatively preserved at 2 years (29.8%, 17/57) and 3 years (30.3%, 10/32)"
		follow-up. There was no increase in the proportion of subjects losing 3 lines or
		more over 3 years of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: There is no significant difference
		in VA outcomes between IVB monotherapy versus IVB/PDT combination therapy. The
		use of IVB alone or in combination with PDT results in significant visual
		stabilization in the majority of patients with CNV secondary to POHS.

PG	-	274-7
AB	-	"A 41-year-old man presented with night sweats, fever, and substernal chest pain"
		approximately 5 months after being treated for community-acquired pneumonia.
		Chest radiograph revealed a mediastinal mass that was confirmed by computed
		"tomography (CT) of the thorax. During surgery, enlarged paratracheal lymph nodes"
		and a mass surrounding the right lower lobe bronchus and bronchus intermedius
		were found. Multiple biopsies from the mass showed that it consisted mainly of
		"acellular fibrous tissue, but a small number of fungal forms typical of"
		Histoplasma capsulatum were seen at the edged of the fibrotic reaction. The lymph
		"nodes contained granulomatous inflammation and areas of necrosis, but no"
		organisms were identified. The patient was treated with fluconazole for 6 weeks
		"with resolution of symptoms. After completion of therapy, a follow-up CT scan of"
		the thorax showed involution of the mediastinal mass. There has been no
		recurrence of symptoms or radiographic abnormalities for 24 months since
		cessation of fluconazole. This case illustrates isolated mediastinal involvement
		by histoplasmosis and suggests that therapy with fluconazole at this stage may
		prevent the often devastating late complications of mediastinal fibrosis.

AB	-	An adult male owl monkey (Aotus nancymai) had hypercalcemia associated with a
		disseminated case of histoplasmosis (Histoplasma capsulatum var. capsulatum).
		Histopathologic examination of tissues at necropsy showed moderate to marked
		numbers of small granulomas involving multiple organs. The granulomas contained
		"numerous round, basophilic, intracellular structures, 1-2 microns in diameter,"
		that stained positive in Periodic acid-Schiff and Gomori's methenamine silver
		tests. The hypercalcemia in this case was attributed to enhance conversion of
		"dietary vitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol by the granulomas."

LID	-	10.1111/jcpt.12609 [doi]
AB	-	WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Amphotericin is the preferred treatment for
		pulmonary histoplasmosis during pregnancy. The long half-life of amphotericin
		supports less than daily administration. CASE SUMMARY: A 28-year-old pregnant
		woman diagnosed with recurrent pulmonary histoplasmosis was initiated on
		"liposomal amphotericin 250 mg (4 mg/kg) intravenously daily. After 2 weeks, the"
		patient was discharged and successfully received 250 mg thrice weekly at a
		hospital-associated outpatient infusion centre. After 6 weeks of outpatient
		"treatment, a chest X-ray demonstrated no remaining disease and therapy was"
		discontinued. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Administration of thrice-weekly
		"liposomal amphotericin in a hospital-associated, outpatient infusion centre may"
		be a promising option for stepdown treatment in patients unable to take
		itraconazole.

PG	-	7-May
AB	-	Histoplasmosis is a deep mycosis whose capsulatum variety is recognized as being
		an AIDS-defining infection. However AIDS associated with Histoplasma capsulatum
		var. duboisii is rarely reported. We report a case of cutaneous duboisii
		histoplasmosis associated with AIDS which has been mistaken for molluscum
		contagiosum for many months. The diagnosis has been confirmed by means of a
		biopsy of a nodule followed by an anatomo-pathological examination. The medical
		treatment was successfully based on combination Triomune (stavudine + lamividine
		+ nevirapine) and itraconazole.

		"pushing, tenesmus, hematochezia, pain while defecating, lost of 18 kg of weight,"
		"fever, fecaloid and purulent discharge through an perianal hole. During the"
		"colonoscopy procedure, we found many ulcers in the ascending, transverse and"
		descending colon.We also found an elevated lesion of about 5 cm in the rectum. We
		used hematoxylin - eosin and Gomori-Grocott stain in the biopsies and identified
		many microorganisms inside macrophages which were compatible with histoplasmosis.
		"ELISA tests for HIV, HTLV I- II were negative. Colon and rectal histoplasmosis in"
		an immunocompetent patient is extremely rare. There are few cases of colonic
		histoplasmosis reported.

AB	-	Reports of ocular histoplasma mycosis demonstrated serologically and in tissue
		are rare in Europe. This is principally due to the fact that histoplasmosis is
		not endemic in Europe (in contrast to the USA). A second reason is that it is
		hard to find laboratories which have experience in the differential diagnosis of
		histoplasmosis and forms of uveitis. In cases of uveitis it would be desirable to
		include histoplasmosis in the differential diagnosis and to use more staining
		"methods (silver nitrate methenamine, fluorescein serology) and immunologic tests"
		"(intracutaneous test with histoplasmin, complement fixation test, countercurrent"
		immuno-electrophoresis) for histoplasmosis. Report on a case of ocular
		"histoplasmosis, positive in the skin test and in immunodiffusion, contracted 19"
		"years previously in Mississippi, USA."

AB	-	Disseminated histoplasmosis is a rare but serious complication of infection with
		the dimorphic fungus Histoplasma capsulatum. We report a case of disseminated
		histoplasmosis with cutaneous involvement diagnosed by touch wet preparation and
		"confirmed with histopathology and culture. ""Touch prep"" performed from a lesional"
		"punch biopsy, prepared with Wright-Giemsa followed by chlorazol black containing"
		"KOH, revealed abundant yeast organisms localized within multinucleated giant"
		"cells, and a rapid diagnosis of disseminated histoplasmosis with cutaneous"
		involvement was achieved. This report demonstrates the utility of wet prep
		techniques as an invaluable and rapid beside diagnostic tool in the setting of
		"cutaneous histoplasmosis. In addition, we compare the distinguishing"
		histopathologic features of the infectious organisms within the differential
		diagnosis of parasitized histiocytes.

LID	-	10.1007/s10067-019-04548-8 [doi]

		"pulmonary manifestations, ocular disease, kidney inflammation, or any other form"
		"of organ involvement. Hypocomplementemia, the presence of C1q antibody in the"
		"serum, and urticarial vasculitis are the keys to the diagnosis of HUVS. It has"
		"been reported to accompany certain infections such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C,"
		"infectious mononucleosis, and coxsackie group A. However, it has never been"
		reported to be linked to histoplasmosis in the literature. To the best of our
		"knowledge, we report the first case of HUVS presenting concurrently with"
		pulmonary histoplasmosis.

OAB	-	A 35-year-old man from Central America with a history of AIDS and numerous
		opportunistic infections presented with progressive neutropenia and
		thrombocytopenia despite having been stable for a period of 6 months. Cessation
		"of antiviral medications did not stop his neutropenia, nor did use of folinic"
		"acid, G-CSF, or erythropoietin. The failure of these measures required repeated"
		blood transfusions. Although the physical examination was relatively
		"unremarkable, hematology and blood chemistries indicated that the patient needed"
		urgent hospitalization due to fever and neutropenia. Neutropenia within HIV
		"infection can be confusing, since it may be a result of the infection itself, an"
		"adverse effect of drug therapy, or from an opportunistic infection or malignancy."
		"If the cause is not evident, it is wise to seek the etiology first rather than"
		"immediately use bone marrow stimulants, such as G-CSF. In this case, an"
		"infectious disease specialist made a diagnosis of disseminated histoplasmosis,"
		after which the patient was treated with amphotericin B and released on
		itraconazole maintenance therapy.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Fungal infections have been commonly diagnosed in individuals with
		"advanced HIV disease. Cryptococcosis, pneumocystosis, and histoplasmosis are the"
		most frequent systemic mycoses in people suffering from HIV/AIDS. CASE REPORT: We
		report a case of multiple fungal infections in an advanced AIDS-patient. A
		"33-year-old HIV-positive man from Brazil was hospitalized due to diarrhea,"
		"dyspnea, emaciation, hypoxemia, extensive oral thrush, and a CD4+ T lymphocyte"
		count of 20cells/mm(3). Honeycombed-structures consistent with Pneumocystis
		jirovecii were observed by direct immunofluorescence in induced sputum.
		Cryptococcus neoformans was recovered from respiratory secretion and
		cerebrospinal fluid cultures. Histopathology of the bone marrow also revealed the
		presence of Histoplasma capsulatum. Molecular assays were performed in a sputum
		sample. Nested-PCR confirmed the presence of P. jirovecii and H. capsulatum; qPCR
		multiplex was positive for C. neoformans and H. capsulatum. With the treatment of
		antifungal drugs the patient progressed satisfactorily. CONCLUSIONS: The
		diagnosis of several systemic mycoses demonstrates the vulnerability of advanced
		"AIDS-patients. Thus, the detection of AIDS cases in the early stages of infection"
		"is necessary for a prompt and adequate introduction of HAART therapy, and the use"
		of prophylaxis to control opportunistic infections.

PG	-	1017-9
LID	-	10.1002/ccd.23038 [doi]
AB	-	Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) was introduced in 2006 as an
		alternative for surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) as treatment for
		patients with aortic stenosis. Endocarditis after TAVI has been anecdotally
		"reported, but concerns aroused because SAVR is often needed to explant the"
		endocarditic valve in a high risk patient previously deemed not to be a surgical
		candidate. We report a case of a patient who underwent TAVI because he was too
		"high risk to undergo SAVR. Several months later, he developed an intermittent"
		self-limiting fever of unknown origin which eventually was diagnosed as
		"endocarditis. The valve was surgically removed, and pathology showed an infection"
		caused by Histoplasma capsulatum. The patient recovered fully and remains in good
		condition.

PG	-	1227-31
AB	-	Fungal infection is a major opportunistic infection in AIDS. Histoplasmosis is
		"often seen in American AIDS, but only one case has been reported in Japan. We"
		report a AIDS case of with histoplasmosis in Japan. The patient was a forty year
		old male living in the U.S from 1987 to 1990. He was diagnosed as candidial
		"esophagitis in July, 1994, and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) antibody"
		positive led to a diagnosis of AIDS. He was admitted to our hospital with fever
		"and lymphadenopathy (neck, abdomen) in August. The therapy for candidial"
		"esophagitis was successful and he was recovering, but he was newly diagnosed as"
		"atypical mycobacteriosis and Kaposi's sarcoma. Though the fever was slight, it"
		persisted. He was discharged from our hospital in October. He was readmitted for
		"a high fever and dehydration in December, but died after a week from disseminated"
		intravascular coagulation (DIC). Histoplasma capsulatum was found by blood and
		ascites cultures on second admission. Many yeast like histoplasma cells in
		granuloma of the liver were found at autopsy. For moderate or severe
		"histoplasmosis, amphotericin B is generally used as the first induction therapy."
		Fluconazole (FLCZ) is used as a maintenance therapy. We did not use amphotericin
		"B, but used FLCZ because we did not diagnose histoplasmosis before death, and his"
		general condition became worse. The effect of FLCZ therapy was unclear in our
		case because he had other infections. We expect that AIDS with histoplasimosis
		will increase in Japan through HIV infected patients infected in the U.S.A.

PG	-	1101-4
AB	-	The article deals with the case of an inflammatory pseudotumour of the lung in
		conjunction with histoplasmosis of the hilar lymph glands in a 35-year-old
		immunocompetent woman in a non-endemic area. She had been suffering from
		"headaches and painful swelling of the lower legs, reddening and hyperthermia for"
		1.5 years. In addition to the above-mentioned symptoms she also complained of a
		typical flush syndrome which had begun a year later. The main paraclinical
		finding was a round mass in the right lung in chest radiography. After
		"considering various differential diagnostic possibilities, thoracotomy and"
		resection of the upper lobe of the right lung were performed. The histological
		diagnosis of the material removed was that of an inflammatory pseudotumour of the
		"lung, combined with histoplasmosis of the hilar lymph glands. Following a"
		"postoperative period without complications, antimycotic treatment was performed."
		The discussion includes whether the simultaneous occurrence of these two diseases
		is coincidental or whether there is a causal relation between the two. The
		authors also discuss various treatments with reference to the relevant
		literature.

TI	-	Esophageal histoplasmosis in a renal allograft recipient.
PG	-	764-7
AB	-	Histoplasmosis is a progressive granulomatous disease caused by the intracellular
		dimorphic fungus Histoplasma capsulatum. We report a rare case of esophageal
		histoplasmosis in a renal allograft recipient. A 55-year-old male who received a
		"live, unrelated renal allograft 20 years ago presented with complaints of"
		"recurrent fever for ten to 12 months, weight loss over six months, progressive"
		dysphagia more for solids for five to six months and joint pain and swelling
		involving the bilateral metacarpo-phalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints.
		Biopsy from the esophageal ulcers revealed dense inflammation infiltrated with
		lymphocytes and macrophages with clusters of strongly positive intracellular
		"fungal spores with a clear area or ""halo-like"" zone suggestive of Histoplasma"
		capsulatum invasion. The patient was treated with intravenous liposomal
		amphotericin B for ten days and later switched over to oral itraconazole.
		Repeated endoscopy revealed significant improvement of the lesions.

PG	-	119-26
AB	-	Cutaneous infection by histoplasmosis in Cuban HIV patients was researched. In a
		"case series study, all HIV patients admitted to ""Pedro Kouri"" Institute from"
		"January 1st, 1992 to June 30th, 2003, who had been diagnosed with cutaneous"
		"histoplasmosis, were included. Of 44 patients with histoplasmosis, 52% (23 cases)"
		"developed the progressive disseminated form of histoplasmosis, which behaved as a"
		subacute weakening disease. Young adults represented 56.5% and 82.6% were males
		mainly Caucasian (91.3%). Most of cases came from the Western provinces.
		Histoplasmosis was a marker disease in 39.1% of cases. CD4+ T-lymphocyte counting
		under 200 cell/mm3 was present in 78.9% of patients. Histoplasmosis seems to
		behave as an important marker disease for AIDs in seropositive patients. Serology
		was not the diagnosing method of choice for this cutaneous disease in AIDS
		patients.

		Report.
LID	-	10.7812/TPP/19.121 [doi]
LID	-	19.121
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Drug-induced lupus (DIL) can comprise up to 10% of new lupus cases
		"annually, and the list of medications associated with DIL is increasing. However,"
		it can be difficult to recognize the connection between symptoms and a
		"medication-induced autoimmune syndrome, which can lead to an invasive, costly"
		workup. Given that the prognosis is usually good if therapy with the offending
		"agent is stopped, it is important to identify this clinical entity promptly. CASE"
		"PRESENTATION: A healthy, 44-year-old man with hypertension was seen initially"
		because of shoulder pain and again after development of fevers and chest pain. He
		"underwent a thorough infectious workup and then oncologic workup, with his"
		clinical course complicated by a Histoplasma infection. After evaluation by
		"subspecialists, the patient was thought to have an autoimmune condition related"
		to DIL. His symptoms improved after he discontinued the offending drug therapy
		and received a course of corticosteroids. DISCUSSION: Our case highlights how DIL
		should be on the differential when seemingly disparate symptoms develop in a
		"patient receiving DIL-associated medications. Lupus is one of the ""great"
		"imitators,"" in which symptoms can be ascribed to many different underlying"
		causes. Although this patient's presentation may have been confounded by
		"concomitant histoplasmosis, his improvement with cessation of hydralazine"
		treatment argues in favor of DIL. His continued atypical serologic test results
		"could be residual from his DIL and should normalize with time. However, it raises"
		the question whether this bout of DIL has unmasked a previously quiescent
		"autoimmune condition, requiring continued observation."

TI	-	Pulmonary histoplasmosis: unusual histopathologic findings.
PG	-	373-8
AB	-	Four patients with clinical diagnosis of interstitial lung disease (ILD) are
		"presented. In these patients, lung biopsies revealed bronchocentric"
		"granulomatosis (BG), pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP), diffuse alveolar"
		"damage (DAD), and in one biopsy, the clinical manifestations suggested"
		tuberculous primo-infection with systemic dissemination. Three patients died
		"without diagnosis. In all four cases, specific histological stains found"
		Histoplasma capsulatum. Histoplasmosis may mimic other infectious or
		"non-infectious pulmonary diseases, such as interstitial and granulomatous"
		"pulmonary disease. Therefore, the absolute need for identification of the"
		organism by culture or special stains cannot be over-emphasized and may lead to a
		proper mycological diagnosis. This highlights the importance of differential
		"diagnosis with systemic infectious diseases, especially in areas where"
		deep-seated mycosis are endemic.

PG	-	2188-95
AB	-	A 44-year-old man was admitted with symptoms compatible with Addison crisis.
		Abdominal computer tomography revealed extensive bilateral adrenal abscesses.
		Histoplasma capsulatum was cultured from a needle aspirate. The patient was
		HIV-seronegative and had no underlying malignancy. He may have acquired the
		"infection during several stays in endemic areas in the United States, South"
		"America and Asia. The case was also remarkable for moderate brain atrophy,"
		thrombosis of the portal and splenic veins and liver cirrhosis caused by
		alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (phenotype MZ). The patient recovered fully under
		substitution of adrenal hormones and antifungal treatment. He received
		"intravenous amphotericin B (75 mg q24h) for 10 days, followed subsequently by"
		oral treatment with itraconazole (400 mg q24h) over several months. Radiologic
		follow-up 9 and 18 months later showed a pronounced decrease of the inflammatory
		adrenal lesions.

TI	-	Chronic bronchitis with fungal infection presenting with marked elevation of
		serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9: a case report.
PG	-	6307-12
AB	-	Carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) is the most frequently applied serum tumor
		"marker for diagnosis of cancers in the digestive organs. However, some patients"
		with benign diseases can have elevated serum levels of CA19-9 as well. The
		current study presents a 55-year-old female who was admitted to our hospital for
		further evaluation of a nodular cavity shadow in the right lower lobe and
		clarification of the cause of the marked elevation of serum CA19-9 levels.
		Abdominal MRI and gastrointestinal endoscopy did not find any malignancy. As lung
		"cancer cannot be excluded in this patient, a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery"
		"was carried, intraoperative and postoperative biopsy analysis both suggested"
		chronic bronchitis with fungal infection (due to Histoplasma capsulatum or
		Penicillium marneffei) and organization. Immunohistochemistry showed marked
		positive staining for CA19-9 in the damaged lung tissue. The CA19-9 levels
		"quickly returned to the normal range following lobe resection. Therefore, the"
		"marked elevation of serum CA19-9 levels, in this case, may have resulted from the"
		chronic bronchitis with fungal infection.

		disease (9.3%). This represents the first population-based epidemiological

		"also presented skin lesions on trunk and face, without neck stiffness. The"
		diagnosis of duration infection was confirmed by culture from the skin biopsy and

		"Ro-SSA antibodies, poor concentration of the tracer in scintigraphy and"
		lymphocytic infiltration in salivary glands confirmed the diagnosis of Sjögren's
		syndrome. the patient was successfully treated with liposomal amphotericin and
		"itraconazole. We report this case to emphasize that opportunistic infections,"
		"such as disseminated histoplasmosis, may be an uncommon clinical presentation of"
		Sjögren's syndrome.

		(PET) findings mimicking primary lung malignancy which eventually required
		surgical resection. CONCLUSION: Histoplasmosis infection may radiologically
		"resemble pulmonary malignancy, often causing a diagnostic dilemma. PET imaging is"
		currently used for and considered accurate in the evaluation of pulmonary
		"nodules. However, overlap in PET standardized uptake value (SUV) between"
		granulomatous and malignant lesions decreases the accuracy of PET as a diagnostic
		modality. Future advances in PET imaging are needed to improve its accuracy in
		the evaluation of pulmonary nodules in areas where histoplasmosis is endemic.

AB	-	The location of bone histoplasmosis is rare. It is a parasitic infection caused
		"by Histoplasma capsulatum, affecting especially the immunocompromised. Diagnosis"
		"is difficult, requiring the use of mycological and histopathological studies."
		"Through this observation, we report a rare sequence of the development of sacrum"
		histoplasmosis in a patient treated 10 years ago for a malignant non-Hodgkin
		lymphoma of the sacrum with complete remission. The clinical and radiological
		investigations suggested a lymphomatous relapse but the pathological study showed
		histoplasmosis. Antifungal treatment was started with an encouraging evolution.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: The incidence of fungi like pathogens in hospitals varies by regions.
		OBJECTIVES: Our goal was not only to record the incidence and etiology of
		"fungaemia, but also the change during the 4 years analysed, to determine the time"
		"of detection in automated blood culture and by lysis-centrifugation, and finally"
		"to assess the gender, age and underlying disease of the patients with fungaemia."
		METHODS: An observational multicentre study of fungaemia was conducted in
		"hospitals in the Mycology Network of Buenos Aires. RESULTS: A total of 190,920"
		"blood cultures were processed: 182,050 automated blood culture and 8,870"
		"lysis-centrifugation. Fungi were recovered in 1,020 episodes. The overall"
		"incidence of fungaemia was 1.72/1,000 admissions; 683 episodes were due to"
		"Candida (68%), and 325 (32%) to other fungi: 214 Cryptococcus, 105 Histoplasma, 7"
		"Rhodotorula, 5 Trichosporon, 2 Pichia, 2 Acremonium, one Saccharomyces and one"
		"Fusarium. The incidence of candidaemia was 1.15/1,000 admissions with a wide"
		variation between centres (0.35 to 2.65). Most Candida isolates (97%) were
		detected in the first 2 days of incubation. Candida albicans was recovered in 43%
		"of the episodes. In fungaemia other than candidaemia, the predominant fungi were"
		Cryptococcus and Histoplasma capsulatum. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence remained
		stable during the study period. Fungaemia by Candida were predominant. C.
		albicans was involved in less than a half of the episodes. The recovery of
		Cryptoccocus and H. capsulatum is strongly associated with HIV patients.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Surgical removal of subfoveal choroidal neovascularization allows
		"visual improvement, especially in young patients. METHODS: Three eyes of 3"
		patients were prospectively studied. Subfoveal choroidal neovascularization was
		related to presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome. The surgical procedure
		"included vitrectomy, surgical excision of the neovascular membrane, and air"
		"tamponnade. RESULTS: Follow-up was 6, 12 and 20 months. Vision improved in 2"
		"eyes. In one case, recurrent extrafoveal neovascularization was treated with"
		laser photocoagulation. DISCUSSION: Surgery seems to be an alternative to
		photocoagulation in subfoveal choroidal neovascularization in presumed ocular
		histoplasmosis.

PG	-	173-177
LID	-	10.1007/s12328-019-01036-z [doi]
AB	-	Histoplasmosis is a common infection endemic to the Ohio and Mississippi River
		Valleys caused by the inhalation of Histoplasma capsulatum spores from
		"contaminated soil. Most infections are asymptomatic; however, patients with"
		"impaired cellular immunity (HIV infection, hematologic malignancy, solid organ"
		"transplant, hematopoietic stem cell transplant or TNF-⍺ inhibitor use) are at"
		risk for disseminated disease. Disseminated histoplasmosis commonly affects the
		"lungs, liver, spleen, bone marrow and gastrointestinal tract. Esophageal"
		involvement is rare and usually due to extrinsic compression from affected
		"mediastinal/hilar lymph nodes. Herein, we report a case of disseminated"
		"histoplasmosis in an AIDs patient involving the esophagus, without evidence of"
		mediastinal involvement.

TI	-	"Bone marrow aspiration, biopsy, and culture in the evaluation of HIV-infected"
		patients for invasive mycobacteria and histoplasma infections.
PG	-	100-6
AB	-	Bone marrow (BM) aspiration and biopsy are used commonly in clinical practice to
		diagnose invasive tissue infections caused by Mycobacterium avium intracellulare
		"(MAC), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), and Histoplasma capsulatum (HC) in"
		"patients with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV) infection. However, the value"
		of these invasive procedures relative to other diagnostic approaches has not been
		clearly defined. To determine the value of BM culture and BM histology in the
		diagnosis of opportunistic MAC/TB and HC infections in immunosuppressed patients
		"with HIV, we retrospectively reviewed the records of 56 adult patients with HIV"
		"who underwent a single BM aspiration, biopsy, and culture because of unexplained"
		fever and/or other clinical features suggestive of MAC/TB or HC infection.
		Thirty-two patients (57%) were ultimately diagnosed with MAC/TB or HC infection
		"by positive cultures of BM, blood, sputum, or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or by"
		the histologic detection of organisms in biopsies of BM or other tissues. The
		"diagnostic sensitivity of BM cultures was equal to that of blood cultures (20/32,"
		or 63%). Granuloma and/or histologically apparent organisms were seen in BM
		biopsy specimens in 11 of 32 individuals (34%) ultimately diagnosed with MAC/TB
		"or HC infections. Among these 11 cases, both granuloma and acid-fast staining"
		organisms were found in the BM biopsy specimens of 2 individuals for whom both BM
		and blood cultures were negative. Certain clinical symptoms and signs at the time
		of BM examination were found by logistic regression analysis to be significantly
		associated with a subsequent diagnosis of MAC/TB or HC infections; these included
		"high fever, long duration of febrile days prior to BM examination, and elevated"
		"direct bilirubin. In conclusion, while the diagnostic sensitivity of BM cultures"
		was found to be no greater than that of blood cultures in detecting MAC/TB or HC
		"infections in immunosuppressed HIV+ patients, histopathologic examination of BM"
		specimens resulted in the relatively rapid identification of nearly one third of
		"infected patients who underwent BM examination, and also identified infections in"
		some patients who were culture negative. These findings support the continued use
		"of BM aspiration, biopsy, and culture for the diagnosis of opportunistic MAC/TB"
		"or HC infections in immunosuppressed HIV+ patients, particularly when selected"
		clinical features are present.

		"The patient, HIV-seronegative and not otherwise immunocompromised, presented"
		voluminous cervical and axillary adenopathies as well as retrosternal and
		mesenteric tumor lesions. Direct examination of biopsy tissue showed numerous
		specimens of Histoplasma capsulatum var. duboisii. Because direct fungal
		techniques are the easiest and the most effective method of diagnostic

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate the successful use of pharmacogenomic testing to
		specifically tailor antifungal treatment to the phenotype of a patient with human
		immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and disseminated histoplasmosis who had clinical
		progression while on itraconazole and subsequently had insufficient therapeutic
		drug levels of voriconazole. CASE SUMMARY: We present the case of a patient with
		HIV and disseminated histoplasmosis with a persistently elevated serum
		Histoplasma capsulatum antigen and subtherapeutic levels of voriconazole.
		"Pharmacogenomic testing revealed he was a CYP2C19 rapid metabolizer, thus"
		"explaining his persistent, subtherapeutic levels of voriconazole and prompting a"
		change in therapy. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Our case illustrates the importance of
		pharmacogenomic testing as a tool to evaluate subtherapeutic itraconazole or
		"voriconazole levels, especially in patients with failed clinical or"
		Histoplasmosis Ag response despite reporting full adherence to prescribed
		therapy.

LID	-	52
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis syndrome (HLS) is an
		"immune-mediated life-threatening disease considered as a medical emergency, with"
		a potentially fatal multisystem inflammatory outcome. We present a patient that
		developed HLS and was able to be diagnosed efficiently with the help of an
		academic research institute of immunology. CASE PRESENTATION: A 21 years old male
		"Mexican with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), late presenter; who developed"
		"cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and a disseminated histoplasmosis-related HLS, as"
		part of an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). The patient
		"required a long course of corticotherapy, intravenous immunoglobulin and massive"
		"transfusions (more than 10 units in 24 h, and a total of 83 units), besides"
		amphotericin-B and ganciclovir treatment. An academic research institute of
		immunology aided in the accurate diagnosis of HLS with the implementation of
		"tests not available within the hospital, thus improving the care provided to the"
		"patient. The patient recovered, was discharged, and continue to improve."
		CONCLUSION: The objective of this report is to highlight the importance of having
		"multidisciplinary support, including basic medical sciences groups providing"
		"specific tests that are sometimes very difficult to get, which provides a benefit"
		to patients in the well-aimed diagnosis as part of applied translational
		medicine.

TI	-	Disseminated histoplasmosis and tuberculosis in a patient with HIV infection.
PG	-	531-4
AB	-	Histoplasmosis is a very rare disease in Korea. Clinical manifestations are very
		similar to those of tuberculosis. This is the first case report of combined
		disseminated histoplasmosis and tuberculosis in a patient with HIV infection in
		Korea. A 42-year-old Korean with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) was
		diagnosed with tuberculosis. He had lived in Guatemala for the past five years.
		"Upon diagnosis of disseminated tuberculosis with HIV infection, he was treated"
		"with anti-tuberculosis medications and anti-retroviral agents. Fever, weakness,"
		hepatosplenomegaly and pancytopenia were persistent despite treatment. The
		patient's history of living in Guatemala caused us to seek opportunistic
		infectious organisms other than tuberculosis. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy
		were performed and the result revealed numerous intracellular organisms
		"consistent with Histoplasma capsulatum; therefore, the diagnosis of disseminated"
		histoplasmosis was made.

PG	-	210-3
AB	-	A case of acute pulmonary histoplasmosis in a non-endemic setting is described. A
		"36 year-old male patient was admitted because of fever attacks, weakness and"
		dyspnea on exertion. The chest X-ray revealed bilateral patchy and nodular
		consolidations and bilateral enlargement of the hilar lymph nodes. On computed
		tomography of the abdomen the spleen was enlarged with a longitudinal diameter of
		12.7 cm. Respiratory insufficiency was demonstrated by an arterial oxygen tension
		(PaO2) of 7.71 kPa at rest. Pathological values of liver function tests were
		indicative of liver involvement. A transbronchial lung biopsy was performed.
		Histologic examination of the biopsy specimen revealed scattered small
		nonnecrotizing granulomas with epithelioid cells and multinucleated giant cells.
		Precipitating antibodies to Histoplasma capsulatum were detected by
		"immunodiffusion in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and blood, IgG antibodies to"
		Histoplasma capsulatum yeast antigens were revealed by enzyme immunoassay. The
		"histoplasmin skin test was negative. The pneumonitis, lymph node and spleen"
		enlargement and the pathological liver function tests resolved within one month
		without treatment. The PaO2 returned to normal within one week.

AB	-	A 35-year-old Chinese man who was known to have insulin-dependent diabetes
		"mellitus was admitted for fever and weight loss. During his hospital stay, he"
		"fell to his death from his ward at the twelfth floor. The clinical features,"
		radiological findings and gross organ changes at autopsy closely simulated
		"miliary tuberculosis. Histology, however, revealed extensive necrosis of the"
		"adrenal glands, lungs, spleen, kidneys and thyroid associated with the presence"
		of Histoplasma capsulatum organisms. This case highlights the similarity both
		clinically and pathologically between histoplasmosis and tuberculosis and
		emphasizes the need to be aware of this infection in a nonendemic area among
		patients with a compromised immune system.

AB	-	"Histoplasmosis is a fungal infection, having interesting synonyms such as Cave"
		"disease, Darling's disease, Ohio Valley disease, reticuloendotheliosis,"
		Spelunker's lung and Caver's disease. The aetiological agent is a dimorphic
		"fungus, Histoplasma capsulatum, causing chronic granulomatous disease. The route"
		of transmission is by inhalation of dust particles from soil contaminated by
		"excrement of birds or bats, harbouring the small spores or microconidia, which is"
		considered the infectious form of fungus. The spectrum of illness ranges from
		subclinical infection of the lung to progressive disseminated disease. The major
		bulk of histoplasmosis infections are asymptomatic or present with mild influenza
		"like illness and involve immunocompetent individuals. However, the"
		immunocompromised or immunodeficient cases have disseminated/haematogenous
		infections with multiple organs involved and are usually fatal unless treated
		immediately. Laryngeal involvement is associated with the disseminated form of

AB	-	"We present a case of disseminated histoplasmosis, complicated by retroperitoneal"
		"bleeding and leading to death, in a patient who was receiving systemic"
		immunosuppressive therapy for rheumatoid arthritis and who was enrolled in a
		gene-therapy trial. This trial was designed to evaluate intraarticular delivery
		"of a tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) antagonist, through an"
		"adeno-associated virus (AAV) type 2 delivery system, for inflammatory arthritis."
		The patient's receipt of concurrent anti-TNF-alpha therapy and other
		immunosuppressive therapy while she was living in an area where histoplasmosis
		was endemic was thought to be the most likely explanation for the infection; the
		evidence presented suggests that this fatal infection was unlikely to have been
		related to exposure to the agent administered in the gene-therapy trial. This
		"case reinforces the importance of considering infectious complications, such as"
		"those from endemic mycoses, in patients receiving treatment with a TNF-alpha"
		antagonist and the importance of having a well-designed monitoring plan when
		"subjects in a research study become ill. (ClinicalTrials.gov number,"

LID	-	10.4269/ajtmh.18-0478 [doi]
AB	-	We describe a Venezuelan visitor to Japan who was diagnosed with hemophagocytic
		lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). The patient was also diagnosed with human
		immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Epstein-Barr virus infection by the Western blot
		"and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, respectively. The cause of HLH was"
		"considered to be these two infections at first; however, the patient did not"
		"recover with antiretroviral/anti-herpes virus therapy. Thereafter, diagnosis of"
		"disseminated histoplasmosis was confirmed with an antigen detection test,"
		"culture, and PCR test of blood, urine, and bone marrow, and the patient improved"
		gradually after the initiation of liposomal amphotericin B. This case highlights
		the importance of ruling out endemic mycosis as a cause of HLH even if other
		probable causes exist in patients from endemic areas.

PG	-	769-71
AB	-	Histoplasmosis is not a frequently reported infection from India. Similarity of
		"its clinical and radiological features with pulmonary tuberculosis, may cause a"
		difficult diagnostic dilemma when the two occur together. We report a case who
		initially presented with cavitary lesions over right lung responding well to anti
		tuberculosis chemotherapy but subsequently a small opacity present over the left
		upper zone showed a relentless increase till it attained a massive size few years
		later. Operative removal and histopathological examination of the mass confirmed
		it to be histoplasmoma. She became sputum AFB smear positive and culture negative
		for a short while during this period and this is explained on the basis of
		previous reports.

		histoplasmosis.
PG	-	15
AB	-	Candida glabrata is the second most common Candida species detected among
		"hospitalized patients in USA. In tissue C. glabrata present as yeasts, 3-5"
		"microns in size, which are difficult to visualize on H&E stained slides but can"
		be detected on Grocott methenamine silver (GMS) stained slides. The presence of
		"yeasts only, without any hyphal elements, makes C. glabrata difficult to"
		distinguish from Histoplasma capsulatum yeasts that are of similar size. Mycology
		culture is the method of choice for definitive identification of C. glabrata.
		"Rapid identification is necessary, as mortality rate due to C. glabrata infection"
		in immunocompromised patients is particularly high. We herein report a patient
		"with inoperable gastric carcinoma, who developed cutaneous and septic form of C."
		glabrata infection.

		surgery.
PG	-	296-304
AB	-	PURPOSE: Submacular surgery for choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is under
		investigation in the treatment of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and the
		presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome. Four case studies are presented to
		demonstrate scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO) testing in the pre- and
		postsurgical evaluation of visual function in patients with subfoveal CNV
		"secondary to AMD, presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome, and submacular"
		hemorrhage secondary to AMD. METHODS: Patients underwent a visual assessment pre-
		"and 6 months postoperatively, consisting of low vision visual acuity measurement,"
		"SLO macular perimetry of dense and relative scotomas, and analysis of the"
		preferred retinal locus for fixation (PRL) location and ability. RESULTS: Visual
		"acuity, dense and relative scotoma size and location, and PRL location were"
		compared; and relationships between anatomic and functional changes were
		observed. Decreases in scotoma size and improvement in PRL location and ability
		usually corresponded with improved visual acuity. Preoperative scotoma and PRL
		location guided retinotomy site selection. CONCLUSION: Scanning laser
		ophthalmoscope macular perimetry and PRL testing may be useful adjuncts in the
		visual assessment of submacular surgery and may advance under-standing of the
		"effects of submacular surgery on visual function. In addition, this testing may"
		be used to plan location of surgical interventions for macular diseases.

PG	-	542-4

		"abcesses of the interstitium and urogenital tract. To our knowledge,"
		glomerulonephritis has never been reported in histoplasmosis. We describe a case
		of proven histoplasmosis presenting with oral granulomatous ulceration and
		segmental glomerulonephritis that mimicked Wegener's granulomatosis (WG). All
		symptoms and renal parameters remitted under itraconazole treatment alone. In
		"conclusion, glomerulonephritis may complicate the course of chronic disseminated"
		"histoplasmosis. Since it can masquerade as WG, systematic tissue staining for"
		intracellular microorganisms should be done when WG is suspected.

		"right hand, accompanied by nontender regional lymphadenomegaly that developed"
		following local trauma that occurred during military training in a tunnel
		inhabited by bats. Histological examination of a biopsy specimen from the skin
		"lesion showed granulomatous infiltrate, but did not show fungal elements."
		"Culturing of this material, incubated in Sabouraud agar, showed growth of"
		Histoplasma capsulatum. No evidence of systemic involvement or immunosuppression
		was found. Treatment with 400 mg/day of itraconazole orally for six months
		"resulted in complete remission of the lesion, which was maintained one year after"
		the end of the treatment.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Those infected by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have a higher
		risk of opportunistic infections. The risk is related to the level of
		immunosuppression. We report a case of a young male with the unusual scenario of
		"three opportunistic infections occurring simultaneously: Cryptococcosis,"
		Histoplasmosis and Cryptosporidiosis. Histoplasmosis and cryptococcosis are major
		causes of morbimortality in immunocompromised patients due to HIV infection. CASE
		PRESENTATION: We report the case of a patient with HIV infection with a CD4 T
		"lymphocyte cell (CD4) count of 2 cells/mm3, who presented with 6 months of"
		"diarrhea, non-productive dry cough, nocturnal diaphoresis, fever, weight loss,"
		and a maculopapular rash. He had a concurrent infection with three opportunistic
		"microorganisms: fungemia by cryptococcosis, disseminated histoplasmosis confirmed"
		by detection of the antigen in urine and chronic diarrhea by cryptosporidiosis
		confirmed by direct observation in feces by modified Ziehl-Neelsen stain. The
		patient received antifungal treatment with a satisfactory outcome. CONCLUSIONS:
		There are still regions where HIV detection programs are deficient thus
		facilitating occurrence of HIV infection cases in advanced stages of
		immunosuppression. A high level of suspicion of systemic mycoses and concurrent
		infection by several opportunistic pathogens is required in severely
		immunocompromised patients.

TI	-	Mucocutaneous manifestations of disseminated histoplasmosis in patients with
		acquired immunodeficiency syndrome: particular aspects in a Latin-American
		population.
PG	-	250-5
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Mucocutaneous lesions in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected
		patients with disseminated histoplasmosis have a wide spectrum of clinical
		"manifestations, making its diagnosis difficult. Studies have been restricted to"
		case reports and series with small numbers of patients not specifically focusing
		on the dermatological aspects of histoplasmosis. AIMS: To describe the
		characteristics of mucocutaneous lesions of disseminated histoplasmosis in
		HIV-infected patients. METHODS: A retrospective and prospective study was
		conducted on 36 HIV-infected patients with mucocutaneous histoplasmosis in a
		tertiary-care hospital in Brazil. RESULTS: Mucocutaneous histoplasmosis was
		diagnosed by histopathology in 33 of the 36 patients (91%) and/or culture in 23
		(64%). Their CD4+ cell counts ranged from 2 to 103 cells/mm(3). The average
		number of different morphological types of lesions was three per patient. Despite
		"the variability of the lesions, papules (50%), crusted papules (64%) and oral"
		mucosal erosions and/or ulcers (58%) were the most frequent dermatological
		lesions. A diffuse pattern of distribution of the skin lesions was found in 58%
		of the cases. There was significant association between the CD4+ cell counts and
		the morphological variability of lesions per patient. Variation in the lesions
		seemed to be associated with higher CD4+ cell counts. CONCLUSION: Doctors caring
		for HIV-infected patients should be aware of the wide spectrum of dermatological
		lesions observed in disseminated histoplasmosis and the importance of detecting
		and isolating the fungus in mucocutaneous tissues.

AB	-	PURPOSE: To describe the first-documented case of histoplasma scleritis in an
		immunocompetent patient. METHODS: Medical and pathological records of the patient
		described were reviewed. RESULTS: A 77-year-old immunocompetent man presented
		"with necrotizing scleritis. Biopsy was consistent with histoplasma species, and"
		culture results confirmed a causative agent of Histoplasma capsulatum. The
		"patient required a long course of treatment, which included topical voriconazole"
		"and amphotericin, oral itraconazole and voriconazole, intravenous amphotericin,"
		"and periocular voriconazole and amphotericin. After 8 months of treatment, the"
		"patient's scleritis resolved, and he maintained good visual acuity. CONCLUSIONS:"
		"To our knowledge, this is the second report of histoplasma scleritis in the"
		literature and the first report in an immunocompetent patient.

AB	-	"Primary cystic tumors of papillary muscles of the heart are extremely rare. Here,"
		one case of unusual cystic tumor in papillary muscle of the heart in a
		37-year-old Myanmar migrant worker has been reported. He came to Malaysia 2 weeks
		before and one morning was found dead in sleep. Autopsy revealed cystic lesion in
		"the papillary muscle of the mitral valve of heart, which was prolapsing into"
		ventricular cavity. The cyst had white-jelly like sticky mucus material. The cyst
		was present in papillary muscle with slight invasion in septum area; it was lined
		by cuboidal-columnar epithelium and contained mucinous contents. There was no
		evidence of an inflammatory reaction in the cyst and in cardiac muscles. In
		"addition to cystic neoplasm, the deceased also had histoplasmosis of the lungs."
		The case is presented with macroscopic and microscopic photographs of the cyst
		"and histoplasmosis of the lungs. This case is reported because of its rarity,"
		"unique position, and unusual appearance."

AB	-	Histoplasmosis is caused by the dimorphic fungus Histoplasma capsulatum.Primary
		infection occurs through inhalation of spores from the air. Immunocompetent
		"individuals are usually asymptomatic, but may develop pulmonary disease."
		Immunocompromised patients tend to present systemic histoplasmosis with cutaneous
		"lesions occurring by secondary invasion. In this case report, we describe a"
		probable primary cutaneous histoplasmosis (PCH) in a patient with adult onset
		Still's disease under immunosuppression.

PG	-	157-159

AB	-	Amphotericin B (AmB) is a polyene antifungal agent used widely for systemic
		"fungal infections. Infusion-related side effects, nephrotoxicity, and"
		dyselectrolytemia are well-known adverse effects with the use of this drug.
		"Liposomal preparation of AmB has less adverse events. However, ototoxicity due to"
		AmB is scarcely mentioned in the literature. We report a case of disseminated
		histoplasmosis who was treated with liposomal amphotericin B (LAmB) and developed
		"hearing loss during the treatment, which recovered after discontinuing the drug."
		"This is a rare adverse effect of LAmB and reported only once from India, to the"
		best of our knowledge.

PG	-	151-7
AB	-	"Chronic infections of the larynx are notorious ""copycats"" of squamous cell"
		carcinoma. Patients typically present with a historical picture and symptoms
		"identical to those seen in a neoplastic setting: dyspnea, hoarseness,"
		"odynophagia, weight loss, and a history of tobacco and alcohol abuse."
		"Historically, these patients were subject to an extensive resection for what was"
		in reality a benign disease. A better understanding and awareness of these
		"conditions has reinforced the need for a direct laryngoscopy, biopsy, and culture"
		in the evaluation of long-lasting laryngeal lesions; this has led to more
		appropriate and focused treatment. The clinical mimicry of chronic laryngeal
		"infections will be illustrated in two recent case reports, histoplasmosis and"
		"botryomycosis of the larynx, which will lead into a discussion on the"
		"differential diagnosis of bacterial and fungal laryngeal infections, their"
		"evaluation, and treatment options."

PG	-	429-33

		syndrome (RHS) resulting from disseminated histoplasmosis in a patient with Human
		Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) from Puerto Rico. Although the diagnosis was
		"established by histopathologic findings and a positive bone marrow culture,"
		Histoplasma capsulatum-specific real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) allowed
		"to confirm the diagnosis from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue."
		"Interestingly, the Histoplasma antigens in both serum and urine samples were"
		"falsely negative. Amphotericin B lipid complex (Abelcet), followed by oral"
		"itraconazole, led to a successful response and resolution of symptoms. A short"
		"review of the clinical signs and symptoms, diagnostic tests, and therapeutic"
		"options for disseminated histoplasmosis is done, with emphasis on the role of"
		Histoplasma-specific real-time PCR as a molecular diagnostic tool and the
		efficacy of treatment with one of the lipid formulations of amphotericin B.

PG	-	863-5
AB	-	"An 8-year-old, female mongrel dog had granulomatous lesions in the skull skin and"
		gingiva of the left mandible. The lesions were macroscopically seen as grayish
		"white papular granulomas, and microscopically consisted to numerous swollen"
		macrophages and a few neutrophils without fibrocaseous necrosis. Macrophages
		contained many small oval or round-shaped yeast-like cells and a few rod-shaped
		organisms indicating a narrow based budding in their cytoplasm. The yeast-like
		"cells were 2-5 microns (average 3.5 microns) in diameter, and appeared as a"
		"central, spherical, lightly basophilic body surrounded by a clear zone or ""halo""."
		"The cell wall and central body were stained by the periodic acid-Shiff, Grocott's"
		"methenamine silver impregnation, or Gridley fungus method. Immunohistochemically,"
		"yeast-like cells were positive to anti-histoplasma yeast antibody, and rod-shaped"
		organisms were positive to anti-histoplasma mycelial antibody. The present paper
		describes the first case of canine histoplasmosis in Japan.

		Histo-plasma capsulatum are reviewed. The indications of fine needle aspiration
		biopsy for the diagnosis of infections in AIDS patients are emphasized. This
		method enables to send rapidly material for cultures and to start immediately an
		appropriate treatment.

TI	-	Presentation and outcome of histoplasmosis in pediatric inflammatory bowel
		disease patients treated with antitumor necrosis factor alpha therapy: a case
		series.
PG	-	56-61
LID	-	10.1002/ibd.21378 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Antitumor necrosis factor alpha (aTNF) therapies are commonly used in
		"the treatment of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, inhibition"
		"of the TNF-alpha pathway predisposes to serious infections, including"
		"histoplasmosis, which is the most common invasive fungal infection in individuals"
		on aTNF therapy and carries a high mortality rate when associated with delayed
		"diagnosis. Few data exist on the frequency, presentation, and appropriate"
		treatment of pediatric patients with histoplasmosis on aTNF therapy. METHODS:
		"Following Institutional Review Board approval, cases were identified then"
		reviewed with their primary gastroenterologist and infectious disease
		specialists. RESULTS: Herein we describe histoplasmosis in five pediatric
		patients receiving aTNF therapy for IBD in an endemic area. CONCLUSIONS:
		Histoplasmosis is an important complication of treatment with TNF-alpha
		neutralizing agents. Children with IBD treated with aTNF therapy who develop the
		infection may present with minimal pulmonary symptoms. While discontinuation of
		"aTNF therapy is important initially, few data exist to determine when and how"
		aTNF therapy can be reinstituted. Recognition of Histoplasma capsulatum is often
		delayed due to the overlap of symptoms with some of the extraintestinal
		manifestations of IBD and other more prevalent infectious complications.

PG	-	235
LID	-	10.1186/1752-1947-8-235 [doi]
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Histoplasmosis is an endemic mycosis with most cases of clinical
		"illness reported in North and Central America. Rarely, patients develop"
		progressive disseminated histoplasmosis with extrapulmonary manifestations. These
		infections are fatal if not appropriately treated. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a
		"case of progressive disseminated histoplasmosis presenting with fever,"
		"progressive dyspnea, and pancytopenia in a 51-year-old Caucasian man who had been"
		treated with chronic steroids for a diagnosis of sarcoidosis made 20 years
		"previously. His presentation was initially mistaken for sarcoidosis but,"
		"fortunately, laboratory results showed hematologic abnormalities, and the"
		diagnosis of histoplasmosis was made by bone marrow biopsy. CONCLUSIONS:
		"Sarcoidosis reduces T cell activity, and the addition of steroids for treatment"
		causes further immunosuppression and vulnerability for development of a
		disseminated infection. The diagnosis of histoplasmosis depends mainly on
		clinical presentation and host factors. Although there are diagnostic laboratory
		"tests available, clinicians may need to diagnose histoplasmosis by history and"
		"physical examination alone and treat empirically, since awaiting"
		Histoplasma-specific laboratory results would delay initiation of treatment.
		"Primary care providers, hospitalists, and subspecialists alike should be aware of"
		the overlap in clinical and radiological presentations of sarcoidosis and
		"histoplasmosis, and when and how to pursue diagnostic testing for endemic"
		"mycoses, since these infections can be fatal in immunosuppressed patients without"
		appropriate treatment.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND Histoplasmosis results from the inhalation of spores from the fungus,"
		Histoplasma capsulatum. A case is presented of pulmonary histoplasmosis
		associated with altered mental state and hypercalcemia following allogeneic
		hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). CASE
		REPORT A 75-year-old man with a five-day history of AML treated with allogeneic
		"hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, presented with weakness, fatigue, and"
		slow mentation. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain was unremarkable.
		"Laboratory investigations showed serum albumin of 2.9 g/dL, calcium of 11.6"
		"mg/dL, ionized calcium of 1.55 mmol/L, parathyroid hormone (PTH) <6.3 pg/mL, and"
		25-hydroxy vitamin D of 14.4 ng/mL. Treatment began with intravenous cefepime 1
		"gm bid, normal saline, and the bisphosphonate, pamidronate, administered as a"
		"single dose. Three days later, his clinical status declined. He developed a dry"
		"productive cough, his oxygen saturation (O₂ Sat) was 90%, and his mental status"
		worsened. Chest CT showed diffuse bilateral lung infiltrates with ground glass
		opacities. Bronchioalveolar lavage and transbronchial biopsy were negative for
		Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP). The CMV rival load was 195 IU/mL.
		Urinalysis for Histoplasma antigen and the Fungitell® assay were positive.
		"Treatment commenced with intravenous voriconazole (250 mg, bid) and ganciclovir"
		"(5 mg/kg, bid). A left lower lobe transbronchial lung biopsy was positive for"
		Histoplasma capsulatum and negative for CMV. CONCLUSIONS This case report has
		highlighted the need for awareness of the diagnosis of histoplasmosis in patients
		with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation who present with an
		altered mental state in the setting of hypercalcemia.

TI	-	Neuroendoscopic diagnosis of central nervous system histoplasmosis with basilar
		arachnoiditis.
PG	-	399.E9-13
LID	-	10.1016/j.wneu.2011.06.016 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: Histoplasmosis of the central nervous system (CNS) is seen in 10% to
		20% of patients with disseminated histoplasmosis and/or in association with
		"immunocompromised patients. Meningitis, arachnoiditis, and hydrocephalus are the"
		most common clinical manifestations of CNS histoplasmosis. Patients with CNS
		"histoplasmosis present similarly to other infectious etiologies, and confirmatory"
		"diagnosis is important in the management of these patients. However, diagnosis of"
		"CNS histoplasmosis can be difficult, and sometimes performing a parenchymal"
		biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: We describe
		"the case of a 41-year-old man with HIV/AIDS who presented with the signs,"
		"symptoms, and radiologic evidence of basal meningitis and hydrocephalus."
		Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis from multiple lumbar punctures was negative.
		The patient underwent a neuroendoscopic procedure with diagnostic and therapeutic
		goals. Internal CSF diversion (endoscopic third ventriculostomy) and biopsy of
		the floor of the third ventricle and subarachnoid space were performed; surgical
		"biopsies identified noncaseating granulomas, and ventricular CSF was positive for"
		Histoplasmosis antibodies. The patient was treated with liposomal amphotericin B
		and itraconazole. The patient had resolution of his symptoms immediately after
		"surgery, and 1-month follow-up computed tomography of the head demonstrated"
		"resolution of the hydrocephalus. At the last follow-up 12 months postoperatively,"
		the patient has not required insertion of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.
		CONCLUSION: Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for fungal basal
		meningitis in patients with AIDS and hydrocephalus. With nondiagnostic lumbar CSF
		"sampling, neuroendoscopy can be considered as an alternative for diagnosis and"
		treatment of basal meningitis and hydrocephalus.

PG	-	926-931
LID	-	10.1111/ijd.13679 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Disseminated cutaneous histoplasmosis (DCH) is one of the
		manifestations of systemic histoplasmosis infection in HIV-positive patients.
		Interaction between host immune status and histoplasmosis infection is still
		"poorly understood. It is thought that immune status, represented by CD4 counts,"
		may be correlated with clinical and histopathological findings. OBJECTIVE: To
		correlate the CD4 counts with the different clinical and histopathological
		findings in cutaneous histoplasmosis. METHODS: This was a serial case report of
		seven HAART-treated HIV positive patients with disseminated histoplasmosis
		observed within the period of January 2004 through December 2014 from the
		"Dermatology and Venereology Department, Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, Jakarta,"
		Indonesia. The patients came with different complaints and clinical findings. CD4
		counts were recorded prior to lesion biopsy. RESULTS: The CD4 counts were
		independent from clinical morphology and distribution of lesions. Lower CD4
		"counts were associated with the presence of intraepidermal yeast-like cells,"
		whereas there is the ability of forming granulomas at higher CD4 counts.
		CONCLUSION: CD4 count correlates to histopathological findings of cutaneous
		histoplasmosis.

TI	-	Choroidoretinal vascular anastomoses.
PG	-	217-22
AB	-	Three cases of choroidoretinal anastomosis had unusual etiologic and hemodynamic
		"features. In two cases the anastomoses, one caused by ocular histoplasmosis and"
		"one by diabetic maculopathy, shunted retinal venous drainage into the choroid. In"
		"the third case, the congenital arterial choroidoretinal anastomosis should"
		probably be termed retinochoroidal arteriovenous anastomosis. Prospective
		photographic and fluorangiographic studies of these patients suggest that our
		understanding of many basic features of retinal-choroidal circulatory
		hemodynamics is incomplete.

AB	-	The authors report 4 cases of African histoplasmosis in Zaïrans. The diagnostic
		"was based ou cutaneous (4 patients), bones (3), lymph-nodes (2), and"
		bowel-localizations (1) and was confirmed by the presence of Histoplasma
		"duboisiis yeasts in cutaneous biopsy (4 patients), in pus of abscess or cutaneous"
		lesions (3) and in stools (1). Two HIV seronegatives patients had a good outcome
		with amphotericin B. One patient died without any treatment. One HIV-1 and HTLV-1
		seropositive patient had successful short-term outcome with ketoconazole. Seven
		others cases of association between African histoplasmosis and AIDS are noted in
		the literature. They suggest the opportunistic nature of this deep mycosis.

PG	-	94-7
AB	-	Histoplasmosis is a rare but serious fungal infection commonly presenting as
		mucosal ulceration of the oral cavity. It is increasingly recognized in Australia
		but the source of infection remains obscure and it is likely to be
		under-diagnosed. We report a case of chronic mucosal ulceration which failed to
		fully respond to periodontal therapy. Histology and culture of a gingival biopsy
		"was consistent with histoplasmosis, and the patient responded favourably to"
		treatment with oral itraconazole. Histoplasmosis may present to general dental
		practitioners as chronic mucosal ulceration and should be considered in the
		differential diagnosis of such lesions. Diagnosis is best made by culture and
		histology of biopsy specimens.

TI	-	Perianal Histoplasmosis Presenting as a Mass Suspicious for Malignancy: A Case
		Report with Review of Gastrointestinal Manifestations of Histoplasmosis.
PG	-	1740-1744
LID	-	10.12659/AJCR.918220 [doi]
AB	-	"BACKGROUND Disseminated histoplasmosis, a disease that can present years after"
		"exposure to the causative organism, may manifest in many diverse ways. Although"
		"the gastrointestinal tract is involved in most cases, the initial presentation"
		"occurring along the gastrointestinal tract, including the colon and rectum, is"
		infrequent. CASE REPORT This case report describes a 66-year-old male patient who
		presented with an indurated painful perianal lesion that appeared highly
		suspicious for malignancy on imaging. The patient had no known history of
		well-established immunocompromised state except for a short course of
		prednisolone for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease management. A biopsy of
		"the mass was performed, showing chronic inflammation with clusters of epithelioid"
		"histiocytes containing characteristic, PAS-fungus stain-positive, intracellular"
		yeast forms consistent with histoplasmosis. There was no evidence of malignancy.
		A subsequent work-up revealed perihilar nodularity on chest X-ray suggestive of
		"calcified granuloma, a positive Histoplasma Capsulatum Antigen test result, and"
		mildly decreased CD4: CD8 ratio of unknown significance. HIV testing was
		"negative. Treatment with itraconazole and terbinafine was initiated, and at"
		"5-months follow-up, the patient reported significant improvement in signs and"
		"symptoms, with undetectable Histoplasma antigen on repeat testing. CONCLUSIONS"
		"This case represents an extremely rare presentation of histoplasmosis infection,"
		and highlights the fact that presenting symptoms of histoplasmosis can be vague
		"and may mimic other disease processes, including neoplasia. Biopsy of the lesion"
		with PAS staining and serologic testing is critical in establishing the correct
		diagnosis.

TI	-	Atypical presentation of histoplasmosis in a patient with psoriasis and psoriatic
		arthritis on infliximab therapy.
PG	-	57-60
AB	-	Infliximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody to TNF-alpha which acts on both the
		soluble and transmembrane forms of TNF-alpha. It has been used successfully for
		"the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's"
		disease and ankylosing spondylitis either as monotherapy or in combination with
		"drugs such as methotrexate. To date, over 20,440 patients with moderate-to-severe"
		psoriasis have been treated with infliximab worldwide. Opportunistic infections
		and reactivation of underlying latent infections are an area of concern with the
		use of infliximab particularly when used in conjunction with other
		immunosuppresants. The authors report a case of histoplasmosis presenting with
		signs of severe hypercalcemia and renal failure in a patient on infliximab for
		approximately three years in combination with low dosages of methotrexate and
		prednisone. This report stresses the importance of maintaining a high index of
		suspicion for unusual pathogens while managing patients receiving TNF-alpha
		"inhibitors, particularly when used in combination with other immunosuppressants."
		"In addition, the authors emphasize the role of a multi-disciplinary approach and"
		appropriate coordination among caregivers.

AB	-	Patients with impaired cell-mediated immunity have a higher risk of developing
		"histoplasmosis; however, histoplasmosis after solid organ transplantation is"
		"rare. In Thailand, histoplasmosis cases are sporadic, and most cases are"
		"associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Herein, we report a"
		case of disseminated histoplasmosis in a kidney transplant Thai recipient
		diagnosed by fungal staining of fungal culture from bronchoalveolar lavage and
		bone marrow biopsy. Liposomal amphotericin B was given followed by oral
		"itraconazole. The patient's clinical condition was improved; however, his graft"
		function was irreversibly declined. The majority of histoplasmosis cases after
		solid organ transplant presented with disseminated disease with pulmonary
		"involvement. Even in a non-endemic area of histoplasmosis, suspected cases should"
		be early diagnosed and promptly managed in order to reduce morbidity and
		"mortality, especially in cell-mediated immunity defect patients like solid organ"
		transplant recipients.

TI	-	Case of disseminated histoplasmosis in a HIV-infected patient revealed by nasal
		involvement with maxillary osteolysis.
PG	-	328
LID	-	10.1186/s12879-017-2419-4 [doi]
LID	-	328
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Disseminated Histoplasmosis (DH) is a rare manifestation of Acquired
		Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in European countries. Naso-maxillar osteolysis
		due to Histoplasma capsulatum var. capsulatum (Hcc) is unusual in endemic
		countries and has never been reported in European countries. Differential
		"diagnoses such as malignant tumors, cocaine use, granulomatosis, vasculitis and"
		infections are more frequently observed and could delay and/or bias the final
		diagnosis. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of an immunocompromised patient
		infected by Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) with naso-maxillar histoplasmosis
		"in a non-endemic country. Our aim is to describe the clinical presentation, the"
		"diagnostic and therapeutic issues. A 53-year-old woman, originated from Haiti,"
		was admitted in 2016 for nasal deformation with alteration of general condition
		evolving for at least 6 months. HIV infection was diagnosed in 2006 and
		classified at AIDS stage in 2008 due to cytomegalovirus infection associated with
		"pulmonary histoplasmosis. At admission, CD4 cell count was 9/mm(3). Surgical"
		biopsies were performed and ruled out differential or associated diagnoses.
		Mycological cultures identified Hcc and Blood Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) for
		Hcc was positive. The patient was given daily Amphothericin B liposomal infusion
		"during 1 month. Hcc PCR became negative in the blood under treatment, and then"
		oral switch by itraconazole was introduced. Antiretroviral treatment was
		reintroduced after a 3-week histoplasmosis treatment. Normalization of
		naso-maxillar mucosa enabled a palatal prosthesis. CONCLUSION: Naso-maxillar
		histoplasmosis is extremely rare; this is the first case ever reported in a
		non-endemic country. Differential diagnoses must be ruled out by conducting
		microbiologic tools and histological examinations on surgical biopsies. Early
		antifungal treatment should be initiated in order to prevent DH severe outcomes.

		case report.
PG	-	374-377
LID	-	10.1111/crj.12344 [doi]
AB	-	We report a case of a 41-year-old man presenting with persisting fevers over 2
		weeks. The patient had spent 4 weeks in Central America. He was in control of a
		stable stage II sarcoidosis. Laboratory and various microbiological tests as well
		as chest radiography led to no diagnosis. Activated sarcoidosis was hypothesized
		"as the most likely diagnosis. However, we considered an infectious process as a"
		"differential diagnosis, in detail, the travel history imposed histoplasmosis."
		Chest-CT documented localized interstitial consolidations. Bronchoscopy with
		"bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and biopsy was performed. Results of BAL fluid,"
		"biopsy, distinct sarcoidosis serum markers and a borderline positive"
		histoplasmosis-serology yielded in a diagnostic dilemma as no distinct diagnosis
		"was drawable. After the patient was already started on a prednisolone trial, the"
		final diagnosis - pulmonary histoplasmosis - could be achieved via positive
		culture and PCR out of the BAL fluid. This case shows the difficult
		differentiation between an acute exacerbation of a chronic pulmonary disease and
		"a concomitant infection, which was especially aggravated in this case as the"
		histoplasmosis masqueraded an acute picture of sarcoidosis.

PG	-	658-61
AB	-	Clinically apparent involvement of the central nervous system is a rare event in
		"cases of disseminated histoplasmosis, even in HIV-infected persons. Despite"
		"therapy with amphotericin B, mortality remains very high. Reported here is the"
		"case of an HIV-infected patient with a 3-month history of fever, cough, weight"
		loss and miliary lung infiltrates. Four weeks after initiation of tuberculostatic
		"therapy, high-grade fever, neurological symptoms, personality changes and"
		respiratory deterioration occurred. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain
		"showed multiple mass lesions, and a chest radiograph revealed worsening of"
		pulmonary infiltrates. Methenamine silver staining of a lung biopsy specimen
		"demonstrated Histoplasma capsulatum. Subsequently, this pathogen was cultured"
		from lavage fluid. Following high-dose intravenous fluconazole therapy (800 mg
		"once daily), the patient's condition improved markedly within 10 days, followed"
		by an almost complete resolution of pulmonary and cerebral mass lesions. This is
		believed to be the first documented case of rapid improvement of disseminated
		histoplasmosis with central nervous system involvement in an HIV-infected patient
		upon induction of therapy with fluconazole.

PG	-	e13523

AB	-	Histoplasmosis is an invasive mycosis caused by fungus Histoplasma capsulatum.
		"Clinical features of histoplasmosis are often nonspecific, but patients with"
		disseminated infection may present with severe manifestations posing an
		increasing threat to patients with various immunocompromised conditions. It is
		often misdiagnosed as tuberculosis in endemic regions leading to high mortality.
		There is under-reporting of histoplasmosis in solid organ transplant from India
		undermining its actual incidence and impact. As a result of the potentially fatal
		"nature of the disease, careful evaluation with tissue diagnosis is recommended."
		We present a series of five cases of disseminated histoplasmosis in renal
		"transplant recipients from our centre, highlighting its significance as"
		"differential diagnosis in this population. To our knowledge, this is the largest"
		case series reported from India in renal transplant patients.

AB	-	Histoplasmosis is a multifaceted condition caused by the dimorphic fungi
		"Histoplasma capsulatum whose infective spores are inhaled and reach the lungs,"
		"the primary organ of infection. The meningeal form, considered one of the most"
		"serious manifestations of this mycosis, is usually seen in individuals with"
		impaired cellular immunity such as patients with acquired immunodeficiency
		"syndrome, systemic lupus erythematous or solid organ transplantation, and infants"
		given their immunological immaturity. The most common presentation is
		self-limited and occurs in immunocompetent individuals who have been exposed to
		high concentrations of conidia and mycelia fragments of the fungi. In those
		"people, the condition is manifested by pulmonary disorders and late dissemination"
		to other organs and systems. We report a case of central nervous system
		histoplasmosis in an immunocompetent child.

		report.
PG	-	577-80
AB	-	A 57-year-old man had subacute embolic ischemia of his right foot and subsequent
		acute embolic ischemia of his left foot after angiography. Thrombus removed at
		the time of the left femoral thromboembolectomy grew Histoplasma capsulatum
		confirming the diagnosis of disseminated histoplasmosis. Surgical
		revascularization of the right leg and parenteral amphotericin B was followed by
		chronic ketoconazole therapy for 16 months. The patient has remained asymptomatic
		at 30 months after operation. Effective treatment of endovascular infection with
		ischemic complications of Histoplasmosis requires surgical revascularization and
		intensive chemotherapeutic intervention. Histoplasmosis is a ubiquitous infection
		in endemic areas that often has an asymptomatic subclinical course. Involvement
		of the cardiovascular system is rarely reported. Previous case reports have
		described infected cardiac valves and aortic aneurysms. This report describes the
		uncommon presentation of disseminated Histoplasma capsulatum infection as a
		peripheral embolic event and the successful management with revascularization
		combined with systemic amphotericin B followed by ketoconazole therapy.

PG	-	459-62
LID	-	10.1002/dc.21814 [doi]
AB	-	Histoplasmosis is usually an opportunistic fungal infection in patients with
		"defective cell mediated immunity, and has been considered as one of the acquired"
		"immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) defining illness. However, cutaneous involvement"
		"in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive patients is less common, and very"
		rarely can be the initial presenting symptom for the diagnosis of AIDS. We
		present here an unusual case of multiple diffuse cutaneous nodular lesions
		"predominantly in face, trunk, and upper extremities diagnosed initially on"
		aspiration cytology as histoplasmosis. Subsequent serological test revealed
		"positivity for HIV 1 and 2, along with a low CD4 count and low CD4:CD3 ratio. The"
		cytomorphological features were further corroborated by histology and
		"histochemical stains. Hence, cutaneous histoplasmosis can cause multiple wide"
		spread nodular or umbilicated lesions in AIDS patients as the initial
		"presentation. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is a rapid, cost effective"
		tool for diagnosis of the fungi from such lesions and initiating work up for
		immunocompromised states including AIDS.

TI	-	[Presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome (POHS) in a non-endemic area].
PG	-	128-30
AB	-	BACKGROUND: POHS is a chorioretinal disease rarely occurring in non-endemic
		areas. METHODS: We present the case of a 35-year old male patient with symptoms
		"of dry eyes, but subjectively no other ocular complaints. However, visual acuity"
		"of the right eye was 20/20, but only 20/200 in the left eye. RESULTS: On"
		fundoscopic examination both eyes showed alterations consistent with all four
		typical features of presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome. In both eyes in the
		"mid-periphery punched-out chorioretinal spots were found, an extensive"
		peripapillary atrophy and peripheral linear chorioretinal streaks were seen.
		"Moreover, in the left eye an atrophic macular scar existed, presumably due to"
		"subretinal neovascularisation. The macula of the right eye was normal, serology"
		testing for Histoplasma capsulatum negative. CONCLUSIONS: As the patient had
		never travelled to endemic areas such as the USA but exhibited all features of
		"POHS, the case shows that POHS may also occur in European, non-endemic areas."
		This further supports the theory that other factors play a role in the
		etiopathology of this syndrome.

PG	-	190-1
AB	-	A 46-year-old man with recurrent pulmonary histoplasmosis was given oral
		treatment with ketoconazole (a new imidazole derivative related to miconazole) in
		"a dose of 400 mg/day for 3 months, followed by 200 mg daily for 6 months. The"
		clinical and microbiological signs disappeared and the chest X-ray cleared. The
		drug was well tolerated without clinical or biological side-effects. The
		"pharmacology of ketoconazole, its indications and the results of treatment of"
		"other deep mycoses are discussed. Unlike amphotericin B, ketoconazole can be"
		administered orally without noticeable toxicity and appears to have approximately
		the same fungicidal activity.

		"back pain, lower limb weakness predominant on the right side, and urinary"
		"difficulties, leading progressively to a flaccid paraplegia with sphincter"
		impairment. Concomitant poor cognitive performances were noted. MRI showed
		"enlargement of the conus terminalis, with a low-intensity signal on T1-weighted"
		"images, high-intensity signal on T2-weighted images, and areas of intramedullar"
		contrast enhancement. A biopsy of the lesion showed macrophages containing yeast
		"cells, with PAS and Grocott staining aspects compatible with the presence of"
		Histoplasma capsulatum (Hc). A brain MRI showed multiple localizations in the
		brain stem and in both hemispheres with associated edema. Disseminated
		histoplasmosis was confirmed by a biopsy of a sub-maxillary ganglion
		demonstrating a necrotic tuberculoid lymphadenitis containing yeast cells
		resembling Hc. Immune tests disclosed the presence of HTLV1 anti-bodies without
		immunodeficiency nor HIV co-infection. An anti-micotic treatment was started 2
		"weeks after surgery, with intra-venous amphotericin B, for 21 days, followed by"
		"itraconazole, orally for 90 days. Cognitive functions improved significantly in 5"
		weeks while paraplegia and sphincter impairment remained unchanged. Seven months
		"later, cerebral MR aspects dramatically improved while the conus medullaris"
		"lesion diminished, and the edematous component disappeared in all areas. Even"
		"though histoplasmosis is endemic in our region, CNS localization is rare,"
		generally in disseminated forms associated with immunodeficiency. Brain
		"granulomas are well-known, but spinal cord histoplasmomas are exceptional: only"
		"four cases have been evaluated by MRI. Unlike our case, spinal cord forms"
		"generally improve, due to surgery associated with antifungus medication, or"
		sometimes due to specific medical treatment alone but with sufficient dosage.

PG	-	334-8
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: To present the functional, angiographic and electron microscopic"
		results of 3 patients who underwent surgical removal of a subfoveolar
		neovascularisation. These patients are representative of the most common
		"indications for subfoveolar surgery. MATERIAL AND METHOD: In one case, the"
		neovascularization originated from an old chorioretinal scar close to the macula;
		"in another case, it was associated with high myopia; in the last case the"
		neovascularization was coupled with an age-related macular degeneration (ARMD).
		The 3 removal neovascular membranes were examined by electron microscopy.
		Indocyanine green and fluorescein angiographies were performed in all 3 cases
		before and after surgery. RESULTS: Visual recovery was excellent in the case of
		neovasularization and old chorioretinitis scar; it was minimal in the case of
		high myopia; no objective improvement was found in the case of ARMD. Electron
		microscopic examination did not always allow to determine accurately if the
		neovascularization was located in the subretinal space or under the pigment
		epthelium. CONCLUSIONS: These results match those already published: surgical
		prognosis is the best when neovascularization is in the subretinal space and when
		the pigment epithelium has not been damaged by the underlying disease or by the
		surgical maneuvers. Electron microscopic examination is not easy to interpret.

TI	-	Disseminated histoplasmosis with atypical cutaneous lesions in an Italian
		HIV-infected patient: another autochtonous case.
PG	-	145-8
AB	-	Disseminated histoplasmosis is recognized as a common AIDS-defining opportunistic
		"disease in endemic areas (Americas, Africa, East Asia), while it is rarely"
		"described in Europe, usually in individuals returning from endemic regions, or"
		following endogenous reactivation of a latent infection imported long before from
		"overseas countries. However, reports of autochtonous cases in Europe suggest the"
		"possible, endemic presence of Histoplasma capsulatum in some European regions,"
		such as the South of France or the Po valley in Italy. A case of disseminated
		"histoplasmosis with atypical, papular and ulcerate skin lesions in an Italian"
		"HIV-infected patient, without history of travels outside his native region, is"
		described. Our patient represents the fifth autochtonous case of AIDS-associated
		histoplasmosis described in Italy.

TI	-	Curvilinear pigmentary lesions in a rod-cone dystrophy.
PG	-	641-2
AB	-	PURPOSE: To report a peculiar curvilinear pigmentary lesion in the peripheral
		fundus in a rod-cone dystrophy. METHODS: Observational case report. Fundus
		examination of a 57-year-old woman who was known to have a generalized rod-cone
		dystrophy since she was 8 years old. RESULTS: The peripheral fundus examination
		revealed a curvilinear lesion which resembles a well-known finding associated
		with a presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome or multifocal choroiditis.
		CONCLUSIONS: The differential diagnosis of a peculiar curvilinear pigmentary
		lesion in the peripheral fundus may be expanded to include a generalized rod-cone
		dystrophy.

PG	-	603-7
AB	-	The case of a thirty-two-year-old female HIV-positive patient from Ghana admitted
		"with a septic illness, diarrhoea, anaemia, and severe weight loss is presented."
		During an extensive diagnostic work-up Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and
		typhoid fever were detected. Specific treatment led to marked improvement in the
		"patient's condition. However, five weeks later high fever and diarrhoea recurred."
		Histological examination of biopsies from coloscopy and blood cultures revealed
		Histoplasma capsulatum. The patient recovered completely following antifungal
		therapy with amphotericin B and itraconazole. The case presented emphasises the
		need for medical staff dealing with immunocompromised patients from endemic areas
		"to be aware of symptoms, diagnostic features, and therapeutic measures of this"
		rare fungal infection.

TI	-	Surgical management of a long-standing subfoveal neovascular membrane secondary
		to ocular histoplasmosis.
PG	-	36-9
AB	-	Subretinal neovascular membranes located under the fovea typically lead to
		significant visual loss. Laser treatment has been limited due to the anatomic
		"location of the neovascular process, but surgical removal has been reported with"
		"promising results. We surgically removed a long-standing, presumed ocular"
		histoplasmosis syndrome (POHS) subfoveal neovascular membrane that had been
		"present for 10 months in a patient's only functional eye, with unexpected good"
		results. This case suggests that the good visual outcomes achieved by surgically
		excising smaller subfoveal neovascular membranes early in their natural history
		also can be achieved in selected patients with more chronic and severe subfoveal
		neovascular processes.

AB	-	Histoplasmosis as a serious opportunistic infection in association with AIDS has
		assumed considerable importance. We have gathered 20 case reports from the
		"literature of oral histoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients. In some cases, oral"
		lesions appear to be the primary or only manifestation of disease. We report one
		such case of oral histoplasmosis in a bisexual man who was seen with ulcerations
		on the palate and proved to be infected by HIV.

AB	-	Histoplasmosis is an endemic disease mainly occurring in North America and is
		rare in China. Confirmation of histoplasmosis should be based on a compatible
		"clinical scenario and a positive culture or histopathology. However, there are"
		"still many cases that are misdiagnosed or missed, especially in individuals from"
		"non-endemic areas. In recent years, metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS)"
		has led to the accurate and timely diagnosis of some rare and complicated
		infectious diseases. We describe the case of a 27-year-old Chinese man who had
		"chronic progressive pulmonary lesions without any symptoms for more than 1year,"
		until the lesions reached the epiglottis and led to progressive pharyngeal pain.
		There were no positive results from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and
		"epiglottis tissue cultures, or from epiglottis and lung pathological"
		"examinations, but mNGS was able to identify Histoplasma capsulatum in the"
		epiglottis tissues and BALF as the cause of the lesions. The patient was treated
		successfully with itraconazole.

TI	-	Histoplasmosis Related to Immunosuppression in a Patient with Crohn's Disease: A
		Diagnostic Challenge.
PG	-	e925345
LID	-	10.12659/AJCR.925345 [doi]
AB	-	"BACKGROUND Infliximab, a monoclonal antibody against tumor necrosis factor (TNF)"
		"alpha with proven efficacy and known safety profile, is currently widely used in"
		the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases. Increased risk for serious
		infections and malignant neoplasms secondary to immunosuppression is a major
		concern during therapy with this medication. Histoplasmosis is a granulomatous
		disease caused by the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum. Disseminated forms of the
		disease have immunodepression as a major risk factor. CASE REPORT A 39-years-old
		man had been followed with refractory fistulizing ileocolonic Crohn's disease
		using combination therapy (infliximab plus azathioprine) and also receiving short
		"courses of steroids. After 2 years of this immunosuppressive therapy, the patient"
		"presented with high fever (39.5ºC) for 5 days, associated with profuse sweating,"
		and moderate pain in the left hypochondrium. The patient was hospitalized.
		"Diagnoses of tuberculosis, malignancy, autoimmune diseases, and bacterial and"
		"viral infections were rapidly discarded after investigation. Clinical,"
		"laboratory, and image signs of liver involvement prompted a guided percutaneous"
		"biopsy, which revealed granulomatous hepatitis, with the presence of fungal"
		structures suggestive of Histoplasma capsulatum. Upon treatment with liposomal
		"amphotericin followed by itraconazole, the patient showed an impressively"
		"positive clinical response. CONCLUSIONS TNF blockers, particularly when"
		"associated with other immunosuppressors, are a serious risk factor for"
		opportunistic infections. This unusual case of disseminated histoplasmosis in a
		patient with Crohn's disease using infliximab in combination with azathioprine
		and steroids emphasizes the need for surveillance of this uncommon but
		potentially lethal complication before starting TNF blockers therapy.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Miliary nodules have been typically described as a radiological
		"manifestation of disseminated tuberculosis. However, miliary nodules are known to"
		occur in a wide variety of conditions. The primary objective of the study was to
		identify clinical characteristics and etiologies of miliary nodules within our
		"institution. METHODS: Using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and"
		"Tenth Revision codes, electronic medical records were used to retrospectively"
		identify 53 patients who fulfilled criteria of miliary nodules over the last 10
		years. Demographic and clinical data were extracted for all the patients in this
		cross-sectional study. RESULTS: The diagnosis of tuberculosis was made in 15
		"(28.3%) patients, sarcoidosis in 12 (22.6%), silicosis in 7 (13.2%),"
		"extrathoracic malignancy in 5 (9.4%), and histoplasmosis in 4 (7.6%) patients."
		Four of 9 HIV patients had histoplasmosis. There was 1 case each of
		"hypersensitivity pneumonitis, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia,"
		"Mycobacterium-avium complex, Epstein-Barr virus pneumonia, cryptococcosis,"
		"aspergillosis, and primary lung cancer. Sputum was positive for acid fast bacilli"
		"in 4 cases (28%), and bronchoscopy had a 57% successful yield in miliary"
		tuberculosis. CONCLUSION: Our study is the largest single-center data review
		evaluating the etiology of miliary nodules within the United States; most of the
		data exist in case reports.

		histoplasmosis!
PG	-	73-6
LID	-	S0004-28032014000100073 [pii]
AB	-	CONTEXT: Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) inhibitor therapy plays a pivotal
		role in the management of moderate to severe inflammatory bowel disease. Because
		"of the role of TNF-α in the host defenses, anti-TNF therapy has been associated"
		with an increase the risks of granulomatous infections. OBJECTIVE: To report the
		first case of adalimumab-associated invasive histoplasmosis presenting as an
		acute hepatitis-like syndrome and febrile pneumonitis in a patient with Crohn's
		disease. METHOD: Case report of a patient with progressive histoplasmosis
		confirmed by percutaneous fine needle aspiration biopsy lung and urine
		Histoplasma antigen. RESULTS: We present the case of a young man with CD who
		developed pneumonia and acute hepatitis-like features caused by Histoplasma
		"capsulatum infection during adalimumab therapy. To the best of our knowledge,"
		this acute hepatitis-like manifestation has never been reported as a presentation
		of the histoplasmosis in patients with Crohn's disease. CONCLUSIONS: This case
		underscores the potential risk for serious infection that may arise in this
		setting and should alert clinicians to the need to consider the histoplasmosis
		diagnosis in patients presenting with acute hepatitis-like syndrome associated
		with prolonged febrile illness or pneumonitis during therapy with anti-TNF-α
		antibodies.

		diagnosed by direct examination of pathology specimens after Giemsa staining.
		CASE REPORT: An HIV-infected man developed cutaneous leishmaniasis and
		disseminated histoplasmosis with buccal lesions concomitantly. Smears stained
		with the RAL 555 kit provided the diagnosis of these two diseases. DISCUSSION:
		This case illustrates how direct microscopic examinations can provide
		"inexpensive, rapid and safe diagnosis of infectious diseases. Direct microscopic"
		examinations are routine practice in a tropical dermatology unit.

PG	-	263-7
LID	-	10.1007/s10157-009-0253-8 [doi]
AB	-	Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection can cause a broad spectrum of
		"clinical manifestations, ranging from an asymptomatic carrier state to severe"
		"immunodeficiency. The most common renal lesion, HIV-associated nephropathy"
		"(HIVAN), is a sclerosing glomerulopathy. However, potentially reversible causes"
		of renal disease in HIV-infected patients should also be considered. We describe
		two cases of patients with acquired immune-deficiency syndrome (AIDS) who
		presented with rapidly progressive renal failure but were found to have
		"reversible etiologies. The first case was found to have syphilis and the second,"
		disseminated histoplasmosis; their renal injury resolved after initiation of a
		"third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic and amphotericin B, respectively."

		cutaneous histoplasmosis in the setting of HIV.
PG	-	12
AB	-	A 66-year-old Columbian man presented with a 15-day history of generalized
		"weakness, cough, fever, and verrucous, ulcerating plaques of the face, upper"
		"chest, upper back, and arms. The patient proved to be HIV positive."
		Histopathologic examination showed a diffuse lymphocytic infiltrate coupled with
		a striking number of yeast forms within macrophages. The clinical presentation
		and histopathologic alterations are consistent with the diagnosis disseminated
		Histoplasma capsulatum. This case emphasizes the importance of increasing
		awareness of histoplasmosis in nonendemic areas as a result of the large subgroup
		of immunocompromised patients at risk. Disseminated histoplasmosis can be a
		"treatable HIV complication if recognized early, although is unfortunately a"
		harbinger for an overall poor prognosis.

TI	-	The direct cost and incidence of systemic fungal infections.
PG	-	26-34
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: In this study we determined the incidence and direct inpatient and
		"outpatient costs of systemic fungal infections (candidiasis, aspergillosis,"
		"cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis) in 1998. METHODS: Using primarily the National"
		Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS) for incidence and the Maryland Hospital
		"Discharge Data Set (MDHDDS) for costs, we surveyed four systemic fungal"
		"infections in patients who also had HIV/AIDS, neoplasia, transplant, and all"
		"other concomitant diagnoses. Using a case-control method, we compared the cases"
		with controls (those without fungal infections with the same underlying
		comorbidity) to obtain the incremental hospitalization costs. We used the
		Student's t-test to determine significance of incremental hospital costs. We
		modeled outpatient costs on the basis of discharge status to calculate the total
		"annual cost for systemic fungal infections in 1998. RESULTS: For 1998, the"
		"projected average incidence was 306 per million US population, with candidiasis"
		accounting for 75% of cases. The estimated total direct cost was $2.6 billion and
		"the average per-patient attributable cost was $31,200. The most commonly reported"
		"comorbid diagnoses with fungal infections (HIV/AIDS, neoplasms, transplants)"
		accounted for only 45% of all infections. CONCLUSIONS: The cost burden is high
		for systemic fungal infections. Additional attention should be given to the 55%
		with fungal disease and other comorbid diagnoses.

PG	-	423-431

AB	-	PURPOSE: The advent of spectral domain optical coherence tomography has led to
		superb imaging capabilities in addition to enhanced visualization of the retinal
		layers. Such advancements have led to the identification of a variety of new
		"retinal conditions, including outer retinal tubulations (ORTs). ORTs are ovoid"
		hyporeflective spaces located in the outer retina. The pathogenesis is unclear
		but seems to involve sublethal injury to the photoreceptors leading to a
		compensatory reorganization of the photoreceptor layer with the neighboring
		ellipsoid zone resulting in a hyperreflective border surrounding a central lumen.
		"Most ORTs have been linked to wet age-related macular degeneration; however,"
		these peculiar structures are now seen in a myriad of retinal disorders. CASE
		REPORTS: Our cases will highlight the wide variety of clinical presentations
		associated with outer retinal tubulations. The clinical presentations include two
		"cases of wet age-related macular degeneration, a case of presumed ocular"
		"histoplasmosis syndrome, a case of central areolar choroidal dystrophy, and a"
		case of pathological myopia. CONCLUSIONS: By correctly differentiating outer
		"retinal tubulations from other masqueraders, unnecessary referrals and"
		interventions can be minimized. Understanding the various disease entities
		associated with outer retinal tubulation could give further insight into the
		mechanism and formation of these structures.

AB	-	Histoplasmosis is an endemic fungus in several regions of the United States. The
		diagnosis and treatment of this infection can be challenging in pediatric
		oncology patients. We present 5 patients diagnosed with histoplasmosis while
		receiving treatment at a midsize pediatric oncology center in Iowa. Two cases
		occurred in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 3 cases in patients
		with solid tumors. All patients were treated with antifungal therapy and
		demonstrated excellent clinical response. Histoplasmosis should be considered as
		"a potential cause of nonspecific febrile illness, pulmonary masses, and bone"
		marrow suppression in immunocompromised patients in endemic regions. Prompt and
		accurate diagnosis can facilitate timely antifungal therapy and avoidance of
		"prolonged hospital stays, invasive testing, unnecessary antibiotics, and"
		unwarranted anticancer therapies.

		disseminated histoplasmosis.
PG	-	537-9
AB	-	We describe herein a provocative case involving an immunosuppressed patient with
		"disseminated Histoplasma capsulatum and also disseminated Nocardia asteroides,"
		which was documented by multiple routine blood culture samples. Nocardia
		asteroides was isolated from 15 routine blood cultures using the nonradiometric
		"blood culture system (Bactec NR-660, Becton Dickinson, Towson, Md). Several"
		different species of the genus Nocardia proved to thrive in blood culture bottles
		(Bactec) when experimental inoculations were performed. The paucity of reports in
		the literature of disseminated nocardiosis with positive blood cultures has led
		us to consider cause for the apparent poor recovery of these organisms from blood
		culture media. We suggest that the media (Bactec) can successfully support growth
		"of Nocardia species and that other variables, such as incubation times and"
		"subculture, should be considered to optimize isolation of this pathogen in blood"
		culture systems.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Opportunistic infections, while well studied in the AIDS population,"
		"continue to have variable and surprising presentations. Here, we present a case"
		of disseminated histoplasmosis with disseminated nontuberculous mycobacterial
		infection in a 50 year old man with long standing AIDS living in a non-endemic
		"area. CASE PRESENTATION: Patient presented with a constellation of symptoms, and"
		"imaging of the chest showed a pulmonary mass with cavitation, multiple nodules,"
		and ground glass opacities. Further investigations revealed granulomatous lung
		"nodules and fungemia consistent with Histoplasma capsulatum, and coinfection with"
		disseminated nontuberculous mycobateria in a nonendemic area. CONCLUSIONS:
		Immunocompromised patients risk co-inhabitation by multiple infectious organisms.
		Some of these organisms may preside in the host for years prior to reactivation.
		Clinicians in non endemic areas should therefore be careful to not overlook
		specific organisms based on a lack of a recent travel history. Physicians in
		nonendemic areas should become more familiar with the clinical findings and
		"diagnostic approach of infectious such as Histoplasmosis, to ensure earlier"
		recognition and treatment in immunocompromised individuals.

PG	-	224-228
LID	-	10.1007/s12328-018-0817-9 [doi]
AB	-	Gastrointestinal histoplasmosis is common in patients with disseminated disease
		"affecting both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. However, it is"
		often unrecognized due to a lack of specific signs and symptoms. It has only
		"rarely been reported to cause small bowel obstruction, during which surgical"
		treatment was nearly always necessary. Little is known about the usefulness of
		endoscopic therapy in gastrointestinal histoplasmosis associated strictures. We
		report the case of a 32-year-old man with a history of hyperimmunoglobulin M
		syndrome who presented with small bowel obstruction secondary to disseminated
		gastrointestinal histoplasmosis. Treatment was successful with a
		through-the-scope balloon dilator in combination with medical therapy. This
		report adds to the limited data available on the benefit of endoscopic therapy in
		"infectious strictures, particularly gastrointestinal histoplasmosis."

AB	-	We report the case of a patient with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) on etanercept who
		presented with panniculitis and focal myositis as manifestations of disseminated
		histoplasmosis. Systematic search of the literature showed 11 additional case
		reports of disseminated histoplasmosis with tumour necrosis factor-alpha
		"(TNFalpha) blockade therapy (infliximab, n = 8; etanercept, n = 3). Although"
		disseminated histoplasmosis may manifest with classical symptoms of fever and
		"respiratory complaints, it may also present atypically, such as with panniculitis"
		and focal myositis. This review illustrates and emphasizes the importance of
		"being highly suspicious for infection, including by opportunistic organisms, and"
		to exclude such process in patients treated with a TNFalpha inhibitor when faced
		"with unusual complications, even when an alternative aetiology appears plausible."

TI	-	Disseminated histoplasmosis causing reversible gaze palsy and optic neuropathy.
PG	-	140-3
AB	-	Subacute disseminated histoplasmosis is an uncommon entity. Typical
		neuro-ophthalmologic manifestations are usually secondary to histoplasmomas or
		encephalitis. A 45-year-old man noted blurred vision while receiving empiric
		antituberculosis therapy for fever and diffuse granulomatous disease of unknown
		"origin. Vertical-gaze palsy, right horizontal-gaze paresis, and mild right optic"
		neuropathy were found on neuro-ophthalmologic examination. Further questioning
		revealed a history of frequent contact with fighting cocks from South America.
		"Magnetic resonance images were consistent with multiple hemorrhagic infarcts,"
		"areas of inflammation, or both, and cerebral angiography showed changes"
		consistent with vasculitis. A previously obtained biopsy specimen from the
		duodenum was restained and found to be positive for fungal elements. Serum
		antigen titers for Histoplasma capsulatum demonstrated evidence of active
		infection. This case is a rare example of a supranuclear ocular motility
		disturbance and optic neuropathy secondary to an occlusive vascular process in a
		patient with subacute disseminated histoplasmosis.

TI	-	HISTOPLASMOSIS MYOSITIS: A CASE REPORT AND LITERATURE REVIEW.
PG	-	738-42
AB	-	Disseminated histoplasmosis is an AIDS-defining illness that can affect multiple
		organ systems. Myositis due to histoplasmosis is rare in HIV infected patients.
		We report here an HIV-infected patient who presented with myositis caused by
		Histoplasma capsulatum. Her HIV was under poor control and her CD4 cell count was
		only 11 cells/mm3. She responded well to treatment but later succumbed to another
		opportunistic infection. The literature on disseminated histoplasmosis is
		reviewed.

TI	-	Localised oral histoplasmosis lesions associated with HIV infection.
PG	-	294-6
AB	-	Opportunistic fungal infections account for a significant amount of morbidity
		associated with HIV disease. We report here a case of localised oral
		histoplasmosis without evidence of disseminated disease in a patient who lacked
		stigmata of HIV disease at the time of initial presentation. The diagnosis is
		"based on histology with special stains, complement fixing antibodies in serum,"
		and culture of the organism from fresh tissues. Activation of subclinical disease
		following an infection in Uganda may explain the development of these exophytic
		oral lesions in this British resident.

		Tumor Necrosis Factor Inhibitors.
PG	-	597-603
LID	-	10.1002/art.39468 [doi]
AB	-	"OBJECTIVE: To identify predictors of the receipt of medical care, including the"
		"receipt of pre-drug screening, for diagnostically targeted fungal or"
		mycobacterial infections among patients prescribed a tumor necrosis factor
		inhibitor (TNFi). METHODS: We conducted a case-control study using deidentified
		patient health claims information from a data set representing a commercially
		"insured US population of 15 million patients annually from January 1, 2007 to"
		"December 31, 2009. Descriptive statistics as well as a 2-sample t-test,"
		"chi-square test of association, Fisher's exact test, and multivariate logistic"
		"regression were used for data analysis. RESULTS: A total of 30,772 patients"
		"received a TNFi during the study period. Of these, 158 patients (0.51%) developed"
		targeted fungal and/or mycobacterial infections (cases). The median number of
		infections per case was 1.0 (interquartile range 1.0-2.0). Tuberculosis was
		"diagnosed in 61% of cases, followed by histoplasmosis in 60%, nontuberculous"
		"mycobacterial infections in 11%, coccidioidomycosis in 10%, unspecified fungal"
		"infection in 8%, blastomycosis in 4%, cryptococcal infection in 3%, and"
		"pneumocystosis in 2%. Compared to controls (n = 474), a higher proportion of"
		cases were prescribed prednisone (55% versus 37%; P < 0.001). Patients who were
		prescribed prednisone during the study period were twice as likely as those not
		taking prednisone to seek medical care attributable to a targeted fungal or
		mycobacterial infection (odds ratio 2.03; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Development of
		a targeted fungal or mycobacterial infection among patients taking a TNFi is
		rare. Concomitant use of prednisone predicted development of such infections.

PG	-	760-3
AB	-	The authors report a case of ulcerative colitis due to Histoplasma capsulatum in
		a previously healthy 35 year-old french geologist with acquired immune deficiency
		syndrome (AIDS). Gomori-Grocott and PAS stains and indirect immunofluorescence
		revealed Histoplasma capsulatum in colonic biopsies. The search for LAV antibody
		was positive. T-lymphocyte analysis revealed 10/mm3 OKT4 with OKT4/OKT8 ratio of
		0.16. Histoplasmosis should be considered in subjects with ulcerative colitis
		according to the epidemiological context. In patients with AIDS relapses after
		discontinuation of treatment are to be expected and suppressive therapy with an
		imidazole derivative should probably be continued indefinitely.

PG	-	85-9
AB	-	"The fungus Histoplasma capsulatum causes histoplasmosis, the most common endemic"
		respiratory mycosis in the United States. Disseminated histoplasmosis in adults
		"is often associated with immunosuppression, such as occurs in HIV infection. We"
		report a case of oral histoplasmosis in an HIV-seropositive patient who presented
		"with an ulceration on the left tip of the tongue, extending to the floor of the"
		"mouth, but was otherwise free of any active systemic disease. Histoplasma"
		"capsulatum was shown, by both histopathology and staining with a fluorescent"
		"antibody reagent specific for the organism, to be present in the lesion and was"
		deduced to be the causative organism.

		study.
PG	-	207-22
AB	-	"A pair-matched, case-control design was used to study exposure to Histoplasma"
		"capsulatum and other environmental factors, and to determine various host"
		characteristics including human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typings in 94 young
		patients with macular choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and in 94 controls with
		other eye diseases. Patients with two types of retinal patterns were studied:
		"Type I, or those with CNV with one or no chorioretinal atrophic spots in the"
		"posterior pole or periphery (n = 51), and Type II, or those with CNV and 2 or"
		more chorioretinal atrophic spots (n = 43). Our purpose was to explore whether
		these two variants of idiopathic CNV have different and distinguishable
		epidemiologies which may or may not be related to prior exposure to Histoplasma.
		We found that histoplasmin skin tests were negative in all but two Type I cases.
		The combination of the HLA-B7 and HLA-DR2 markers (but not either marker alone)
		"was significantly increased in Type I cases. Among Type II cases, HLA-B7,"
		"HLA-DR2, HLA-DQ1, a positive histoplasmin skin test, myopic refractive error,"
		"prior residence in a histoplasmosis endemic area, occupations involving exposure"
		"to animals, and hypertension were all significantly increased. Histoplasmin skin"
		test responses were positive in 18 Type II cases (45%). In the multivariate
		"analysis, only DR2 and the combined presence of DQ1 and a positive histoplasmin"
		skin test remained predictive of Type II disease. Our findings suggest that
		"histoplasmin sensitivity is associated with some, but not all, cases of Type II"
		"disease. However, histoplasmin sensitivity appears to have no relationship to"
		"Type I disease. HLA factors may play a role in both disease types, possibly by"
		producing a modified immune response to Histoplasma and/or other unidentified
		agents.

		"digestive lesions have been found in African patients, there is no available data"
		on the incidence of gastric ulcer as a presenting sign of the disease.

		"refractive surgery, who consulted due to a metamorphopsia and decrease in visual"
		acuity in the right eye. A presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome (POHS) and a
		subfoveal choroidal neovascular membrane were observed in the fundoscopy. Two
		"monthly doses of intravitreal bevacizumab were given after the labour, but the"
		third dose was never inyected as the patient became pregnant again. She
		subsequently had a spontaneous miscarriage. DISCUSSION: Treatment with
		intravitreal bevacizumab during pregnancy is controversial as it may increase the
		risk of miscarriage during the first trimester.

		report.
PG	-	101-5
AB	-	"Amongst the main opportunistic diseases that affect the HIV-positive patient,"
		histoplasmosis is found. This systemic mycosis caused by the fungus Histoplasma
		capsulatum has the capacity to disseminate from the lung to the skin and oral
		mucosa. Oral lesions of histoplasmosis can be found with ulcerated or nodular
		"aspect, being always very painful and infiltrating the mucosa. When they are"
		"present in the mouth, they strongly indicate the presence of some kind of"
		immunosuppression. This study shows the disease's evolution in an HIV-positive
		"patient, who presented several ulcerated lesions in the oral cavity and facial"
		skin. The symptomatology and clinical aspects of the lesions were not specific
		"for the disease, and due to this, the diagnosis was obtained by cytological smear"
		and oral biopsy. The results of the exams defined the disseminated picture of the
		infection. The treatment plan involved the use of amphotericin B for the lesions'
		"remission, and, following this, itraconazole was administered in the maintenance"
		phase.

AB	-	"Due to limited access to more powerful diagnostic tools, there are few data on"
		"the burden of fungal infections in Côte d'Ivoire, despite a high HIV and TB"
		burden and many cutaneous diseases. Here we estimate the burden of serious fungal
		infections in this sub-Saharan country with a health profiling description.
		National demographics were used and PubMed searches to retrieve all published
		articles on fungal infections in Côte d'Ivoire and other bordering countries in
		"West Africa. When no data existed, risk populations were used to estimate"
		"frequencies of fungal infections, using previously described methodology by LIFE"
		(www.LIFE-Worldwide.org). The population of Côte d'Ivoire is around 25 million;
		"37% are children (≤14 years), and 9% are>65 years. Tinea capitis in children is"
		"common, measured at 13.9% in 2013. Considering the prevalence of HIV infection"
		"(2.6% of the population, a total of ∼500,000) and a hospital incidence of 12.7%"
		"of cryptococcosis, it is estimated that 4590 patients per year develop"
		"cryptococcosis. For pneumocystosis, it is suggested that 2640 new cases occur"
		"each year with the prevalence of 11% of newly diagnosed HIV adults, and 33% of"
		children with HIV/AIDS. Disseminated histoplasmosis is estimated a 1.4% of
		advanced HIV disease - 513 cases. An estimated 6568 news cases of chronic
		pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) occur after pulmonary tuberculosis (a 5-year
		"prevalence of 6568 cases [26/100,000]). Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis"
		(ABPA) and severe asthma with fungal sensitisation (SAFS) were estimated in
		"104/100,000 and 151/100,000 respectively, in 1,152,178 adult asthmatics."
		Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is common and recurrent VVC affects ∼6% of women
		"in their fertile years - 421,936 women. An unknown number develop candidaemia and"
		invasive aspergillosis. The annual incidence of fungal keratitis is estimated at
		"3350. No cases of sporotrichosis, mucormycosis and chromoblastomycosis are"
		"described, although some cases of mycetoma and Conidiobolus infection have been"
		reported. This study indicates that around to 7.25% (1.8 million) of the
		"population is affected by a serious fungal infection, predominently tinea capitis"
		in children and rVVC in women. These data should be used to inform
		"epidemiological studies, diagnostic needs and therapeutic strategies in Côte"
		d'Ivoire.

TI	-	[Gastrointestinal histoplasmosis: an atypical presentation].
PG	-	31-5
AB	-	Histoplasmosis is a systemic mycosis caused by Histoplasma capsulatum. It is an
		endemic disease in the American continent. It is spread hematogenously and any
		organ can be affected. It is more frequent in immunodeficient patients and the
		most common opportunist mycosis associated with HIV Exclusive gastrointestinal
		involvement is rare and invariably mortal without treatment. It is considered to
		be impossible to diagnose the disease based on the macroscopic aspect of lesions.
		We report a 43-year-old male in apparent good health status who was admitted with
		intermittent proctorrhagia of one year of evolution associated to burning
		"proctalgia, without any further symptoms. A videocolonoscopy (VCC) with"
		proctologic exam was conducted The patient was warned about the potential
		orificial origin of the bleeding and the importance of screening for colorectal
		neoplasia. The proctologic exam revealed internal congestive hemorrhoids. VCC
		showed during the routine exploration of the terminal ileon lesions both in that
		"level and rectum, although of a different morphology. The colon had normal"
		endoscopic appearance. Biopsies of both lesions identified Histoplasma. Later
		studies diagnosed HIV/AIDS and the patient was referred to the infectology
		department to complete diagnostic tests and begin treatment of both diseases. In
		"conclusion, we present an atypical case of this mycosis because of its exclusive"
		"gastrointestinal allocation, in anasymptomatic patient, in apparent good health,"
		"with unknown HIV/AIDS, who was admitted because of a proctorrhagia of orificial"
		"origin. Endoscopic biopsies of lesions of different morphologies, located in the"
		"terminal ileon and rectum, allowed the diagnosis of this disease, that had no"
		clinical expression. This casual endoscopic diagnosis enabled to change the life
		expectancy of the patient. We consider that the described endoscopic lesions in
		rectum are of a particular morphology and can rarely be found in other
		pathologies. The diffusion of these images could warn other endoscopists of these
		phenomena.

TI	-	Intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor for choroidal
		neovascularization in ocular histoplasmosis.
PG	-	24-9
LID	-	10.1097/ICB.0b013e3182a48bcc [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: To report eight cases of long-term successful treatment of choroidal
		neovascularization because of ocular histoplasmosis syndrome with intravitreal
		anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents. METHODS: Retrospective case
		series. This article reviewed the course of eight eyes in seven patients who
		underwent intravitreal injection of bevacizumab and/or ranibizumab for treatment
		of choroidal neovascularization secondary to ocular histoplasmosis syndrome.
		Outcomes were assessed using pre- and post-anti-vascular endothelial growth
		factor visual acuities. RESULTS: Eight eyes in seven patients were found to have
		new ocular histoplasmosis syndrome-associated subfoveal choroidal
		"neovascularization lesions, as evidenced on clinical examination, fluorescein"
		"angiography, and optical coherence tomography. Intravitreal anti-vascular"
		endothelial growth factor injections were used as initial or early treatment with
		successful resolution of the choroidal neovascularization lesions in most cases.
		Mean visual acuity improved from 20/60 to 20/47 over an average of 121.4 weeks.
		Either bevacizumab or ranibizumab was administered with an average of 2.6
		injections per year of follow-up. Three eyes (37.5%) experienced a gain in visual
		"acuity with a mean increase of 7.7 lines, 1 eye (12.5%) experienced no change,"
		and 2 eyes (25%) experienced a loss of visual acuity of 2 or more lines. Six eyes
		(75%) were able to avoid mild visual loss (2 lines or less). CONCLUSIONS:
		Intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents may successfully
		treat or at least stabilize neovascular complications of ocular histoplasmosis
		syndrome when used as a first-line treatment.

PG	-	270-5
AB	-	Histoplasmosis is an illness which occurs very rarely in Europe and it is
		"especially rare in Germany. A generalised infection with Histoplasma capulatum, a"
		"systemic mycosis of the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS), occurs only in"
		"individuals with weakened immune systems. Within the framework of diagnostics, a"
		pathologist can be confronted with histoplasmosis since there has been an
		"increase in travel to and from endemic regions, as well as an increase in the"
		number of diseases of the immune system. The presented case reports the
		histological intravital and post-mortem diagnostics of disseminated
		histoplasmosis in existing HIV-infection in the stage of manifest AIDS.

PG	-	1155-6
AB	-	We have reported what we believe to be the first case of disseminated infection
		due to a multiply drug resistant strain of Nocardia asteroides in a patient with
		the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and concomitant disseminated
		histoplasmosis. This strain of the organism fits a pattern of susceptibility that
		is rare among N asteroides isolates in general and has been called the type 5
		"pattern, described as a resistance to broad spectrum cephalosporins,"
		"ciprofloxacin, and all aminoglycosides except amikacin. The recognition of"
		disease due to this group of organisms is especially important in patients with
		"AIDS because sulfonamides, considered the drugs of choice for treatment of N"
		"asteroides infection, are associated with a high incidence of adverse effects in"
		these patients.

TI	-	[Disseminated histoplasmosis detected by lingual and tonsillar erosions in an
		immunocompetent patient].
PG	-	709-11
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Histioplasmosis is a usually asymptomatic fungal infection. In the
		"immunocompetent patient, it leads to chronic disseminated infection. Mucosal"
		involvement is common and can provide the diagnosis. CASE REPORT: A metropolitan
		Frenchman with a history of alcoholism and smoking and living in Guyana consulted
		for lingual and tonsil erosion. Squamous cell carcinoma was suspected but not
		confirmed at pathology. The patient had a bi-apical infiltration on the chest
		x-ray and was treated empirically for tuberculosis. The diagnosis of
		histoplasmosis was reached when rare Histoplasma capsulatum were evidenced from a
		buccal swab. Itraconazole led to cure in 6 months. DISCUSSION: This case
		illustrates the importance of mucosal signs in the diagnosis of disseminated
		histoplasmosis in immunocompetent subjects. Histoplasmosis is rarely the cause of
		"active infection in immunocompetent subjects. In these patients, the fungal"
		infection generally progresses to chronic dissemination. Mucosal signs are
		frequent in this form but are rare in case of cutaneous histoplasmosis.
		Itraconazole (200 mg/d) is indicated for 6 months.

PG	-	543-552
LID	-	10.1111/myc.13075 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: The Republic of Congo (RoC) is characterised by a high prevalence of
		"tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS, which largely drive the epidemiology of serious fungal"
		infections. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to estimate the current burden of serious fungal
		"infections in RoC. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Using local, regional or global data and"
		"estimates of population and at-risk population groups, deterministic modelling"
		was employed to estimate national incidence or prevalence of the most serious
		fungal infections. RESULTS: Our study revealed that about 5.4% of the Congolese
		population (283 450) suffer from serious fungal infections yearly. The incidence
		"of cryptococcal meningitis, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia and disseminated"
		"histoplasmosis in AIDS patients was estimated at 560, 830 and 120 cases per year."
		Oral and oesophageal candidiasis collectively affects 12 320 HIV-infected
		"patients. Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis, 67% post-tuberculosis, probably has a"
		prevalence of 3420. Fungal asthma (allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and
		severe asthma with fungal sensitisation) probably has a prevalence of 3640 and
		"4800, although some overlap due to disease definition is likely. The estimated"
		prevalence of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis and tinea capitis is 85 440 and
		"178 400 respectively. Mostly related to agricultural activity, fungal keratitis"
		affects an estimated 700 Congolese yearly. CONCLUSION: These data underline the
		urgent need for an intensified awareness towards Congolese physicians to fungal
		infections and for increased efforts to improve diagnosis and management of
		fungal infections in the RoC.

TI	-	Etiology of choroidal neovascularization in young patients.
PG	-	1241-4
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is a common cause of legal
		"blindness in developed countries. In patients younger than 50 years of age, CNV"
		"can be due to various causes, but to the authors' knowledge there has been no"
		large epidemiologic study to compare the relative incidence of the various causes
		of CNV in this younger-aged group. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed
		of patients seen over a 30-month period to precisely define the relative
		incidence of the various etiologies of CNV in patients younger than 50 years of
		age who had been referred to a tertiary care ophthalmology department in western
		Europe. RESULTS: Clinical charts and angiograms of 363 patients were reviewed.
		"The etiology of CNV was high myopia in 225 (62%) patients, pseudo-presumed ocular"
		"histoplasmosis syndrome in 42 (12%), angioid streaks in 17 (5%), and"
		miscellaneous hereditary or traumatic or inflammatory disorders in 16 (4%).
		Choroidal neovascularization could not be related to any etiology in 63 (17%)
		"patients, and was considered to be idiopathic lesions. Choroidal"
		neovascularization was subfoveal in 62% of the patients due to myopia versus 30%
		to 36% in patients due to other etiologies. Laser photocoagulation was applied in
		the majority of patients due to all etiologies except myopia. CONCLUSION: These
		data provide the relative incidence of the various etiologies of CNV in young
		patients and emphasize the importance of myopia as an etiology of CNV in such
		"patients. In addition, an apparent preferential localization of CNV to the"
		subfoveal region in myopic eyes precludes its treatment with photocoagulation.

TI	-	Diagnosis of pulmonary histoplasmosis and blastomycosis by detection of antigen
		in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid using an improved second-generation enzyme-linked
		immunoassay.
PG	-	43-7
AB	-	Antigen detection is a useful adjunct for the diagnosis of histoplasmosis. The
		purpose of this study was to evaluate antigen detection in bronchoalveolar lavage
		(BAL) fluid using an improved second-generation Histoplasma antigen assay.
		Antigen was detected in 16 of 19 (84%) cases of histoplasmosis and 5 of 6 (83.3%)
		blastomycosis cases using the second-generation assay vs. 13 of 19 (68%) and 4 of
		"6 (66.7%), respectively, in the original assay. Ten-fold concentration permitted"
		detection of antigen in an additional case of histoplasmosis and another with
		"blastomycosis, for an overall sensitivity of 23 of 25 (92.0%). Specificity was"
		98.2% in both assays in controls with other pulmonary infections. These findings
		support the diagnostic utility of the second-generation assay in patients with
		pulmonary histoplasmosis and blastomycosis.

AB	-	We conducted a systematic literature review to obtain risk population-based
		fungal disease incidence or prevalence data from China. Data were categorized by
		risk factors and extrapolated by using most recent demographic figures. A total
		"of 71,316,101 cases (5.0% of the population) were attributed to 12 risk factors"
		"and 17 fungal diseases. Excluding recurrent Candida vaginitis (4,057/100,000"
		"women) and onychomycosis (2,600/100,000 persons), aspergillosis (317/100,000"
		persons) was the most common problem; prevalence exceeded that in most other
		"countries. Cryptococcal meningitis, an opportunistic infection, occurs in"
		immunocompetent persons almost twice as often as AIDS. The pattern of fungal
		infections also varies geographically; Talaromyces marneffei is distributed
		"mainly in the Pearl River Basin, and the Yangtze River bears the greatest"
		"histoplasmosis burden. New host populations, new endemic patterns, and high"
		"fungal burdens in China, which caused a huge impact on public health, underscore"
		the urgent need for building diagnostic and therapeutic capacity.

TI	-	Limited macular translocation for the management of subfoveal retinal pigment
		epithelial loss after submacular surgery.
PG	-	272-5
AB	-	PURPOSE: To report a case of subfoveal retinal pigment epithelial (retinal
		pigment epithelium) loss after submacular surgery managed successfully by limited
		macular translocation. METHODS: Case report. RESULTS: A 28-year-old woman
		presented with a visual acuity of 20/100 caused by subfoveal choroidal
		neovas-cularization secondary to ocular histoplasmosis syndrome. Submacular
		resection of the choroidal neovascularization was complicated by inadvertent
		retinal pigment epithelium loss from beneath the foveal center. She underwent
		limited macular translocation 5 days after the initial surgery and had successful
		displacement of the fovea to an area inferior to the retinal pigment epithelium
		defect. Her visual acuity was 20/60 4 months postoperatively. CONCLUSION: This
		report demonstrates the feasibility of using limited macular translocation for
		the management of eyes with central retinal pigment epithelium defect after
		submacular surgery and extends the clinical indications for limited macular
		translocation.

		retrospective analysis of 98 cases.
PG	-	409-17
LID	-	10.1093/cid/civ299 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Histoplasmosis may complicate tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α blocker
		therapy. Published case series provide limited guidance on disease management. We
		sought to determine the need for long-term antifungal therapy and the safety of
		resuming TNF-α blocker therapy after successful treatment of histoplasmosis.
		METHODS: We conducted a multicenter retrospective review of 98 patients diagnosed
		with histoplasmosis between January 2000 and June 2011. Multivariate logistic
		regression was used to evaluate risk factors for severe disease. RESULTS: The
		most commonly used biologic agent was infliximab (67.3%). Concomitant
		"corticosteroid use (odds ratio [OR], 3.94 [95% confidence interval {CI},"
		"1.06-14.60]) and higher urine Histoplasma antigen levels (OR, 1.14 [95% CI,"
		1.03-1.25]) were found to be independent predictors of severe disease. Forty-six
		(47.4%) patients were initially treated with an amphotericin B formulation for a
		median duration of 2 weeks. Azole treatment was given for a median of 12 months.
		TNF-α blocker therapy was initially discontinued in 95 of 98 (96.9%) patients and
		"later resumed in 25 of 74 (33.8%) patients at a median of 12 months (range, 1-69"
		months). The recurrence rate was 3.2% at a median follow-up period of 32 months.
		"Of the 3 patients with recurrence, 2 had restarted TNF-α blocker therapy, 1 of"
		"whom died. Mortality rate was 3.2%. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, disease outcomes"
		were generally favorable. Discontinuation of antifungal treatment after clinical
		"response and an appropriate duration of therapy, probably at least 12 months,"
		appears safe if pharmacologic immunosuppression has been held. Resumption of
		"TNF-α blocker therapy also appears safe, assuming that the initial antifungal"
		therapy was administered for 12 months.

PG	-	2483-6
AB	-	Adrenal histoplasmosis is one of the most common adrenal granulomatous infections
		in endemic areas. Although CT or MRI findings of adrenal histoplasmosis have been
		"documented, there are no reports regarding 18F-fluorodeoxyglocose (FDG) positron"
		emission tomography (PET) findings. We report a case of bilateral adrenal
		histoplasmosis showing a significantly high uptake of 18F-fluorodeoxyglocose on
		PET study. Adrenal histoplasmosis should be considered as one of the differential
		"diagnoses in cases of adrenal tumors with intense FDG uptake, even in non-endemic"
		areas.

AB	-	We describe an original case of disseminated infection with Histoplasma
		capsulatum (Hc) var. duboisii in an African patient with AIDS who migrated to
		Switzerland. The diagnosis of histoplasmosis was suggested using direct
		examination of tissues and confirmed in 24 h with a panfungal polymerase chain
		reaction assay. The variety duboisii of Hc was established using DNA sequencing
		of the polymorphic genomic region OLE. Molecular tools allow diagnosis of
		"histoplasmosis in 24 h, which is drastically shorter than culture procedures."

TI	-	Estimated burden of fungal infections in Sweden.
PG	-	1043-1048
LID	-	10.1111/myc.12981 [doi]
AB	-	The aim of this study was to estimate the annual burden of fungal infections in
		Sweden using data mainly from 2016. Data on specific populations were obtained
		from Swedish national data registries. Annual incidence and prevalence of fungal
		disease was calculated based on epidemiological studies. Data on infections due
		"to Cryptococcus sp., Mucorales, Histoplasma capsulatum, Coccidioides immitis and"
		Pneumocystis jirovecii were retrieved from Karolinska University Laboratory and
		"covers only 25% of Swedish population. In 2016, the population of Sweden was"
		9 995 153 (49.8% female). The overall burden of fungal infections was 1 713 385
		(17 142/100 000). Superficial fungal infections affect 1 429 307 people
		(1429/100 000) based on Global Burden of Disease 14.3% prevalence. Total serious
		fungal infection burden was 284 174 (2843/100 000) in 2016. Recurrent Candida
		vulvovaginitis is common; assuming a 6% prevalence in women. Prevalence of
		allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and severe asthma with fungal
		"sensitisation were estimated to be 20 095 and 26 387, respectively. Similarly,"
		chronic pulmonary aspergillosis was estimated to affect 490 patients after
		"tuberculosis, sarcoidosis and other conditions. Candidemia incidence was"
		estimated to be 500 in 2016 (4.7/100 000) and invasive aspergillosis 295
		"(3.0/100 000). In Stockholm area, Mucorales were reported in three patients in"
		"2015, while Cryptococcus spp. were reported in two patients. In 2016, there were"
		297 patients PCR positive for P jirovecii. The present study shows that the
		overall burden of fungal infections in Sweden is high and affects 17% of the
		"population. The morbidity, mortality and the healthcare-related costs due to"
		fungal infections warrant further studies.

TI	-	Salvage treatment of histoplasmosis with posaconazole.
PG	-	319-27
AB	-	Six patients received salvage treatment with posaconazole oral suspension (800
		mg/day in divided doses) for severe forms of histoplasmosis. One patient had
		pulmonary disease and 5 had disseminated disease. Previous antifungal therapy
		"consisted of amphotericin B, itraconazole, fluconazole, or voriconazole."
		Posaconazole treatment duration for individual patients ranged from 6 weeks to 34
		weeks. All patients had successful clinical outcomes with significant clinical
		improvements noted during the first month of therapy. Although the number of
		"patients evaluated in this case series is small, the findings are encouraging and"
		provide preliminary evidence that posaconazole may be a useful salvage treatment
		option for histoplasmosis involving a variety of infected tissues and organs.

AB	-	A 41-year-old man left for Mexico in May 2015. Right pulmonary nodule was
		"detected at a health examination in May 2016, and he subsequently showed headache"
		and slight fever. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the brain
		"revealed basilar meningitis, so he was admitted to our hospital. We considered"
		imported mycosis due to his travel history to Mexico. We diagnosed histoplasmosis
		based on the presence of antibodies against Histoplasma in both serum and
		cerebrospinal fluid. Symptoms almost completely recovered with a liposomal
		formulation of amphotericin B. Central nervous system histoplasmosis is very rare
		"in Japan. Immunocompetent hosts can develop histoplasmosis, and this pathology is"
		important to consider in patients presenting with basilar meningitis and a
		positive travel history.

AB	-	Concurrent Pneumocystis jirovecii (PJ) and pulmonary histoplasmosis (PHP) are
		rare in a single HIV individual. We present a challenging case of concomitant PJ
		and PHP in a young HIV individual. A 44-year-old man presented to the emergency
		department with progressive pulmonary symptoms. He was hypoxic with bilateral
		pulmonary opacities on chest radiograph. CT of the chest showed a geographical
		pattern of ground-glass attenuation. He started receiving intravenous antibiotics
		in addition to oral Bactrim for suspected PJ. He also began receiving
		"itraconazole, given suspected PHP with recent bat-droppings exposure. HIV test"
		"was positive, though history was negative; the CD4 count was 5 cells/mm(3) Later,"
		he developed respiratory failure without clinical improvement. First
		bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) failed to confirm opportunistic pathogens. Repeat
		"BAL revealed PJ but no Histoplasma. Histoplasma antigens were positive,"
		confirming histoplasmosis. The patient died despite aggressive treatment with
		intravenous Bactrim and amphotericin B.

		Exchange-Facilitated Decision Support: A Controlled Before-and-After Trial.
PG	-	401-410
LID	-	10.1177/0033354920914318 [doi]
AB	-	"OBJECTIVE: Outbreak detection and disease control may be improved by simplified,"
		semi-automated reporting of notifiable diseases to public health authorities. The
		"objective of this study was to determine the effect of an electronic,"
		prepopulated notifiable disease report form on case reporting rates by ambulatory
		care clinics to public health authorities. METHODS: We conducted a 2-year
		(2012-2014) controlled before-and-after trial of a health information exchange
		(HIE) intervention in Indiana designed to prepopulate notifiable disease
		reporting forms to providers. We analyzed data collected from electronic
		"prepopulated reports and ""usual care"" (paper, fax) reports submitted to a local"
		health department for 7 conditions by using a difference-in-differences model.
		"Primary outcomes were changes in reporting rates, completeness, and timeliness"
		between intervention and control clinics. RESULTS: Provider reporting rates for
		chlamydia and gonorrhea in intervention clinics increased significantly from
		"56.9% and 55.6%, respectively, during the baseline period (2012) to 66.4% and"
		"58.3%, respectively, during the intervention period (2013-2014); they decreased"
		"from 28.8% and 27.5%, respectively, to 21.7% and 20.6%, respectively, in control"
		clinics (P < .001). Completeness improved from baseline to intervention for 4 of
		"15 fields in reports from intervention clinics (P < .001), although mean"
		completeness improved for 11 fields in both intervention and control clinics.
		"Timeliness improved for both intervention and control clinics; however, reports"
		"from control clinics were timelier (mean, 7.9 days) than reports from"
		"intervention clinics (mean, 9.7 days). CONCLUSIONS: Electronic, prepopulated case"
		"reporting forms integrated into providers' workflow, enabled by an HIE network,"
		can be effective in increasing notifiable disease reporting rates and
		"completeness of information. However, it was difficult to assess the effect of"
		"using the forms for diseases with low prevalence (eg, salmonellosis,"
		histoplasmosis).

		sarcoidosis by transbronchial biopsy.
PG	-	364-8
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of positive microbiologic cultures in
		patients with epithelioid granulomas and negative histochemical stains for
		microorganisms in transbronchial biopsy specimens. Secondary objectives were to
		compare the histologic features of sarcoidosis with those of infectious
		granulomas and to assess the reliability of histology in establishing the
		diagnosis of sarcoidosis. DESIGN: Retrospective study. Specific histologic
		features of transbronchial biopsy specimens were correlated with clinical and
		"microbiologic data, final diagnosis, and an estimate of the probability, on"
		"admission, that the patient had sarcoidosis. SETTING: A large, urban,"
		"tertiary-care, university-affiliated hospital. PATIENTS: Ninety-two adult"
		"patients in whom epithelioid granulomas, negative for microorganisms on"
		"Ziehl-Neelsen and Gomori methemaine silver stain, were found in transbronchial"
		biopsy specimens. Patients were identified through a search of surgical pathology
		files from 1975 to 1987. RESULTS: Ten patients (10.9%) had mycobacterial or
		"fungal granulomas, while 82 had sarcoidosis. In all patients with a high clinical"
		"probability of sarcoidosis, the diagnosis was confirmed. Transbronchial biopsy"
		specimens from patients with infectious granulomas had fewer granulomas (2.0 +/-
		"1.7 (SD) versus 7.1 +/- 6.6; P<.01), which involved a smaller proportion of lung"
		tissue per case (9.5 +/- 10.0% versus 26.6 +/- 24.0%; P<.01). Sarcoid granulomas
		often exhibited Schaumann bodies (69.5% versus 10%; P<.01). Necrosis tended to
		predominate in infectious granulomas (19.5 versus 40%; not significant).
		"CONCLUSIONS: Numerous granulomas, Schaumann bodies, and a high clinical"
		probability of sarcoidosis are significantly associated with that diagnosis.
		Necrosis does not exclude sarcoidosis. Clinicopathologic assessment of
		transbronchial biopsy specimens is useful in predicting the final diagnosis of
		"sarcoidosis but does not obviate the need for microbiologic cultures, which were"
		positive in 10.9% of patients in this study.

AB	-	A case of balantidial dysentery is reported in a patient infected with the HIV in
		French Guiana. This case is the first described in medical literature. The
		patient presented also a disseminated histoplasmosis. Immunosuppression probably
		favoured the evolution of asymptomatic carriage to clinical dysentery. This
		clinical case did not present any complications. Treatment with doxycycline had
		to be carried out for 20 days in order to obtain a clinical and parasitological
		cure.

PG	-	1535-1541
LID	-	10.1111/myc.13377 [doi]
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Over the years, the focus of infectious diseases in many African"
		"countries has been mainly on viral, bacterial and parasitic infections. Serious"
		fungal infections (SFIs) with comparable morbidity rate in these countries remain
		neglected. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the burden of SFI in Togo and to stimulate
		efforts for improved attention. METHODS: Literature was thoroughly searched for
		epidemiological data on SFI in Togo. Incidence and/or prevalence of SFI was
		"estimated using socio-demographics, health system's information, risk-groups data"
		and SFI rates obtained from national and international studies. RESULTS: About
		"5.29% of the 7,265,286 Togolese population is estimated to suffer from SFI"
		"annually. Among HIV patients, 1,342, 1,650 and 330 may develop cryptococcal"
		"meningitis, Pneumocystis pneumonia and disseminated histoplasmosis respectively"
		"per year. Oral and oesophageal candidiasis may annually affect 19,800 and 7,535"
		"persons, respectively, living with HIV. Estimated incidence of invasive"
		aspergillosis (IA) was 283 cases. Prevalence of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis
		(CPA) was estimated at 191 cases. The annual incidence of allergic
		bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) and severe asthma with fungal sensitization
		"(SAFS) was 4,577 and 6,042 cases, respectively. Tinea capitis and recurrent"
		"Candida vaginitis presumably affect 232,271 children and 108,979 women"
		"respectively. Candidaemia incidence is estimated at 5 cases per 100, 000"
		inhabitants and fungal keratitis may affect 981 persons annually. CONCLUSIONS:
		SFIs in Togo are probably more significant than expected. These findings
		"underscore the need to increase awareness among healthcare professionals, enhance"
		diagnostic and therapeutic capacities and intensify epidemiological studies for
		effective management of fungal infections in Togo.

		study.
PG	-	1044-1052
LID	-	10.1093/mmy/myaa018 [doi]
AB	-	"Fungal infections cause substantial morbidity and mortality. However, the burden"
		of deep fungal infections is not well described in Uganda. We aimed to estimate
		the burden and etiology of histologically diagnosed deep fungal infections in
		Uganda. We retrospectively reviewed histology reports at the Pathology Reference
		"Laboratory, Department of Pathology, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda from"
		January 1950 to September 2019 to identify any reports that had a fungal
		"infection as the diagnosis. Over the study period, 697 cases of deep fungal"
		"infections were identified with an average incidence of 0.73/100,000 persons per"
		decade. There was a general decline in the number of cases detected. Median age
		of the cases was 28 years (IQR: 11-40) and majority (59%) were male. The age
		group of 0-10 years were the most affected. The foot was the most affected part
		"of the body (26%). Deep mycoses identified include eumycetoma (32%), subcutaneous"
		"phycomycosis (26%), histoplasmosis (9.2%), chromoblastomycosis (4.6%),"
		"aspergillosis (3.3%), cryptococcosis (3.3%), blastomycosis (1.6%), subcutaneous"
		"mycosis (1.4%), dermatomycosis (1.3%), coccidioidomycosis (0.6%), mucormycosis"
		"(0.6%), and sporotrichosis (0.1%). Histoplasma was the commonest causative agent"
		"(9.2%) followed by Aspergillus (3.4%) and Cryptococcus (3.3%), while 81% of the"
		fungal pathogens were not identified to genus/species level. Only 31% of the
		cases were diagnosed clinically as deep fungal infections. There is a substantial
		burden of deep fungal infections caused by multiple fungal pathogens in Uganda.
		There is need to build local capacity for mycology so as to improve on the index
		of clinical suspicion and diagnostic capabilities.

TI	-	Systemic salmonellosis in patients with disseminated histoplasmosis. Case for
		'macrophage blockade' caused by Histoplasma capsulatum.
PG	-	561-4
AB	-	Five patients are described with disseminated histoplasmosis and systemic
		salmonellosis. Four of these patients were also immunocompromised because of the
		acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in two patients and renal transplantation in
		another two patients. Histologic studies in two patients showed histiocytes that
		were heavily laden with Histoplasma capsulatum yeast-phase organisms. We
		postulate that diffuse parasitization of the reticuloendothelial system (RES) by
		"Histoplasma organisms may cause ""RES blockade,"" which then predisposes to"
		"systemic salmonellosis, as reported in certain other infections and in sickle"
		cell anemia.

AB	-	"Histoplasmosis has rarely been reported in Taiwan, and its clinical"
		manifestations may be similar to those of tuberculosis. With increasing
		"international travel, physicians need to be aware of the possibility of this"

		infection who have traveled to endemic areas. A 55-year-old Chinese male from
		Burma presented with concurrent histoplasmosis and tuberculous meningitis as the

		"altered mentation, pancytopenia, splenomegaly and marked elevations of serum"
		lactate dehydrogenase (3601 U/L) and ferritin (>10(6) ng/mL) were noted. Despite
		"treatment with amphotericin B and antituberculous therapy, the patient died on"
		the 25th day of hospitalization. This case illustrates the complexity and
		challenges of management of opportunistic infections in travelers returning from
		Southeast Asia who are in the advanced stage of HIV infection.

AB	-	"Hypercalcemia is a common laboratory finding in patients with malignancy, as well"
		as with granulomatous disease. We report the case of a 75-year-old man with
		"multiple myeloma (MM) who presented with generalized weakness, fever, and"
		intractable hypercalcemia. The hypercalcemia proved difficult to treat despite
		"well-controlled MM, as well as adequate use of bisphosphonates and calcitonin."
		Biopsy of sub-centimeter mesenteric adenopathy was significant for Histoplasma
		"capsulatum and negative for malignancy, suggesting disseminated gastrointestinal"
		histoplasmosis as the sole etiology for uncontrolled hypercalcemia. He was
		successfully treated with voriconazole. Disseminated histoplasmosis can be fatal
		if left untreated and warrants vigilance of non-malignant etiologies of
		"hypercalcemia. While hypercalcemia is a common clinical manifestation of MM, our"
		patient is an exemplar of maintaining a broader differential diagnosis in
		immunocompromised hosts.

TI	-	Surgical management of subfoveal choroidal neovascularization.
PG	-	952-68; discussion 975-6
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV) usually is associated
		with a poor visual prognosis. Laser photocoagulation of certain subfoveal
		membranes secondary to age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) appears preferable
		to observation based on recent Macular Photocoagulation Study (MPS) findings but
		is associated with decreased vision. The authors explored the use of
		vitreoretinal surgical techniques as an alternative method of eradicating
		"subfoveal CNV. METHODS: After vitrectomy, a small retinotomy technique was used"
		to extract or disconnect from the choroidal circulation subfoveal CNV in 58 eyes.
		"There were 33 eyes with ARMD, 20 eyes with presumed ocular histoplasmosis, and 5"
		eyes with miscellaneous etiologies. Five eyes also received subfoveal RPE
		"patches. RESULTS: With limited follow-up, significant improvement in vision"
		(defined as 2 Snellen lines) was achieved in 7 of 22 eyes with ARMD CNV removal
		"(1 eye 20/20), 0 of 4 eyes with ARMD CNV removal and RPE patches, and 1 of 7 eyes"
		with ARMD CNV disconnection. Significant improvement was achieved in 6 of 16 eyes
		with presumed ocular histoplasmosis removal and 0 of 4 eyes with presumed ocular
		"histoplasmosis CNV disconnection. In 5 eyes with miscellaneous CNV, 2 improved"
		(20/20 and 20/40). CNV recurred in 29%. CONCLUSIONS: Some patients with subfoveal
		CNV appear to benefit from surgical removal. Only rarely do eyes with ARMD
		improve. Longer-term follow-up and refined case selection are required before
		this approach can be widely recommended.

AB	-	The authors report the case of a 45-year-old HIV and HTLV1 antibody positive male
		patient form French West-Indies who was infected by disseminated histoplasmosis
		presenting as acute diarrhea. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed gastric mass
		and colonoscopy patchy erythematous mucosa. The diagnosis was made by histology

PG	-	421-8
AB	-	PURPOSE: To report the feasibility and safety profile of 2-mg and 6-mg
		fluocinolone acetonide implants after long-term follow-up in eyes with choroidal
		"neovascularization (CNV). DESIGN: Prospective, noncomparative, interventional"
		case series of patients with non-age-related subfoveal choroidal
		neovascularization enrolled in a compassionate use protocol. METHODS: Sustained
		drug delivery devices containing either 2 mg (eight eyes) or 6 mg (six eyes) of
		fluocinolone acetonide were implanted through the pars plana into the vitreous
		"cavity of 14 patients with predominantly classic, subfoveal CNV. The main outcome"
		measures were complications related to the device. Secondary outcome measures
		"were involution of established CNV, inhibition of recurrent CNV, and visual"
		"acuity. RESULTS: Patients had a diagnosis of ocular histoplasmosis (seven),"
		"myopic degeneration (four), angioid streaks (two), and punctate inner"
		"choroidopathy (one). Patients were followed for an average of 33 months (range,"
		16 to 40 months). All 14 eyes developed elevated intraocular pressure and
		cataract. Four eyes developed nonischemic central retinal vein occlusion.
		Complications required implant removal in 8 eyes. Ten of 14 eyes demonstrated
		involution of CNV or inhibition of recurrent CNV. Ten eyes had stable or improved
		visual acuity. Median initial visual acuity was 20/64. Median final visual acuity
		was 20/40. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term follow-up demonstrates a significant
		complication rate with the sustained release of high-dose intraocular
		"corticosteroids. The complications are treatable, and eyes can retain good"
		vision. This therapeutic approach warrants further study to identify if lower
		doses of corticosteroids may reduce the complication rate yet still be effective
		in treating ocular disease.

LID	-	10.1097/IAE.0b013e3181babdf1 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of intravitreal
		bevacizumab for choroidal neovascularization resulting from presumed ocular
		histoplasmosis syndrome. METHODS: This is a chart review of retrospective
		consecutive case series in which intravitreal bevacizumab (1.25 mg) was injected
		into 24 eyes with choroidal neovascularization resulting from presumed ocular
		histoplasmosis syndrome. Visual acuity was measured in all patients. Optical
		coherence tomography and/or fluorescein angiography was performed before and
		after treatment. The minimum follow-up time was 3 months. Retreatment criteria
		included failure to improve visual acuity and/or persistent leakage as determined
		by optical coherence tomography or fluorescein angiography. RESULTS: Patients'
		"mean age was 43.08 years (standard deviation, 13.58 years) and mean follow-up was"
		"31.8 weeks (standard deviation, 20.79 weeks). The average number of bevacizumab"
		"injections was 6.8 injections/year. After 3 months, visual acuity improved from"
		mean logMAR 0.76 +/- 0.48 (Snellen equivalent of 20/114) to mean logMAR 0.45 +/-
		"0.47 (Snellen equivalent of 20/55) (P < 0.001, paired t test; n = 24). After 12"
		"months, visual acuity improved from mean logMAR 0.86 +/- 0.35 (Snellen equivalent"
		"of 20/150) to mean logMAR 0.34 +/- 0.33 (Snellen equivalent of 20/45) (P = 0.006,"
		paired t test; n = 9). Fourteen (58.3%) eyes had final visual acuity of 20/40 or
		"better compared with 5 (20.8%) eyes at baseline (P = 0.003, McNemar test). Ten"
		patients (41.6%) had visual acuity of 20/200 or worse at baseline compared with 5
		"(20.8%) eyes at the final visit (P = 0.059, McNemar test). CONCLUSION:"
		Intravitreal injection of bevacizumab seems to be an effective treatment for
		choroidal neovascularization resulting from presumed ocular histoplasmosis
		syndrome.

AB	-	"Histoplasmosis is a systemic fungal infection caused by Histoplasma capsulatum, a"
		dimorphic fungus that spreads commonly by contamination of soil with bird and bat
		droppings. The infection remains latent in most patients until manifested by
		"reduced immune status, for example, HIV/AIDS, corticosteroid/immunosuppressive"
		therapy or in solid organ transplant recipients. Tuberculosis and histoplasmosis
		may cooccur rarely in HIV and the clinical resemblance of both diseases may
		"hinder identification of patients' harbouring dual infection, especially in"
		regions non-endemic for histoplasmosis. We report a case of disseminated
		histoplasmosis with disseminated tuberculosis in an incidentally detected patient
		with HIV-positive who presented with reports of fever and skin rash for 10 days.
		The Mantoux positivity and CT of chest and abdomen revealing multiple necrotic
		lymph nodes coupled with bone marrow and skin biopsy divulging histoplasmosis and
		tuberculosis helped us clinch the concurrent infection.

		associated with presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome.
PG	-	1873-5
AB	-	PURPOSE: To report a case of juxtafoveal choroidal neovascularization in a
		patient with presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome (POHS) who was treated with
		intravitreal injection of bevacizumab (Avastin) as initial treatment. METHODS: A
		23-year-old woman with POHS presented with sudden dimness of vision and
		"metamorphopsia in the right eye. The patient was examined with ophthalmoscopy,"
		"fluorescein angiography, and optical coherence tomography (OCT). RESULTS: Fundus"
		"examination, fluorescein angiography, and OCT of the right eye revealed a"
		juxtafoveal choroidal neovascularization. Intravitreal injection of bevacizumab
		was performed with a postoperative improvement of visual acuity and resolution of
		the distortion. CONCLUSIONS: This case report describes a case of juxtafoveal
		choroidal neovascularization associated with POHS that responded remarkably well
		to intravitreal injection of bevacizumab.

AB	-	PURPOSE: To report the clinical course of four women treated with intravitreal
		bevacizumab during pregnancy. METHODS: Observational case series. RESULTS: Four
		pregnant women were treated with intravitreal bevacizumab for choroidal
		neovascularization (CNV) because of presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome
		"punctate inner choroidopathy, or sarcoid uveitis. Patients received a mean of 2.6"
		"± 2.3 injections (range, 1-6 injections) while pregnant. One patient was treated"
		with five additional injections while breastfeeding. The mean follow-up duration
		"after the most recent injection was 14 ± 2.9 months (range, 11-18 months)."
		Snellen visual acuity improved in all 4 patients with a mean of 5.75 ± 2.2 lines
		"(range, 3-8 lines). At the most recent follow-up, all patients had involuted CNV"
		that did not require additional treatment. All patients had an uneventful
		prenatal course and delivered healthy full-term infants. All children have
		"remained healthy, exhibiting normal development and growth during infancy."
		CONCLUSION: Offering pregnant patients intravitreal bevacizumab therapy during
		pregnancy for off-label ocular indications can result in significant visual
		improvement. No adverse events related to treatment occurred in any patient
		included in this study. Additional studies with more patients and longer
		follow-up duration are required to identify any risks associated with treatment.

AB	-	Histoplasmosis in Africa is caused by Histoplasma capsulatum var duboisii (Hcd)
		and/or Histoplasma capsulatum var capsulatum (Hcc)[1]. It occurs predominantly in
		immunocompetent patients as localized disease and less commonly in HIV positive
		patients as disseminated disease [2]. The most significant risk factor for
		histoplasmosis in Africa is HIV [3]. Histoplasmosis is often mis-diagnosed and
		treated empirically as tuberculosis (TB) in HIV patients in TB endemic areas
		"[2,3]. The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has not been"
		associated with a significant decline in the incidence of histoplasmosis globally
		thus underscoring the importance of diagnosing this treatable condition in
		endemic regions [4]. We report a case of disseminated histoplasmosis in an AIDS
		patient with good clinical response to antifungal therapy but failure of immune
		reconstititution with HAART.

PG	-	207-13
AB	-	Report of a new American histoplasmosis caused by Histoplasma capsulatum in a
		"young adult Haitian, and review of the digestive disorders as reported in the"
		"previous medical papers. In the present case, the first localization detected was"
		a granulomatous hepatitis which lead to the disclosure of an ulcerous
		"entercolitis. Tuberculosis and Crohn disease were first suspected, but their"
		treatment induced a worse turn of the patient's condition and compelled to a
		"laparotomy, which shown ulcerous entercolitis with associated lymph-nodes. Per"
		operative pathological examination gave evidence of Histoplasma capsulatum
		"yeasts. Treatment, first with miconazole and later on with amphotericin B could"
		not prevent the death of the patient affected by a deficiency of cell mediated
		"immunity. Disseminated histoplasmosis is rare: 1 out of 5,000 cases of American"
		histoplasmosis-digestive disorders are generally detected by surgery or
		post-mortem examination. They occur in 20 p. 100 of the cases envolving the whole
		"digestive tract from mouth to anus, giving mucous ulcerations, difficult to"
		detect by X ray. Endoscopic control with biopsies has therefore a great value. In
		"Histoplasma duboisii, histoplasmosis digestive disorders are very unusual and"
		"localized to intestine. They may be detected by surgery, or by endoscopies. In"
		"the reported case, in spite of the geographical origin of the patient, the"
		diagnosis of American histoplasmosis was not retained because of the negativity
		of the immunological tests and of the biopsies performed before surgery. An
		afterward checking of these biopsy specimens gave evidence of a few yeasts.
		Special dyeing technique may have made the diagnosis somewhat earlier; this is
		important because new non toxic imidazole drugs seem to be active against these
		yeasts.

TI	-	Nodular pulmonary histoplasmosis in Cushing's disease: a case report and
		literature review.
PG	-	44-6
AB	-	Opportunistic infections are well documented in states of steroid excess. To our
		"knowledge, histoplasmosis has not been previously reported in Cushing's disease,"
		and has rarely been reported in patients with exogenous glucocorticoid use. We
		report a novel presentation of Histoplasmosis as pulmonary nodules in a patient
		with Cushing's disease. A 45-year-old man with a pituitary macroadenoma and
		Cushing's disease was treated with transsphenoidal hypophysectomy and radiation
		"therapy. He was receiving Ketoconazole and basal steroid replacement, when he"
		presented with dyspnea. Chest radiograph showed nodular lesions and subsequent
		biopsy revealed Histoplasma capsulatum. Itraconazole was administered and the
		patient recovered. The case not only demonstrates the protean manifestations of
		Histoplasmosis in patients with glucocorticoid excess but it also emphasizes the
		importance of intensive control of the hypercortisolemia in achieving a favorable
		outcome.

		syndrome.
PG	-	1356-9
AB	-	Disseminated histoplasmosis is one of the life-threatening opportunistic
		infections associated with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). A
		29-year-old man with AIDS and disseminated histoplasmosis complained of a hazy
		spot in the vision of his left eye. Results of examination showed distinct creamy
		white intraretinal and subretinal infiltrates in both eyes. The patient died
		within a month from pulmonary infection with Histoplasma capsulatum and
		cytomegalovirus. Examination with light microscopy showed that the right and left
		"eyes contained histoplasma yeast cells in lesions of retinitis, optic neuritis,"
		and uveitis. These lesions contained variable numbers of lymphocytes and
		histiocytes. Electron microscopy of the histoplasma in tissue showed
		characteristic features. This case illustrates the funduscopic appearance and
		"histopathology of histoplasmic retinitis, an uncommon although important"
		ophthalmologic complication of AIDS.

AB	-	Histoplasmosis has been observed in patients with immunosuppression in the form
		"of isolated pulmonary involvement and disseminated disease. However, very few"
		"cases of this type that involved pleural effusion have been reported, and none"
		have been reported in a case individual with mixed-phenotype acute leukemia

		and breathlessness in the postinduction therapy period for mixed-phenotype acute
		leukemia (MPAL) with diagnosis of histoplasmosis based on the results of pleural
		fluid cytologic testing. The diagnosis of histoplasmosis may be missed in routine
		"pleural fluid cytology testing; however, a high degree of suspicion for"
		opportunistic infections in patients with immunocompromised state can aid
		diagnosis.

AB	-	The diagnosis of histoplasmosis due to Histoplasma capsulatum var capsulatum is
		based on a direct examination identifying encapsulated yeast with narrow-based
		"budding. Galactomannan antigenemia facilitates diagnosis, as well as the"
		monitoring of patients receiving treatment. The case of a HIV-positive patient
		from Congo-Brazzaville with a disseminated form of African histoplasmosis
		highlighted the positive galactomannan antigen in this disease due to Histoplasma
		capsulatum var duboisii. Galactomannan antigenemia remained high with a very slow
		decrease during antifungal therapy and slow regression of clinical lesions.
		African histoplasmosis is a rare disease that is difficult to diagnose and rarely
		"described in immunocompromised patients, in whom differential diagnosis can be"
		common. This observation underlines the importance of the galactomannan antigen
		assay in patients who have travelled to endemic areas. As in the case of
		"Histoplasma capsulatum var capsulatum, the positivity of the Aspergillus"
		galactomannan antigen is very useful in the diagnosis and monitoring of African
		histoplasmosis.

TI	-	Blastomycosis and Histoplasmosis in a Patient with Glioblastoma Receiving
		Temozolomide.
PG	-	447-450
AB	-	Malignant glioblastoma multiform (GBM) is the most common primary malignancy of
		the brain in the U.S. Temozolomide (TMZ) is the cornerstone of management along
		with surgical resection and radiotherapy. Because of the reduction in the CD4+
		"lymphocyte count as a side effect of TMZ use, this patient population is under"
		risk for opportunistic infections like Pneumocystis jiroveci. A male patient with
		newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiform presented with non-productive cough and
		"chest pain. Before presentation, the patient received the standard therapy"
		"including surgical resection, radiation and TMZ. Computerized tomography of the"
		chest showed a very large cavitary lesion in the upper segment of the right lower
		lobe and multiple nodular lesions with some starting to cavitate. Cytology of the
		"bronchioalveolar lavage with special stain showed large, broad based budding"
		"yeast-like cells, morphologically consistent with blastomyces and macrophages"
		"filled with yeast-like forms, morphologically consistent with histoplasma. The"
		patient was treated with intraconazole intended for 12 months. To the best of our
		"knowledge, our case represents the first documented case of lung infection with"
		both blastomyces and histoplasma in a patient after receiving TMZ for newly
		diagnosed GBM.

AB	-	A case of cytomegalovirus (CMV) sialadenitis in a patient with acquired
		immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) diagnosed by fine-needle aspiration biopsy
		(FNAB) is reported. Although a diagnosis of CMV sialadenitis can be established
		"on Diff-Quik-stained slides, the characteristic viral changes are the best"
		appreciated on slides stained by the Papanicolaou (Pap) technique. Differential
		pitfalls are discussed. It needs to be stressed that clinically unsuspected
		diagnosis of CMV infection may uncover congenital or acquired defects of cellular
		"immunity, and particularly AIDS. Diagn. Cytopathol. 2000;22:101-103."

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Pulmonary mycoses resemble clinically and radiologically chronic
		"pulmonary tuberculosis. Studies describing the prevalence, etiology and clinical"
		features of pulmonary mycosis are of crucial importance in the Brazilian Amazon.
		AIMS: To estimate the frequency of pulmonary mycoses in smear-negative
		"tuberculosis patients; to describe their demographic, epidemiological, and"
		clinical characteristics; and to evaluate diagnostic methods. METHODS: A
		cross-sectional study was conducted at two tuberculosis reference institutions in
		"Amazonas, Brazil. We included 213 patients and collected clinical data, blood and"
		"induced sputum to perform serological, direct microscopy, microbiologic culture"
		"and PCR-based assays to identify infections caused by Aspergillus fumigatus,"
		"Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, Histoplasma capsulatum, Cryptococcus, and HIV."
		Chest computed tomography was also performed. RESULTS: Pulmonary mycoses were
		"diagnosed in 7% (15/213) of the cases, comprising ten aspergillosis cases, three"
		cases of paracoccidioidomycosis and one case each of histoplasmosis and
		"cryptococcosis. Among the patients with pulmonary mycoses, 86.7% were former"
		tuberculosis patients. The most significant clinical characteristics associated
		"with pulmonary mycoses were cavity-shaped lung injuries, prolonged chronic cough"
		and hemoptysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirmed the high prevalence of pulmonary
		mycoses in smear-negative tuberculosis patients in the Brazilian Amazon.

AB	-	"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article describes the background, clinical presentation,"
		"diagnosis, and treatment of selected etiologies of subacute and chronic"
		meningitis. Key diagnostic considerations when evaluating a patient presenting
		"with chronic inflammation of the CNS are discussed, and several specific"
		"infectious, neoplastic, and autoimmune etiologies are reviewed in detail. RECENT"
		"FINDINGS: With recent advancement in serologic and CSF diagnostic testing,"
		"specific infectious, neoplastic, or autoimmune etiologies of chronic meningitis"
		can be identified. Eliminating previous diagnostic uncertainty of chronic
		inflammation in the CNS has led to rapid and specific treatment regimens that
		ultimately improve patient outcomes. Recent advances in imaging have also aided
		clinicians in both their diagnostic approach and the detection of inflammatory
		"complications such as hydrocephalus, hemorrhage, and ischemic stroke. SUMMARY:"
		Meningitis is defined as inflammation involving the meninges of the brain and
		"spinal cord. Meningitis can be categorized as acute, subacute, or chronic based"
		on duration of inflammation. This article focuses on the most common causes of
		subacute and chronic meningitis. Chronic meningitis is commonly defined as
		inflammation evolving during weeks to months without resolution of CSF
		abnormalities. Determining the time course of meningitis is important for
		creating a differential diagnosis. Most organisms causing acute meningitis rarely
		persist more than a few weeks. Although numerous etiologies of subacute and
		"chronic meningitis have been identified, this article focuses on the most common"
		"etiologies: (1) infectious, (2) autoimmune, and (3) neoplastic."

PG	-	69-74
AB	-	Opportunistic diseases in HIV-infected patients have changed since the
		introduction of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART). This study aims at
		evaluating the frequency of associated diseases in patients with AIDS admitted to
		"an university hospital of Brazil, before and after HAART. The medical records of"
		342 HIV-infected patients were reviewed and divided into two groups: group 1
		"comprised 247 patients before HAART and, group 2, 95 patients after HAART. The"
		male-to-female rate dropped from 5:1 to 2:1for HIV infection. There was an
		"increase in the prevalence of tuberculosis and toxoplasmosis, with a decrease in"
		"Kaposi's sarcoma, histoplasmosis and cryptococcosis. A reduction of in-hospital"
		mortality (42.0% vs. 16.9%; p = 0.00002) has also occurred. An agreement between
		the main clinical diagnoses and autopsy findings was observed in 10 out of 20
		cases (50%). Two patients with disseminated schistosomiasis and 2 with
		"paracoccidioidomycosis are reported. Overall, except for cerebral toxoplasmosis,"
		it has been noticed a smaller proportion of opportunistic conditions related to
		severe immunosuppression in the post HAART group. There was also a significant
		"reduction in the in-hospital mortality, possibly reflecting improvement in the"
		treatment of the HIV infection.

		leishmaniosis is rare and this localization does not belong to the most prevalent
		"mucosal leishmaniosis. However, this parasitic disease warrants special concern,"
		"especially in patients who received prolonged corticosteroid treatments, in order"
		to avoid a misdiagnosis of this disease.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To report the results of therapeutic drug monitoring of
		lopinavir/ritonavir and itraconazole concentrations in an HIV-infected male who
		was treated for histoplasmosis. CASE SUMMARY: A 34-year-old HIV-infected man who
		had recently initiated efavirenz-based antiretroviral therapy was diagnosed with
		"disseminated Histoplasma capsulatum infection. In the hospital,"
		lopinavir/ritonavir 400 mg/100 mg twice daily replaced efavirenz to avoid
		efavirenz-itraconazole interactions. After 14 days of liposomal amphotericin B
		"therapy, itraconazole solution was initiated at 150 mg twice daily for 3 days,"
		"followed by 200 mg daily. Prior to itraconazole initiation, lopinavir trough"
		"concentration was 7.4 mg/L. The lopinavir trough concentration 15 days later,"
		"after 14 days of itraconazole, was 6.8 mg/L. An itraconazole concentration"
		measured 2 hours post-dose on day 15 of oral therapy was 1.9 microg/mL. After 2
		"weeks of liposomal amphotericin, urine Histoplasma antigen was 27.23 ng/mL; after"
		"5 months of oral itraconazole therapy, it decreased to 5.24 ng/mL. Plasma HIV RNA"
		decreased 4.26 log(10) in 5 months to less than 40 copies/mL. The patient has
		"demonstrated marked clinical improvement. DISCUSSION: In this case, dosing"
		recommendations of itraconazole 200 mg daily with lopinavir/ritonavir were
		appropriate. Lopinavir trough concentrations were not significantly different
		following the addition of itraconazole and were above the minimum target of 1
		mg/L in treatment-naïve patients. The itraconazole concentration was above the
		recommended concentration of at least 1 microg/mL. CONCLUSIONS: The dose of
		"itraconazole was reduced to 200 mg daily as recommended by current guidelines,"
		and therapeutic drug monitoring of both itraconazole and lopinavir concentrations
		confirmed that no further dosage adjustments were necessary.

		predominantly driven by the widespread adoption of aggressive immunosuppressive
		"therapy among certain patient populations (e.g., chemotherapy, transplants) and"
		the increasing use of invasive devices such as central venous catheters (CVCs).
		The use of new immune modifying drugs has also opened up an entirely new spectrum
		of patients at risk of IFIs. While the epidemiology of candida infections has
		"changed in the last decade, with a gradual shift from C. albicans to non-albicans"
		"candida (NAC) strains which may be less susceptible to azoles, these changes vary"
		between hospitals and regions depending on the type of population risk factors
		"and antifungal use. In certain parts of the world, the incidence of IFI is"
		strongly linked to the prevalence of other disease conditions and the ecological
		niche for the organism; for instance cryptococcal and pneumocystis infections are
		particularly common in areas with a high prevalence of HIV disease. Poorly
		controlled diabetes is a major risk factor for invasive mould infections.
		Environmental factors and trauma also play a unique role in the epidemiology of
		"mould infections, with well-described hospital outbreaks linked to the use of"
		contaminated instruments and devices. Blastomycosis is associated with
		"occupational exposure (e.g., forest rangers) and recreational activities (e.g.,"
		camping and fishing).The true burden of IFI is probably an underestimate because
		of the absence of reliable diagnostics and lack of universal application. For
		"example, the sensitivity of most blood culture systems for detecting candida is"
		typically 50 %. The advent of new technology including molecular techniques such
		as 18S ribosomal RNA PCR and genome sequencing is leading to an improved
		understanding of the epidemiology of the less common mould and dimorphic fungal
		infections. Molecular techniques are also providing a platform for improved
		"diagnosis and management of IFI.Many factors affect mortality in IFI, not least"
		"the underlying medical condition, choice of therapy, and the ability to achieve"
		"early source control. For instance, mortality due to pneumocystis pneumonia in"
		HIV-seronegative individuals is now higher than in seropositive patients. Of
		significant concern is the progressive increase in resistance to azoles and
		"echinocandins among candida isolates, which appears to worsen the already"
		significant mortality associated with invasive candidiasis. Mortality with mould
		"infections approaches 50 % in most studies and varies depending on the site,"
		underlying disease and the use of antifungal agents such as echinocandins and
		"voriconazole. Nevertheless, mortality for most IFIs has generally fallen with"
		"advances in medical technology, improved care of CVCs, improved diagnostics, and"
		more effective preemptive therapy and prophylaxis.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Predictors of death in hospitalized HIV-infected patients have not
		been previously reported in Bangladesh. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study
		was to determine predictors of death among hospitalized HIV-infected patients at
		a large urban hospital in Bangladesh. METHODS: A study was conducted in the HIV
		"in-patient unit (Jagori Ward) of icddr,b's Dhaka Hospital. Characteristics of"
		patients who died during hospitalization were compared to those of patients
		discharged from the ward. Bivariate analysis was performed to determine
		associations between potential risk factors and death. Multivariable logistic
		regression was used to identify factors independently associated with death.
		"RESULTS: Of 293 patients admitted to the Jagori Ward, 57 died during"
		hospitalization. Most hospitalized patients (67%) were male and the median age
		"was 35 (interquartile range: 2-65) years. Overall, 153 (52%) patients were"
		diagnosed with HIV within 6 months of hospitalization. The most common
		"presumptive opportunistic infections (OIs) identified were tuberculosis (32%),"
		"oesophageal candidiasis (9%), Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) (8%), and"
		"histoplasmosis (7%). On multivariable analysis, independent predictors of"
		"mortality were CD4 count ≤200 cells/mm3 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 16.6, 95%"
		"confidence interval [CI]: 3.7-74.4), PJP (aOR: 18.5, 95% CI: 4.68-73.3),"
		"oesophageal candidiasis (aOR: 27.5, 95% CI: 5.5-136.9), malignancy (aOR:15.2, 95%"
		"CI: 2.3-99.4), and bacteriuria (aOR:7.9, 95% CI: 1.2-50.5). Being on"
		"antiretroviral therapy prior to hospitalization (aOR: 0.2, 95% CI: 0.06-0.5) was"
		associated with decreased mortality. CONCLUSION: This study showed that most
		patients who died during hospitalization on the Jagori Ward had HIV-related
		illnesses which could have been averted with earlier diagnosis of HIV and proper
		management of OIs. It is prudent to develop a national HIV screening programme to
		facilitate early identification of HIV.

AB	-	Case report We report the case of a young Cameroonian woman who presented with
		"cough, hyperthermia, weight loss, pancytopenia, and hepatosplenomegaly. A"
		positive HIV serology was discovered and a chest radiography revealed a 'miliary
		pattern'. Bone marrow aspiration pointed out yeast inclusions within macrophages.
		"Given the morphological aspect, the clinical presentation and immunosuppression,"
		histoplasmosis was retained as a working hypothesis. Antiretroviral and
		amphotericin B treatments were promptly initiated. Review Given the immigration
		"wave that Europe is currently experiencing, we think it is important to share"
		"experience and knowledge, especially in non-endemic areas such as Europe, where"
		clinicians are not used to face this disease. Histoplasmosis is due to
		"Histoplasma capsulatum var. capsulatum, a dimorphic fungus. Infection occurs by"
		inhaling spores contained in soils contaminated by bat or bird droppings. The
		clinical presentation depends on the immune status of the host and the importance
		"of inoculum, varying from asymptomatic to disseminated forms. AIDS patients are"
		"particularly susceptible to develop a severe disease. Antigen detection,"
		"molecular biology techniques, and microscopic examination are used to make a"
		"rapid diagnosis. However, antigen detection is not available in Europe and"
		diagnosis needs a strong clinical suspicion in non-endemic areas. Because of
		"suggestive imagery, clinicians might focus on tuberculosis. Our case illustrates"
		"the need for clinicians to take histoplasmosis in the differential diagnosis,"
		depending on the context and the patient's past history.

TI	-	Prevalence of uveitis: a retrospective study.
PG	-	386-9
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Uveitis is commonly seen in optometric practice, and anterior uveitis"
		accounts for more than 75% of all uveitis. Uveitis may be the initial
		"manifestation of an associated systemic disease process; and, with proper testing"
		"and diagnosis, the patient's ocular and systemic condition may be more"
		"effectively treated. METHODS: Retrospectively, 194 charts from a referral"
		"practice with a general diagnosis of uveitis, retinitis, or chorioretinal scar"
		"were reviewed to determine medical history, clinical findings, tests performed,"
		"and specific diagnoses obtained. RESULTS: The majority of cases, 87.6%, were"
		"anterior uveitis with more than half, 54.7%, presenting with undetermined"
		etiology. Trauma was the cause of the next most common group of anterior uveitis
		"patients, 21.8%, and accounted for 19.1% of all uveitis cases. Glaucomatocyclitic"
		"crisis was seen in 8 cases, 4.1%, while there were 7 patients with sarcoid"
		"disease, and 5 with ankylosing spondylitis or systemic lupus erythematosus."
		Posterior uveitis was the principle finding in 12.4% of cases with ocular
		histoplasmosis being most common. There were 4 cases of toxoplasmosis and 3 cases
		of pars planitis. CONCLUSIONS: Utilization of laboratory testing proved to be
		most valuable in the treatment and management of uveitis. Although there were
		fewer cases of pars planitis reported in our study in comparison to previous
		"reports, the mix of cases of uveitis in our study was comparable to the work of"
		others in the field. Accurate diagnosis of these cases is quite important since
		the treatment and prognosis for recovery is variable and different with its
		associated diseases.

		and 73 male Nigerian children resident in Ife-Ijesa zone of Western Nigeria over
		a period of ten years (1982-1991) form the basis of this study. Patients' ages
		ranged from 2 months to 15 years. Most of the patients (81%) were aged 6 years
		and above. The cervical region was the commonest site of lymphadenopathy (48%)
		and localized lymphadenopathy was the rule. Chronic specific inflammation
		"(tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis, and histoplasmosis) predominated as a cause of"
		lymphadenopathy (44%) compared with non specific lymphadenitis (31%) and
		malignant tumours (24%). Tuberculosis was the commonest cause of chronic specific
		lymphadenitis and was commoner in girls. The cervical region was the commonest
		"site for chronic specific lymphadenitis, as well as Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's"
		lymphoma. The lymphomas were more common in males. The peak incidence for
		Hodgkin's disease was between the ages of 12 and 15 years.

LID	-	195
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Although mustelids occur worldwide and include a wide range of
		"species, little is known about the diseases affecting them. Mustelids have"
		regularly been submitted for post mortem investigation in the framework of the
		"program for general wildlife health surveillance in Switzerland, which has been"
		in place for nearly 60 years. We performed a retrospective analysis of the
		necropsy reports on mustelids submitted to the diagnostic service of the
		University of Bern. The aims of this study were to present an overview of the
		"causes of mortality and morbidity observed in these carnivores, to assess"
		"differences among species, to assess changes in disease detection over the study"
		"period, and to describe the pathology of selected diseases. RESULTS: Five hundred"
		and sixty-six reports from 1958 to 2015 were analyzed. Most animals were stone
		"martens (Martes foina, 46%) and badgers (Meles meles, 44%); the remaining species"
		"were polecats (Mustela putorius, 4.7%), pine martens (Martes martes, 2%), stoats"
		"(Mustela erminea, 1.4%), weasels (Mustela nivalis, 0.8%) and otters (Lutra lutra,"
		0.3%). Infectious diseases (n = 262) were frequent and were mostly bacterial or
		viral; non-infectious conditions (n = 169) were less common and were mostly
		traumatic or due to metabolic disorders. The most frequent diagnoses included
		"distemper (75% were badgers), amyloidosis (96% were martens), bacterial"
		"respiratory infections (all mustelids), biting lice (badgers only) and pulmonary"
		and gastro-intestinal helminths (all species). Less frequent diseases included
		"histoplasmosis (badgers only), aspergillosis, toxoplasmosis, hepatozoonosis, and"
		sarcoptic mange. Lesions due to infection with distemper virus were primarily
		appreciated in the respiratory tract and central nervous system; they presented
		species-specific characteristics such as necrosis in the ependyma in badgers and
		absence of syncytia in stone martens. Amyloidosis in martens was multisystemic in
		most cases and included both AA and AL amyloidosis; the main macroscopic change
		was severe splenomegaly. CONCLUSION: Infectious diseases were the most frequent
		"causes of morbidity and mortality of mustelids, with marked species-specific"
		differences. Lung and skin were the most commonly affected organs. Contagious
		"diseases such as canine distemper, sarcoptic mange and rabies in mustelids showed"
		"a similar temporal pattern as in red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), suggesting pathogen"
		spillovers from foxes to mustelids.

AB	-	Aim: This study evaluated burden of illness in immunocompromised patients with
		"systemic mycoses (SM) eligible for itraconazole treatment, specifically,"
		"histoplasmosis, blastomycosis and aspergillosis. Methods: A cross-sectional study"
		used an electronic medical record network integrating information from 30 US
		"hospitals, including >34 million patients, to evaluate burden and healthcare"
		resource utilization over 6 months following initiation of antifungal therapy.
		Results: Symptomatic burden experienced by each of the otherwise healthy or
		age >65 or immunosuppressed cohorts receiving antifungal therapy for SM was
		comparable but significantly greater in cancer or HIV patients and transplant
		"recipients. Across groups, there was substantially higher healthcare resource"
		utilization in patients with SM versus matched controls without SM. Conclusion:
		The total impact of SM is particularly severe in high-risk or vulnerable
		populations.

TI	-	Parasitic infections associated with HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean.
PG	-	129-37
AB	-	This review article seeks to highlight the significance for the Caribbean of
		"major parasitic infections associated with AIDS, encourage awareness of these"
		"opportunistic parasites, and promote familiarity with appropriate diagnostic"
		techniques and their clinical relevance. Specific agents considered include
		Pneumocystis carinii; Toxoplasma gondii; the enteric coccidians Cryptosporidium
		"spp., Isospora belli, and Cyclospora cayetanensis; the hemoflagellates Leishmania"
		spp. and Trypanosoma cruzi; the fungi Histoplasma capsulatum and Cryptococcus
		neoformans; the nematode Strongyloides stercoralis; and the mite Sarcoptes
		"scabiei. These disease agents can be divided into two groups, the"
		"immune-regulated ""endogenous"" parasites (the protozoans P. carinii and T. gondii,"
		and possibly the roundworm S. stercoralis) and intracellular parasites (including
		"the enteric coccidia, hemoflagellates, and fungi). Both in the Caribbean and"
		"elsewhere, the endogenous parasites (particularly P. carinii and T. gondii) are"
		"the most troublesome for AIDS patients, partly because they are likely to be"
		transmitted and establish a benign immunoregulated presence early in the
		"subject's life. Indeed, health management programs for AIDS patients often"
		"routinely include P. carinii prophylaxis, since nearly all such patients who"
		survive long enough are expected to experience an episode of acute P. carinii
		"infection. In contrast, there is no known epidemiologic association between AIDS"
		"and strongyloidiasis in the Caribbean, and the prevalence there of potentially"
		opportunistic hemoflagellates such as Leishmania spp. and Trypanosoma cruzi is
		relatively low.

TI	-	"HIV infection/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome at Siriraj Hospital, 2002: time"
		for secondary prevention.
PG	-	173-9
AB	-	The authors retrospectively reviewed the medical records of HIV/AIDS patients who
		"were admitted to the medical service, Siriraj Hospital from January 1, 2002"
		"through December 31, 2002. Demographics, CD4 lymphocyte counts, discharge"
		"diagnoses, the incidence of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), cerebral"
		toxoplasmosis and cryptococcosis in patients who received and did not receive
		appropriate chemoprophylaxis against those opportunistic infections when
		"indicated, and outcome of the patients were collected. Three hundred medical"
		records of 286 HIV/AIDS patients were available for review. One hundred and
		seventy two patients (60.1%) were male. Mean age of the patients was 36.8 +/-
		9.91 years (range 14-74). The mean CD4 lymphocyte count that was determined in
		"165 patients was 74.7 +/- 134.21 cells/mm3 (range 0-894). Of the 300 admissions,"
		36 per cent were newly diagnosed HIV infection. Only 23 (7.7%) patients had
		received antiretroviral drugs at the time of hospitalization. The leading
		"HIV-related diseases were tuberculosis (29.3%), Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia"
		"(18.7%), and cryptococcosis (15.7%). The rest of them included cytomegalovirus"
		"diseases (6.3%), lymphoma (6.3%), Salmonella bacteremia (6%), cerebral"
		"toxoplasmosis (5.7%), cryptosporidiosis (5.3%), disseminated Mycobacterium avium"
		"complex infection (1.0%), extrapulmonary histoplasmosis (1.0%), Candida"
		"esophagitis (1.0%), progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (1.0%), and"
		rhodococcosis (0.7%). Among those for whom HIV infection was established and
		"chemoprophylaxis for PCP, cerebral toxoplasmosis and cryptococcosis were"
		"indicated, 9.8 per cent vs 28.2 per cent, 3.6 per cent vs 5.1 per cent, and 10"
		per cent vs 15.2 per cent of whom received and did not receive the appropriate
		"chemoprophylaxis developed PCP, cerebral toxoplasmosis and cryptococcosis"
		"respectively. One hundred and ninety (63.3%) patients were alive at discharge, 84"
		"(28.0%) had died, 21 (7%) were referred to other hospitals, and 5 (1.7%) left"
		hospital against medical advice. The mortality rate in newly diagnosed HIV and in
		known HIV without antiretroviral treatment were comparable but much lower in
		known HIV-infected patients who received antiretroviral therapy. Secondary
		prevention by detection of HIV-infected patients while they are asymptomatic and
		providing them with appropriate chemoprophylaxis against specific opportunistic
		infections as well as appropriate antiretroviral treatment would decrease
		"morbidity, mortality, and improve the quality of life of HIV-infected patients in"
		Thailand.

TI	-	Dry eye symptoms and chemosis following blepharoplasty: a 10-year retrospective
		review of 892 cases in a single-surgeon series.
PG	-	39-46
LID	-	10.1001/2013.jamafacial.1 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence of and risk factors associated with dry
		eye symptoms (DES) and chemosis following upper or lower blepharoplasty. To
		examine the outcomes among long-term blepharoplasty data to better understand the
		incidence of and risk factors associated with dry eye symptoms (DES) and
		"chemosis, to evaluate the known risk factors for DES in the general population,"
		"and to analyze intraoperative procedures (such as forehead-lift, midface-lift,"
		"canthopexy, and canthoplasty) to determine their effects on DES and chemosis."
		METHODS: A retrospective medical record review was performed among all the cases
		of upper or lower blepharoplasty performed by the senior author during a 10-year
		period (January 1999 through December 2009). A self-reported dry eye
		questionnaire was used to collect baseline and follow-up data. Patients with
		"incomplete medical records, multiple (>1) revision procedures, less than 3 weeks"
		"of postoperative follow-up data, or a history of Sjögren syndrome, severe thyroid"
		"eye disease, histoplasmosis ocular infection, periocular trauma causing eyelid"
		"malposition, or radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal cancer were excluded from the"
		study. Binary logistic regression analyses were performed to analyze the
		relationship between 13 preoperative and anatomical variables and DES or
		chemosis. χ2 Tests were performed to analyze the relationship between
		"intraoperative risk factors and DES or chemosis. RESULTS: In total, 892 cases met"
		the study inclusion criteria. Dry eye symptoms and chemosis following
		"blepharoplasty were reported in 26.5% and 26.3% of patients, respectively. The"
		incidences of DES and chemosis were significantly higher in patients who
		underwent concurrent upper and lower blepharoplasty (P < .001) and in patients
		who underwent skin-muscle flap blepharoplasty (P = .001). Hormone therapy use and
		preoperative scleral show were associated with DES after blepharoplasty (P <
		".05). Male sex, preoperative eyelid laxity, and preoperative DES were associated"
		with an increased incidence of chemosis following blepharoplasty (P < .05).
		Intraoperative canthopexy significantly increased the risk for developing
		"chemosis (P = .009), and postoperative lagophthalmos significantly increased the"
		risk for DES following blepharoplasty (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Dry eye symptoms
		"and chemosis are common following blepharoplasty, and the risk for developing"
		"these conditions may increase with intraoperative canthopexy, postoperative"
		"temporary lagophthalmos, concurrent upper and lower blepharoplasty, and"
		transcutaneous approaches violating the orbicularis oculi muscle. Patients with a
		"preoperative history of DES, eyelid laxity, scleral show, or hormone therapy use"
		may be at greater risk for developing dry eyes or chemosis following surgery.

AB	-	Autopsy continues to play an essential role in monitoring opportunistic fungal
		"infections. However, few studies have analysed the historical trends of fungal"
		"infections in autopsies. Here, we analyse available data on fungal infections"
		obtained from autopsy reports during 85 years of autopsies performed by the
		largest autopsy service in Brazil. All invasive fungal infections presented in
		"autopsy reports between 1930 and 2015 were included. Of the 158,404 autopsy"
		"reports analysed, 1096 involved invasive fungal infections. In general,"
		"paracoccidioidomycosis (24%) was the most frequent infection, followed by"
		"candidiasis (18%), pneumocystosis (11.7%), cryptococcosis (11%), aspergillosis"
		(11%) and histoplasmosis (3.8%). Paracoccidioidomycosis decreased after the
		"1950s, whereas opportunistic fungal infections increased steadily after the 1980s"
		during the peak of the AIDS pandemic. The lung was the most frequently affected
		organ (73%). Disseminated infection was present in 64.5% of cases. In 26% of the
		"513 cases for which clinical charts were available for review, the diagnosis of"
		opportunistic fungal infections was performed only at autopsy. Our unique 85-year
		history of autopsies showed a transition from endemic to opportunistic fungal
		"infections in São Paulo, Brazil, reflecting increased urbanization, the"
		"appearance of novel diseases, such as AIDS in the 1980s, and advances in medical"
		care over time.

TI	-	National lung screening trial: variability in nodule detection rates in chest CT
		studies.
PG	-	865-73
LID	-	10.1148/radiol.13121530 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: To characterize the variability in radiologists' interpretations of
		computed tomography (CT) studies in the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST)
		"(including assessment of false-positive rates [FPRs] and sensitivity), to examine"
		"factors that contribute to variability, and to evaluate trade-offs between FPRs"
		and sensitivity among different groups of radiologists. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
		The HIPAA-compliant NLST was approved by the institutional review board at each
		screening center; all participants provided informed consent. NLST radiologists
		"reported overall screening results, nodule-specific findings, and recommendations"
		for diagnostic follow-up. A noncalcified nodule of 4 mm or larger constituted a
		positive screening result. The FPR was defined as the rate of positive screening
		examinations in participants without a cancer diagnosis within 1 year.
		Descriptive analyses and mixed-effects models were utilized. The average odds
		ratio (OR) for a false-positive result across all pairs of radiologists was used
		as a measure of variability. RESULTS: One hundred twelve radiologists at 32
		"screening centers each interpreted 100 or more NLST CT studies, interpreting 72"
		160 of 75 126 total NLST CT studies in aggregate. The mean FPR for radiologists
		"was 28.7% ± 13.7 (standard deviation), with a range of 3.8%-69.0%. The model"
		yielded an average OR of 2.49 across all pairs of radiologists and an OR of 1.83
		for pairs within the same screening center. Mean FPRs were similar for academic
		"versus nonacademic centers (27.9% and 26.7%, respectively) and for centers inside"
		"(25.0%) versus outside (28.7%) the U.S. ""histoplasmosis belt."" Aggregate"
		"sensitivity was 96.5% for radiologists with FPRs higher than the median (27.1%),"
		compared with 91.9% for those with FPRs lower than the median (P = .02).
		CONCLUSION: There was substantial variability in radiologists' FPRs. Higher FPRs
		were associated with modestly higher sensitivity.

TI	-	Prevalence of enteric pathogens in HIV-related diarrhea in the midwest.
PG	-	179-84
AB	-	"HIV disease is often associated with the condition of diarrhea, which may be"
		accompanied by enteric infection or gastrointestinal tumor. This study
		prospectively investigated 27 episodes of chronic diarrhea in 24 patients with
		HIV infection. Upper endoscopy and sigmoidoscopy with biopsies at three sites
		"(distal duodenum, sigmoid colon, and rectum) and viral and mycobacterial blood"
		cultures were performed. Stool specimens were sent for standard tests. A primary
		infectious diagnosis was found in 10 (37%) of 27 episodes: cytomegalovirus (CMV)
		"colitis (n = 4), 3 microsporidiosis (n = 3), cryptosporidiosis (n = 2), and"
		colonic histoplasmosis (n = 1). Patients with CD4 counts of less than 50
		cells/mm3 and with lower albumin levels were more likely to have a primary
		infectious diagnosis. Adenovirus was found in 7 cases but was often associated
		with another organism; these were not considered to be primary diagnoses. Blood
		"cultures for viruses were not useful, and all mycobacterial cultures were"
		negative. A flexible sigmoidoscopy with histologic examination and culture of
		biopsy samples were the diagnostic tools that yielded most infectious diagnoses.
		Follow-up showed that two thirds of patients improved with nonspecific
		antidiarrheal medications regardless of diagnosis. The study supports a
		minimalistic approach to the problem of diarrhea in patients with HIV infection.
		"Upper and lower endoscopy lead to a precise diagnosis in a minority of cases, and"
		the outcome was similar in patients with or without a primary infectious
		diagnosis.

AB	-	"Some ocular infections, only rarely seen in otherwise healthy individuals, are"
		"sometimes seen in patients with immunodeficiencies, i.e., with HIV infection. A"
		typical example is the ophthalmic zoster or luetic uveitis in young individuals
		which should always imply the possibility of HIV infection. The so called
		opportunistic infections in contrast are only seen in HIV infection defining the
		AIDS syndrome. These infections are systemic in origin and only secondarily
		"affecting the eye. Consequently, a therapy concept for these diseases should be"
		"developed always involving both, the ophthalmologist and the general physician."
		"Pathogens causing ocular infections are cytomegalovirus (CMV), cryptococcus,"
		"pneumocystis carinii, mycobacteria, toxoplasma gondii, histoplasma capsulatum and"
		"candida albicans. Under these, CMV retinitis is the commonest infection affecting"
		nearly 20% of all AIDS patients. The clinical findings and therapy of the most
		frequent ocular infections are discussed and a scheme for the care of these
		patients introduced.

PG	-	286-92
AB	-	"OBJECTIVE: The survey ""Mortality 2000"" had for aim to describe the distribution"
		of causes of death in HIV-infected adults in France. METHOD: Hospital wards
		involved in the management of HIV infection prospectively reported deaths
		occurring in 2000. The causes of death were documented using a standardized
		questionnaire. RESULTS: In French Guyana and the French West Indies the five
		referent wards reported 81 deaths. The main underlying causes of death were
		"AIDS-related (67%), non-AIDS and non-hepatitis related cancer (9%),"
		"cardiovascular disease (7%), bacterial infections (5%), and end stage liver"
		"disease (4%). Among AIDS-related deaths, the more frequent diseases were"
		"histoplasmosis and toxoplasmosis in Guyana and atypical mycobacterial infection,"
		"tuberculosis, and cytomegalovirus disease in the West Indies. Median age was 43"
		"years, transmission of HIV infection was heterosexual in 79%; 56% lived in poor"
		"socio-economic conditions, and 30% were born abroad. One out of five had been"
		recently diagnosed with HIV infection and one out of three had never received
		"antiretroviral treatment. CONCLUSION: In 2000, two in three death cases in"
		HIV-infected adults were AIDS-related in French Guyana and the French West
		Indies. Improved strategies for screening HIV infection before the occurrence of
		AIDS are still needed taking into consideration poor socio-economic and migrant
		conditions.

		10-year retrospective review.
PG	-	600-4
LID	-	10.1093/mmy/myw017 [doi]
AB	-	The epidemiology of invasive fungal infections has recently changed in
		"immunosuppressed populations as a result of HIV infection, organ transplant,"
		chemotherapy and in elderly patients. The diagnosis of invasive fungal infections
		by culture is prolonged since fungi grow slowly in vitro. we wanted to estimate
		the frequency of fungemia diagnoses established through the Clinical Mycology
		Laboratory over the past 10 years; through a retrospective study; data was
		obtained from the laboratory patient registry in the Infectious Disease
		Hospital's laboratory registry of patients with a systemic fungal isolate between
		2005 and 2014. One hundred and thirty two (132) systemic fungal infections were
		"identified. They were more prevalent in males, in the age group between 20 and 59"
		years and in patients with a diagnosis of AIDS. The most frequently isolated
		"agents belonged to the genus Candida and others such as Histoplasma sp.,"
		"Cryptococcus sp., Aspergillus sp., and Coccidioides sp. Of all blood and bone"
		"marrow cultures received 17.9% had fungal development; of these, in 70% of cases"
		"it was through blood cultures. In general, fungal agents were not diagnostically"
		suspected. We identified that Sixty percent (60%) of fungemias developed in AIDS
		"patients, followed by patients with sepsis. The most common agents belonged to"
		"the genus Candida, predominantly the albicans species. They were more frequently"
		identified by blood culture than by bone marrow culture. Invasive fungal
		infections have not followed a usual clinical pattern and are not easily
		recognizable.

PG	-	1054-61
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To determine frequency and outcomes of conditions with peripapillary
		subretinal neovascular membranes (PSRNVMs). DESIGN: Retrospective observational
		case series. PARTICIPANTS: All patients from a private community-based retina
		"practice diagnosed with a PSRNVM. METHODS: Review of clinical charts,"
		"photographs, and fluorescein angiograms of 115 eyes of 96 patients, accrued over"
		"18 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Demographics, visual acuity (VA), laterality,"
		"neovascular membrane type and recurrence status over treatment course, and"
		associated ocular conditions. RESULTS: Prevalences of reported associations were
		"52 (45.2%), age-related maculopathy (ARM); 45 (39.1%), idiopathic; 5 (4.3%),"
		"multifocal choroiditis; 3 (2.6%), angioid streaks; 2 (1.7%), histoplasmosis; 2"
		"(1.7%), choroidal osteoma; 1 (0.9%), optic disc drusen; and 1 (0.9%), congenital"
		disc anomaly. Newly recognized associations include pattern dystrophy (3 [2.6%])
		and peripapillary pseudopodal pigment epithelial and choroidal atrophy (1
		[0.9%]). Second-eye involvement was observed in 19.8% of patients over a median
		follow-up of 2 years. Median initial VAs were 20/40 for ARM-associated eyes and
		20/30 for idiopathic eyes (P = 0.0230). Median final VAs were 20/70 for
		ARM-associated eyes and 20/32 for idiopathic eyes (P = 0.0261). The VA changes in
		the ARM-associated and idiopathic groups did not differ significantly (P =
		0.1453). Recurrence of PSRNVMs after laser ablation was seen in 14 of 73 eyes
		(19.2%). A case of a PSRNVM as a cause of pseudopapilledema leading to
		unnecessary neurological imaging is reported. CONCLUSIONS: Close inspection of
		fellow eyes at the time of first eye diagnosis and regular follow-up afterward
		"are indicated, given the high rate of eventual bilateral involvement regardless"
		of associated condition. Laser ablation of PSRNVMs with broad treatment margins
		reduces recurrence rates relative to earlier series. The differential diagnosis
		of disc edema should include PSRNVMs. Pattern dystrophy can be associated with
		PSRNVMs.

TI	-	Epidemiological and clinical features of pulmonary blastomycosis.
PG	-	206-18
AB	-	The epidemiological and clinical aspects of Blastomycosis are reviewed. The
		"central United States is the most heavily endemic area in the world, although the"
		"extent of the endemic zone has been mapped only by individual case finding,"
		rather than by large skin test surveys (as was done for histoplasmosis). The
		difficulties in developing a sensitive and specific skin test antigen are
		"reviewed, and the sequence of antigens from Blastomycin to antigen A to the ASWS"
		(alkali and water soluble) antigen to the WI (Wisconsin) antigen are discussed.
		The absence of good immunological markers of remote subclinical disease means
		that the size of the iceberg of subclinical cases relative to clinically apparent
		and diagnosed pulmonary and extrapulmonary cases remains uncertain. Clinical
		"presentations of blastomycosis range from (1) asymptomatic, currently discovered"
		"only in outbreak situation, (2) flulike illness of brief duration resembling"
		"other upper respiratory infections, (3) illness resembling bacterial pneumonia"
		"with acute onset, high fever, lobar infiltrates, and productive cough, (4)"
		subacute or chronic respiratory illness with symptom complex resembling
		tuberculosis or lung cancer and radiographic presentation of fibronodular
		"infiltrates or mass-like lesions, and (5) fulminant infectious adult respiratory"
		"distress syndrome (ARDS) with high fever, diffuse infiltrates, and progressive"
		respiratory failure. Radiographic presentations are highly variable and even more
		confusing because of lack of standard terminology to describe these
		abnormalities. Examples of some of the radiographic presentations of
		blastomycosis are shown. Available information concerning computed tomographic
		"studies is also reviewed. Special mention is made of blastomycosis in AIDS, which"
		"is uncommon but tends to be fulminant, systemic, and rapidly progressive. An"
		overview of current diagnostic strategies and treatment options is also
		presented.

PG	-	25-37
AB	-	Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis (PAP) is a rare and diffuse lung disease
		"characterized by the abnormal deposition of PAS positive, lipoproteinaceous"
		"material in the alveolar spaces. It has been related, mainly, to alterations in"
		the immune state and to secondary infections. We studied four cases of PAP
		diagnosed by light microscopy. In two cases we were able to demonstrate
		disseminated Histoplasmosis related to immunodeficiency states (AIDS and
		"malnutrition), one case with Pneumocystis carinii infection and AIDS, and one"
		"case with no related pathology. Granular and electron dense material, concentric"
		"myelin figures, and variable-sized osmiophilic bodies were observed by electron"
		"microscopy. We found yeast-like structures, trophozoites and cysts in the"
		"alveolar spaces, in the Histoplasmosis and Pneumocystic carinii infection cases,"
		"respectively. In one of our cases, the circulating neutrophils showed crystalloid"
		inclusions in the nucleus. PAP should be considered in the differential diagnoses
		of patients with pulmonary infiltrates.

AB	-	PURPOSE: To describe the distribution pattern and the clinical features of
		uveitis in two ophthalmology referral centres in Colombia. METHODS: This was a
		retrospective study in which clinical records of patients attending the centres
		between 1996 and 2006 were systematically reviewed. Data were analysed and
		compared with previous reports. RESULTS: Uveitis was found in 693 patients: 335
		men (48.3%) and 358 women (51.7%). The mean age for the first presentation was
		"31.7 +/- 18.3 years. Unilateral (73.4%), acute (68.3%), posterior (35.9%) and"
		non-granulomatous (90.6%) were the most common types of uveitis found in the
		sample. Toxoplasmosis was the most frequent cause in this study followed in order
		"by idiopathic and toxocariasis. Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada, Behçet's disease,"
		sarcoidosis and white dot syndromes were less common. Some causes such as
		systemic lupus erythematosus and tuberculosis were extremely rare. Presumed
		"ocular histoplasmosis, onchocerciasis and Lyme disease were absent. CONCLUSIONS:"
		The results of this study provide the first report of clinical patterns for
		"uveitis in Colombia. This study will enhance awareness of uveitis, and data"
		should assist in the development of public health policies in our population for
		the improvement of patient outcomes.

		Wisconsin.
PG	-	97-101
AB	-	Ninety-five persons exposed to a point-source of Blastomyces dermatitidis in
		Wisconsin in 1984 were evaluated 3 months after exposure for the development of
		"specific cellular immunity, and the 48 infected persons were again evaluated 7"
		and 21 months after exposure. The immune response was assessed by an assay of
		[3H]thymidine uptake by lymphocytes proliferating in response to stimulation with
		Blastomyces alkali- and water-soluble antigen (B-ASWS) or blastomycin and by skin
		"testing with blastomycin. At 3 months, 36 (84%) of 43 patients demonstrated a"
		proliferative response to B-ASWS (mean value of experimental [E]-control [C]
		"counts, 16,852 +/- 2664, and of E/C, 42.2 +/- 5.3). None of the patients"
		"demonstrated a proliferative response to blastomycin, and only 19 (41%) of 45"
		"patients tested had a positive blastomycin skin test. By 21 months, 47 (98%) of"
		the 48 patients demonstrated a proliferative response to B-ASWS on at least one
		"testing date. Of those initially positive, 82% had a persistently positive"
		proliferative response at 21 months; mean E-C and E/C values were comparable to
		those seen at 3 months. None of the 47 uninfected persons demonstrated a
		proliferative response to B-ASWS: 7 with positive histoplasmin skin tests had a
		"mean E-C value of 1094 +/- 432, and the 40 others, a mean value of 1139 +/- 212."
		A proliferative response to B-ASWS in exposed individuals is a reliable marker of
		specific cellular immunity in blastomycosis and the response persists in most
		patients for up to at least 2 years.

TI	-	Efficacy and safety of amphotericin B lipid complex injection (ABLC) in
		solid-organ transplant recipients with invasive fungal infections.
PG	-	329-39
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Fungal infections following solid-organ transplantation are a major
		source of morbidity and mortality. This report describes the efficacy and safety
		of Amphotericin B Lipid Complex Injection (ABLC) in solid-organ transplant
		"recipients. METHODS: Three open-label, second-line treatment studies evaluated"
		"ABLC as a treatment for severe, life-threatening mycoses in patients who were"
		refractory to or intolerant to conventional antifungal (mostly amphotericin B
		[AmB]) therapy or had pre-existing renal disease. RESULTS: The 79 solid-organ
		"transplant recipients (25 heart, 20 liver, 17 kidney, 11 lung, 5 multiple, 1"
		pancreas) who received ABLC in these studies had the following fungal infections:
		aspergillosis (n = 39); candidiasis (n = 20); zygomycosis (n = 8); cryptococcosis
		"and histoplasmosis (n = 3 each); and blastomycosis, cladosporiosis, fusariosis,"
		"Bipolaris hawaiiensis, Dactylaria gallopava, and an unspecified fungal infection"
		(n = 1 each). The median duration of ABLC therapy was 28 d (1-178 d). The daily
		"dose ranged between 1.6 and 7.4 mg/kg (median, 4.6 mg/kg). The clinical response"
		rate for the patients who could be assessed was 58% (39/67). Clinical response
		"rates for heart, liver, kidney, and lung recipients were 59, 60, 67, and 40%,"
		"respectively; response rates for aspergillosis and candidiasis were 47 and 71%,"
		respectively. Forty-six of the 79 patients (58%) survived for more than 28 d
		after the last dose of ABLC. Mean baseline serum creatinine was 3.2 mg/dL; 64
		patients (81%) had stable (n = 37) or improved (n = 27) serum creatinine at the
		end of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: ABLC is safe and effective treatment for fungal
		infections in solid-organ transplant recipients. Its renal-sparing properties are
		particularly suited for this high-risk population for renal failure.

TI	-	Invasive fungal infections in Argentine patients with systemic lupus
		erythematosus.
PG	-	892-8
LID	-	10.1177/0961203313496342 [doi]
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Infections are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in
		patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Invasive fungal infections
		"(IFI) comprise a group of diseases caused by Cryptococcus, Histoplasma,"
		Aspergillus and Candida. Few studies of IFI have been published in patients with
		SLE and associated factors have not been completely defined. OBJECTIVES: The
		objectives of this paper are to estimate the frequency of IFI in admitted
		"patients with SLE in our hospital, to determine the risk factors associated with"
		"IFI in our patients with SLE, and to compare IFI group with a control group (SLE"
		"without IFI). METHODS: The medical charts of patients with IFI (EORTC/MSG, 2008)"
		"and SLE (ACR, 1997) admitted to our hospital from June 2001 until June 2012 were"
		"reviewed. To identify factors associated with IFI, we developed a case-control"
		study (SLE + IFI vs SLE alone) in a one to three ratio adjusted for sex and age
		and hospitalization for other reasons. Comparison was made of demographic
		"characteristics, duration of disease and disease activity previous to IFI"
		"diagnosis, especially three months before fungal infection. We defined severe"
		activity as SLEDAI ≥ 8. Infection by fungi of the genus Candida was considered
		only in its disseminated form. RESULTS: Ten cases of IFI were identified in 208
		patients with SLE admitted between June 2001 and June 2012. We included 40
		"patients with SLE (10 with IFI and 30 controls). Of the SLE-IFI patients, eight"
		"were women and the average age was 27.5 years (range, 19-42 years). Fungal"
		"isolation: eight Cryptococcus neoformans, one Histoplasma capsulatum and one"
		"Candida albicans. Sites affected: five in peripheral blood, five in central"
		"nervous system (CNS), four in skin/soft tissue and one in pleura. Mortality was"
		"40% (p = 0.002), with Cryptococcus neoformans being the most common fungus. The"
		SLE disease activity was severe in 70% of infected patients and no significant
		difference with the control group was found (p = 0.195). We also found no
		"association with leukopenia, lymphopenia, hypocomplementemia,"
		hypogammaglobulinemia or anti-DNA positivity; neither with meprednisone doses
		>20 mg/day or intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy before fungal
		infection. The use of immunosuppressive therapy with azathioprine showed a
		significant association (p = 0.017). Cyclophosphamide (p = 0.100) or
		mycophenolate mofetil (p = 0.256) did not show similar results. CONCLUSION: The
		frequency of IFI in hospitalized SLE patients in our hospital was 4.8%.
		Cryptococcus neoformans was the most common etiologic agent and was primarily
		responsible for the deaths in this cohort. These data are consistent with
		publications in East Asia rather than North America where Candida spp. is more
		"common. Unlike other publications, previous immunosuppression with azathioprine"
		was the only risk factor associated with the development of the infection.
		Invasive fungal infection should be suspected in hospitalized patients with SLE
		and immunosuppression with CNS or atypical cutaneous manifestation of SLE in
		order to start appropriate treatment early and obtain better outcome.

AB	-	We evaluated the diagnostic yield of open-lung biopsies (OLBs) in a large
		tertiary cancer center to determine the role of infectious diseases as causes of
		undiagnosed pulmonary lesions. All consecutive adult patients with either single
		or multiple pulmonary nodules or masses who underwent a diagnostic OLB over a
		period of 10 years (1998-2007) were retrospectively identified. Their risk
		factors for malignancy and clinical and radiological characteristics were
		"reviewed, and their postoperative complications were assessed. We evaluated 155"
		"patients with a median age of 57 years (range, 19-83 years). We identified"
		infectious etiologies in 29 patients (19 %). The most common diagnosis in this
		"group was histoplasmosis (12 [41 %]), followed by nontuberculous mycobacterial"
		infection (7 [24 %]) and aspergillosis (4 [14 %]). The majority of the 126
		"remaining patients had nonmalignant diagnoses, the most prevalent being"
		"nonspecific granuloma (26 %), whereas only 17 % had malignant diagnoses. We"
		"observed no significant differences among the patients with infectious,"
		"malignant, or both noninfectious and nonmalignant final diagnoses regarding their"
		"demographic, laboratory, and clinical characteristics. Six percent of the"
		"patients had at least one post-OLB complication, and the post-OLB mortality rate"
		was 1 %. OLB is a safe diagnostic procedure which frequently identifies a wide
		variety of infectious and inflammatory diseases.

TI	-	Postmortem findings and opportunistic infections in HIV-positive patients from a
		public hospital in Peru.
PG	-	767-75
AB	-	There is a paucity of HIV autopsy data from South America and none that document
		the postmortem findings in patients with HIV/AIDS in Peru. The purpose of this
		autopsy study was to determine the spectrum of opportunistic infections and the
		causes of mortality in HIV-positive patients at a public hospital in Lima.
		Clinico-epidemiological information regarding HIV infection in Peru is also
		"reviewed. Sixteen HIV-related hospital postmortems, performed between 1999 and"
		"2004, were included in this retrospective analysis. The primary cause of death"
		was established in 12 patients: one died of neoplasia and 11 of infectious
		"diseases, including 3 from pulmonary infection, 7 from disseminated infection,"
		and 2 from central nervous system infection (one case had dual pathology).
		"Opportunistic infections were identified in 14 cases, comprising cytomegalovirus,"
		"histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, toxoplasmosis, Pneumocystis pneumonia,"
		"aspergillosis, tuberculosis, varicella zoster virus, and cryptosporidiosis."
		Fourteen patients had at least one AIDS-related disease that had been neither
		"clinically suspected nor diagnosed premortem. Moreover, 82% of the diagnoses"
		considered to be of important clinical significance had not been suspected
		antemortem. The spectrum and frequency of certain opportunistic infections
		"differed from other South American autopsy studies, highlighting the importance"
		of performing HIV/AIDS postmortems in resource-limited countries where locally
		specific disease patterns may be observed.

AB	-	"In the necropsy material of the Medical School of the University of São Paulo,"
		"collected between 1931 and 1981, consisting of 131,466 post-mortem examinations,"
		"there were 254 (0.2%) cases of adrenalitis, 185 male and 69 female. In 161 of"
		"these cases the affection was bilateral, in 46 it was unilateral and in 47 cases"
		"this information is lacking. In 111 cases (43.7%), the adrenalitis was caused by"
		"tuberculosis, in 86 cases (33.8%), by South American blastomycosis, in three"
		"cases (1.2%) by histoplasmosis, in two (0.8%) by Salmonellosis, in two (0.8%) by"
		cytomegalovirus infection and in one (0.4%) by leishmaniasis. The high number of
		cases with tuberculosis and paracoccidioidomycosis of adrenal glands is due to
		high incidence of these infections in Brazil.

TI	-	Incidence and aetiologies of pulmonary granulomatous inflammation: a decade of
		experience.
PG	-	115-21
LID	-	10.1111/resp.12410 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Granulomatous lung disease (GLD) is caused by a wide
		range of conditions. Often there is a need to correlate pathological findings
		"with clinical, microbiological or radiological data to determine an aetiology."
		The aim of this study was to determine the different aetiologies of GLD over the
		"past decade. METHODS: Among 2228 consecutive lung specimens from 1999 to 2011,"
		226 cases (10.1%) were positive for GLD. One hundred ninety patients were
		retrospectively reviewed and diagnoses were assigned based on availability of
		"histological/clinical/microbiological correlation. RESULTS: A confident, probable"
		"and uncertain diagnosis was made in 68.4%, 13.2% and 18.4% patients. The"
		"aetiologies comprised infectious, non-infectious and uncertain in 54.7%, 26.8%"
		"and 18.4% patients. Mycobacterial infections constituted 27% of all patients, and"
		"included atypical, tuberculous and unclassified mycobacteria in order of"
		frequency. Acid-fast bacilli (AFB) were visualized in tissue sections in 29%
		"cases and cultured in 73% cases. Fungal infections comprised 27% of all cases,"
		"which included Coccidioides, Cryptococcus, Aspergillus and Histoplasma in order"
		of frequency. Fungi were visualized in tissue sections with Gomori methenamine
		silver (GMS) stain in 83% patients and cultured in 52% cases. Sarcoidosis was the
		"major non-infectious aetiology, constituting 21% of all patients. Necrosis in"
		granulomas was associated with the presence of infection (P < 0.001).
		CONCLUSIONS: The aetiology in necrotizing GLD with negative AFB and GMS stains is
		most likely infectious due to atypical mycobacteria. Coccidioidomycosis was the
		most common fungal infection. The aetiology in non-necrotizing GLD is most likely
		"non-infectious, probably sarcoidosis."

PG	-	542-5
LID	-	10.3109/13693780903330563 [doi]
AB	-	Paracoccidioidomycosis is a systemic mycosis that is usually acquired early in
		life by inhalation of conidia which convert in the lungs into yeast forms; these
		in turn trigger an inflammatory process. This mycosis may appear as an
		"acute/subacute form or a chronic, adult form. Acute/subacute presentations can be"
		"observed in children and young adults, with the reticuloendothelial system"
		frequently involved but the lungs are usually spared or present with mild
		"clinical or radiological alterations. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),"
		an extensive dysfunction of the lungs alveolar-capillary barrier has occasionally
		"been observed in other endemic mycoses such as coccidioidomycosis,"
		"cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis and blastomycosis. We describe the first patient"
		with acute paracoccidioidomycosis who developed fatal ARDS accompanied by
		multiple organ injuries. The basis of the rarity of this entity in patients with
		"paracoccidioidomycosis, as well as the reasons that may have lead to the"
		development of ARDS in this patient are discussed.

TI	-	Clinical patterns and characteristics of uveitis in a tertiary center for uveitis
		in China.
PG	-	943-8
AB	-	PURPOSE: To address the clinical pattern and characteristics of uveitis in a
		tertiary center for uveitis in China and compare the similarity and difference in
		the distribution of uveitis entities between China and other countries. METHODS:
		A retrospective study was performed on the patients with uveitis referred to the
		Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center from January 1996 to December 2003. The clinical data
		"including category, etiology, gender, and the age of the patients at uveitis"
		presentation were analyzed and compared with studies published previously from
		other countries. RESULTS: There were 902 male and 850 female patients in our
		series. The mean age of these patients at uveitis presentation was 33.8 +/- 16.5
		"years. Anterior uveitis (800, 45.6%) was the most common anatomical entity,"
		"followed by panuveitis (727, 41.5%), posterior uveitis (119, 6.8%), and"
		"intermediate uveitis (106, 6.1%). Further classification with the etiology"
		"criteria revealed 16 entities in anterior uveitis, with idiopathic anterior"
		"uveitis being the most common entity (473, 27.0%). Twelve entities were"
		"identified in panuveitis, of which Behçet disease (289, 16.5%) and"
		"Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome (278, 15.9%) were the predominant ones. No"
		specific entity was recognized in the intermediate uveitis group. Although a
		"number of specific entities were identified in posterior uveitis, toxoplasmosis"
		was noted in only two patients in this group. CONCLUSIONS: Idiopathic anterior
		"uveitis, Behçet disease, and VKH syndrome are the most common entities of uveitis"
		"in China. Ocular toxoplasmosis, ocular histoplasmosis, and birdshot"
		retinochoroidopathy are less common or absent in China.

LID	-	S0036-46652012000200006 [pii]
AB	-	Involvement of the digestive system in patients with acquired immunodeficiency
		syndrome (AIDS) is frequent and many changes in these patients are diagnosed only
		at autopsy. There are few studies of autopsy with detailed analysis of this
		system and only one was conducted in Brazil. We evaluated each segment of the
		digestive system in 93 consecutive autopsies of patients infected with human
		immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the importance of these lesions to death. Of
		"these, 90 (96.8%) patients had AIDS. We reviewed medical records, autopsy reports"
		and histological sections from tongue to rectum stained with hematoxylin-eosin.
		"When necessary, we analyzed special stains and immunohistochemistry to"
		investigate infections. There was damage to the digestive system in 73 (78.5%)
		"cases. The most common infections were candidiasis (42%), cytomegalovirus (29%),"
		"histoplasmosis (11.8%), toxoplasmosis (9.7%) and mycobacterial infection (9.7%)."
		"Malignancies were rare, present in four (4.3%) cases (two Kaposi's sarcoma, one"
		adenocarcinoma and one metastatic embryonal carcinoma). All segments showed
		"lesions: tongue (48.6%), esophagus (44.8%), stomach (44.7%), colon (43.2%) and"
		small intestine (28.9%). The lesions found were immediate cause of death in five
		(5.4%) cases. In another 36 (38.7%) cases the basic disease was systemic and also
		compromised the digestive system.

		"histoplasmosis (13%), toxoplasmosis (10%), pneumocystosis (8%), cryptococcosis"
		"(5%), bacterial sepsis (4%) and other causes (15%). The concordance between the"
		clinical diagnosis before death and the autopsy was 51.9%. The main organ
		involved was the lungs (82.2%). The length of survival from the time of the
		laboratory diagnosis to death ranged from one month to 120 months. The mean
		length of survival was 15 days and 56% died less than one month after the
		"diagnosis, while 15 patients died on the same day that they were diagnosed. These"
		results show the importance of autopsies in elucidating the causes of death among

		Open ddI Treatment Program.
PG	-	924-30
AB	-	The aim of this study was to ascertain the safety profile of didanosine (Videx;
		ddI) within the Canadian Open Treatment Program. Symptomatic HIV+ subjects with
		AIDS or ARC or CD4 < 200/mm3 were eligible to receive didanosine if they were
		"either (a) intolerant to zidovudine (Retrovir, ZDV) or (b) deteriorating despite"
		ZDV therapy. The dose of didanosine (powder formulation) was based on body weight
		"as follows: > or = 75 kg, 375 mg b.i.d.; 50-74 kg, 250 mg b.i.d.; 35-49 kg, 167"
		mg b.i.d. Participants were monitored with physical examinations and prespecified
		laboratory studies by their treating physicians on a monthly basis. Follow-up
		data were collected in a central database through five regional coordinators. A
		"total of 168 physicians across Canada participated in the program, and 825"
		"subjects who started didanosine after July 1, 1990, were included in the"
		"analysis. Of these, 97% were male, 88% homosexual, and 59% had a prior diagnosis"
		"of AIDS. Reasons for enrolling was ZDV intolerance in 39%, failure in 25%, both"
		"in 32%, and other in 4%. Data were prospectively collected until July 31, 1991."
		"Total follow-up was 3,440 patient-months and median follow-up was 4.3 months. A"
		"total of 78 deaths were reported, 44 of which occurred within a month after the"
		last dose of didanosine. Causes of death included AIDS-related unspecified causes
		"(13 patients), MAC (11), wasting (7), AIDS-related CNS involvement other than"
		"OI's (7), Kaposi's sarcoma (7), Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (6), sudden death,"

		recipients - A tertiary care experience.
PG	-	1137-1143
LID	-	10.4103/1319-2442.270270 [doi]
AB	-	Fungal infections are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in renal
		transplant recipients. These infections account for 5% of all infections in renal
		transplant recipients. The symptoms of systemic fungal infections are
		"nonspecific, particularly in their early stages, and this can lead to delay in"
		diagnosis. Retrospective analysis was conducted on all renal transplants that
		were performed at our center over a 20-year period from 1996-2016. Cases of
		invasive fungal infections (IFIs) that occurred among renal transplant recipients
		were identified to describe the epidmeiology of these infections. A total of 67
		(9.2%) IFI cases were identified among 725 renal transplant recipients. Of the 67
		"patients (9.24%) with IFI, 31 (46.2%) cases were seen in deceased donor"
		"transplant recipients. Of 67 cases with IFI, 42 (62.7%) had received induction"
		therapy. The incidence of fungal infections according to the induction agent used
		"was, 14.3% with basiliximab, 12.3% each with daclizumab and rabbit antithymocyte"
		"globulin, and 6.3% among patients not given any induction. Invasive candidiasis"
		"was the most common IFI overall, followed by mucormycosis, invasive"
		"aspergillosis, and cryptococcosis. Median time to onset of IFI was 117.9 days."
		Majority of infections occurred within 180 days after transplantation. Late
		posttransplant (>180 days after transplantation) IFI's were predominantly caused
		"by Candida, followed by Cryptococcus. The longest time to infection was a case of"
		"histoplasma, occurring seven years posttransplant. The overall 12-month"
		cumulative incidence (CI) for any IFI was 9.1%. The 12-month CI of the first IFI
		increased from 7.3% between 1996 and 2001 to 10.5% between 2010 and 2016. The
		overall mortality rate was 38.8%. The use of newer and more-effective
		immunosuppressive agents in recent years are associated with increased rates of
		"fungal infections in renal transplant recipients. Therefore, early detection of"
		fungal infections and proper therapy are important in improving survival and
		reducing mortality.

TI	-	Epidemiology of invasive fungal infections in patients with acquired
		immunodeficiency syndrome at a reference hospital for infectious diseases in
		Brazil.
PG	-	71-8
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-014-9755-3 [doi]
AB	-	Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) represent one of the main causes of
		"morbimortality in immunocompromised patients. Pneumocystosis, cryptococcosis and"
		histoplasmosis are the most frequently occurring IFIs in patients with acquired
		"immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Fungi, such as Candida spp. and Aspergillus"
		"spp., may cause severe diseases during the course of an HIV infection. Following"
		"the introduction of highly active anti-retroviral therapy, there has been a"
		"marked reduction of opportunistic fungal infections, which today is 20-25 % of"
		the number of infections observed in the mid-1990s. This study is an
		observational and retrospective study aimed at the characterising IFI incidence
		"and describing the epidemiology, clinical diagnostic and therapeutic features and"
		"denouement in HIV/AIDS patients. In HIV/AIDS patients, the IFI incidence is"
		"54.3/1,000 hospitalisation/year, with a lethality of 37.7 %. Cryptococcosis"
		"represents the main opportunistic IFI in the population, followed by"
		histoplasmosis. Nosocomial pathogenic yeast infections are caused principally by
		"Candida spp., with a higher candidemia incidence at our institution compared to"
		other Brazilian centres.

AB	-	Fungal prosthetic valve endocarditis is a rare but devastating disease. To better
		"characterise this syndrome, we retrospectively reviewed 21 cases of fungal"
		prosthetic valve endocarditis seen at Mayo Clinic over the past 40 years. The
		average patient age was 65 years with a 2 : 1 male predominance. Twelve of 21
		cases (57%) occurred within 1 year of prosthetic valve placement. The aortic
		"valve was most commonly affected, and the most common aetiological agent was"
		"Candida species, followed by Histoplasma capsulatum. Although 20 of 21 patients"
		"(95%) were immunocompetent, they had other risk factors for fungal infection."
		"Patients typically presented with systemic signs and symptoms of infection, and"
		cardiac imaging was abnormal in 68% of cases. Pathological evaluation of valve
		"material was of high yield, with organisms identified in 92% of cases who"
		underwent valve replacement surgery or had an autopsy performed. Prosthetic valve
		"fungal endocarditis was associated with a high morbidity and mortality, with 67%"
		of patients experiencing complications and 57% of patients dying of
		"infection-related disease. Hopefully, with the prompt institution of early"
		"medical therapy, surgical intervention and lifelong oral antifungal suppressive"
		"therapy, cure rates will continue to improve."

AB	-	Histoplasmosis is a fungal disease caused by Histoplasma capsulatum var.
		capsulatum (Hcc) and H. capsulatum var. duboisii (Hcd). Central nervous system
		"(CNS) involvement is rare. So far, the few cases reported having Histoplasmosis"
		"associated brain abscesses were caused by H. capsulatum var. capsulatum. Herein,"
		we report a unique case of brain abscess caused by H. capsulatum var. duboisii
		"occurring in a 42-year-old immunocompromised woman with HIV. Initially, she"
		"presented with hypothermia, vomiting, frontal headache, evolving over one"
		month. She then progressed to have a generalized seizure. Brain MRI showed
		multifocal brain abscesses and a frontal osteitis. The frontal osteitis was
		biopsied and confirmed the diagnosis of H. capsulatum var. duboisii. She was
		successfully treated with liposomal amphotericin B (150 mg daily) for the first
		four weeks and itraconazole (200mg twice daily) for six months.

		certain granulomatous diseases. The compression of mediastinal structures can
		lead to severe cardiopulmonary symptoms. We report the case of a 50-year-old
		woman who presented with severe bilateral branch pulmonary artery compression 6
		months after bilateral pulmonary artery stenting. We performed bypass surgery
		"with use of a homograft conduit. Seven months postoperatively, the homograft and"

		"activities of daily living, including full-time employment. In addition to"
		"reporting this patient's case, we discuss surgery as an alternative to stenting"
		in patients with fibrosing mediastinitis.

AB	-	Infection with Histoplasma capsulatum typically manifests as a self-limiting
		pulmonary disease in immunocompetent patients. Systemic symptoms such as
		cutaneous lesions are associated with immunodeficient states. Our patient was an
		immunocompetent 68-year-old male who presented with a plaque on his left
		infraorbital area that was concerning for malignancy. Histological examination of
		the lesion revealed granulomatous inflammation and small yeast forms suggestive
		of H. capsulatum. The lesion resolved spontaneously and recurred 1 year later. On
		"recurrence, histological examination again revealed yeast forms consistent with"
		H. capsulatum. Serum and urine testing for H. capsulatum antigen were negative.
		"Next-generation sequencing detected H. capsulatum, which supported the diagnosis"
		of a cutaneous infection. The patient was prescribed and started treatment with
		"itraconazole for 1 year after recurrence of the lesion, and he has not reported"
		further disease recurrence to date. This case is unique because of the
		"presentation of a primary cutaneous recurrent H. capsulatum lesion, and it"
		demonstrated the utility of laboratory testing in its diagnosis.

TI	-	Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy: natural history.
PG	-	639-48
AB	-	PURPOSE: The present study was performed to clarify the long-term natural history
		"of polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV). DESIGN: Prospective, consecutive"
		observational case series. METHODS: Fourteen eyes of 12 consecutive patients with
		PCV were prospectively followed in our clinic for at least 2 years without any
		treatment after a first visit to the clinic between February 1996 and November
		"1998. All patients underwent complete ophthalmologic examination, color fundus"
		"photography, and fluorescein and indocyanine green (ICG) angiography at regular"
		intervals. Inclusion criteria were as follows: eyes had serous and/or hemorrhagic
		"pigment epithelium detachment (PED) and retinal detachment in the posterior pole,"
		and ICG angiography revealed a branching vascular network with polypoidal
		dilations at the terminals of the network. Exclusion criteria were as follows:
		"other diseases such as exudative age-related macular degeneration, high myopia,"
		"angioid streaks, and presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome, and patients who"
		previously underwent any ocular surgery. RESULTS: Patients were followed for mean
		"of 39.9 months (range, 24-54 months). PCV was present in 10 (83%) men and two"
		"women and in the elderly (mean age 68.1 years), usually unilateral (83%) with"
		"vascular lesions located at the macula (93%). The PCV manifested in two patterns,"
		"exudative and hemorrhagic. In the exudative pattern, serous PED and retinal"
		detachment were predominant at the macula. The hemorrhagic pattern was
		characterized by hemorrhagic PED and subretinal hemorrhage at the macula. ICG
		angiography revealed polypoidal choroidal neovascularization that was changeable
		"in appearance and repeatedly grew and spontaneously regressed, but the vascular"
		"network persisted. In some eyes, a collection of small aneurysmal dilations of"
		vessels resembling a cluster of grapes appeared and all of them had marked
		bleeding and leakage and worse outcome. CONCLUSION: Polypoidal choroidal
		vasculopathy is a long persistent chronic disease and the patients had a variable
		course. Fifty percent of the patients had a favorable course. In the remaining
		"half of the patients, the disorder persisted for a long time with occasional"
		"repeated bleeding and leakage, resulting in macular degeneration and visual loss."
		Eyes with a cluster of grapes-like polypoidal dilatations of the vessels had a
		high risk for severe visual loss.

TI	-	[Fungemia in patients with HIV infection].
PG	-	523-7
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To make an analysis of fungemia in HIV-infected patients in our
		hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively (1989-1997) studied all
		"HIV-infected patients with positive blood cultures for Candida sp., Cryptococcus"
		neoformans or any other fungal infection. RESULTS: C. neoformans was isolated in
		11 patients (10 men and 1 woman): Six were treated with amphotericin B and 5 with
		fluconazole. 2 patients died during the acute phase and the infection relapsed in
		3. Blood culture for Candida sp. were positive in 9 (8 men and 1 woman): only a
		case was nosocomial. Seven patients were intravenous drug users and the
		"presenting manifestations were autolimited candidemia in 3, aortic and tricuspid"
		endocarditis in 1 and 2 cases respectively and pneumonia in another one. Six C.
		"albicans, 2 C. krusei and 1 C. glabrata were isolated. 3 patients received"
		amphotericin B and 3 received fluconazole. 2 patients suffering from endocarditis
		"died and so did the patient with C. glabrata infection. A patient, who denied"
		"having travelled to endemic areas, developed histoplasmosis; blood culture was"
		positive for H. capsulatum. He initially had a good response to amphotericin B
		and itraconazole. CONCLUSIONS: Fungemia is not frequent in HIV-infected patients.
		Cryptococcosis and histoplasmosis occur in advanced HIV-patients and candidemia
		is fundamentally associated with intravenous drug use.

TI	-	[Primary adrenal failure and AIDS: report of 11 cases and review of the
		literature].
PG	-	74-9
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To know the prevalence of adrenal insufficiency (AI) in our patients
		with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and to compare the clinical
		manifestations with those reported in previous series in the literature. PATIENTS
		AND METHODS: Retrospective study with review of clinical records of patients with
		AIDS diagnosed of AI (plasma cortisol after synthetic ACTH < 18 micrograms/dl) in
		our hospital for a period of 6 and a half years. RESULTS: Eleven out of 65
		patients (17%) with the hormonal study performed were diagnosed of AI. The
		prevalence of AI in our patients with AIDS was 1.66%. The response of plasma
		cortisol to synthetic ACTH was abnormal in the 11 patients (mean increase: 1.89
		micrograms/dl). Nine out of the 11 patients had a decreased basal plasma cortisol
		level (mean: 4.75 micrograms/dl). Basal plasma ACTH levels were increased (mean:
		638.9 pg/ml) in seven out of nine patients. Patients were severely
		immunosuppressed (mean CD4: 21/microliter). While the clinical course was
		"subacute (mean: 5.1 weeks), nine out of the eleven patients developed an adrenal"
		crisis which required emergency therapy. Ten patients had an opportunist
		"infection--M. tuberculosis (3), M. avium-intracellulare (3), Cytomegalovirus (3),"
		histoplasmosis (1)--which could involve the adrenal glands in ten patients. All
		patients responded to treatment but their mean survival was 5.6 weeks.
		CONCLUSIONS: Although the prevalence of AI in our patients with AIDS was low
		"(1.66%), it is important to be aware of the disease and to order a basal plasma"
		"cortisol value after synthetic ACTH, as treatment improves the life quality of"
		"patients if AI is confirmed, despite a short survival time."

TI	-	Surgical and long-term antifungal therapy for fungal prosthetic valve
		endocarditis.
PG	-	538-43
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Fungal prosthetic valve endocarditis is an uncommon but serious
		disease. We have developed a strategy of treatment that includes perioperative
		"amphotericin B, radical debridement of infected tissue, reconstruction using"
		"biologic tissue when possible, and prolonged oral suppressive antifungal therapy."
		METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 12 patients reoperated on for
		fungal prosthetic valve endocarditis involving the aortic valve (10 patients: six
		"porcine valves, two mechanical valves, two homografts) and the mitral valve (2"
		"patients, both porcine valves). Prosthetic valve endocarditis developed in 7"
		within 12 months after the first valve procedure. The organisms included Candida
		"species (9 patients), Scopulariopsis brevicaulis (1), Saccharomyces cervisiae"
		"(1), and histoplasmosis (1). RESULTS: At operation, all patients had prosthetic"
		"vegetations, 8 had abscesses, and 4 had sinus tracts. Seven received aortic"
		"homografts, 4 received porcine valves (two mitral), and 1 received a mechanical"
		prosthesis. Two patients died in the hospital after prolonged illnesses (83%
		hospital survival). Four patients had recurrence an average of 25 months later
		and 3 underwent further surgical intervention. One patient had recurrence and
		died 17 months postoperatively. One other late death occurred 96 months after
		"operation, and there was no evidence of recurrence. Eight patients (67%) are"
		"alive and well 51.5 +/- 61.0 months (range, 1 to 189 months) after the first redo"
		procedure for fungal prosthetic valve endocarditis. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that
		"preoperative treatment with amphotericin B, radical resection of all infected"
		"tissue, cardiac reconstruction using biologic tissue when possible, and life-long"

AB	-	Histoplasmosis is a systemic fungal mycosis caused by Histoplasma capsulatum. It
		is a dimorphic fungus which lives as a saprophyte in the environment and
		occasionally infects immunosuppressed people. H capsulatum is a ubiquitous fungus
		present throughout the globe and is more common in the temperate world. Human
		infection with H capsulatum occurs through respiratory route by inhalation of
		spores present in the air as droplet nuclei. Pulmonary histoplasmosis is
		"difficult to diagnose, more so in the regions where tuberculosis is endemic, and"
		"many infected patients remain asymptomatic. In the case of immunosuppression,"
		clinical symptoms of pulmonary infection may be seen along with chances of
		dissemination. We report a case of chronic pulmonary histoplasmosis in an
		immunocompetent individual.

		"data suggested prolongation of the asymptomatic phase of HIV infection, median"
		survival after AIDS diagnosis remained approximately 12 months.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Infective endocarditis caused by the dimorphic fungus Histoplasma
		"capsulatum is extremely rare, occurring predominantly in individuals with"
		"prosthetic heart valves and HIV infection. To our knowledge, no case of H."
		capsulatum native valve endocarditis has been reported in Asia. Methodology. A
		"descriptive study was carried out at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital,"
		"Bangkok, Thailand, in 2020. RESULTS: A previously healthy 34-year-old man"
		"developed fever, umbilicated skin lesions, oral ulcers, hoarseness of voice,"
		"severe weight loss, and progressive dyspnea over the course of one week. Facial"
		"umbilicated papules, nodular ulcers in his tongue and palate, a diastolic"
		"rumbling murmur at the mitral valve, diffuse fine crackles in both lungs, and"
		engorged neck veins were detected during the examination. Skin scraping of the
		"facial lesion revealed both extracellular and intracellular yeasts with buddings,"
		2-4 μm in size on Wright's stain. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated a
		"left ventricular ejection fraction of 54 percent, severe rheumatic mitral"
		"stenosis, and multiple oscillating masses in the anterior mitral valve leaflet"
		ranging in dimension from 1.5 to 2.4 cm. The HIV antibody test was negative. H.
		"capsulatum endocarditis was diagnosed, and liposomal amphotericin B was"
		"administered. Due to cardiogenic shock, emergency open-heart surgery was"
		"conducted one day after admission. However, he died of multiorgan failure four"
		days after the operation. The skin and vegetation cultures finally grew H.
		"capsulatum after 1 week of incubation. CONCLUSIONS: To date, there has been"
		handful of cases of H. capsulatum native valve endocarditis in non-HIV-infected
		"patients. We report herein the first case in Thailand. Umbilicated skin lesions,"
		"especially combined with oral mucosal lesions, are a clinical clue that leads to"
		the correct diagnosis of the causative organism.

TI	-	Rare AIDS-defining diseases in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study.
PG	-	399-402
AB	-	The objective of this study was to investigate the spectrum and frequency of rare
		AIDS-defining diseases in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study. AIDS-defining diseases
		contributing less than 1% to the absolute number of all recorded AIDS-defining
		"diseases in at least one of five periods (1988-1990, 1991-1992, 1993-1994,"
		"1995-1996, 1997) were defined as being rare. A total of 9110 HIV-infected"
		"subjects were included in this study. Over the entire 9-year period, the"
		following rare diseases were diagnosed: progressive multifocal
		"leukoencephalopathy (n = 138), disseminated cryptococcosis (n = 67), visceral"
		"herpes simplex disease (n = 66), primary cerebral lymphoma (n = 65),"
		"indeterminate cerebral lesion (n = 50), cryptococcal meningitis (n = 34),"
		"Mycobacterium kansasii disease (n = 32), recurrent Salmonella septicemia (n ="
		"22), intestinal isosporiasis (n = 21), candidiasis of the trachea, bronchi and"
		"lungs (n = 19), toxoplasma retinitis (n = 16), disseminated toxoplasmosis (n ="
		"8), invasive cervical carcinoma (n = 8), extrapulmonary Pneumocystis disease (n ="
		"5), disseminated histoplasmosis (n = 1) and disseminated coccidioidomycosis (n ="
		1). Rare diseases accounted for 7.3% of all AIDS-defining diseases over the
		entire 9-year period. Physicians should be aware of the likelihood of a broad
		spectrum of AIDS-defining diseases in HIV-infected patients.

AB	-	A 35-year-old African American woman with HIV/AIDS presented with altered mental
		status. A CT of the head revealed an infiltrating hypodense intra-axial mass
		"within the basal forebrain. Lumbar puncture showed a lymphocytic pleocytosis,"
		elevated protein and low glucose. PCR analysis of the CSF was negative for
		"Mycobacterium tuberculosis, HSV, VZV, CMV and JC virus. There was low positivity"
		for EBV DNA. Serologic studies were consistent with past infections with EBV and
		"CMV and were negative for toxoplasmosis, histoplasmosis, Cryptococcus and West"
		Nile virus. VDRL was non-reactive. CSF and blood cultures were negative. She soon
		expired. Post-mortem examination of the patient's brain showed a poorly
		delineated area of softening and hemorrhage within the basal forebrain.
		Histologic examination revealed necrotizing encephalitis with perivascular
		lymphocytes and glial cells with numerous cytoplasmic and intranuclear
		inclusions. Immunohistochemistry was strongly positive for adenovirus and
		"negative for HSV, CMV, SV40 and EBV. Electron microscopy confirmed the presence"
		virions consistent with adenovirus. We conclude that adenovirus is a rare and
		sometimes unsuspected cause of encephalitis that may present as a forebrain mass
		lesion.

LID	-	e00692
AB	-	Histoplasma capsulatum is typically an indolent disease among immunocompetent
		"patients. However, immunocompromised patients, such as solid organ transplant"
		"recipients, are at risk of developing severe histoplasmosis. Yet post-transplant"
		"histoplasmosis is a rare pathology, representing less than five percent of"
		"invasive fungal infections among transplant recipients. Furthermore, patients"
		"tend to present with nonspecific clinical symptoms, complicating timely diagnosis"
		and delaying treatment. Disease features that may be more representative of H.
		"capsulatum infection, such as anemia, leukopenia and pulmonary involvement are"
		"often not present until late in the disease course, when the patient is at"
		greater risk of decompensation. Unlike H. capsulatum infections among
		"immunocompetent hosts, extrapulmonary infection among immunocompromised hosts is"
		more the rule than the exception. Treatment with liposomal amphotericin B
		"followed by oral itraconazole is the standard therapy, but special considerations"
		"must be made for patients with hepatic and/or renal insufficiency, underlying"
		cardiac abnormalities or malabsorptive pathologies and doses of
		immunosuppressants will need to be adjusted for drug interactions. Herein we
		present a case of H. capsulatum infection presenting with generalized
		lymphadenopathy post-renal transplant.

		"(var. duboisii), India, and Southeast Asia. H. capsulatum infection is rarely"
		"diagnosed in Italy, while in Latin America, progressive disseminated"
		histoplasmosis (PDH) is one of the most frequent AIDS-defining illnesses and
		causes of AIDS-related deaths. We report a case of PDH and new HIV infection
		"diagnosis in a Cuban patient, who has been living in Italy for the past 10 years."
		Bone marrow aspirate and peripheral blood smear microscopy suggested H.
		capsulatum infection. The diagnosis was confirmed with the culture method
		identifying its thermal dimorphism. Liposomal amphotericin B was administered
		"alone for 10 days and then for another 2 days, accompanied with voriconazole; the"
		former was stopped for probable side effects (persistent fever and worsening
		"thrombocytopenia), and voriconazole was continued to complete 4 weeks. PDH"
		maintenance treatment consisted of itraconazole for one year. Antiretroviral
		therapy (ART) was started on the third week of antifungal treatment. At the
		"3-year follow-up, the patient is adherent on ART, the virus was suppressed, and"
		she has an optimal immune recovery. This case highlights the need to suspect
		histoplasmosis in the differential diagnosis of opportunistic infections in
		"immunocompromised persons, native to or who have traveled to endemic countries."

TI	-	Rare case of Histoplasma capsulatum endocarditis in a patient with a prosthetic
		valve.
PG	-	ytac086

LID	-	ytac086
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of fungal endocarditis can be challenging, especially among"
		"cases with negative blood culture results. Of fungal endocarditis cases,"
		Histoplasma capsulatum constitutes an even smaller proportion with ∼58 prior
		cases reported. Due to the rarity of histoplasmosis endocarditis and thus limited
		"data, there is no current diagnostic guideline for testing within culture"
		negative infective endocarditis. CASE SUMMARY: Our patient was a 58-year-old
		"female presenting with worsening dyspnoea, hypotension, and near-syncope. In this"
		"case report, we depict the clinical presentation and diagnosis of H. capsulatum"
		endocarditis in a female patient with a prosthetic aortic valve and negative
		blood cultures. We further demonstrate the rising risk of fungal endocarditis
		with use of external devices. DISCUSSION: Despite the rarity of fungal
		"endocarditis, there has been a recent upward trend in infections given the rising"
		"use of external devices, greater number of immunocompromised patients, and rising"
		"rates of intravenous drug use. Recently, more cases of fungal endocarditis have"
		been occurring in patients with prosthetic valves compared to native. Although H.
		"capsulatum constitutes a smaller proportion of fungal endocarditis cases,"
		patients with appropriate risk factors and those who have been exposed to at-risk
		"areas such as the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys, may benefit from further"
		evaluation.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Deep mycoses and pseudomycoses (DMP) may cause significant disability
		"and even death; however, the reports regarding these diseases, mainly affecting"
		"the foot, are scarce. OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiological, clinical, and"
		diagnostic characteristics of DMP of the foot in 160 patients. METHODS: A
		retrospective and observational study of DMP affecting the foot was carried out
		in a tertiary-care center in Mexico for 20 years (from January 2000 to December
		2019). Cases with confirmatory microbiological studies were included; the
		identification of the isolated fungi was based on the forms of reproduction. For
		"actinomycetes, morphological analysis in an automated system ATB Vitek® 1574"
		"(Biomèrieux) was used. The fungi were identified by PCR, using several primers"
		from the ITS regions and for actinomycetes in the 16S rRNA region. Data from
		histopathological studies were also collected. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty
		proven cases of DMP of the foot were included. The cases were categorized into
		nine types of infections including mycetoma (actinomycetoma and eumycetoma) in
		"102 cases (63.7%); sporotrichosis in 21 cases (13.1%); chromoblastomycosis, 18"
		"cases (11.2%); phaeohyphomycosis, 3 cases (1.8%); histoplasmosis, 12 cases"
		(7.5%); coccidioidomycosis 2 cases (1.2%) and botryomycosis and nocardiosis with
		one case respectively (0.6%). Most cases developed after traumatic implantation
		"(147 cases, 91.8%). One hundred fifteen cases (71.8%) were men. The evolution was"
		chronic in 125 cases (78.2%); bone involvement was observed in 64 cases (40%).
		Parasitic forms were observed In 139 cases (86.8%). The isolation and
		identification of the etiological agents were confirmed in all cases. CONCLUSION:
		The main DMP affecting the foot were infections due to traumatic implantation;
		most were endemic mycoses. The clinical characteristics and the evolution of the
		"diseases are easily misdiagnosed, and thus, diagnostic tests are usually"
		required.

LID	-	ytz127
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Histoplasma capsulatum is an extremely rare cause of prosthetic valve
		endocarditis (PVE) and can present with non-specific symptoms leading to a delay
		in diagnosis with unfavourable outcomes. CASE SUMMARY: A 65-year-old male patient
		with a history of a bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement and non-obstructive
		"coronary artery disease was admitted for altered mentation, failure to thrive,"
		and a 20-pound unintentional weight loss over the past 4 months. Upon
		"examination, he was lethargic but afebrile and haemodynamically stable. A late"
		peaking ejection murmur was heard on exam. Skin exam was significant for embolic
		phenomenon involving the extremities. Inflammatory markers and serum calcium were
		elevated. A bedside echocardiogram showed severe obstruction across the aortic
		"valve prosthesis. Two years prior, he had an echocardiogram with a normal"
		functioning prosthesis. Routine blood cultures were negative and serologic
		screening was unrevealing. Urine Histoplasma antigen screen was positive on
		"hospital day 3 and on hospital day 10, fungal blood cultures were positive for H."
		"capsulatum. Unfortunately, the patient died shortly afterwards as a result of"
		multiorgan failure from embolic manifestations of the infection. DISCUSSION:
		Based on our patient's findings and those of previously reported cases in the
		"literature, H. capsulatum PVE should be strongly considered in patients from"
		endemic areas with non-specific symptoms and negative routine blood cultures.

TI	-	Visual outcome after surgical removal of choroidal neovascularization in
		pediatric patients.
PG	-	1373-8
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To assess the visual outcome after surgical removal of choroidal
		"neovascularization (CNV) in pediatric patients. METHODS: A retrospective,"
		"noncomparative, consecutive case series of 17 eyes undergoing surgical removal of"
		CNV of various causes in patients aged 18 years and younger. RESULTS: The cause
		"of the CNV was presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome in 11 eyes, idiopathic in"
		"3, and optic nerve coloboma, ocular toxoplasmosis, and trauma in 1 eye each. Two"
		eyes had CNV within 100 microm of the center of the foveal avascular zone
		"(juxtafoveal CNV) and 1 eye had peripapillary CNV, while 14 eyes had CNV beneath"
		the geometric center of the foveal avascular zone (subfoveal CNV). In eyes with
		"subfoveal CNV, median preoperative Snellen visual acuity was 20/200 (range,"
		"20/80-3/200). With a median follow-up of 27 months (range, 6-45 months), median"
		"final visual acuity was 20/50 (range, 20/20-2/200); 10 (72%) had improvement of 2"
		"or more Snellen lines after surgery, and 6 eyes (43%) had final visual acuity of"
		"20/40 or better. In 3 eyes with juxtafoveal CNV or peripapillary CNV, all eyes"
		had improvement of 4 or more Snellen lines. Postoperative recurrent CNV developed
		in 6 (35%) of 17 patients; 2 of the eyes underwent a second vitrectomy and 4
		received laser treatment for the recurrences. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients may
		"have good recovery of vision after surgical removal of CNV, and the removal of"
		these membranes may be a viable alternative to laser photocoagulation in
		pediatric patients.

PG	-	781-4
LID	-	10.1016/j.jaad.2008.07.014 [doi]
AB	-	Toxoplasmosis is a rare and often fatal complication of hematopoietic stem cell
		transplantation (HSCT). The diagnosis of toxoplasmosis is usually made at autopsy
		because of the variety of systemic manifestations and the difficulty of diagnosis
		by serologic methods in the severely immunocompromised patient. Cutaneous
		toxoplasmosis in this setting is extremely rare and is difficult to diagnose with
		certainty because of the morphologic similarity of Toxoplasma gondii to other
		"organisms, such as Leishmania and Histoplasma species. We report a patient who"
		"developed systemic toxoplasmosis, manifested as encephalitis and cutaneous"
		"lesions, after HSCT. Findings of a skin biopsy led to a tentative histologic"
		"diagnosis of toxoplasmosis, confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)"
		"examination of the skin biopsy and cerebrospinal fluid. This is, to our"
		"knowledge, the first report of cutaneous toxoplasmosis diagnosed by skin biopsy"
		confirmed by PCR and sequencing. This disease may be more common than is
		generally appreciated in severely immunocompromised patients. PCR is a valuable
		adjunct to diagnosis.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Infection with Histoplasma capsulatum (H. capsulatum) can lead to
		disseminated disease involving the gastrointestinal tract presenting as diffuse
		abdominal pain and diarrhea which may mimic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
		CASE SUMMARY: We report a case of 12-year-old boy with presumptive diagnosis of
		"Crohn disease (CD) that presented with several months of abdominal pain, weight"
		loss and bloody diarrhea. Colonoscopy showed patchy moderate inflammation
		"characterized by erythema and numerous pseudopolyps involving the terminal ileum,"
		"cecum, and ascending colon. Histologic sections from the colon biopsy revealed"
		diffuse cellular infiltrate within the lamina propria with scattered histiocytic
		"aggregates, and occasional non-necrotizing granulomas. Grocott-Gomori's"
		Methenamine Silver staining confirmed the presence of numerous yeast forms
		"suggestive of Histoplasma spp., further confirmed with positive urine Histoplasma"
		"antigen (6.58 ng/mL, range 0.2-20 ng/mL) and serum immunoglobulin G antibodies to"
		"Histoplasma (35.9 EU, range 10.0-80.0 EU). Intravenous amphotericin was"
		administered then transitioned to oral itraconazole. Follow-up computed
		tomography imaging showed a left lower lung nodule and mesenteric lymphadenopathy
		consistent with disseminated histoplasmosis infection. CONCLUSION:
		Gastrointestinal involvement with H. capsulatum with no accompanying respiratory
		symptoms is exceedingly rare and recognition is often delayed due to the
		overlapping clinical manifestations of IBD. This case illustrates the importance
		"of excluding infectious etiologies in patients with ""biopsy-proven"" CD prior to"
		initiating immunosuppressive therapies. Communication between clinicians and
		pathologists is crucial as blood cultures and antigen testing are key studies
		that should be performed in all suspected cases of histoplasmosis to avoid
		misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment.

AB	-	Histoplasma capsulatum is the most common endemic mycosis worldwide. Although
		most of the globe's largest urban hubs fall outside this organism's regions of
		"endemicity, clinicians practicing in a metropolis like New York City or Los"
		Angeles must nevertheless remain vigilant for histoplasmosis because of the large
		immigrant population that is served by its hospitals. H. capsulatum infection
		ranges from asymptomatic pulmonary infection to life-threatening diffuse
		pneumonia with dissemination. The early years of the AIDS epidemic first
		introduced U.S. clinicians working in areas previously unfamiliar with
		histoplasmosis to newly immunocompromised patients from endemic regions
		presenting with disseminated H. capsulatum originally acquired in their home
		countries. Improvement in HIV prevention and therapeutics has reduced the
		frequency of such cases. Herein we report three cases of histoplasmosis
		encountered in our New York City institution over the last three years to
		emphasize that awareness of this infection remains mandatory for the frontline
		urban clinician.

		literature review.
PG	-	514-523
LID	-	10.1177/11206721221112537 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: To report on the outcome of surgical submacular choroidal neovascular
		membrane (CNV) removal in children and to perform a comprehensive review of
		literature concerning this intervention in children. METHODS: In this
		"retrospective, noncomparative, interventional case series, we included 8 eyes of"
		7 consecutive children with subfoveal choroidal neovascularization treated by
		pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) and CNV removal. Main outcome measures were visual
		acuity and complications. RESULTS: Mean age at surgery was 8.6 ± 5.2 years
		(range: 2-16). Two out of 8 eyes were idiopathic. Corrected-distance visual
		acuity (CDVA) improved from 1.01 ± 0.45logMAR (range:0.3-1.5) at presentation to
		0.60 ± 0.37 (range:0-1) at last follow-up (p = 0.03). Mean follow-up was
		3.9 ± 3.9 years. Six eyes received at least one intravitreal injection of
		bevacizumab prior to surgery. Recurrence occurred in one eye with Best's
		disease.Literature review revealed a total of 42 cases with the most frequent
		etiologies being Presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome (POHS) and idiopathic
		"CNV. Considering all cases together, mean CDVA improved from 1.00 ± 0.37logMAR to"
		"0.52 ± 0.42 (p < 0.01). CNV recurrence occurred in 11 eyes (22.0%), 7 of which"
		had an inflammatory etiology. Other complications included pigment epithelium
		"tear, atrophy and retinal tear. CONCLUSION: Surgical removal of CNV is a viable,"
		effective and safe option in children with persistent submacular neovascular
		membranes.

PG	-	1319-1325
LID	-	10.12998/wjcc.v8.i7.1319 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Sjögren syndrome (SS) is a chronic and systemic autoimmune disease
		characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of the exocrine glands. And
		histoplasmosis is an invasive mycosis caused by the saprophytic dimorphic fungus
		"H. capsulatum. In patients with primary SS (PSS), disseminated histoplasmosis"
		(DH) is extremely rare. CASE SUMMARY: We report a 37-year-old female patient
		"admitted to our hospital with exacerbating fatigue, somnolence, and pancytopenia"
		"as the main symptoms. She was eventually diagnosed with DH based on pancytopenia,"
		"splenomegaly, and findings of bone marrow smears. The atypical clinical symptoms"
		"made the diagnosis process more tortuous. Unfortunately, she died of respiratory"
		failure on the day the diagnosis was confirmed. CONCLUSION: We present a rare and
		interesting case of DH in a PSS patient. This case updates the geographic
		"distribution of histoplasmosis in China, and expands the clinical manifestations"
		"of DH in PSS, highlighting the significance of constantly improving the"
		understanding of PSS with DH.

AB	-	Histoplasma capsulatum is a dysmorphic fungus distributed worldwide commonly
		associated with pulmonary histoplasmosis. We report the case of an unusual
		presentation of gastrointestinal histoplasmosis leading to the obstruction of the
		"intestinal lumen in a 30-year-old female, HIV positive, admitted to the hospital"
		due to chronic abdominal pain and constipation. An initial abdominal CT revealed
		"a mass in the sigmoid colon. A further colonoscopy showed an infiltrating,"
		friable mass obstructing 80% of the lumen staining positive for H. capsulatum.
		The unspecific nature of the patient's symptoms along with the unusual
		presentation of the infection raises awareness about the importance of including
		new pathologies to differential diagnoses when treating AIDS patients.

AB	-	Histoplasmosis is a world-wide distributed deep mycosis caused by Histoplasma
		capsulatum which has been endemic in many countries. We present a case involving
		an immunocompetent man evidencing the necessity of a multidisciplinary approach
		and rational requisition of exams. The disease has started as a pulmonary disease
		"mimicking tuberculosis, although the exams have been negative. Immunodiffusion"
		"test indicate histoplasmosis, not confirmed by culture of sputum. After days the"
		patient was forwarded by a private doctor for evaluation of oral lesions at our
		Department of Stomatology. An incisional biopsy revealed a nonspecific
		granulomatous inflammation and the Grocott-Gomori methenamine silver stain
		identified scarce oval structures that could represent fungal yeast. Sampling
		"oral lesions with swab, it was observed the typical growth of H. capsulatum on"
		culture. This case highlights the importance of doctor's integration diagnosing
		"histoplasmosis, while a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations should be"
		expected. Oral lesions may be the critical manifestation leading diagnosis.

AB	-	Optimal staging and evaluation of residual lesions of invasive fungal infections
		(IFIs) are major challenges in the immunocompromised host. Preliminary data have
		suggested that [¹⁸F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([¹⁸F]FDG) uptake may be observed in the
		course of active invasive fungal infections. The aim of this study was to assess
		the role of positron emission tomography with [¹⁸F]FDG ([¹⁸F]FDG-PET) in the
		diagnosis and staging of IFI. A prospective monocentric study evaluating
		[¹⁸F]FDG-PET in 30 consecutive adults and children with European Organization for
		Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group probable or proven IFI was
		"performed. Twenty males and ten females (median age, 45 years (range 6-7 years))"
		"were enrolled. Twenty-six were immunocompromised, as follows: haematological"
		"malignancy (18) with allogeneic stem cell transplantation (16/18), solid tumour"
		"(three), solid organ transplantation (two), diabetes mellitus (two) and cystic"
		"fibrosis (one). IFIs were acute invasive aspergillosis (ten), chronic"
		"disseminated candidiasis (ten), zygomycosis (two), black grains eumycetoma (two),"
		"pulmonary Histoplasma capsulatum var. capsulatum histoplasmosis (two), and"
		"Phomopsis sp. osteoarthritis, Scedosporium apiospermum and Candida krusei"
		"spondylodiscitis, and acute pulmonary coccidioidomycosis in one case each. An"
		increased uptake of [¹⁸F]FDG was observed in all areas previously identified by
		computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging to be involved by IFI. In
		"4/10 chronic disseminated candidiasis cases, [¹⁸F]FDG-PET revealed small splenic"
		abscesses that were unapparent on the corresponding computed tomography scan.
		[¹⁸F]FDG uptake disappeared after 6 months of antifungal therapy in three
		patients with chronic disseminated candidiasis for whom the [¹⁸F]FDG-PET was
		performed to assess the evolution of the disease. [¹⁸F]FDG-PET could potentially
		be useful for the initial diagnosis and staging of IFI. Whether or not
		[¹⁸F]FDG-PET might be useful for assessing the optimal duration of IFI therapy
		should now be assessed in a specific prospective study.

AB	-	PURPOSE: To evaluate the use of macular translocation surgery 360 in blinding
		submacular diseases other than age-related macular degeneration. METHODS: A
		"retrospective, consecutive case review was performed of subjects treated with"
		macular translocation surgery 360 for a submacular disease other than age-related
		macular degeneration. Primary outcome was change in visual acuity. Clinical data
		"were collected and analyzed, including demographics, visual acuity, imaging"
		"features, surgery details, and complications. RESULTS: The review identified 16"
		subjects who had undergone macular translocation surgery 360 from 1996 to 2009
		for submacular diseases other than age-related macular degeneration. These
		"diseases included Best disease (n = 2), angioid streaks (n = 1), pathologic"
		"myopia (n = 3), punctate inner choroidopathy (n = 2), presumed ocular"
		"histoplasmosis syndrome (n = 3), central serous chorioretinopathy (n = 1),"
		"adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy (n = 3), and North Carolina macular"
		"dystrophy (n = 1). Mean preop visual acuity was 20/135 (range, 20/50-20/500). A ≤"
		3-line acuity loss was seen in 13 of 16 (81%) subjects. Mean postop visual acuity
		"was 20/110 (range, 20/40-20/1,000). The most common postop complications included"
		"epiretinal membrane (50%), cystoid macular edema (31%), residual diplopia (25%),"
		"retinal detachment (13%), and recurrent choroidal neovascularization (13%). Mean"
		"follow-up was 28 months (range, 4-61 months). CONCLUSION: Macular translocation"
		surgery 360 may be considered in subjects with progressive bilateral vision loss
		from various conditions other than age-related macular degeneration. Although a
		"significant number of complications occurred, a large percentage of subjects"
		gained >3 lines of visual acuity (38%) and achieved a final visual acuity of ≥
		20/50 (31%).

LID	-	e01876-20
AB	-	"Outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) is a safe, effective, and"
		convenient treatment strategy for patients receiving intravenous antimicrobials
		"in the outpatient setting; however, data are limited describing the use and"
		safety of liposomal amphotericin B (L-AMB). Records of patients receiving L-AMB
		OPAT between 1/1/2015 and 7/31/2018 were retrospectively reviewed. The primary
		objective was to describe the OPAT patient population discharged on L-AMB and
		evaluate factors associated with readmission and adverse events (AEs). Analysis
		was performed to evaluate for predictors of worse outcomes. Forty-two patients
		"(67% male, median age 50 years) were identified, most of whom were treated for"
		"histoplasmosis. The most common doses of L-AMB were 3 mg/kg (n = 16, 38%) or"
		"5 mg/kg (n = 14, 33%) based on actual body weight. Twenty-six (62%) patients"
		completed their anticipated course of L-AMB. Twenty-two (52%) patients were
		readmitted within 30 days of discharge; median time to readmission was 11 days
		(interquartile range [IQR] 5 to 18). While hypokalemia and acute kidney injury
		"(AKI) were common, occurring in 26 (62%) and 20 (48%) patients, respectively,"
		only 5 (12%) were readmitted to the hospital due to L-AMB-associated AEs. Ninety
		percent of patients achieved at least partial renal recovery within 30 days after
		L-AMB discontinuation. Factors significantly associated with AKI include higher
		"L-AMB dose, lower serum potassium levels after therapy initiation, and receipt of"
		potassium supplementation at discharge. L-AMB is associated with significant AEs;
		"however, these results suggest that treatment is feasible in the outpatient"
		"setting with close monitoring, as the majority of AEs were managed effectively in"
		an outpatient without long-term sequelae.

AB	-	PURPOSE: To describe a case of bilateral infectious scleritis secondary to
		Histoplasma capsulatum in the setting of a locally and systemically
		immunosuppressed patient. OBSERVATIONS: A 45-year-old man with HLA-B27 associated
		"ankylosing spondylitis and anterior uveitis on systemic secokinumab, underwent"
		"bilateral cataract extraction which required extensive peri-operative steroids,"
		"including intravitreal triamcinolone, topical prednisolone, and oral prednisone."
		"Six weeks after cataract surgery, the patient presented with mild eye irritation"
		and was found to have bilateral subconjunctival purulence and necrosis.
		Histoplasma capsulatum was identified on fungal cultures and confirmed by DNA
		probe. The patient was treated with fortified amphotericin drops and oral
		itraconazole with complete resolution of scleritis. CONCLUSION AND IMPORTANCE: H.
		capsulatum is a rare cause of infectious scleritis that must be considered in our
		immunosuppressed and post-surgical patients.

PG	-	e005035

LID	-	e005035
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Diagnosing progressive disseminated histoplasmosis (PDH) in
		patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is diagnostically challenging.
		"Since PDH is lethal when untreated, awareness of this infection in patients with"
		"SLE is of utmost importance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first"
		description of a case of PDH in a patient with SLE in Europe. CASE PRESENTATION:
		"A 56-year-old woman of Surinamese descent with a history of SLE, presented with"
		"fever and polyarthritis. Although a flare of SLE was suspected initially,"
		cultures of bone marrow and broncho-alveolar lavage fluid grew Histoplasma
		capsulatum. CONCLUSION: This case report highlights that physicians should be
		aware of progressive disseminated histoplasmosis in patients with SLE treated
		with immunosuppressive agents. The signs and symptoms can easily mimic a SLE
		"flare, which would then be treated with more aggressive immunosuppression."
		Failure to recognize the infection will therefore invariably lead to death of the
		patient. Progressive disseminated histoplasmosis is usually not recognized by
		"doctors in non-endemic areas such as Europe. However, globalisation and more"
		frequent intercontinental traffic of immunocompromised patients currently
		increases the incidence of histoplasmosis in these areas. It is therefore of
		life-saving importance that doctors are aware of the features of the infection in
		areas where H. capsulatum is not endemic.

TI	-	Molecular identification of fungal pathogens in nodular skin lesions of cats.
PG	-	132-44
LID	-	10.1093/mmy/myu082 [doi]
AB	-	"In a retrospective study, we investigated 52 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded"
		(FFPE) samples from cats with histologically confirmed cutaneous and subcutaneous
		mycoses to determine if the pathogens could be identified by molecular methods.
		Aim of the study was to obtain a deep understanding of the spectrum of infectious
		"agents, which, as we hypothesized, was not available by histopathology alone."
		Detection of feline and fungal DNA was achieved in 92.3% and 94.2% of the
		"samples, respectively. Most of the subcutaneous infections in cats were caused by"
		"Alternaria spp. (63.5%), followed by Cryptococcus neoformans (7.7%), Histoplasma"
		"capsulatum (5.8%), Sporothrix spp. (3.8%), Aspergillus vitricola, Aureobasidium"
		"pullulans, Exophiala attenuata, Fusarium oxysporum, Lecythophora cateniformis,"
		"Microsporum canis, and Phialophora sp. (1.9% each). The results from molecular"
		identification indicate that correct identifications of the fungal pathogens by
		histology alone were rarely possible. The spectrum of fungal pathogens identified
		after DNA extraction from FFPE samples was much broader than that expected by
		classical histopathology. This was especially noted in alternariosis in that the
		micromorphological pattern in tissue was misleading and could be confused with
		"that of cryptococcosis. Due to different susceptibilities to antifungal agents,"
		"it is important to arrive at a definitive diagnosis, which might be possible by"
		"examination of the fungus recovered in culture and/or molecular methods, in"
		addition to the histopathologic techniques.

PG	-	107-13
AB	-	We show the records about diagnosed mycoses in a hospital in Mexico City in two
		"periods of time: from 1967 to 1977 and from 1993 to 1997. In the former 15,429"
		"patients were studied and in the latter, 5,998. Striking differences among"
		"frequency, etiological agents and clinical outcome, were observed. The most"
		"frequent infections in both lapses were the superficial ones, however the most"
		recent scores showed a notorious increase in opportunistic infections. We
		diagnosed only one histoplasmosis case during the period from 1993 to 1997.
		"Etiological agents have also changed, dermatophytes frequency like Trichophyton"
		mentagrophytes and T. tonsurans have diminished while T. rubrum increased from
		60% to 80% of the whole dermatophytoses cases. Even though Criptococcus
		"neoformans used to be the only agent causing criptococosis, in the most recent"
		"report we found that C. laurentii, C. terreus and C. unigutulatus were also"
		isolated. Another important difference was mortality in rhinocerebral
		"mucormicosis: twenty years ago it was fairly 80%, nowadays it has decreased to"
		20%.

AB	-	CASE SUMMARY: Based on demonstration of the yeast phase of Histoplasma capsulatum
		"on fine-needle aspirate cytology of the kidney, a 5-year-old cat was diagnosed"
		with histoplasmosis. Urine and serum were tested for antigen via a Histoplasma
		"antigen enzyme immunoassay. At the time of diagnosis, and on multiple occasions"
		"during antifungal treatment, antigenemia was detected without antigenuria. The"
		cat was treated with standard therapy and achieved clinical remission. RELEVANCE
		AND NOVEL INFORMATION: Diagnosis is most commonly made by finding the yeast phase
		of H capsulatum via cytology of fluid samples or cytology or histopathology of
		"infected tissues. In certain cases this may require invasive tests. Recently, a"
		"non-invasive test, a Histoplasma antigen enzyme immunoassay, has been shown to be"
		a sensitive test for supporting the diagnosis of histoplasmosis in cats. Urine
		has been considered the biologic specimen of choice for antigen testing and there
		is a paucity of information concerning the use of other specimens such as serum.
		The case herein reports a cat with antigenemia without antigenuria. These
		findings suggest that further research is necessary to better understand the
		ideal biologic sample or combination of samples as it pertains to antigen testing
		in cats. It also suggests that to maximize sensitivity both urine and serum may
		need to be tested in cats with suspected histoplasmosis.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus is a public health problem in Mexico, and the trend"
		"of the disease is increasing. From 2000 to 2017, 7.32 million new cases were"
		"diagnosed, with pulmonary mycoses being one of the most serious complications."
		AIMS: To describe the frequency and the clinical characteristics of patients
		"diagnosed with pulmonary mycoses, and to identify the risk factors associated"
		"with this entity. METHODS: Case-control study, paired by gender (1:1-3) and age"
		"(± 5 years), that analyzed patients with pulmonary mycosis (mucormycosis,"
		"histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, blastomycosis, aspergillosis, cryptococcosis,"
		paracoccidioidomycosis) and studied the risk factors present in each patient.
		"RESULTS: From the 162 patients studied, 56 suffered pulmonary mycosis and 106"
		were controls. The median of the age was 51 and 50 years for the cases and for
		"the controls, respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that"
		"patients with diabetes mellitus had an odds ratio of 8,3 (p < 0.001), and"
		"patients with a history of tuberculosis had an odds ratio of 8,8 (p < 0.001)."
		CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that 52% of the patients with pulmonary mycoses had
		a history of diabetes mellitus. Diabetes mellitus is a relevant risk factor for
		"pulmonary mycoses, which are usually diagnosed in advanced stages and have a high"
		mortality.

		America during employment. A positron emission tomography-computed tomography
		"scan revealed prominent hypermetabolic lesions in the cecum and the lung,"
		"pointing towards a malignant disease. Surprisingly, histological examination of"
		"colonic and oral biopsies revealed abundant intracellular fungal elements, highly"
		suspicious of Histoplasma capsulatum. Diagnosis was finally confirmed by
		panfungal polymerase chain reaction. Upon treatment with liposomal amphotericin
		"followed by itraconazole, the severely ill patient showed an impressive clinical"
		response. This case describes a disseminated manifestation of H. capsulatum years
		after the first exposure in an otherwise immunocompetent patient descending from
		a nonendemic area.

PG	-	2913-9
AB	-	We have developed 21 specific nucleic acid probes which target the large subunit
		"rRNA genes from Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus glaucus,"
		"Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus terreus, Blastomyces dermatitidis, Candida"
		"albicans, Candida (Torulopsis) glabrata, Candida guilliermondii, Candida kefyr,"

		"Filobasidiella neoformans var. neoformans, Histoplasma capsulatum,"
		"Pseudallescheria boydii, and Sporothrix schenckii. A section of the 28S rRNA gene"
		"from approximately 100 fungi, representing about 50 species of pathogens and"
		"commonly encountered saprophytes, was sequenced to develop universal PCR primers"
		and species-specific oligonucleotide probes. Each step in the process of
		detection and identification was standardized to a common set of conditions
		applicable without modification to all fungi of interest and all types of
		clinical specimens. These steps consist of DNA extraction by boiling specimens in
		"an alkaline guanidine-phenol-Tris reagent, amplification of a variable region of"
		"the 28S rRNA gene with universal primers, and amplicon identification by probe"
		hybridization or DNA sequencing performed under conditions identical for all
		fungi. The results obtained by testing a panel of fungal isolates and a variety
		of clinical specimens indicate a high level of specificity.

PG	-	243-5
AB	-	A 40-year-old man had new onset of hemoptysis and hematemesis. Bronchoscopy
		"revealed red, inflamed mucosa with apparent rich blood supply in the left primary"
		bronchus. Computed tomography revealed calcified subcarinal lymph nodes with a
		"small extension into the left primary bronchus. Shortly after admission, the"
		patient had an episode of gastrointestinal bleeding. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy
		"showed a lesion in the posterior wall of the esophagus, 12 cm from the upper"
		"incisors. During exploratory thoracotomy, a single piece of irregular-shaped tan"
		"tissue measuring 3.5 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm and engulfing the esophagus, carina, and left"
		"primary bronchus was dissected. A single stonelike mass, or broncholith, was"
		found to involve both the trachea and the esophagus. Microscopic examination
		showed multiple caseating granulomas with surrounding lymphoid tissue and
		"germinal centers. During 12 months of follow-up, the patient has remained"
		asymptomatic. The chronic inflammation in this case suggested granulomatous
		"mediastinitis, a rare disease whose mass-like effects may contribute to"
		structural compression. The trachea and esophagus are rarely involved.
		Tuberculosis and histoplasmosis are thought to be the two most common causes of
		granulomatous mediastinitis. Chronic inflammation leading to calcification and
		"broncholith may invade bronchial lumen or esophageal wall, causing"
		life-threatening hemorrhage and necessitating prompt surgical intervention.

		Biological Immune Modulators.
PG	-	e15709
LID	-	10.7759/cureus.15709 [doi]
LID	-	e15709
AB	-	Histoplasmosis is a fungal disease caused by a dimorphic fungus known as
		"Histoplasma capsulatum (H. capsulatum), which is endemic to areas around river"
		valleys and southeastern states in the United States (US). Patients with
		"histoplasmosis are asymptomatic, and the condition is usually diagnosed by an"
		"incidental finding of a pulmonary granuloma on a chest radiograph. In rare cases,"
		this disease can develop into a progressive disseminated form and cause fatal and
		"diffuse pulmonary infiltrates in immunocompromised adults. Moreover, there is a"
		close association between disseminated histoplasmosis and the use of tumor
		necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Our case report
		discusses a unique presentation of disseminated histoplasmosis in a patient with
		RA who was not on any biological immune modulators. The disseminated
		histoplasmosis in this case was progressive and involved the central nervous
		"system, liver, lungs, and oral mucosa and was treated successfully with"
		amphotericin therapy. We also discuss the disease process in detail and
		hypothesize that RA could be an independent risk factor for the increased
		incidence of disseminated histoplasmosis in adults. Based on the findings in this
		"case report, we recommend screening for latent Histoplasma infections in adults"
		with RA living in endemic areas and keeping a low threshold to evaluate flare-ups
		from this disease regardless of the use of anti-TNF inhibitors. Specific
		experimental and epidemiological studies can be conducted to examine the
		association between RA and similar indolent fungal infections.

TI	-	Role of fine-needle aspiration cytology in early diagnosis of fungal infections.
PG	-	645-651
LID	-	10.1002/dc.24447 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is an important tool for the diagnosis
		"of infectious diseases. In this study, we assessed the efficacy of FNA cytology"
		in early diagnosis of fungal infections. METHODS: This was a retrospective study
		from January 2016 to August 2018. Electronic archives were searched for FNAs from
		superficial and deep lesions obtained from various sites with the diagnosis of
		"fungal infection. Each case was evaluated for underlying predisposing conditions,"
		"FNA source, radiologic findings, culture, and serology results. RESULTS: A total"
		"of 15 cases were identified from the following sites: lung (eight), cervical"
		"lymph nodes (four), soft tissue (two), and retroperitoneal lymph node (one)."
		"Predisposing conditions were found in 11 patients: HIV (five), malignancy"
		"(three), and post-transplant (three). Imaging impression was mostly malignancy vs"
		"infection. In all 15 cases, the diagnosis of fungal infection was done by FNA"
		cytology. The presumptive genus specific diagnoses based on yeast morphology was
		"given in 12 cases (five Histoplasma, four Cryptococcus, and three Coccidioides)."
		"The diagnosis of fungal infection was provided within 24 h in nine cases, four"
		"during onsite evaluation. Microbial cultures were confirmatory in seven cases,"
		and five cases exhibited negative cultures with positive serology. Out of the 15
		"patients, 14 were discharged in fair condition, and one died with complications"
		of heart graft failure. CONCLUSION: FNA is a rapid and reliable method for early
		"diagnosis of fungal infections, allowing a prompt and appropriate management,"
		especially in immunocompromised patients. When onsite evaluation indicates
		"infectious process, cultures can be timely done."

		cases.
PG	-	730-4
LID	-	10.1097/PAS.0b013e3181d9f16a [doi]
AB	-	To better characterize the clinical and pathologic features of granulomatous
		"reaction to Pneumocystis jirovecii, we reviewed 20 cases of this uncommon"
		response. Patients included 15 males and 5 females (mean age 52 y). The most
		common symptom was dyspnea (5 of 14). Primary medical diagnoses included human
		"immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (7 of 20),"
		"hematopoietic (6 of 20), and solid malignancies (4 of 20). Radiology findings"
		included nodular (8 of 16) and diffuse (5 of 16) infiltrates and solitary nodules
		(3 of 16). Diagnostic procedures with the highest yield were open lung biopsy (13
		of 20) and autopsy (5 of 20); false-negative results were most common on
		"bronchial washings/brushings, bronchoalveolar lavage, fine needle aspiration, and"
		"transbronchial biopsy. Follow-up showed resolution of disease (6 of 13), death"
		"from disease (6 of 13), and death from unknown cause (1 of 13). Histologically,"
		clusters of Gomori methenamine silver-positive (20 of 20) Pneumocystis organisms
		were identified in all cases. Organisms were identified within well (16 of 20)
		and poorly (4 of 20) formed necrotizing (16 of 20) and non-necrotizing (4 of 20)
		granulomas ranging in size from 0.1 to 2.5 cm (mean 0.5 cm); granulomas were
		"multiple (18 of 20) or single (2 of 20). Giant cells (11 of 20), a fibrous rim (8"
		"of 20), and eosinophils (6 of 20) were seen. Foamy eosinophilic exudates were"
		present centrally within some granulomas (5 of 20). Cystic spaces (1 of 20) and
		calcification (1 of 20) were rare. Only one case demonstrated classic
		intra-alveolar foamy exudates containing Pneumocystis. Granulomatous P. jirovecii
		pneumonia occurs most commonly in males with human immunodeficiency
		"virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, hematopoietic, and solid malignancies."
		The diagnosis may be overlooked as conventional radiologic and pathologic
		"features are absent. When suspected, open lung biopsy is most likely to yield"
		diagnostic material. Attention to organism morphology avoids misdiagnosis as
		Histoplasma.

		between 1992 and 1997 at the LeBonheur Children's Medical Center. The authors
		have evaluated the results of this treatment. METHODS: Thoracoscopic intervention
		was performed at the fibrinopurulent state of empyema. An irrigating
		"laparoendoscope was inserted, loculi were disrupted, debris was evacuated, and a"
		chest tube was passed through the port site. RESULTS: The patients were aged
		"between 11 months and 16 years (mean, 6.5 years). The etiology of the empyema was"
		"parapneumonic in 17, and there was one case each of perforated appendicitis and"
		mediastinal histoplasmosis. They underwent thoracoscopy at a mean of 4.6 days
		"after hospital admission (range, 1 to 12 days). Chest tubes were removed at 1 to"
		"5 days (mean, 2.9 days) after operation, and resolution of fever occurred at 1 to"
		"9 days (mean, 3.8 days) postoperatively. Patients were discharged home between 4"
		"and 10 days (mean, 6.1 days) postoperatively, and the mean hospital stay was 10.3"
		"days (range, 5 to 21). There were no complications. The surgical technique was"
		"simple and well tolerated, requiring few disposable items, and the mean operating"
		time was 77 minutes. CONCLUSIONS: Thoracoscopy eliminated the morbidity of
		thoracotomy and the discomfort and expense of prolonged chest tube drainage.
		Thoracoscopy may be used as early first-line therapy in a majority of pediatric
		patients with fibrinopurulent empyema.

PG	-	131-9
AB	-	Case records of 232 dogs and 29 cats with neutropenia were reviewed to examine
		the spectrum of underlying etiologies causing the neutropenia. Six etiological
		categories included nonbacterial infectious disease; increased demand due to
		"marked inflammation, bacterial sepsis, or endotoxemia; drug-associated"
		neutropenia; primary bone-marrow disease; immune-mediated neutropenia; and
		diseases of unclear etiology. The largest single category associated with the
		"development of neutropenia was nonbacterial infectious disease (e.g., feline"
		"leukemia virus [FeLV], feline immunodeficiency virus [FIV], histoplasmosis,"
		"cryptococcosis, and parvovirus), with parvovirus infection accounting for 47.1%"
		of all cases. The least common (0.38%) cause was naturally occurring
		immune-mediated neutropenia.

TI	-	Neuroinfection survey at a neurological ward in a Brazilian tertiary teaching
		hospital.
PG	-	1021-5
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: This study was undertaken to characterize the neuroinfection profile
		in a tertiary neurological ward. INTRODUCTION: Neuroinfection is a worldwide
		"concern and bacterial meningitis, tetanus and cerebral malaria have been reported"
		"as the commonest causes in developing countries. METHODS: From 1999 to 2007, all"
		"patients admitted to the Neurology Ward of Hospital das Clínicas, São Paulo"
		University School of Medicine because of neuroinfection had their medical records
		"reviewed. Age, gender, immunological status, neurological syndrome at"
		"presentation, infectious agent and clinical outcome were recorded. RESULTS: Three"
		hundred and seventy four cases of neuroinfectious diseases accounted for 4.2% of
		ward admissions and the identification of infectious agent was successful in 81%
		"of cases. Mean age was 40.5 + 13.4 years, 63.8% were male, 19.7% were"
		immunocompromised patients and meningoencephalitis was the most common clinical
		presentation despite infectious agent. Viruses and bacteria were equally
		"responsible for 29.4% of neuroinfectious diseases; parasitic, fungal and prion"
		"infections accounted for 28%, 9.6% and 3.5% respectively. Human immunodeficiency"
		"virus (HIV), herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1), Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Treponema"
		"pallidum, Taenia solium, Schistosoma mansoni, Cryptococcus neoformans and"
		Histoplasma capsulatum were the more common infectious pathogens in the patients.
		"Infection mortality rate was 14.2%, of which 62.3% occurred in immunocompetent"
		patients. CONCLUSION: Our institution appeared to share some results with
		developed and developing countries. Comparison with literature may be considered
		as quality control to health assistance.

PG	-	475-8
LID	-	10.4103/0019-509X.176749 [doi]
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Most of the adrenal masses are discovered incidentally by imaging
		techniques for reasons unrelated to adrenal diseases. Treatment is based on
		"various factors such as, nature of adrenal mass, age of presentation, size of"
		"tumor, and the functional status of tumor. We report a series of 14 consecutive"
		cases of adrenal tumors treated in a single surgical unit in our hospital. AIM:
		The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical profile and outcome of
		treatment of adrenal tumors treated in a surgical unit. MATERIALS AND METHODS: It
		is a retrospective study data of 14 cases of adrenal tumors treated in a single
		surgical unit in University Hospital over 10 years have been analyzed. Various
		"parameters such as gender, age, size of tumor, functional status, histopathology,"
		"type of management, and outcome have been reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 14"
		patients with adrenal masses were seen over a 10 year period (1997-2006). All
		"were referred cases, either from endocrinology or medicine wards. There were"
		seven female and seven male patients. Mean age of patients was 48.6 years (range
		14-60 years). Mean size of tumor was 8.0 cm (5.9 cm for benign tumors and 9.7 cm
		"for malignant tumors). There were six cases of adrenal carcinoma, four cases of"
		"adrenal myelolipoma, two cases of pheochromocytoma, and one each case of adrenal"
		"hyperplasia and histoplasmosis. There were only two functional tumors. All,"
		except two malignant cases were treated operatively. A total of 5 year survival
		was 100% in benign cases and 27% in malignant tumors. CONCLUSION: Adrenal tumors
		need to be assessed for their functional status and malignant potential prior to
		treatment. Surgical excision is usually curative for benign lesion. Among
		malignant tumors the benefits of surgery depend on local extent and metastatic
		status of tumors.

AB	-	We describe a patient with fibrosing mediastinitis after childhood histoplasmosis
		who presented with severe pulmonary hypertension secondary to pulmonary vein
		stenoses. Stenting of 2 stenosed pulmonary veins via a transseptal approach
		resulted in an immediate decrease in systolic pulmonary artery pressure from 90
		"to 68 mm Hg and improvement in dyspnea and cardiac index, which was sustained at"
		6 months. This case highlights the importance of routinely assessing the
		pulmonary veins during workup for pulmonary hypertension.

		impact of HIV infection.
PG	-	1818-27
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Cough lasting for > or = 3 weeks (i.e., chronic cough) indicates that"
		"a patient has suspected tuberculosis (TB). At the primary health care level, the"
		spectrum of disease that causes chronic cough has not been previously
		investigated in a setting with a high prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus
		(HIV) infection. METHODS: A total of 544 adults with chronic cough were recruited
		"systematically from 2 primary health care clinics, and they were evaluated using"
		preset first- and second-line investigations and diagnostic case definitions.
		RESULTS: The overall prevalence of HIV infection among the study cohort was 83%.
		"TB was the most common diagnosis, with 207 HIV-positive patients (46%) and 27"
		"HIV-negative patients (30%) having confirmed or probable TB. Of these, 145"
		HIV-positive patients with TB (70%) and 20 HIV-negative patients with TB (74%)
		had smear-positive cases of TB. Only 17 HIV-positive and 2 HIV-negative patients
		had smear-negative but culture-positive cases of TB. Lower respiratory tract
		"infections (n = 178; HIV prevalence, 79%) and pneumonia (n = 87; HIV prevalence,"
		"89%) were the next most common diagnoses. Asthma (n = 26; HIV prevalence, 46%),"
		"posttuberculous disease and other fibrotic lung disease (n = 34; HIV prevalence,"
		"88%), and cardiac disease (n = 15; HIV prevalence, 93%) were more common than"
		"were Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia and cryptococcosis (n = 8 and n = 5,"
		"respectively; HIV prevalence, 100%), and we found no cases of nocardiosis or"
		histoplasmosis. CONCLUSIONS: TB was diagnosed for 43% of patients who presented
		"with chronic cough to primary health care clinics in Harare, with 71% having"
		smear-positive disease. The findings of TB culture added relatively little to the
		findings of fluorescent microscopy of concentrated sputum specimens. The
		"prevalence of HIV infection was high across a range of diagnoses, suggesting that"
		an HIV test should be recommended in the initial investigation of chronic cough.

PG	-	841-8
LID	-	10.1177/1098612X12452494 [doi]
AB	-	Feline histoplasmosis is a systemic fungal infection often treated with
		"itraconazole, which can be cost-prohibitive for some clients. Additionally,"
		"although the clinical disease in cats has been documented, sources of Histoplasma"
		species spore exposure in cats have yet to be thoroughly investigated. The
		objectives of this study were to compare the outcomes of cats with histoplasmosis
		"treated with fluconazole to those treated with itraconazole, and to evaluate"
		possible sources of exposure for affected cats. Medical records from feline
		patients with confirmed histoplasmosis (n = 32) at Kansas State University were
		systematically reviewed and follow-up was performed by owner telephone interview.
		Cats treated with fluconazole (n = 17) had similar mortality and recrudescence
		"rates when compared with cats treated with itraconazole (n = 13). Thus,"
		fluconazole may be a viable alternative therapy for the treatment of feline
		histoplasmosis. Eleven cats were housed strictly indoors and possible sources of
		exposure reported for these cats included potted plants (5/11) and unfinished
		basements (6/11).

TI	-	Clinicopathologic study after submacular removal of choroidal neovascular
		membranes treated with verteporfin ocular photodynamic therapy.
PG	-	343-50
AB	-	PURPOSE: To report the clinicopathologic findings after submacular removal of
		choroidal neovascular membranes (CNV) treated with verteporfin ocular
		photodynamic therapy. DESIGN: Interventional case series. METHODS: Retrospective
		review of eight eyes of eight patients who underwent submacular surgery for CNV
		after having previously received verteporfin ocular photodynamic therapy for
		"presumed ocular histoplasmosis (one patient), age-related macular degeneration"
		"([AMD] three patients) pathologic myopia (two patients), punctate inner"
		"choroiditis (one patient), and idiopathic CNV (one patient). All cases had"
		undergone ocular photodynamic therapy with verteporfin using standard protocols.
		Six of eight patients suffered a submacular hemorrhage after ocular photodynamic
		"therapy, and two of eight patients refused further ocular photodynamic therapy."
		All patients subsequently had submacular surgery with removal of the CNV. One
		"membrane was routinely processed, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and"
		eosin. Five membranes were stained with toluidine blue for light microscopic
		examination. Semithin (1.0 microm) sections were cut and stained with uranyl
		acetate-lead citrate for transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: Choroidal
		"neovascular membranes were removed at 3 days (presumed ocular histoplasmosis), 29"
		"days (punctate inner choroiditis), 63 days (AMD, pathologic myopia), 66 days"
		"(AMD), 107 days (pathologic myopia), 116 days (AMD), and 152 days (idiopathic)"
		after verteporfin ocular photodynamic therapy. Histopathologic and
		ultrastructural examination showed areas of vascular occlusion at 3 days that
		were not seen at later time points. All specimens had patent CNV. There were
		"signs of vascular damage with extravasated erythrocytes and fibrin, pigment"
		"clumping in cells, and inflammatory cells in all but the 3-day specimen."
		CONCLUSIONS: This case series presents data only from patients who refused repeat
		treatment with ocular photodynamic therapy or who developed submacular hemorrhage
		after initial photodynamic therapy. Histopathologic evaluation of CNV 3 days
		after verteporfin ocular photodynamic therapy showed partial vascular occlusion
		that was not present in later specimens. These later specimens demonstrated
		evidence of vascular damage. Verteporfin ocular photodynamic therapy does not
		"appear to lead to permanent and complete occlusion of the CNV. Thus, treatments"
		that lead to permanent closure of CNV without damage to the retinal pigment
		epithelium and sensory retina are still needed.

		colonization?
PG	-	604-10
LID	-	10.1159/000354940 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: Flexible bronchoscopy with exfoliative cytology is an important tool
		for the diagnosis of pulmonary fungal infections. The question of colonization
		versus true fungal infection is of critical importance. STUDY DESIGN: A 5-year
		retrospective analysis of all cases of pulmonary fungal infection diagnosed using
		"exfoliative cytology was performed. Clinical, radiological, bronchoscopy and"
		histopathology findings were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 69 cases of mycoses
		were retrieved. The most common fungal organism identified was Aspergillus
		followed by Candida and Pneumocystis. Most cases of Aspergillus and Candida in
		cytological specimens presented as a pulmonary mass or endobronchial growth and
		"were diagnosed as carcinomas in biopsy specimens, thus representing colonization."
		All cases of Pneumocystis with bilateral ground glass infiltrates and
		cryptococcosis with parenchymal mass lesion in radiology represented true
		infection. Histoplasma was identified in pleural fluid from a known case of lung
		carcinoma. CONCLUSION: Aspergillus and Candida species are the most common fungal
		"organisms. Most of these represent colonization of malignant growths. However,"
		true fungal infections may also present as mass lesions and may masquerade
		malignancy clinically. Fluid cytological examination is an important diagnostic
		"modality for pulmonary mycoses; however, it is important to correlate results"
		"with clinical, bronchoscopy and biopsy findings for accurate diagnosis and"
		appropriate management.

PG	-	87-91
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Although respiratory tract infections represent a frequent cause of
		"morbidity in travelers, and pneumonia a frequent cause of medical consultation"
		"among febrile travelers returning home, the etiologic spectrum of pneumonia in"
		travelers has not been specifically studied. METHODS: We reviewed the medical
		charts of all travelers hospitalized during a 12-month period in our department
		"with pneumonia after returning home. RESULTS: Seventeen patients (nine men, eight"
		"women, mean age 44 years, range 26 to 67 years) were included in this study. The"
		etiology of pneumonia was established in 13 patients. Bacterial pneumonia was
		"documented in 10 cases and was due to Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=2), Mycoplasma"
		"pneumoniae (n=2), Legionella pneumophila (n=1), Coxiella burnetti (n=1),"
		Leptospira sp. (n=1) or Mycobacterium tuberculosis (n=3). Other etiologies
		"included histoplasmosis, invasive schistosomiasis and dengue fever (one case"
		each). CONCLUSION: These results show the wide range of causes of pneumonia among
		travelers returning from abroad.

PG	-	392
LID	-	10.25259/SNI_345_2021 [doi]
LID	-	392
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Histoplasma capsulatum infection is largely seen in endemic regions;
		it results in symptomatic disease in <5% of those infected and is most often a
		self-limiting respiratory disease. Disseminated histoplasmosis is considered rare
		in the immunocompetent host. Central nervous system (CNS) dissemination can
		"result in meningitis, encephalitis, and focal lesions in the brain and spinal"
		"cord, stroke, and hydrocephalus. An intramedullary spinal cord lesion as the only"
		manifestation of CNS histoplasmosis has been rarely described. CASE DESCRIPTION:
		"We present an atypical case of a 44-year-old man from a nonendemic region, on"
		adalimumab therapy for ulcerative colitis who developed an isolated
		intramedullary spinal cord lesion in the setting of disseminated histoplasmosis.
		His course was initially indolent with vague systemic symptoms that led to
		consideration of several other diagnoses including sarcoidosis and lymphoma.
		Biopsies of several positron emission tomography positive lymph nodes revealed
		"granulomatous inflammation, but no firm diagnosis was achieved. He was ultimately"
		diagnosed with histoplasmosis after an acute respiratory infection in the setting
		"of anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy. With appropriate antifungal therapy, the"
		"spinal cord lesion regressed. The previous systemic biopsies were re-reviewed,"
		and rare fungal elements consistent with H. capsulatum were identified. A
		presumptive diagnosis of CNS histoplasmosis was made in the absence of direct
		laboratory confirmation in the setting of rapid and complete resolution on
		antifungal therapy. CONCLUSION: Disseminated histoplasmosis should be considered
		"in granulomatous disease, even if the patient resides in a nonendemic region."
		"Furthermore, clinicians should be mindful that CNS histoplasmosis may present in"
		an atypical fashion.

TI	-	Two-year results of surgical removal of choroidal neovascular membranes related
		to non-age-related macular degeneration.
PG	-	649-54
AB	-	PURPOSE: To present the 2-year outcomes of surgical removal of non-age-related
		macular degeneration (AMD)-related choroidal neovascular membranes and to
		evaluate any association between visual outcome and baseline clinical factors.
		METHODS: Retrospective consecutive case series. All patients who had surgery for
		non-AMD-related choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) between November 1997 and
		March 2003 under the care of a single surgeon (WA) were included in the study.
		"Baseline data including patient age, duration of subfoveal CNV, preoperative"
		"visual acuity (VA), lesion size, lesion components and aetiology were collected."
		"The primary outcome was VA change with secondary outcomes retinal detachment,"
		"operative peripheral retinal break formation, CNV recurrence and cataract."
		RESULTS: A total of 52 eyes were included in the study. The aetiology of CNV was:
		punctate inner choridopathy 21 (40%); idiopathic 8 (15%); pathologic myopia 6
		(12%); ocular histoplasmosis syndrome 1 (2%); and other 16 (31%). The mean age of
		patients was 41(range 14-72) years. 24-month follow-up was available for 41 (80%)
		eyes. The mean logMAR equivalent baseline acuity was 1.1 and mean lesion size 1.2
		"disc areas. An improvement in VA >1 Snellen line was noted in 26 (63%) eyes,"
		whereas 10 (24%) eyes remained the same (within 1 line) and 5 (12%) lost >1 line
		of acuity. Improvement in VA was associated with worse baseline VA (84% for eyes
		"with VA <or=6/36 vs 31% for those with VA>6/36, p=0.001). No evidence of"
		association between 2-year visual outcome and any other baseline factor under
		study was observed. Peripheral retinal breaks were noted in 5 (10%) eyes at the
		"time of surgery, and 3 (5.8%) eyes developed postoperative retinal detachments."
		Persistent/recurrent CNV was noted in 17 (33%) eyes. The median time to
		presentation of CNV in these eyes was 27 (range 2-172) weeks. Five eyes underwent
		cataract surgery during the follow-up period. The mean age of these patients was
		significantly higher than the mean age of those who did not require cataract
		"surgery (57 vs 37 years, p=0.014). CONCLUSIONS: Surgical excision of"
		non-AMD-related CNV resulted in improvement of VA in the majority of eyes. Worse
		presenting acuity was associated with better visual improvements.

LID	-	e6525
AB	-	Histoplasmosis is one of the most prevalent endemic mycosis in the United States.
		Patients with a previous history of histoplasmosis have a risk of reinfection in
		the future. Individuals with impaired immunity and those who have massive
		"re-exposure to H. capsulatum, their defenses against this organism can be"
		overwhelmed and diseases can recur. We present a unique case of reactivation
		disseminated histoplasmosis in an immunocompetent patient. We present a case of a
		75-year-old male who presented to the ER on two separate occasions for
		"stroke-like symptoms with progressive falls, impaired speech, hand tremor,"
		confusion and generalized weakness. CT of the head without contrast on both
		occasions showed chronic atrophy and microvascular changes but no acute
		abnormalities. MRI could not be performed due to pacemaker incompatibility. EKG
		showed paced rhythm. The only abnormal lab was a creatinine level of 1.6.
		Neurology was consulted and they ordered an EEG and lumbar puncture during his
		"second hospitalization. EEG showed generalized slowing, suggestive of diffuse"
		"brain dysfunction. Lumbar puncture showed WBC: 103, protein: 172, lymphocytes:"
		"88%, neutrophils: 11%, monocytes: 1%. Following the lumbar puncture, Infectious"
		"Disease was consulted. On further investigation, it was discovered that the"
		patient was previously treated for oral histoplasmosis with itraconazole for
		three months. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was positive for histoplasmosis antigen
		titer 1:64. Serology was positive for histoplasmosis antibody complement fixation
		titer of 1:32. The patient was treated with liposomal amphotericin B for six
		"weeks. With treatment, his serology titers continued to improve. The patient was"
		"discharged home on itraconazole 200 mg for lifetime, due to his previous history"
		"of oral histoplasmosis. On his three-month follow-up, his serology titer was"
		<1:8. Histoplasmosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of
		"patients who present with chronic meningitis, cerebral vascular accident, focal"
		"brain or spinal cord lesions, and encephalitis."

PG	-	660-2
AB	-	Pharmacologic blockade of TNFalpha has been a highly effective approach to
		"treating several immunologically mediated diseases, including rheumatoid"
		"arthritis, Crohn's disease, and psoriatic arthritis. 1,2,3 Both etanercept, the"
		"recombinant extracellular domain of the tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2),"
		"and infliximab, a humanized murine antibody, bind TNFalpha and block its"
		"interaction with cell surface receptors. Recently, it has become clear that"
		"blockade of TNFalpha action is profoundly immunosuppressive, and may result in"
		"reactivation of tuberculosis and histoplasmosis, as well as the emergence of"
		"B-cell lymphomas. 4,5,6 In this report, we describe two cases of cutaneous and"
		systemic T-cell lymphoma that progressed rapidly in the setting of TNFalpha
		"blockade. Both cases were characterized by rapid onset, a fulminant clinical"
		"course with extensive cutaneous and systemic involvement, and death within months"
		of diagnosis.

PG	-	982-7
LID	-	10.1001/archophthalmol.2010.157 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical features and outcomes of a large group of
		patients with a spectrum of clinical appearances and diagnosed as having punctate
		"inner choroidopathy (PIC). METHODS: In a retrospective consecutive case series,"
		patients seen during a 16-year period at Moorfields Eye Hospital who were
		diagnosed as having PIC and had a minimum of 12 months' follow-up were included.
		"Patients were classified as having typical PIC or atypical PIC (larger, presumed"
		ocular histoplasmosis syndrome-like lesions). Main outcome measures included
		"development of choroidal neovascularization, development of new PIC lesions, and"
		final visual acuity. RESULTS: A total of 136 patients (271 eyes) were included.
		"The average age was 32 years, 126 patients (93%) were female, and the mean"
		refraction was -4.6 diopters. The overall mean follow-up was 6.2 years. Among 63
		"normal fellow eyes, 56 (88%) remained unchanged, 3 (5%) developed PIC lesions,"
		and 4 (6%) developed choroidal neovascularization. Eyes with PIC lesions remained
		"unchanged in 49 of 74 cases (66%), with 9 (12%) developing new PIC lesions and 16"
		(22%) developing choroidal neovascular membrane. In eyes with choroidal
		"neovascularization, the mean logMAR visual acuity was 0.63 at study entry, 0.63"
		"at 12 months, 0.61 at 2 years, and 0.71 at final review (mean, 6.1 years)."
		"Overall, 40 eyes with PIC-related choroidal neovascular membrane (26%) had final"
		visual acuity less than 6/60. No differences were observed between typical and
		atypical PIC eyes in any of the outcome measures or in any of the subgroup
		analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Punctate inner choroidopathy-related choroidal
		neovascularization was not visually benign. No differences were observed between
		"eyes with typical and atypical choroidal lesions, supporting the notion that they"
		"represent a spectrum of a single disease, PIC."

TI	-	Fungal infections as a complication of therapy for sarcoidosis.
PG	-	451-6
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Treatment of symptomatic sarcoidosis usually includes systemic
		immunosuppressive agents. These agents may render the patient more susceptible to
		"opportunistic infections. In addition, the fungal infection may be difficult to"
		distinguish from the underlying sarcoidosis. AIM: To examine the presentation and
		management of invasive fungal infections in sarcoidosis patients. DESIGN:
		Retrospective record review. METHODS: We reviewed the notes of all sarcoidosis
		patients (n = 753) seen at our clinic over an 18-month period. RESULTS: Seven
		patients (0.9%) with previously diagnosed sarcoidosis developed fungal
		infections: two each with Histoplasma capsulatum and Blastomyces dermatitidis and
		three others with Cryptococcus neoformans. No cases of invasive aspergillus or
		tuberculosis were identified. The diagnosis of fungal infection was made by
		"bronchoscopy (four cases), open-lung biopsy (one case), bone-marrow aspirate (one"
		"case), and spinal fluid examination (one case). All patients were receiving"
		corticosteroids at the time of worsening chest X-ray or clinical status. Four
		patients were also receiving methotrexate prior to infection. No patient with
		systemic fungal infection was receiving either infliximab or cyclophosphamide.
		All patients responded to anti-fungal therapy and a reduction in
		immunosuppression. DISCUSSION: Fungal infections occur rarely in treated patients
		"with sarcoidosis. Deterioration of chest X-ray, especially a localized"
		"infiltrate, warrants investigation."

PG	-	17-22
LID	-	10.5146/tjpath.2019.01466 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: Bone marrow examination (BME) is an important modality for
		"investigation of case of pyrexia of unknown origin (PUO). However, its yield in"
		the diagnosis of infections has not been extensively studied and its role has not
		been well established. The aim of the study was to investigate the usefulness of
		BME and to evaluate the etiological and clinico-hematological profile in cases of
		bone marrow infections. MATERIAL AND METHOD: This was a retrospective study where
		bone marrow cases were retrieved and a review of bone marrow findings with an
		"infectious etiology from July 2014 to June 2018 was done. Detailed history,"
		clinical examination and hematological parameters at presentation were recorded.
		Clinico-hematological correlation using descriptive statistics was performed.
		"RESULTS: The study included 55 cases, on analysis of which the maximum number of"
		"infections were those of leishmaniasis accounting for 35%, followed by HIV (29%)"
		and tuberculosis (15%). Other etiological agents included fungal infections
		"(histoplasmosis and aspergillosis), Enteric fever, Scrub typhus, parvovirus,"
		falciparum malaria and filariasis. The most common clinical presentation was
		fever (80%) and the most common clinical finding was splenomegaly (66%).
		CONCLUSION: Bone marrow examination is an important diagnostic tool to delineate
		"etiological diagnosis in infectious conditions, particularly those presenting"
		"with PUO. Moreover, it is particularly important if urgent diagnosis is required"
		or if alternate diagnostic modalities have not revealed a reason for PUO.

TI	-	Sclerosing mediastinitis: a report on 18 cases.
PG	-	280-3
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Sclerosing mediastinitis is a rare condition which causes dense
		fibrosis of the mediastinum. Few large studies have been reported to date. The
		clinical and pathological features of cases have been studied in a specialist
		referral centre in the UK. METHODS: The pathological files of the Royal Brompton
		Hospital were examined and 18 cases of sclerosing mediastinitis were identified
		between 1970 and 1993. The clinical notes were obtained and the pathological
		specimens analysed. RESULTS: There were 12 men and six women of age range 9-64
		"years. Twelve patients presented with shortness of breath, six had haemoptysis,"
		"three had hoarseness, four had pleuritic chest pain, three general weakness, two"
		"had dysphagia, and one was asymptomatic. Nine patients had a previous history of"
		pulmonary tuberculosis. Two had auto-immune disease--one rheumatoid arthritis and
		the other systemic lupus erythematosus. There were three cases of previous
		malignancy--two undifferentiated carcinoma of the lung and the other Hodgkin's
		disease. Serological tests revealed only one positive reaction to Histoplasma.
		The erythrocyte sedimentation rate and serum immunoglobulins were raised in nine
		patients. Diagnosis was usually by thoracotomy with biopsy. All cases had
		fibrosis and chronic inflammation with no active granulomas. No infective
		organisms or positive cultures were obtained in any case. Ten of the 18 cases are
		"alive up to 15 years after diagnosis, with only two deaths and six lost to follow"
		up. CONCLUSIONS: Sclerosing mediastinitis is a slowly progressive condition
		"associated with previous tuberculosis, mediastinal malignancy, and autoimmune"
		disease. The outlook is excellent for those cases without underlying malignancy.

TI	-	[A study of 34 cases of adrenal incidentaloma].
PG	-	341-50
AB	-	"Adrenal incidentaloma, a tumor discovered unexpectedly during imaging performed"
		"for non-adrenal related causes, has become a frequent clinical concern. Although"
		"in most cases they are benign and hormonally nonfunctioning, it is important to"
		appropriately identify those few cases of malignant or hyperfunctioning lesions
		of surgical resolution. Although several proposals for an optimal diagnostic
		"strategy have been designed, controversy over a series of questions still"
		persists. In the present retrospective study we analyzed 34 patients with adrenal
		"incidentaloma. Of these, 32% of the patients displayed hyperfunctioning"
		"pathologies that included subclinical Cushing's syndrome in four patients,"
		"probable primary hyperaldosteronism in two, late onset congenital adrenal"
		"hyperplasia in one, adrerocortical carcinoma in one and pheochromocytoma in"
		three. CT and/or MRI permitted the identification of adenomas and were crucial to
		decide on surgery in two patients with nonfunctioning pheochromocytomas and in a
		"patient carrying a primitive adrenocortical carcinoma, a diagnosis also suggested"
		by a mixed pattern of hypersecretion of androgens and cortisol. In a diabetic and
		hypertensive patient with subclinical Cushing's syndrome both comorbidities were
		solved by surgery. Nonfunctioning tumors were mainly adenomas (87%) with
		"individual cases of histoplasmosis, pseudocyst, idiopathic adrenal hyperplasia"
		and mielolipoma. Six of the eight operated patients presented malignant and/or
		hyperfunctioning tumors. The pathology associated with incidentalomas represents
		a broad spectrum of risk for patients and reaffirms the necessity for a
		"meticulous clinical, biochemical, and imaging evaluation in order to make"
		appropriate decisions.

PG	-	28-31
LID	-	10.3760/cma.j.cn112147-20200314-00332 [doi]
AB	-	Objective: To investigate the spectrum of pathogens causing lung fungal disease
		"diagnosed by histopathology through histochemical special staining, compared to"
		"the fungal culture results, and to further evaluate the diagnostic value of"
		histochemical special staining in pulmonary fungal disease. Methods: We performed
		a retrospective analysis of 187 cases of pulmonary fungal disease diagnosed by
		histopathology in Peking Union Medical College Hospital from 2001 to 2015
		"(including 92 cases with pulmonary resection or open lung biopsy, 33 with"
		percutaneous lung biopsy and 62 ones with fiberoptic bronchoscopic lung biopsy).
		"All cases were treated with hexamine silver, PAS, mucus carmine and acid-fast"
		staining in addition to conventional HE staining. The clinical records and the
		fungal culture results were reviewed. Results: There were 103 male and 84 female
		"patients, aged from 12 to 70 years [average (48±14) years]. There were 85"
		cases(45.5%) of pulmonary aspergillosis(including 60 cases of invasive infection
		"and 25 cases of aspergilloma), 51 cases(27.3%) of pulmonary cryptococosis, 6"
		"cases (3.2%)of pulmonary mucormycosis, 3 cases(1.6%) of pulmonary histoplasmosis,"
		"3 cases (1.6%)of pulmonary candidiasis, and 2 cases (1.1%) of pneumocystosis,"
		while in the remaining 37 cases (19.8%) the pathogens could not be clearly
		classified by microscopy due to limited tissue or degeneration. Among the 88
		patients with pulmonary fungal disease diagnosed by histopathology from 2011 to
		"2015, 35 ones (39.9%) were detected by fungal culture (including lung biopsy,"
		"intraoperative swab, blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and sputum, etc.). The"
		diagnostic results of 18 cases were completely consistent between
		"histopathological examination and fungal culture (18/35, 51.4%), while 13 cases"
		"(13/35, 37.1%) were diagnosed by histopathology but no fungi were cultured, and"
		"in 3 cases (3/35,8.6%) the culture was positive for fungi which could not be"
		classified clearly by histopathology. In another case the pathogen was found to
		"be Cryptococcus histopathologically but the lavage culture grew""candida"", but the"
		patient's blood cryptococcal antigen was positive. Conclusions: Among patients
		"with histopathological diagnosis of pulmonary fungal disease, pulmonary"
		"aspergillosis was the most common, followed by pulmonary cryptococcosis,"
		"pulmonary mucormycosis, pulmonary histoplasmosis, pulmonary candidiasis and"
		pneumocystosis. A small number of cases could not be classified by histopathology
		through histochemical special staining. There was a high consistency in
		discovering fungal pathogens between pathological histochemical special staining
		"and culture method, but 37% pulmonary fungal disease diagnosed by histopathology"
		"were culture negative. In practice, the role of histochemical special staining in"
		diagnosing pulmonary fungal disease should be paid more attention.

TI	-	Bacteremia and fungemia in patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus
		(HIV) infection in Taiwan.
PG	-	690-7
AB	-	To understand the etiology and clinical outcome of bacterial and fungal sepsis in
		"patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in Taiwan, we"
		conducted a prospective study of nonmycobacterial bacteremia and fungemia in
		HIV-infected patients with fever who were admitted to a university hospital in
		"Taiwan during a 42-month period. Of 210 patients, 41 (19.5%) had a total of 52"
		"episodes of sepsis due to nonmycobacterial bacteria or fungi, or both (15.5% of"
		336 episodes of fever). All but one patient had acquired immunodeficiency
		"syndrome (AIDS), and the mean CD4 lymphocyte count was 29/microL (range,"
		0-321/microL). A total of 57 pathogens (39 bacteria and 18 fungi) were isolated
		from blood; polymicrobial sepsis due to both bacteria and fungi occurred in four
		episodes. Nontyphoid Salmonella (NTS) was the most common cause of
		"community-acquired bacteremia (24/30, 80%). Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia was"
		diagnosed in three episodes while Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia was found
		in only one. Cryptococcus neoformans was the most common cause of fungemia and
		"was responsible for 12 episodes, while fungemia due to Penicillium marneffei and"
		"Histoplasma capsulatum, two emerging fungi in Taiwan, were diagnosed in four"
		"cases and one case, respectively. Nine episodes, eight of bacteremia and one of"
		"candidemia, were nosocomial. The overall in-hospital mortality was 29%, and"
		"nosocomial sepsis was associated with a higher mortality rate (56%, p = 0.02)."
		The mean duration of survival after recovery from initial sepsis was 426 days. We
		conclude that NTS bacteremia was the most common cause of sepsis in patients with
		advanced HIV infection in Taiwan and clinicians caring for such patients should
		watch for emerging fungal infections. Nosocomial sepsis was associated with a
		high mortality rate. The mean survival duration after recovery from sepsis of our
		patients was short.

		role in evaluation and management.
PG	-	997-1002
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Positron emission tomography (PET), a new noninvasive imaging"
		"modality, utilizing 2-[F-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG), has demonstrated"
		increased FDG uptake in lung tumors. OBJECTIVE: To determine the diagnostic
		efficacy of PET-FDG imaging in differentiating benign from malignant solitary
		pulmonary nodules. PATIENT SELECTION: A prospective study of 30 patients who
		presented with indeterminate solitary pulmonary nodules less than 3 cm in size
		based on chest radiograph and computed tomographic (CT) scan. SETTING: Two
		"tertiary care medical centers in Omaha, Neb: Creighton University Medical Center"
		and the Omaha Veterans Administration Medical Center. MEASUREMENTS: Positron
		emission tomographic imaging of the lung was performed 1 h after intravenous
		injection of 10 mCi of F-18-FDG. Qualitative analysis of the images was performed
		independently by two observers by visual identification of the areas of increased
		FDG uptake in the lung nodules. Semiquantitative analysis was performed using
		computation of differential uptake ratio (DUR). Histologic specimens were
		"obtained in 29 patients (thoracotomy 20, transthoracic needle aspiration biopsy"
		"8, bronchoscopy 1). RESULTS: Positron emission tomographic imaging correctly"
		identified 27 of 30 pulmonary nodules. Diagnostic accuracy was high with
		sensitivity of 95 percent and specificity of 80 percent. The positive and
		negative predictive value of PET imaging for solitary pulmonary nodules was 90
		"percent and 89 percent, respectively. The DUR values were significantly higher"
		"for malignant nodules (mean +/- SD, 5.55 +/- 2.79) than benign nodules (mean +/-"
		"SD, 0.95 +/- 0.99) (p < 0.001). There was one false-negative result in a patient"
		with a 1-cm nodule identified as a scar adenocarcinoma. There were two
		false-positive cases and both had caseating granulomas with active inflammation
		"and Histoplasma organisms. CONCLUSION: PET-FDG imaging of the lung, a new"
		"noninvasive diagnostic test, has a high degree of accuracy in differentiating"
		benign from malignant pulmonary nodules. PET-FDG imaging could complement CT
		scanning in the evaluation and treatment of patients with solitary pulmonary
		nodules.

PG	-	463-8
AB	-	"PURPOSE: To report visual outcome, rate of recurrence, and complications for"
		patients who underwent subretinal surgery as treatment of classic juxtafoveal
		choroidal neovascularization (CNV). METHODS: This study was a noncomparative case
		series of 46 patients who underwent subretinal surgery for juxtafoveal CNV that
		appeared to be pure classic without angiographic or clinical evidence of occult
		"neovascularization between 1993 and 2000, with best-corrected preoperative and"
		postoperative Snellen visual acuity reported. RESULTS: The mean follow-up period
		"+/- SD was 20.4 +/- 12.9 months (range, 6-57 months). Etiologic categories"
		"included ocular histoplasmosis syndrome (37%), age-related macular degeneration"
		"(20%), idiopathic (15%), myopic degeneration (11%), mixed features of ocular"
		"histoplasmosis syndrome and myopia (11%), and other miscellaneous causes (6%)."
		Thirty-three percent (15) of 46 eyes that underwent surgery had previously been
		treated with thermal laser photocoagulation at least once. Most patients (89%)
		had membranes with the posterior edge located 200 microm or closer to the center
		of the foveal avascular zone. The median preoperative visual acuity was 20/70
		compared with the median postoperative visual acuity of 20/40. Significant
		"improvement of visual acuity, measured as an increase of two or more lines of"
		"vision, occurred in 26 eyes (56%). In 10 (22%) of the remaining eyes,"
		postoperative visual acuity was within one line of the preoperative visual
		acuity. Visual acuity decreased by two to five lines in seven eyes (15%). Severe
		"vision loss, defined as a decrease of six or more lines, occurred in three eyes"
		(7%). Recurrence was observed in 26 patients (56.5%). CONCLUSION: The results

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Patients with HIV infection can have recurrent and persistent oral
		"ulcers, not attributable to known infectious agents. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to"
		evaluate prospectively oral ulcers in patients with HIV infection to determine
		whether an etiologic agent could be identified. METHODS: Sixteen patients with
		HIV infection who had oral ulcers not attributable to known causes had culture of
		the base and a biopsy specimen taken from the ulcer. Cultures were obtained for
		"herpes simplex and varicella-zoster viruses, mycobacteria, and fungi. By"
		polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis with primer/probe sets for herpes
		"simplex viruses 1 and 2, varicella-zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, human"
		"papillomavirus, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, each biopsy specimen was analyzed"
		for the presence of DNA from these organisms. Specimens were also evaluated
		histologically. RESULTS: Histoplasmosis was detected histologically in one biopsy
		"specimen, candidiasis in a second, and herpetic changes in a third. Viral"
		cultures were positive for herpes simplex virus 1 in four cases and herpes
		simplex virus 2 in one case. PCR analysis detected DNA for herpes simplex virus 1
		in one case and herpes simplex virus 2 in another; DNA from other pathogens was
		"not identified. In the remaining eight patients, hematoxylin-and-eosin staining"
		revealed eosinophilic ulcers in five cases and nonspecific changes in three
		cases. CONCLUSION: The etiologic agent of recurrent or persistent oral ulcers in
		patients with AIDS and AIDS-related complex was not identified in 50% of
		patients. PCR analysis was not useful. Herpes simplex virus or other pathogens
		were not detected in ulcers containing numerous eosinophils.

OAB	-	Studies conducted with locally available means at the University Hospital in
		Brazzaville have provided data on opportunistic parasitic and mycotic disease in
		AIDS patients in the Congo. The diagnosis of AIDS was based on the World Health
		Organization clinical definition for Africa and on positive ELISA tests. Patients
		were prospectively studied in 1986-87. 12 cases of meningitic cryptococcosis were
		"found in 139 patients studied, for a rate of almost 9% of AIDS cases. Prior to"
		the AIDS epidemic only 2 cases were published in the Congo. 35.6% of 146 cases
		studied showed oral pharyngeal candidiasis on clinical examination. The frequency
		of esophageal and bronchopulmonary candidiasis could not be estimated with the
		"means available. 118 AIDS patients had intestinal parasites, of whom 2/3 had"
		chronic diarrhea. 9.3% were caused by Isospora belli and 4.2% by
		Cryptosporidiosis. Other intestinal flora were apparently affected by routinely
		administered antiparasite treatments. An estimate of 20% for cerebral
		toxoplasmosis was obtained by comparing serum toxoplasmosis antibody and
		cerebrospinal fluid rates for 75 patients. The rate of pneumocystis carinii
		pneumonia appears on indirect evidence to be under 10%. No cases of disseminated
		histoplasmosis or malignant strongyloidiasis were observed. The biggest
		differences between the patterns of opportunistic infection in industrialized
		countries and especially the US and in the Congo appear to be the lesser
		frequency in the Congo of pneumocystosis and the greater frequency of Isosporosis
		and cerebral toxoplasmosis.

		"to be endemic, resulting in catastrophic complications. The patient presented"
		"with a two month progressive history of vomiting, diarrhea, productive cough, and"
		"shortness of breath, on the background of poorly-controlled HIV. There was a low"
		"index of suspicion for infection with histoplasmosis, particularly given the"
		large differential diagnosis and the lack of travel or endemic precedence. The
		case was complicated by the development of disseminated intravascular coagulation
		"(DIC) prior to identification of the pathogen. Ultimately, the patient's goals of"
		"care transitioned to palliation, and treatments were discontinued. It is our hope"
		"that in the future, such outcomes might be prevented by considering disseminated"
		"histoplasmosis in systemically unwell patients with HIV, regardless of endemic"
		exposure or specific presentation.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: The detection of Trypanosoma cruzi in tissue samples is important
		"in many situations, such as testing of the reactivation of the infection. The"
		detection of T. cruzi nests in endomyocardial biopsies (EMB) may be useful to
		"evaluate graft rejection. Given their scarcity, such nests are not routinely"
		"identified. To increase the diagnosis sensitivity, immunohistochemistry (IHC) may"
		"serve as a promising strategy. Here, we validate an antiserum for the detection"
		of T. cruzi infection by IHC. METHODS: We used 1) positive controls (PCs) - 13
		"EMB, 12 skin biopsies, and 1 heart with T. cruzi nests as sections stained with"
		hematoxylin and eosin (HE); 2) negative controls - a) 10 explant hearts and 10
		EMB with no amastigote nests or clinical/laboratory signs of chagasic infection;
		"and b) eight samples with leishmaniasis, toxoplasmosis, or histoplasmosis; and 3)"
		Cases - 31 EMB of chagasic patients with no parasite nests in HE sections but
		detected positive for T. cruzi DNA by polymerase chain reaction. As a primary
		"antibody, a hyperimmune serum from T. cruzi-infected rabbits was used. RESULTS:"
		IHC results were positive for 21 of 26 PCs (80.8%) and one case of cutaneous
		"leishmaniasis. In 4 of 31 cases, IHC revealed nests (12.9%), which were"
		undetected by conventional histological examination. CONCLUSIONS: This study
		shows that IHC with the tested antiserum increases the sensitivity of the
		diagnosis and may be recommended for routine use in EMB analyses of cardiac
		transplant patients with Chagas disease.

AB	-	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To present a consecutive case series of patients 50
		years or younger who underwent photodynamic therapy (PDT) for choroidal
		neovascularization (CNV) from etiologies other than age-related macular
		degeneration. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective chart review of 35 consecutive
		eyes of 34 patients. RESULTS: Visual acuity remained stable or improved in 20 of
		35 eyes. Thirteen eyes with myopic degeneration had pre-treatment and
		"post-treatment mean visual acuities of 20/100 and 20/200, respectively. Eight"
		eyes with idiopathic CNV had an improvement of mean visual acuity from 20/200 to
		20/125. Six eyes with ocular histoplasmosis displayed a stable mean visual acuity
		"of 20/50. Of 3 eyes with angioid streaks, visual acuity remained stable in 2 eyes"
		and declined in 1 eye. Five eyes with other etiologies all had improved vision.
		CONCLUSION: Although the current literature shows evidence that PDT is beneficial
		"in treating CNV secondary to myopic degeneration, the evidence for etiologies"
		"such as idiopathic causes, ocular histoplasmosis, and angioid streaks is"
		optimistic but remains unproven. Our study suggests that PDT may be beneficial in
		stabilizing and improving vision when treating CNV from these etiologies.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the frequency and clinical features of endemic and other
		opportunistic infections in liver or kidney transplant recipients in four
		transplant centres in different geographical areas of Brazil. METHODS:
		Retrospective analysis of medical and laboratory records of four transplant
		centres on endemic and other opportunistic infections in liver or kidney
		transplant recipients. Analyses were performed with spss statistical software.
		"RESULTS: From 2001 to 2006, 1046 kidney and 708 liver transplants were registered"
		in all centres. The average age was 42 years. Among 82 (4.7%) cases with
		"infections, the most frequent was tuberculosis (2.0%), followed by systemic"
		"protozoal infections (0.7%), toxoplasmosis (0.4%) and visceral leishmaniasis"
		"(0.3%). Systemic fungal infections occurred in 0.6%, of which 0.4% were"
		cryptococcosis and 0.2% were histoplasmosis. Dengue was the only systemic viral
		"infection and was registered in two cases (0.1%), of which one was classified as"
		the classic form and the other as dengue haemorrhagic fever. Nocardiosis was
		described in one case (0.05%). The infectious agents most frequently associated
		"with diarrhoea were Blastocystis sp., Schistosoma mansoni and Strongyloides"
		stercoralis. CONCLUSIONS: Opportunistic Infections in transplant patients have a
		wide spectrum and may vary from asymptomatic to severe infections with high
		mortality. A better understanding of the epidemiology of endemic pathogens and
		clinical manifestations can contribute to the establishment of an early diagnosis
		as well as correct treatment aimed at decreasing morbidity and mortality.

AB	-	Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome (HCPS) can occur after infection with
		"Hantavirus which can occur by inhaling aerosolized rodent urine, feces, and"
		saliva contaminated with the virus. It presents with the rapid development of
		"pulmonary edema, respiratory failure, and cardiogenic shock with the hallmark"
		being microvascular leakage. We report a patient with a history of alcohol abuse
		and recent exposure to mice and sick kittens who presented with cough with sputum
		"production, shortness of breath, orthopnea, and new-onset lower extremity edema."
		Imaging revealed bilateral infiltrates more common on the left with an
		"unremarkable echocardiogram. Testing for COVID-19, Human Immunodeficiency Virus"
		"(HIV), influenza, bacterial pneumonia including tuberculosis and"
		"methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), aspergillosis,"
		"histoplasmosis, Blastomyces, and Coccidiodes was negative. Bronchoscopy and"
		bronchoalveolar lavage revealed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) and were
		negative for acid-fast bacilli and Nocardia cultures. He was further tested for
		"Hantavirus, Q fever, leptospirosis, toxoplasmosis, and empiric treatment with"
		doxycycline initiated. His Hantavirus IgM antibody came back positive. Human
		Hantavirus infection occurs after inhalation of infected rodent excreta;
		"fortunately, human-to-human transmission has not been documented. HCPS most"
		"commonly occurs due to the Sin Nombre virus (SNV), has a case fatality rate of"
		"50%, and is a notifiable disease in the United States. It has 3 distinct phases,"
		"prodromal, cardiopulmonary, and convalescent/recovery. The cardiopulmonary phase"
		occurs from increased permeability of pulmonary capillaries and in severe cases
		can progress to cardiogenic shock. Diagnosis is based on the presence of IgM and
		"IgG Hantavirus antibodies. Treatment is mainly supportive; however, patients are"
		usually treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics while workup is underway. In
		"animal models, ribavirin and favipiravir are only effective when administered in"
		"the prodromal phase. If suspicion of Hantavirus infection exists, early"
		mobilization to the intensive care unit for treatment is recommended.
		Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been suggested to improve outcomes
		in severe HCPS with refractory shock.

TI	-	Fungi in megakaryocytes. An unusual manifestation of fungal infection of the bone
		marrow.
PG	-	577-81
AB	-	"When fungi infect the bone marrow, typically they are associated with granuloma"
		"formation and/or necrosis, and the fungi are found within histiocytes or admixed"
		with necrotic debris. Recently two bone marrow biopsy specimens were encountered
		"in which fungi were confined to the cytoplasm of megakaryocytes, a finding not"
		previously reported in the literature. The first case was that of a 46-year-old
		man with pulmonary histoplasmosis and no known immunodeficiency. The second was
		that of a 38-year-old man with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome and
		"cryptococcal meningitis. In the first case, many megakaryocytes contained fungal"
		"forms consistent with Histoplasma. In the second, one small cluster of"
		megakaryocytes contained several budding yeast consistent with Cryptococcus.
		"Neither marrow biopsy specimen had necrosis, granulomas, or histiocytic"
		"infiltration. In both cases, because of the unusual localization of the fungi,"
		they were initially overlooked. The bone marrow may contain fungi even in the
		absence of abnormalities suggesting fungal infection on routinely stained
		sections. A silver stain or a periodic acid--Schiff stain should be performed on
		all marrow biopsy specimens in cases of known or suspected fungal infection
		"outside the marrow. The phenomenon of megakaryocyte emperipolesis is well known,"
		and this process may be responsible for the apparent ability of megakaryocytes to
		internalize fungi.

AB	-	Infectious Cryptococcus neoformans occurs primarily in immunocompromised
		"patients. The primary organ affected is the lungs, but the infection of the"
		central nervous system (CNS) is also be seen. Disseminated cryptococcosis can
		"involve any organ in the body. However, hepatic involvement is rare. Here we"
		discuss a case of cryptococcal hepatitis in a patient who presented with
		persistently elevated liver enzymes. A 56-year-old Ecuadorian female with no
		"known past medical history presented with fever, abdominal pain, nausea,"
		"unintentional weight loss, and diarrhea for two months. Her liver function tests"
		"(LFTs) revealed elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST: 415 U/L), elevated"
		"alanine aminotransferase (ALT: 201 U/L), elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP: 763"
		"U/L), but normal total bilirubin (0.9 mg/dl). Her HIV antigen screening was"
		"reactive, and the absolute cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) helper count was 22"
		"cell/µL. Over the course of her hospital stay, the patient's liver enzymes"
		"continued to trend upward, with negative Histoplasma antibodies and negative"
		"serum cryptococcal antigen titers. During the second week of hospitalization, her"
		"liver enzymes continued to rise with an ALP of 4046 U/L, AST of 436 U/L, and ALT"
		of 276 U/L. With a persistent elevation of the liver enzymes without any
		"definitive cause, an ultrasound-guided biopsy was performed. Pathology revealed"
		"cryptococcal hepatitis, and the patient was started on a 15-day course of"
		amphotericin B with an eight-week course of fluconazole 400 mg with LFTs nearly
		normalizing at six weeks. This case demonstrates an unusual manifestation of
		cryptococcosis. Our patient did not present with the typical cryptococcal
		"pulmonary or central nervous system infection. Additionally, our patient's serum"
		"cryptococcal antigen titers were negative, but biopsy results revealed"
		"cryptococcal hepatitis, despite a very high sensitivity and specificity of the"
		serum cryptococcal antigen test. This case demonstrates the importance of
		"maintaining a broad differential, specifically in immunocompromised patients."

		intravitreal triamcinolone injection.
PG	-	128-32
LID	-	10.1097/IJG.0b013e31814b9948 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: To prospectively monitor intraocular pressure (IOP) and gonioscopy
		changes within the first month after a single 4-mg intravitreal injection of
		"triamcinolone acetonide (IVK) (Kenalog, Briston-Meyers Squibb, New York). DESIGN:"
		Prospective comparative interventional case series. METHODS: A consecutive series
		of 28 eyes of 14 patients with no prior intravitreal injections or history of
		"glaucoma were prospectively enrolled. After baseline evaluation in both eyes,"
		"including IOP, gonioscopy, and optic nerve evaluation, a single 4-mg IVK was"
		given in a standard sterile fashion in the eye to be treated. Eyes received IVK
		for macular edema associated with retinal vein occlusions and in conjunction with
		photodynamic therapy for choroidal neovascularization secondary to age-related
		"macular degeneration, ocular histoplasmosis, and high myopia. The fellow eye"
		"served as the control. After the injection, IOP and gonioscopy were repeated at"
		"1, 2, and 4-week intervals in both eyes. RESULTS: Of the 14 patients, the 5 women"
		and 9 men had a mean age of 67.6 years. Mean baseline IOP of the treated and
		"fellow control eyes were similar at 15.9 versus 16.6 mm Hg, respectively. The"
		control eyes maintained a small IOP range (15.6 to 16.6 mm Hg) during the 1-month
		"follow-up period. In the treated eyes, the mean maximum IOP was 54% above"
		"baseline during follow-up, compared with 11% for control eyes. Six of 14 (43%)"
		treated eyes had IOP elevation to 24 mm Hg or higher with mean change of 8.6 mm
		Hg and a mean maximum IOP of 32.1 mm Hg. There was no correlation between IOP
		"rise and age, sex, diagnosis, or optic nerve appearance. However, during the"
		"course of the study, 4 of 6 (67%) of the treated eyes that required topical drops"
		for the IOP elevation had documented abnormal inferior angle changes
		characterized by pigmented particulate matter in the inferior angle not present
		at the baseline exam. The most frequent time point for an IOP elevation that
		required treatment was at 2-week postinjection. No eyes required surgical
		management of IOP during the course of this 4-week study. CONCLUSIONS: We
		observed a significant IOP rise in eyes after a single intravitreal injection of
		"4 mg of triamcinolone within 1 month of injection. In this study, the most"
		"frequent time point that required IOP treatment was at 2-week postinjection,"
		suggesting that early and frequent monitoring of IOP should be considered.
		Two-thirds of eyes that required medical control of IOP developed gonioscopy
		"changes, characterized by particulate matter in the inferior angle, not present"
		at baseline. Eyes that developed gonioscopic changes were 5 times more likely to
		be treated for IOP elevation than those without gonioscopic findings.

TI	-	Skin disorders in HIV-infected patients from West Java.
PG	-	18-22
AB	-	AIM: to describe the spectrum of HIV-related skin disorders as well as their
		prevalence and relation to CD4-cell counts among HIV-seropositive patients from
		"West Java, Indonesia. METHODS: all HIV-positive patients presenting in 2008 at"
		"the HIV-clinic, Hasan Sadikin Hospital, were included in a cross-sectional study."
		Patients who had a skin complaint were examined by a dermatologist. Skin diseases
		"were classified based on ICD 10. RESULTS: among 843 patients, 121 (14.4%) had a"
		"skin complaint, consisting of skin manifestations (73.3%), drug eruptions"
		"(30.5%), and sexually transmitted infections (15.7%), some of them had more than"
		"one diseases. The most common skin manifestations were drug eruptions, pruritic"
		"papular eruptions, seborrhoeic dermatitis, herpes zoster, dermatophytosis, and"
		"bacterial skin infections. Among patients who started nevirapine, 6.4% (95%CI:"
		"3.9% - 8.9%) developed any kind of drug eruption, and 1.4% (95%CI 0.2%-2.6%)"
		"developed a severe drug eruption. No cases of Kaposi sarcoma, penicilliosis,"
		"eosinophilic folliculitis were seen, however one case of histoplasmosis was"
		diagnosed. CONCLUSION: this is the first report describing the prevalence and
		characteristic of skin manifestation in HIV-positive in Indonesia. Indonesian
		physicians should be alert about HIV when patient presents with certain skin
		manifestations. The rate of severe drug eruptions following treatment with
		nevirapine is a cause of concern that needs further study.

AB	-	"In human immunodeficiency virus infection as well as in related syndromes,"
		cervico-facial and otorhino-laryngologic manifestations are current. A
		retrospective study in Oto-Rhino-Laryngology service of Brazzaville University
		Hospital from December 1995 to November 2001 has been reported. 253 patients were
		selected from a total of 1352 consultations. The study population is young
		"(average age: 34 +/- 4.8 years), and most of the patients are 30 to 49 years old"
		(75.9%). Men represent 51% and women 49%. Although sexual multipartnership
		"(59.7%) is the main risk factor, traditional practices (22.8%) are not"
		"neglictible in Africa. Among all cases, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 is"
		"found in 72.3% of cases. The affections are located in the neck (40.5%), ear"
		"(24.9%), pharynx (17.3%), rhinosinus (13.3%), oral cavity and vestibule (2.7%)"
		"and larynx (1.3%). These main affections are represented by: parotidosis (20.1%),"
		"peripheric facial paralysis (15.4%), pharyngeal candidiasis (14.6%), sinusitis"
		"(14.2%) and ganglial tuberculosis (11.5%). Lymphoma (7 cases), kaposi's sarcoma"
		(7 cases) and epidermoid carcinoma (1 case) are the malignant affections
		identified in 15 cases (6%). The diagnosis of some affections like cystic
		"parotiditis (11%), noma (1.6%), African histoplasmosis (0.4%) and rhinoscleroma"
		(0.4%) constitutes this study particularity The Oto-rhino-laryngologist's role is
		important in early diagnosis of HIV infection as well as in the followed-up of
		patients.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To assess the 3-year visual outcome of intravitreal bevacizumab in
		inflammatory ocular neovascularization. DESIGN: Experimental study. METHODS:
		Retrospective multicenter consecutive case series in 81 patients with
		inflammatory ocular neovascularization refractory to standard therapy and treated
		with intravitreal bevacizumab. The outcome measures included improvement of best
		corrected visual acuity expressed as logarithm of minimum angle of resolution
		(logMAR) and paired comparison decrease in central foveal thickness by optical
		coherence tomography. RESULTS: Mean best corrected visual acuity improved from
		baseline 0.699 (6/30 or 20/101) (SD 0.434) to 0.426 (6/16 or 20/53) (SD 0.428) (n
		"= 81; p < 0.001), a gain of 2.7 lines (median 3 injections; 81 eyes; 81"
		patients). Paired comparisons revealed significant central foveal flattening at 3
		"years of 97.9 μm (n = 51; p < 0.001). In a subgroup analysis, visual improvement"
		was significant for ocular histoplasmosis (p = 0.026); multifocal choroiditis (p
		= 0.05); serpiginous choroiditis (p = 0.028); ocular toxoplasmosis (p = 0.042);
		"and punctate inner choroidopathy (p = 0.015). In a subgroup analysis, foveal"
		flattening was significant for ocular histoplasmosis (p = 0.004); multifocal
		choroiditis (p = 0.007); serpiginous choroiditis (p = 0.011); and punctate inner
		"choroidopathy (p = 0.001). Of the group, 5 eyes developed submacular fibrosis, 1"
		"eye retinal pigment epithelial tear, and 1 eye macular ischemia in the context of"
		"vasculitis. CONCLUSION: At 3 years, intravitreal bevacizumab sustained"
		significant visual improvement of 2.7 lines and significant foveal flattening of
		98 μm in a wide variety of inflammatory ocular diseases without major
		complications after a median of 3 injections.

PG	-	752-5
LID	-	423 [pii]
AB	-	Fibrosing mediastinitis (FM) is a rare benign disorder caused by proliferation of
		acellular collagen and fibrous tissue within the mediastinum. In the United
		"States, most cases are thought to be caused by an abnormal immune response to"
		Histoplasma capsulatum infection. Some cases of FM are related to tuberculosis.
		In most patients the cause of FM is unknown. The affected patients are typically
		young and present with signs and symptoms of obstruction or compression of the
		"superior vena cava, pulmonary veins or arteries, central airways or esophagus."
		Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are central to the diagnosis
		and management of this disorder. We present a rare case of FM as a sequela of
		tuberculosis.

TI	-	Mycoses of the breast: diagnosis by fine-needle aspiration.
PG	-	51-5
AB	-	Fungal infections of the breast are unusual and may clinically mimic carcinoma.
		"When studied by fine-needle aspiration (FNA), such masses may yield necrosis,"
		"granulomatous inflammation, reactive histiocytes, and atypical epithelial cells."
		Cohesive groups of atypical epithelial cells featured nuclear enlargement and
		"overlapping, as well as prominent nucleoli. The organisms may be widely"
		"scattered, so that careful evaluation was required for their identification. In"
		"concert with provocative clinical findings, these features may lead to an"
		erroneous diagnosis of malignancy. We describe three women with mycotic masses of
		the breast initially studied by FNA. The first patient presented at age 31 with a
		"large, firm breast mass, chest wall extension, and radiographic evidence of"
		vertebral bone involvement. FNA was requested to confirm the clinical diagnosis
		"of advanced breast carcinoma. In addition to the atypia described above, the"
		smears showed yeast forms indicative of blastomycosis surrounded by neutrophils.
		"She remains well, following antifungal treatment. The second case of"
		"Blastomycosis was diagnosed by FNA of a breast mass in a 64-yr-old woman, who"
		also responded to treatment. The third patient's preoperative needle aspiration
		"showed granulomas, but no organisms were identified, even with special stains;"
		silver stains of surgically excised tissue showed histoplasmosis.

		"invasive rhinitis with adnexal involvement, mimicking disease more commonly"
		caused by cryptococcosis or aspergillosis. This case is especially noteworthy as
		it was from an area where histoplasmosis is not enzootic. RELEVANCE AND NOVEL
		INFORMATION: Invasive fungal rhinitis causes significant morbidity in cats.
		Diagnostic investigation of more common pathogens includes detection of fungal
		antigen (Cryptococcus) or antifungal antibodies (Aspergillus). This case
		demonstrates that histoplasmosis can present as chronic nasal disease in cats.
		"Histoplasma antigen testing provides a non-invasive diagnostic option. Moreover,"
		"this case serves as a reminder that histoplasmosis can affect cats anywhere, even"
		in non-enzootic areas.

TI	-	Geographical pathology profile of AIDS in Puerto Rico: the first decade.
PG	-	647-51
AB	-	Postmortem histopathological changes in 100 adult patients with AIDS who died in
		Puerto Rico from 1982 to 1991 were studied and tabulated. Modes of HIV
		transmission were reviewed. Patient ages ranged from 21 to 60 yr. Gender
		"composition for the patient group was 83 men (average age, 35 yr) and 17 women"
		"(average age, 39 yr). Sixty-eight of the patients were injecting-drug users, 20"
		"were homosexual and bisexual men, seven were women who had had heterosexual"
		"contact with men at risk for HIV, and one was a man who had had heterosexual"
		contact with prostitutes. Only one case was linked to transfusions of blood.
		Twenty-seven men and seven women were serologically tested for antibodies and all
		were HIV seroreactive. The most common causes of infection and the frequency of
		each were as follows: Pneumocystis carinii in 49 patients; cytomegalovirus in 43;
		Toxoplasma gondii in 30; Candida species in 24; Histoplasma capsulatum in 18;
		Mycobacterium species in 14; Cryptococcus species in eight; and Strongyloides
		stercoralis in six patients. Infection by Schistosoma mansoni (10 patients) was
		considered incidental because this trematode is endemic in Puerto Rico. The lung
		was the organ most frequently infected by a single microorganism: Pneumocystis
		"carinii affected 49 patients. However, Cryptococcus species was the microorganism"
		that infected more body systems: 20 different organs in eight patients. Nineteen
		"patients had microglial nodular encephalitis, 86 patients had lymphocyte"
		"depletion in the spleen, and 58 had lymphocyte depletion in lymph node tissue."
		Twenty-seven men had testicular maturation arrest and variable germ cell loss.
		"Three patients had malignant lymphoma, and two had Kaposi's sarcoma.(ABSTRACT"

		report.
PG	-	126-129
LID	-	10.5582/irdr.2018.01022 [doi]
AB	-	Histoplasmosis is a systemic fungal infection caused by Histoplasma capsulatum
		which occurs endemically in some parts of the world like North and Central
		"America particularly in Mississippi and Ohio River valleys, but is uncommon in"
		India. Progressive disseminated form of histoplasmosis (PDH) usually occurs in
		the immune-compromised hosts especially in HIV positive population. In PDH any
		"organ can be involved like lung, liver, spleen, brain, adrenals etc. Involvement"
		of oral cavity and buccal mucosa in PDH is common but pharyngeal involvement is
		rare. We here report a case of progressive disseminated histoplasmsosis with
		pharyngeal involvement in an immunocompetent male from non-endemic area. This
		case presented to us with history of long duration fever and we found the
		etiology by giving due significance to a trivial symptom and thorough evaluation
		"of the same. Etiology was found as disseminated histoplasmosis, which is not a"
		common disease. We treated him initially with amphotericin-B then subsequently
		with itraconazole for one year. He recovered fully over the period of one year
		with the given treatment. This case report emphasizes that disseminated
		histoplasmosis should be considered one differential diagnosis in case of long
		"duration of fever, even in an immunocompetent patient. It also emphasizes that in"
		"evaluation of a case of long duration of fever, even a trivial symptom is very"
		"crucial, which may direct towards the diagnosis."

		cutaneous sporotrichosis misdiagnosed as pyoderma gangrenosum and treated with
		immunosuppressants for 17 months leading to exacerbation and atypical morphology
		mimicking Histoplasma organisms on biopsy. Exclusion of infection prior to
		diagnosing pyoderma gangrenosum is important to prevent iatrogenic
		"immunosuppression, demonstrating the challenges with application of the updated"
		pyoderma gangrenosum diagnostic criteria.

		lesion of the right upper eyelid. Biopsy of the lesion revealed intracellular
		periodic acid-Schiff positive round to oval organisms with a surrounding clear
		halo suggestive of histoplasmosis. Histoplasma capsulatum specific polymerase
		chain reaction was positive. The patient was treated with oral antifungals and
		showed a prompt response to treatment. We report this rare case of primary
		cutaneous histoplasmosis of the eyelid in an otherwise healthy adult patient.

		histopathological features of histoplasmosis along with the disseminated disease.
		Cutaneous manifestations thus led to an early diagnosis of the case and a good
		prognostic outcome.

AB	-	Histoplasmosis is a self-limited and asymptomatic disease in immunocompetent
		individuals. Patients with untreated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or immune
		suppression due to medications such as corticosteroids can present with
		disseminated and life-threatening infections. We present a case of a 60-year-old
		female that presented with recurrent diarrhea that was found to have isolated
		gastrointestinal (GI) histoplasmosis. The rarity of this case is due to the
		isolated colonic involvement and lack of respiratory symptoms (the portal of
		"infection). In conclusion, clinicians should be aware of isolated histoplasmosis"
		affecting the GI tract and careful endoscopic evaluation with adequate
		sampling is warranted to confirm the diagnosis.

AB	-	Histoplasmosis is the fungal infection caused by Histoplasma capsulatum fungus.
		"It is commonly found in a few endemic areas in the United States, where there is"
		a large number of birds or bats and can spread through their droppings.
		Disseminated histoplasmosis is a severe manifestation of the fungal infection
		which is commonly seen in individuals with underlying immunosuppression. Our case
		"is an unusual case of disseminated histoplasmosis in a 60-year-old,"
		"immunocompetent male patient with a history of significant alcohol abuse, which"
		led to end stage liver failure. While the patient showed some signs of
		"improvement initially upon beginning the treatment, he ultimately continued to"
		deteriorate despite treatment due to an overwhelming histoplasmosis infection.
		This case demonstrates the importance of keeping a high index of suspicion even
		amongst immunocompetent patients with no obvious exposure to risk factors. It
		also shows that timely diagnosis with a high index of suspicion is required with
		an integrated treatment approach.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Infection with Histoplasma capsulatum can lead to a disseminated
		disease involving the gastrointestinal tract presenting as diffuse abdominal pain
		and inflammatory diarrhea which may mimic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). CASE
		"SUMMARY: In the current report, we discuss the case of a 41-year old male who"
		presented to the emergency department with complaints of high-grade intermittent
		fevers and severe abdominal pain with associated diarrhea and hematochezia.
		Laboratory results demonstrated transaminitis and elevated erythrocyte
		"sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein and ferritin levels. The patient's"
		"presentation was thought to be an exacerbation of his underlying IBD, but further"
		investigations revealed a positive Histoplasma antigen in the urine. The patient
		"was offered a colonoscopy and biopsy to confirm the diagnosis; however, he"
		refused. He was treated with itraconazole and showed significant improvement of
		"his symptoms, thereby confirming the diagnosis of gastrointestinal"
		"histoplasmosis. CONCLUSION: Here within, we provide a review of IBD, evaluation"
		"of chronic diarrhea, and gastrointestinal histoplasmosis."

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Histoplasmosis is a fungal disease endemic in some regions of the
		"United States of America, Canada, and Latin America. The geographic"
		"characteristics, humidity, soil, and climate are responsible for such"
		"distribution. In Brazil, there are case reports of histoplasmosis throughout its"
		"territory, being considered an endemic region. It is considered an opportunistic"
		"disease, affecting mostly immunocompromised patients. To the present date,"
		scientific publications dealing with pediatric cases of histoplasmosis are
		restricted to case series. Spinal cord injuries caused by histoplasmosis are
		"rare, even in the adult population, being described in few studies. CASE"
		"DESCRIPTION: The present report deals with a 4-year-old patient, from the"
		"southeast region of Brazil, who started a condition of fever, weight loss,"
		"cervicobrachialgia, and symmetrical tetraparesis, with evolution over 2 months."
		"In the diagnostic investigation, she was found to have primary immunodeficiency"
		and neuroimaging examinations showed a cervical spinal cord lesion at the level
		of C4-C6. The anatomopathological diagnosis of histoplasmosis was possible after
		surgery for decompression and biopsy of the lesion. CONCLUSION: According to our
		"research, there are no reports in the literature that address the situation of"
		spinal cord compression syndrome due to histoplasmosis in the pediatric
		population.

TI	-	Histoplasma capsulatum: An Unusual Case of Pericardial Effusion and Coarctation
		of the Aorta.
PG	-	254-6
LID	-	10.14740/jocmr2455w [doi]
AB	-	Histoplasma capsulatum is a fungus that is endemic in many parts of the world and
		can present with a wide variety of symptoms. Here we present a case of a
		previously healthy 19-year-old female who presented with shortness of breath. She
		was found to have a right lung mass and coarctation of the aorta on computed
		tomography imaging. Pathology revealed granuloma caused by Histoplasma
		"capsulatum. She later developed massive pericardial effusion, requiring emergent"
		pericardiocentesis. She was treated with anti-fungal therapy and recovered well.
		This case illustrates an unusual presentation of newly diagnosed coarctation of
		the aorta complicated by Histoplasma pericardial effusion. Imaging and pathology
		slides are reviewed.

PG	-	e16444

LID	-	e16444
AB	-	Primary cutaneous cryptococcosis is an uncommon condition. Patients with
		"immunosuppression and those of older age are more susceptible to infection,"
		warranting investigations into underlying systemic disease. We report the case of
		a 49-year-old male with multiple sclerosis in remission on fingolimod who
		presented with a non-healing skin lesion on his upper thigh for a duration of two
		"years. Skin biopsy showed dermal parasitized histiocytes, and serum antigens for"
		histoplasmosis and Cryptococcus were negative. Further investigation with
		"polymerase chain reaction (PCR) demonstrated cutaneous cryptococcal infection,"
		with no associated systemic signs or symptoms. This case report highlights an
		uncommon presentation of cutaneous cryptococcosis on an unexposed skin surface
		with successful and rapid improvement following fluconazole therapy without
		fingolimod discontinuation.

		"HLH has been associated with malignancies, autoimmune diseases, and infections,"
		such as histoplasmosis. Histoplasmosis commonly has subclinical manifestations
		but can also present in its disseminated form. We present the case of an
		immunocompromised patient with worsening liver function caused by hepatic

		two brothers.
PG	-	34-37
LID	-	10.18502/cmm.7.4.8409 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Histoplasma capsulatum is the cause of a prevalent fungal
		"disease in certain regions in the United States of America, like Ohio and the"
		Mississippi River. Its clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic to
		"life-threatening diseases, according to the immune system. A definitive diagnosis"
		is made by biopsy. CASE REPORT: Two middle-aged brothers presented with a
		"nine-day history of severe progressive dyspnea. Both were living in Cincinnati,"
		"Ohio, and encountered bird droppings 7 days prior to symptoms while working on a"
		roofing project. It should be mentioned that they were not wearing masks. After
		"extensive testing, they were diagnosed with acute pulmonary histoplasmosis. Both"
		were successfully treated with azole-derivative fungal therapy. CONCLUSION: This
		is the first case of histoplasmosis acquired through occupational exposure
		related to roofing and is unique given the two patients were siblings.

AB	-	Bilateral adrenal hemorrhage is an extremely uncommon and life-threatening
		"condition. It is caused by multiple etiologies, including antiphospholipid"
		"syndrome, disseminated histoplasmosis, trauma, severe stress, and granulomatous"
		"disease. The authors present a unique case of a 64-year-old alcoholic male, who"
		"was admitted after fall and right hip fracture. On day seven of admission, the"
		"patient started to develop hypotension, leukocytosis, and tachycardia. CT abdomen"
		"was done, which ruled out infectious causes, however, it showed bilateral adrenal"
		hemorrhages. Patient adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test was
		positive for adrenal insufficiency and was started on hydrocortisone
		replacement. Our case highlights the fact that adrenal insufficiency after
		bilateral adrenal hemorrhage can be slow and can manifest as late as seven days
		and prompt therapy with steroids is warranted to avoid life-threatening adrenal
		insufficiency.

LID	-	S2210-2612(20)30985-8 [pii]
LID	-	10.1016/j.ijscr.2020.10.107 [doi]
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Esophagectomy is a challenging procedure associated with
		"considerable morbidity. Previous pulmonary diseases, such as histoplasmosis"
		"fungal infection, may interfere in operative and postoperative outcomes after"
		esophagectomy. Anastomotic leakage is one of the most feared complications after
		"esophagectomy. However, new therapies developed such as vacuum procedure and"
		esophageal prosthesis have been provenly beneficial. PRESENTATION OF CASE: We
		present a case with squamous cell carcinoma of the mid esophagus portion on a
		young patient with a pulmonary histoplasmosis history. After a multidisciplinary
		"board, the patient underwent transhiatal esophagectomy with gastric-pull up and"
		cervical anastomosis due to pulmonary disease. The patient later developed an
		anastomotic leak with mediastinal abscess. We describe this complication's
		"management via an endoscopic vacuum system, esophageal prosthesis, and exhibit a"
		video illustrating the technique. DISCUSSION: We illustrate the management of
		esophageal cancer associated with previous pulmonary disease. Histoplasmosis may
		"misunderstand the esophageal cancer staging, and it can contribute to anastomotic"
		leakage occurrence. An endoscopic vacuum system is an excellent tool for treating
		"esophagogastric anastomosis fistula after esophagectomy, even when the drainage"
		is accumulated in the mediastinum. The esophageal prosthesis may be used after
		mediastinal abscess resolution. CONCLUSION: Treatment of the association of
		"esophageal cancer and histoplasmosis is feasible. However, care should be taken"
		to avoid highly potential postoperative complications.

		Diagnosed by Metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing.
PG	-	4507-4514
LID	-	10.2147/IDR.S371740 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Histoplasmosis is a deep fungal infection caused by Histoplasma
		"capsulatum and can be classified as pulmonary, disseminated or central."
		Disseminated histoplasmosis is the most dangerous of all clinical types and is
		"characterized by rapid onset, rapid progression, high mortality, and difficulty"
		in diagnosis and treatment. CASE PRESENTATION: This report describes a
		"31-year-old female who presented with fever, with a maximum temperature of 39.8"
		"°C. There were no concomitant symptoms, such as cough, sputum, abdominal pain and"
		"diarrhoea, before the onset of fever, and the illness lasted for more than 20"
		"days. On examination, the liver and spleen were enlarged, and laboratory tests"
		"showed a significant decrease in CD4 cell count, suggesting immune deficiency."
		"Broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment was ineffective, and specific infectious"
		diseases and haematological neoplasms were considered likely. She was finally
		diagnosed with disseminated histoplasmosis after undergoing bone marrow
		aspiration and metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) and was treated with
		"amphotericin B, fluorouracil and itraconazole, with good results. CONCLUSION:"
		This case demonstrates that disseminated histoplasmosis infection can present
		with unexplained fever and that mNGS can be an important complement to bone
		marrow aspiration for the diagnosis of this disease.

AB	-	Histoplasmosis is usually self-limiting in healthy individuals but often fatal in
		immunocompromised patients. It can mimic primary lung malignancy and liver
		"metastasis, causing a delay in appropriate therapy. We report a case of a"
		"58-year-old male, with a 20 pack-year smoking habit, who presented with a"
		three-week history of persistent fevers and productive cough with night sweats.
		"Computed tomography (CT) scan of chest, abdomen and pelvis showed findings"
		suggestive for primary lung malignancy associated with liver metastasis. Liver
		biopsy showed budding yeast. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid grew fungal
		organisms. Urine and serology were positive for histoplasmosis. Patient was
		"pancytopenic, hence, we decided to evaluate further with a bone marrow biopsy"
		which revealed underlying hairy cell leukemia. In the case of disseminated
		"histoplasmosis, a high degree of suspicion towards any immunosuppressive"
		condition should be entertained and any signs should be promptly investigated.

AB	-	Histoplasmosis is a fungal disease usually occurring in endemic areas that can
		affect immuno-impaired patients in whom pulmonary involvement is the rule. We
		"present the case of an 18 year-old immunocompetent, male patient, resident of the"
		"State of Florida, who showed signs of mononucleosis syndrome that included"
		"odynophagia, cervical adenomegaly, sporadic fever and rash; however, no pulmonary"
		involvement or visceromegaly were present. Faced with this atypical and
		"unexpected clinical picture, histoplasmosis infection was eventually diagnosed"
		following cervical lymph-node biopsy. Disseminated histoplasmosis may have
		"unexpected manifestations, as is pointed out in the case described below."

PG	-	330-332

AB	-	Histoplasmosis is the most prevalent endemic mycosis in the United States with
		the highest incidence in the Mississippi and Ohio River Valleys. Most infections
		"are asymptomatic or self-limited. However, in immunocompromised patients, severe"
		"and progressive disseminated infection can occur. In our patient, evaluation of"
		her cutaneous lesions was critical in making the diagnosis of acute-disseminated
		histoplasmosis. Because clinical manifestations of disseminated histoplasmosis
		"can vary widely, early recognition of this infection is challenging. This case"
		highlights the importance of considering histoplasmosis in immunocompromised
		patients since the untreated disease can be fatal.

PG	-	e24360
LID	-	10.7759/cureus.24360 [doi]
LID	-	e24360
AB	-	Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare and life-threateningly
		aggressive syndrome caused by excessive immune activation. It involves the
		abnormal activation of lymphocytes and macrophages which leads to tissue
		destruction and inflammation. Traditionally HLH classification is currently
		separated into primary and secondary HLH based on genetic versus nongenetic
		"events such as infection, malignancy, or autoimmune disorders. In this case"
		"report, we present the case of a middle-aged woman presenting with HIV with"
		medication noncompliance who presented to the emergency department with
		pancytopenia as well as disseminated histoplasmosis and was diagnosed with HLH
		based on the HLH-2004 guidelines and treated in accordance with the HLH-94
		protocol. The patient also underwent treatment for the management of her
		histoplasmosis with a favorable outcome. This case demonstrates that HLH is best
		treated through management of the underlying process that triggered the syndrome
		such as infection as in this patient in addition to management per HLH-94
		protocol early on in the course of the disease in order to have the best chance
		at a positive clinical outcome.

LID	-	30
AB	-	Opportunistic infections of the gastrointestinal tract are well-documented
		complications of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
		"However, concomitant infection by Histoplasma and cytomegalovirus has been"
		described rarely. We present the case of an HIV patient with a CD4 count of 20
		cells/uL who was admitted with odynophagia and weight loss. Endoscopic evaluation
		"revealed ulcerations in the esophagus and colon, and a mass formation in cecum."
		Histology revealed budding yeasts in the cecum and a transverse colon consistent
		with Histoplasma. Urine Histoplasma antigen was positive. Esophageal tissue
		disclosed viral cytopathic changes. Immunostaining was positive for
		cytomegalovirus in the esophagus and transverse colon. The patient was started on
		appropriate antifungal and antiviral treatment with complete resolution of his
		"symptoms. To our knowledge, this is the fifth case of Histoplasma and"
		cytomegalovirus co-infection of the gastrointestinal tract in a patient with
		AIDS. We also review the literature for similar cases in regards to clinical
		presentation and the type of gastrointestinal involvement.

AB	-	Histoplasmosis (HP) is a sporadic deep fungal disease that rarely shows oral
		lesions in various clinical forms. It is usually associated with
		"immunocompromised states, but oral HP has also been reported in many"
		immunocompetent individuals. An unusual case of focal oral HP in a
		"65-year-old immunocompetent male is reported from New Delhi, India (non-endemic"
		region) presenting with oral ulcerative lesions on the floor of the mouth and
		lateral surface of the tongue. This case report highlights the importance of
		prompt diagnosis for the success of the treatment of oral HP along with a
		thorough review of the literature on HP in immunocompetent patients with oral
		manifestations. The average age of immunocompetent patients with oral HP is 49.65
		years with a marked male predilection. The most common intraoral site is the
		"tongue, followed by the gingiva. Also, five intraosseous cases of HP in"
		"immunocompetent patients are reported, among which four are seen in patients from"
		Africa and in a much younger age group (mean: 17.25 years).

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: We describe a case of progressive disseminated histoplasmosis (PDH)
		and disseminated cytomegalovirus (CMV) with development of haemophagocytic
		lymphohistiocytosis in a 62-year-old man of Bangladeshi origin living in the UK.
		CASE PRESENTATION: The patient had a background of ulcerative colitis for which
		"he took prednisolone and azathioprine. He presented with fever, lethargy, cough,"
		"weight loss and skin redness, and was initially treated for bacterial cellulitis"
		and investigated for underlying malignancy. He developed multiple progressive
		"erythematous skin lesions, sepsis and colitis requiring management on intensive"
		"care. A skin biopsy showed yeasts in the dermis and sub-cutaneous fat, which were"
		confirmed as Histoplasma capsulatum by PCR. Disseminated CMV with evidence of end
		organ gastrointestinal disease was also diagnosed. Despite anti-viral and
		"anti-fungal treatment, the patient deteriorated with evidence of bone marrow"
		suppression and a diagnosis of haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis was made.
		CONCLUSION: PDH is classically seen in patients with significant
		"immunosuppression, e.g. those with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or on"
		"anti-TNF therapy; however, we present a case of reactivation of Histoplasma in a"
		non-HIV patient. We consider the importance of contemplating reactivation of
		endemic mycoses and CMV in critically unwell and deteriorating patients.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Pulmonary histoplasmosis is a fungal infection caused by histoplasma
		"capsulatum, rarely diagnosed in non endemic areas and/or immunocompromised"
		patients. Complication of pulmonary histoplasmosis with bronchocentric
		granulomatosis is extremely rare. CASE REPORT: A 48-year-old man with prolonged
		fever and nausea was admitted to our hospital. Clinical examination revealed
		pathological auscultatory sounds to the left lung. Computed tomography was
		"performed and revealed a large solid mass of the left upper lobe, limited pleural"
		and pericardial effusion and calcified lymphadenopathy of mediastinum. A computed
		tomography guided core biopsy of the lung lesion was performed and three samples
		were obtained. Culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) revealed Histoplasma
		capsulatum. Histological findings were compatible with bronchocentric
		granulomatosis. Extended laboratory investigation excluded immunosuppresion. Our
		patient although immunocompetent was diagnosed with chronic pulmonary
		histoplasmosis complicated with bronchocentric granulomatosis and treatment with
		antifungal medication and methylprednisoline started. CONCLUSION: Description of
		a rare case of chronic pulmonary histoplasmosis in a non endemic area like
		"Greece, with atypical radiological findings, complicated with bronchocentric"
		granulomatosis.

		"pancytopenia and disseminated histoplasmosis accompanied by HLH, initially"
		suspected to be blood malignancies. Our first case documented the relevance
		between the improvement of pancytopenia and the clearance of Histoplasma
		capsulatum in serial bone marrow aspirations. The second case showed immense
		Histoplasma engulfment by the macrophage in relation to a severe clinical
		"condition, followed by improvement of clinical symptoms in accordance with the"
		recovery of pancytopenia. These two cases highlighted the importance of
		comprehensive and critical analysis for cases with concurrent pancytopenia and
		"severe infection, since it may be that the pancytopenia underlies the severe"
		infection or vice versa.

AB	-	Severe infections with Histoplasma capsulatum are commonly observed in patient
		with secondary immunodeficiency disorders. We report a two and a half years old
		boy previously healthy with disseminated cutaneous histoplasmosis. Using whole
		"exome sequencing, we found an indel mutation at the CD40LG gene, suggesting a"
		"diagnosis of hyper-IgM (HIGM) syndrome, even in the absence of the usual features"
		"for the disease. Interestingly, the patient lives in a region endemic for"
		histoplasmosis. The unusual infections in our case suggest that in children with
		"severe histoplasmosis and resident in endemic areas, HIGM syndrome should be"
		considered as a diagnosis.

AB	-	Chronic histoplasmosis is typically diagnosed in patients who are
		immunocompromised or severely debilitated and who either live in or who have
		"travelled to endemic areas. We report the case of a young, otherwise"
		immunocompetent male patient who presented to a New York hospital with lobar
		consolidation and was found to have chronic pulmonary histoplasmosis. He
		described no history of travel to an endemic area. Immunological workup later
		revealed selective immunoglobulin M (IgM) deficiency. The literature has
		suggested a link between IgM deficiency and fungal infections. Recent research
		has also proposed a link between autoimmunity and IgM deficiency. Our clinical
		vignette describes the case of a patient with selective IgM deficiency who was
		diagnosed with pulmonary histoplasmosis without any clinical evidence of
		autoimmune disease.

TI	-	Pulmonary Histoplasmosis Mimicking Metastatic Lung Cancer: A Case Report.
LID	-	10.3390/diagnostics11020328 [doi]
LID	-	328
AB	-	Histoplasmosis is a well-known endemic fungal infection but experience in
		"non-endemic regions is often limited, which may lead to delayed diagnosis and"
		"extensive testing. The diagnosis can be especially challenging, typically when"
		the disease first presents with pulmonary nodules accompanied by hilar and
		"mediastinal lymphadenopathy, suggesting a much more common malignant disease. In"
		"this situation, a greater FDG uptake in draining lymph nodes in comparison with"
		"the associated lung nodule seen in [(18)F]FDG-PET/CT, the so-called ""flip-flop"
		"fungus"" sign, can help to orientate further diagnostic measures. We report a case"
		"of a 56-year-old woman living in Switzerland, a non-endemic region, whose"
		diagnosis of imported histoplasmosis was delayed since the findings had been
		"initially misinterpreted as pulmonary malignancy. Further, histological workup"
		"was inconclusive due to lack of specific fungal staining, leading to ineffective"
		treatment and non-resolving disease. This paper intends to highlight the pitfalls
		in diagnosing Histoplasma capsulatum and presents images of particularities of
		"fungal infections in [(18)F]FDG-PET/CT, which in our case showed a ""flip-flop"
		"fungus"" sign."

AB	-	Histoplasmosis and cryptococcosis are systemic fungal diseases frequently
		"encountered in immunocompromised hosts, particularly in patients with HIV/AIDS"
		"with low CD4 counts. However, co-infection with histoplasmosis and cryptococcosis"
		"is an uncommon clinical scenario, hence carrying the risk of under diagnosis by"
		"medical professionals. For instance, when one infection is identified, most"
		health professionals will have a low suspicion for an additional co-infection.
		"Here, we report the case of a 71-year-old gentleman with a new diagnosis of"
		myasthenia gravis (MG) requiring recent steroid therapy who presented with
		recurrent respiratory symptoms despite treatment for community acquired
		pneumonia. Bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were performed; BAL
		samples revealed presence of Cryptococcus neoformans and histoplasma antigen
		(Ag). Serum cryptococcal Ag and urine histoplasma Ag returned positive as well.
		"The patient then required inpatient treatment with amphotericin B, with eventual"
		transition to oral fluconazole at discharge. Pulmonology and Infectious disease
		consults assisted in appropriate diagnosis and management of this rare
		presentation. Given the high prevalence of immunocompromised states in a myriad
		"of medical co-morbidities, it is important to highlight this case to create"
		awareness regarding possibility of concomitant systemic fungal diseases.

		Prosthetic Joint Infection: A Case Report.
LID	-	10.2106/JBJS.CC.22.00155 [doi]
AB	-	CASE: This report describes a histoplasma capsulatum total knee prosthetic joint
		infection (PJI) in an immunosuppressed patient treated with a 2-stage revision.
		"The diagnosis of PJI was made based on minor criteria, and the causative organism"
		was identified from cultures obtained at the time of explantation. The patient
		"underwent induction with amphotericin B, followed by oral antifungal therapy and"
		a successful 2-stage revision with a hinged prosthesis with an interval of ∼7
		"months between stage 1 and stage 2. At the most recent follow-up (18 months), she"
		remained clear from infection with planned lifetime antifungal suppression.
		CONCLUSION: This case report highlights the importance of consideration of
		"atypical organisms when treating immunocompromised patients. Furthermore, this"
		case report documents one of the few cases of histoplasma PJI and provides a
		successful treatment algorithm to potentially be applied to future cases.

AB	-	Histoplasmosis is the most common endemic fungal infection in the USA. The
		majority of cases are asymptomatic and have clear exposure to endemic regions. In
		"contrast, we present an adolescent immunocompromised patient with systemic and"
		"relatively non-specific symptoms including abdominal pain, weight loss, lower"
		"extremity edema, and scabbing skin lesions, without known exposure to endemic"
		areas for histoplasmosis. Histologic analysis of gastrointestinal and skin
		biopsies eventually revealed a diagnosis of disseminated histoplasmosis; the
		patient was successfully treated with amphotericin B followed by itraconazole
		"maintenance therapy. Ultimately, a high bar of suspicion for fungal disease must"
		be maintained in immunosuppressed individuals even without apparent exposure
		history to endemic areas. This case report serves as a valuable reference for
		practitioners evaluating differential diagnosis of infections in
		immunocompromised patients.

AB	-	Histoplasma capsulatum periprosthetic knee infection has rarely been reported in
		"the literature due to its low frequency. Notwithstanding, it is important to keep"
		it among the differential diagnoses to avoid delays in treatment. The current
		report presents the case of infectious knee monoarthritis in an immunocompetent
		patient after unicompartmental knee arthroplasty. The joint infection was
		"accompanied by disseminated histoplasmosis, which initiated an autoimmune"
		"reaction, ensuing a systemic inflammatory response syndrome. The management"
		protocol used in this case was successful and included staged arthroplasty
		reconstruction combined with chronic antifungal and steroid pharmacotherapy.
		"Approximately 4 years after total knee arthroplasty revision, there were no"
		clinical signs of localized or systemic infection.

AB	-	Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) have become the cornerstone for the
		treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other systemic autoimmune conditions.
		"However, these biologic DMARDs can lead to various opportunistic infections such"
		"as viral infection, tuberculosis, and histoplasmosis. Furthermore, these"
		biologics can also cause severe systemic inflammatory reactions known as
		hemophagocytosis lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) that can lead to multiorgan failure
		and high mortality. Due to overlapping clinical features and time-intensive
		"microbiological culture methods, distinguishing between HLH and opportunistic"
		infections can be challenging early in the disease course. We present a similar
		situation with our patient where the patient met the diagnostic criteria for HLH
		however was found to have disseminated histoplasmosis. This case uniquely
		evaluates the utility of the HLH diagnostic criteria and hemophagocytosis for
		accurate diagnosis of HLH.

AB	-	Histoplasma capsulatum is no longer confined to certain geographic areas and
		should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of lymphadenopathy and
		organomegaly in HIV-positive patients. We present an unusual case of a
		"20-year-old immunocompromised male of African origin presenting with fever,"
		"jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, and retroperitoneal and cervical lymphadenopathy."
		Fine needle aspiration (FNA) smears from the cervical lymph node revealed
		numerous yeast forms of histoplasma in macrophages. The patient succumbed to the
		fulminant infection. Postmortem liver biopsy also revealed infiltration by
		"histoplasma, confirming the diagnosis of disseminated histoplasmosis. This case"
		highlights the variable nature of the clinical presentation of disseminated
		"histoplasmosis which can mimic tuberculosis, leishmaniasis, or lymphoma. FNA"
		"cytology is a rapid, cost-effective, and reliable diagnostic tool for early"
		detection and prompt management of histoplasmosis.

		to Ranibizumab Injections following Uneventful Delivery.
PG	-	129-33
LID	-	10.1159/000328385 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: Occurrence of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) during pregnancy has
		been reported as a complication of presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome or
		"punctuate inner chorioretinopathy. To our knowledge, idiopathic CNV (ICNV) during"
		pregnancy has only been reported once in the relevant literature. Bevacizumab has
		"been used for the treatment of ICNV in small case series. However, there is"
		limited experience regarding the use of ranibizumab for the management of ICNV.
		CASE REPORT: A 31-year-old woman in the eighth month of her second pregnancy was
		diagnosed with mild macular and papillary edema. She was followed up using
		"biomicroscopy, fluorescein angiography (FA), and optical coherence tomography"
		"(OCT). After 3 months, visual acuity further deteriorated and funduscopy, FA and"
		OCT findings revealed a juxtapapillary choroidal neovascular membrane (CNVM).
		"After two ranibizumab injections, best-corrected visual acuity increased"
		"significantly, physiological macular anatomy was restored and no subretinal fluid"
		"was observed. DISCUSSION: In this case report, we present a young pregnant"
		"patient with peripapillary ICNV and neurosensory detachment involving the macula,"
		and treatment of the eye with intravitreal ranibizumab following uneventful
		delivery. Increased angiogenic factor levels associated with pregnancy may
		contribute to the onset of CNV although this relationship has to be investigated
		experimentally. The rapid response to ranibizumab suggests that this anti-VEGF
		agent may be an alternative treatment option in the management of peripapillary
		ICNV.

AB	-	Histoplasmosis is an uncommon opportunistic infection in human immunodeficiency
		virus (HIV) positive children. The most common form is primary disseminated
		"histoplasmosis, characterized by persistent fever and failure to thrive. A"
		10-year-old HIV positive girl presented to the Baylor College of Medicine
		Children's Foundation-Tanzania Mbeya Center of Excellence (COE) with ulcerated
		"skin lesions and a violaceous facial rash. She also had persistent fevers, severe"
		"acute malnutrition, and severe anemia. At diagnosis, the patient was failing"
		first line antiretroviral therapy (ART) with a cluster of differentiation 4
		"immune cells (CD4) of 24 cells/µL and an HIV viral load (VL) of 196,658 cp/mL."
		"The patient was changed to a second line ART regimen (abacavir, lamivudine, and"
		"ritonavir-boosted lopinavir) and received nutritional support, blood"
		"transfusions, multiple antibiotics, and meticulous wound care. She also received"
		"comprehensive symptom management, psychosocial support, and emergency housing"
		through the COE's palliative care program. Biopsy of a lesion showed
		intracytoplasmic organisms consistent with Histoplasmosis capsulatum var
		capsulatum. The patient was treated with conventional amphotericin B and oral
		itraconazole and she achieved wound healing as well as immune reconstitution and
		HIV viral suppression. Amphotericin infusions were given as an outpatient despite
		the resource constraints of the setting in southwestern Tanzania. Histoplasmosis
		should be considered in the differential diagnosis of the immunocompromised host
		with unusual skin manifestations and persistent fever.

LID	-	10.4103/0970-9371.168855 [doi]
AB	-	Histoplasmosis is an opportunistic fungal infection caused by inhaling the spores
		of a fungus called Histoplasma capsulatum. Disseminated histoplasmosis is the
		most common form associated with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).
		"Here, we report a case of histoplasmosis presenting as isolated cervical"
		lymphadenopathy in a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patient
		diagnosed by a less invasive method (fine-needle aspiration cytology) and
		confirmed by fungal culture of fine-needle aspiration material. Due to varied and
		"nonspecific clinical manifestations of histoplasmosis, most of the infections are"
		misdiagnosed or underreported. It has to be considered in differential diagnosis
		"of cervical lymphadenopathy, particularly in immunocompromised patients so that"
		patients can be treated medically at an early stage before dissemination occurs
		"and unnecessary surgery can be avoided. Here, we present this case because of its"
		rare presentation as isolated cervical lymphadenopathy and classical cytological
		picture.

LID	-	2723489
AB	-	Miliary histoplasmosis is a rare presentation that may mimic miliary
		tuberculosis. We report a case of miliary histoplasmosis in a 52-year-old male
		"who was being treated with hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate, and sulfasalazine"
		for his rheumatoid arthritis and presented to the emergency department with
		shortness of breath and fevers. Computed tomography (CT) chest revealed miliary
		pulmonary nodules. Urine Histoplasma antigen and serum Histoplasma antigen were
		"negative; however, Coccidioides immitis complement immunofixation assay and"
		Coccidioides IgM were positive. The patient was initiated on treatment for
		"pulmonary coccidioidomycosis and immunosuppression was held. However, a few days"
		"later, Histoplasma capsulatum was isolated from cultures from bronchoscopy. This"
		case highlights the difficulty in diagnosing histoplasmosis in immunocompromised
		patients and the importance of having a broad differential diagnosis for miliary
		pulmonary nodules. Tissue culture and histopathology remain the gold standard for
		the diagnosis of histoplasmosis. Further research needs to be conducted to
		determine the optimal duration of histoplasmosis treatment in immunocompromised
		patients.

AB	-	Histoplasmosis is a common endemic mycosis. The majority of infections involving
		this dimorphic fungus are asymptomatic. Manifestations in symptomatic patients
		"are diverse, ranging from flu-like illness to a more serious disseminated"
		disease. We present here a case of chronic disseminated histoplasmosis mimicking
		a metastatic cancer. We reviewed the literature for cases of disseminated
		"histoplasmosis presenting with hypercalcemia, focusing particularly on clinical"
		"presentation, risk factors predisposing for fungal infection, and outcome. We"
		report a case of a 65-year-old diabetic male who presented with unexplained
		weight loss and hypercalcemia. Multiple brain space-occupying lesions and
		bilateral adrenal enlargement were evident on imaging studies. Biopsies showed
		"caseating granulomas with budding yeast, consistent with histoplasmosis. The"
		patient's symptoms resolved after liposomal amphotericin B and itraconazole
		"therapy. Granulomatous diseases, including fungal infections, should be"
		"considered alongside malignancies, in patients with similar presentation."

AB	-	Fibrosing mediastinitis is a rare condition defined by the presence of fibrotic
		mediastinal infiltrates that obliterate normal fat planes. It is a late
		"complication of a previous granulomatous infection, such as histoplasmosis or"
		"tuberculosis (TB). Due to its rarity, fibrosing mediastinitis is often"
		"under-recognized, and the clinical presentation is variable and dependent on the"
		extent of infiltration or encasement of structures within the mediastinum. We
		"present a case of fibrosing mediastinitis in a man with a prior history of TB,"
		who presented with progressive dyspnea and was found to have chronic mediastinal
		soft tissue opacities and pulmonary hypertension. His diagnosis was delayed due
		to the lack of recognition of this clinical/radiographic entity. Fibrosing
		mediastinitis is a rare entity usually caused by granulomatous disease. Most
		cases develop as a late complication of histoplasmosis or TB. The presence of
		calcified mediastinal soft tissue infiltrates on advanced chest imaging can be
		diagnostic of fibrosing mediastinitis in patients with a prior history of a
		granulomatous infection once active processes such as malignancy are excluded.

		has been reported as a radiologic presentation of chronic histoplasmosis in
		"patients with pre-existing lung disease. However, there have been few reports of"
		extensive basal predominant cavitary lesions that mimic cystic-bronchiectasis.
		CASE PRESENTATION: A 65-year-old previously healthy Thai male presented with
		"productive cough, hoarseness, low-grade fever, and weight loss for 6 months."
		There was no history of significant exposure to Histoplasmosis capsulatum. Tests
		for HIV and anti-IFN- γ antibody were negative. Chest CT revealed multifocal
		"thick wall cavities, which were distributed in a peri-bronchial pattern, and some"
		areas of consolidation in both basal lungs. Laryngoscopy revealed an ulcerative
		lesion of the false vocal cords. Histopathological study of false vocal cords and
		lung tissue showed granulomatous inflammation with mixed inflammatory cell
		infiltration and aggregation of histiocytes containing round intracytoplasmic
		"organisms. GMS-staining was positive, but negative mucicarmine-staining was"
		negative. A real-time PCR assay of the lung tissue was positive for
		Histoplasmosis capsulatum. The final diagnosis was chronic cavitary pulmonary
		histoplasmosis with laryngeal involvement. CONCLUSION: Chronic cavitary pulmonary
		"histoplasmosis is rare, as is laryngeal involvement. However, there have been"
		"such cases in endemic areas, even in immunocompetent patients. Chronic"
		histoplasmosis should be considered in patients who present with the extensive
		basal predominant cavitary-pulmonary lesions that mimic cystic bronchiectasis.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic inflammatory"
		disorder. There is a clear association between some disease-modifying drugs used
		to treat RA and infection. The introduction of the anti-tumor necrosis factor
		(TNF) therapies has improved the outcome of severe RA. The TNF-antagonism may
		increase susceptibility to granulomatous pathogens such as Mycobacterium
		"tuberculosis, Listeria monocytogenes, and Histoplasma capsulatum. METHODS: We"
		"report the case of a 37-year-old woman with RA receiving an anti-TNF agent, who"
		"developed a rash on her back and both legs, which was finally diagnosed as"
		tuberculoid leprosy. RESULTS: This is the first case of leprosy due to anti-TNF
		therapy reported in Europe. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware of this and
		other types of atypical and serious infections that patients may suffer from when
		treated with anti-TNF agents.

		"common opportunistic infections in immunosuppressed patients, particularly in"
		patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). (1 → 3)-β-D-glucan is a

		Aspergillus sp. and Histoplasma sp. The measurement of serum (1 → 3)-β-D-glucan
		has been reported to be a highly sensitive test for PCP related to human

		elevated serum (1 → 3)-β-D glucan and highlight how HIV-PCP cannot be completely
		ruled out if (1 → 3)-β-D glucan is negative.

AB	-	Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is nowadays
		widespread minimally invasive procedure for diagnosing a large number of benign
		as well as malignant lesions. We report a case of a 62-year-old immunocompetent
		"elderly male, who presented with high-grade fever, hepatosplenomegaly and"
		mediastinal and intra-abdominal lymph nodes. He was residing in an old haweli
		with bats infestation. EUS-FNA of the subcarinal and the preaortic lymph node
		clinched the diagnosis. A rapid on-site evaluation of the cytology material
		revealed organisms conforming to the morphology of Histoplasma capsulatum. The
		patient was immediately started on amphotericin B and itraconazole and responded
		"well. In this case, we found the role of EUS-FNA not only in diagnosis, but also"
		in the follow-up of the patient.

AB	-	"The term ""endemic mycoses"" refers to a group of fungi that maintains a baseline"
		rate of infection only in certain geographical regions due to the hospitable
		"enviormental conditions these regions offer. In the United States, Histoplasma"
		"capsulatum, Coccidioides spp, and Blastomyces dermatitidis are the three most"
		prevalent endemic human fungal infections. The traditional endemic regions for
		"these pathogens are defined based on data acquired many decades ago, and case"
		"detection is subject to diagnostic delays even in classically endemic areas, a"
		problem that is likely to be magnified in areas less familiar with these fungal
		infections. The present series includes an example of each of these infections
		"diagnosed in a medical center situated in the suburbs of New York City, a"
		location not considered endemic for any of them. Likely routes of acquisition for
		"the three patients are considered, and the history of encounters with these"
		"pathogens in New York State is briefly recounted. Altogether, this report is"
		intended to serve as a reminder to clinicians that traditional distribution maps
		for the endemic mycoses are bound to be outdated in the face of modern trends in
		"globalization, population dynamics, and ecological change."

AB	-	"Among all infections occurring in pediatric kidney transplant recipients,"
		approximately 1%-5% are fungal. Most fungal infections occur in the first 6
		months following kidney transplantation. We present the case of a 15-year-old boy
		"with a history of a kidney transplant 4 years ago, who was found to have"
		"asymptomatic moderate hypercalcemia on routine laboratory testing, along with an"
		acute deterioration of his kidney function markers. The cause of his acute kidney
		injury was likely related to hypercalcemia. An extensive workup for hypercalcemia
		revealed infection with Histoplasma capsulatum (histoplasmosis) with multiple
		pulmonary nodules. Hypercalcemia that was initially refractory to medical
		management resolved after initiating the antifungal treatment. Fungal
		granulomatous infections such as histoplasmosis should be considered in the
		differential diagnosis of hypercalcemia in an asymptomatic pediatric kidney
		transplant recipient.

AB	-	Disseminated histoplasmosis is a rare opportunistic infection in non-endemic
		"areas, where the disease is often diagnosed late. The spectrum of clinical"
		manifestations is broad and life-threatening complications occur. We present a
		detailed case of a kidney liver transplant patient with disseminated
		histoplasmosis in a non-endemic area. Our case highlights the wide range of
		"pathogens to consider in the immunocompromised patient, the delayed diagnosis of"
		Histoplasmosis Capsulatum in non-endemic areas and the possibility of severe
		gastrointestinal disease. We also briefly review diagnostic tests and treatment
		options.

AB	-	"Most cases of osteomyelitis in children are caused by Staphylococcus aureus,"

		American ethnicity who had extensive inflammation of and discharge from his right
		ankle. Imaging studies supported a diagnosis of osteomyelitis. Acid-fast bacillus
		(AFB) and routine wound cultures were ordered on the wound discharge. The AFB
		"culture yielded a positive result for Mycobacterium bovis, and molecular"
		"diagnostic testing further genotyped the microorganism as Mycobacterium bovis,"
		"Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG). Herein, we report a rare case of osteomyelitis"
		that we believe resulted from a BCG vaccine that the patient had received outside

AB	-	"Emmonsia crescens is a saprophytic fungus that is distributed worldwide, causing"
		"diseases mostly in rodents. It has also been described, though rarely, as an"
		"etiologic agent of pulmonary pathology in humans, potentially leading to death. A"
		case of pulmonary adiaspiromycosis is reported in a 30-year-old immunocompetent
		"man. The patient presented with a history of several weeks of weakness, cough,"
		"fever, and weight loss of 10 kg. Clinical and radiographic findings showed"
		"pulmonary lesions consistent with tuberculosis or histoplasmosis, but no pathogen"
		was found with classical microbiological procedures. The diagnosis of
		adiaspiromycosis due to Emmonsia crescens was initially made using molecular
		biology techniques. Histological observations subsequently confirmed the presence
		"of adiaspores in granulomas. To our knowledge, this is the first case of"
		adiaspiromycosis diagnosed by PCR and sequencing. The patient was treated with
		itraconazole and was seen at 1 month with symptomatic improvement. Here we will
		discuss this rare fungal infection and its difficult treatment and diagnosis. As
		"represented in this case, molecular biology is a powerful method to optimize"
		diagnostic tests and therefore improve the care of the infected patient.

AB	-	Histoplasmosis is one of the most common endemic mycoses affecting
		immunocompromised individuals in the United States and Latin America. Involvement
		"of the central nervous system carries higher mortality rates and worse prognosis,"
		"given its resemblance to stroke, vasculitis, and meningitis of other etiologies."
		"The diagnosis is challenging, due to its subtle clinical presentation and the"
		poor sensitivity of the cerebrospinal fluid culture. Herein the authors present a
		"case of a middle-aged man with HIV, who presented with intermittent headaches"
		"exacerbated by an oculomotor nerve palsy, concerning for acute stroke. A"
		"diagnosis of central nervous system histoplasmosis was made, and his neurological"
		deficits subsided after initiation of treatment. The stroke-like syndrome in this
		scenario may be secondary to granulomatous vasculitis of small caliber cerebral
		blood vessels. Histoplasmosis of the central nervous system remains a challenging
		"diagnosis, which requires a high index of suspicion by the clinician for an early"
		institution of therapy in order to improve outcomes.

AB	-	The use of immune-checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy has significantly improved
		patient outcomes in a wide variety of cancers and has become a cornerstone in the
		"treatment of renal cell carcinoma. However, ICI treatment has the potential to"
		cause a variety of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) that can affect any
		tissue or organ. This report describes the diagnostic dilemma of a patient with
		both RCC and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who developed acute onset of fever and
		diffuse lymphadenopathy following treatment with combined ipilimumab and
		"nivolumab. While diagnostic considerations included worsening lymphoma,"
		"hyperprogression of RCC, sarcoid-like reaction from immunotherapy, and fungal"
		"infection, his lymphadenopathy eventually resolved with treatment for"
		histoplasmosis and discontinuation of immunotherapy. Despite only receiving two
		"doses of immunotherapy, he has not required additional systemic therapy for RCC."
		This case demonstrates both the effectiveness of ICI therapy and the need for
		multidisciplinary approach to potential irAEs.

AB	-	"Histoplasmosis is caused by Histoplasma capsulatum, and commonly it causes an"
		asymptomatic illness. Although Histoplasma is the commonest organism to infect
		"adrenal glands, disseminated histoplasmosis in an immune-competent host leading"
		"to adrenal insufficiency is rare in current literature. Here, we report a case of"
		possible disseminated histoplasmosis leading to adrenal crisis in a young Asian
		immunocompetent male. A 42-year-old Sri Lankan male with noninsulin-dependent
		diabetes mellitus presented with constitutional symptoms and feverishness for
		three weeks' duration. He was found to have hepatosplenomegaly with bilateral
		"adrenal masses and pancytopenia. One week later, he developed severe vomiting and"
		hemodynamic collapse and was found to have suppressed adrenal functions.
		Ultrasound-guided biopsy of adrenals showed fungal spores morphologically similar
		to Histoplasma. He was started on oral itraconazole and adrenal replacement
		therapy. He improved symptomatically with treatment and currently is on regular
		clinic follow-up with a plan to continue antifungal therapy for at least one year
		"to prevent a relapse. Fungal infections, especially histoplasmosis, need to be"
		considered in all immunocompetent patients with compatible history and bilateral
		adrenal masses. Adrenal insufficiency needs to be promptly diagnosed and treated
		to prevent Addisonian crisis in these patients.

AB	-	We report a case of a Puerto Rican male with advanced AIDS who presented with
		"multiple falls and pancytopenia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain,"
		"as initial workup, revealed 2 ring-enhancing brain lesions. Initial cerebrospinal"
		"fluid analysis revealed minimal cells, mildly elevated protein, and no organism"
		"seen on gram stain. Due to prohibitive thrombocytopenia, brain biopsy was"
		deferred. He had neither clinical nor radiographic improvement despite empiric
		therapy for both toxoplasmosis and bacterial abscesses. Indicated by
		"pancytopenia, bone marrow (BM) aspiration was performed. Culture of BM aspirate"
		grew Histoplasma capsulatum. Urine histoplasma antigen was markedly elevated. He
		was treated with liposomal amphotericin B (LamB) for progressive disseminated
		histoplasmosis with probable central nervous system involvement. Cerebrospinal
		fluid histoplasma antigen obtained after 2 months of LamB was detected. After
		"prolonged course of LamB, he took itraconazole. Brain MRI at 7-month follow-up"
		revealed significant improvement from baseline study.

LID	-	9485793
AB	-	Patients are commonly referred to general surgery clinics for evaluation of
		soft-tissue masses of the trunk and extremities. The primary goal of surgical
		"referral is to confirm the presence of a mass, to assess the need for additional"
		"imaging and/or testing, and to gauge amenability to surgical biopsy, whether"
		incisional or excisional. This is a case of a 67-year-old woman who was referred
		to surgery clinic for a small soft-tissue mass near her left elbow that had
		increased in size and pain over the past year. The mass had been present for
		"several years. After MRI imaging revealed a nonspecific process, an excisional"
		"biopsy was performed. Following a careful review of the patient's history, risk"
		"factors, and histological results, a diagnosis of localized subcutaneous"
		Histoplasma capsulatum var. capsulatum infection was made. Without signs or
		"symptoms of active, systemic disease, no further treatment was recommended. The"
		patient was provided risk factor counseling for symptoms or signs of active
		"histoplasmosis and outpatient follow-up. Histologically, most masses will return"
		"as benign and mesenchymal in origin. However, soft-tissue masses may arise from"
		uncommon etiologies and a broad differential is needed to ensure appropriate
		management and recommendations.

PG	-	19609
AB	-	"Psoriasis is a chronic, auto-inflammatory disease affecting millions of"
		"individuals worldwide. In addition to classic cutaneous manifestations, the"
		condition is linked to significant co-morbidities including cardiovascular
		"disease, metabolic syndrome, melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer, and"
		"psychiatric disease. Therefore, more aggressive treatment and multi-disciplinary"
		"care is critical. Measures of disease burden (quantified by anatomic location,"
		"body surface area (BSA) of involvement, and impact on daily life) assist in"
		determining the severity of disease and have been integral in objective
		assessment of treatment regimens and new drug therapies. Biologic agents have
		entered the clinical armamentarium as treatment options for patients with
		moderate-to-severe psoriasis who have failed traditional systemic therapies.
		Three of the four FDA-approved biologic agents for psoriasis suppress TNF-α
		"mediated pathways, which are essential for granuloma formation and maintenance,"
		"key components of host defenses against intracellular pathogens. Subsequently,"
		the increased use of these agents is accompanied by increased reporting of
		"granulomatous infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, nocardia,"
		and nontuberculous mycobacteria. Report of any unusual infection is therefore
		vitally important in the care of this immune suppressed patient population.

TI	-	Adenomatoid tumors of the pleura.
PG	-	1219-23
AB	-	We report two cases of small pleural nodules showing the distinctive histologic
		appearance of adenomatoid tumor. Both lesions were discovered incidentally during
		surgery in patients undergoing lung resection for unrelated intrapulmonary
		masses: lung carcinoma in one case and histoplasmosis in the other. The tumors
		were composed of a focal proliferation of epithelioid cells forming vacuoles and
		"tubular spaces in a fibrous stroma, as seen in adenomatoid tumors from other"
		sites. The differential diagnosis in both cases included metastatic signet ring
		cell carcinoma. The mesothelial nature of the lesions was supported by
		immunohistochemical and ultrastructural evidence. The tumor cells in both cases
		were positive for cytokeratin but negative for carcinoembryonic antigen and
		"LeuM1. One case was also negative for BER-EP4, B72.3, CD34, and Factor VIII."
		"Electron microscopy in this case demonstrated well-developed basal laminae,"
		"desmosomes, and numerous slender microvilli along the luminal surfaces of the"
		tumor cells. Adenomatoid tumors are regarded as a benign variant of mesothelioma.
		"Despite the abundance of mesothelial cells in the pleura, adenomatoid tumors are"
		apparently extremely rare in this location. Separation from malignant lesions
		such as adenocarcinoma and epithelioid hemangioendothelioma is important.

LID	-	e10454
AB	-	The association between hepatitis C virus (HCV) and sarcoidosis is
		"well-documented, but in this case report, we shall discuss an interesting"
		"association between hepatitis B virus (HBV) and sarcoidosis, presenting with"
		non-specific symptoms and confirmed with liver biopsy and immunologic markers.
		The case was complicated by treatment with immunosuppressive medication that led
		"to colonic histoplasmosis. A 58-year-old woman, from the western part of India,"
		who has a past medical history of HBV-related cirrhosis of the liver for six
		"months, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes presented to our clinic with bilateral"
		"pedal edema, anorexia, and mild epigastric discomfort. She had been on entecavir"
		"for the last six months. The patient denied any significant surgical, social, or"
		family history. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed hepatosplenomegaly and
		mesenteric lymphadenopathy. She had a 21.3kPa liver stiffness on elastography and
		an HBV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) level of 89 copies/ml. Liver biopsy showed
		multiple noncaseating granulomas consisting of Langerhans cells in the parenchyma
		"and portal tract, associated with moderate inflammation. A chest computed"
		tomography (CT) scan showed upper and middle lobe fibrosis of the lungs; this
		diagnosis was further confirmed with elevated angiotensin-converting enzymes. She
		"was started on prednisone; within a period of three months, she experienced"
		"weight loss, diarrhea, and fever. Colonoscopy was done after an abdomen CT showed"
		"mural thickening of the ascending colon and terminal ileum, which on biopsy was"
		"confirmed as histoplasmosis. Prednisone was stopped, and the patient was treated"
		"with hydroxychloroquine and amphotericin B, followed by itraconazole. The patient"
		"improved symptomatically, and repeated colonoscopy findings were normal. Studies"
		"are scarce to prove the association between hepatitis B and sarcoidosis; however,"
		we reasonably hypothesized that the alterations in the pool of cytokines and
		immune cells caused by HBV infection might have had a vicious influence on immune
		regulation and could be a trigger for granuloma. Further studies can impact the
		future to provide for a better understanding of the pathophysiology of
		"sarcoidosis, HBV correlation, and treatment options."

		Concomitantly the patient presented with hyponatremia which was deemed to be from
		SIADH. We present the first case of a patient with T. marneffei cross reactivity
		"with Blastomyces, Histoplasma and SIADH due to pulmonary disease."

AB	-	We report the case of a previously healthy 32-year-old man who was seen with
		"flulike symptoms, dyspnea, and chest pain. The diagnosis was"
		"pyopneumopericardium, and pericardial tap revealed 1.3 L of purulent material."
		Computed tomography of the chest demonstrated a calcified mass inferior to the
		carina. Urgent exploration through a right thoracotomy revealed that the mass was
		adherent to the esophagus and pericardium. The subcarinal mass was resected.
		"Pathological study demonstrated granulomatous lymph nodes, which were likely due"
		to histoplasmosis. This is among the first reports of granulomatous erosion into
		"the pericardium causing pyopneumopericardium. The patient made a good recovery,"
		and his case demonstrates the importance of early imaging and mediastinal
		exploration for pyopneumopericardium.

AB	-	Adrenal histoplasmosis is an uncommon cause for adrenal insufficiency. The
		duration of treatment for adrenal histoplasmosis is not clear. Existing treatment
		regimens advocate antifungals given for periods ranging from 6 months to 2 years.
		We report here a rare case who showed persistence of histoplasma in adrenal
		biopsy 7 years after being initially treated with itraconazole for 9 months. This
		calls for a prolonged therapy with regular review of adrenal morphology and
		histology in these patients.

		"testing confirmed the diagnosis of HIV/AIDS with a CD4 count of 52 cells/mm(3),"

		highlights the importance of maintaining a broad differential for opportunistic

TI	-	Belatacept and mediastinal histoplasmosis in a kidney transplant patient.
PG	-	84-7
LID	-	10.15171/jnp.2016.15 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: In transplantation immunosuppression enhances the appearance of
		"opportunist infections. An ideal balance between the prevention of rejection, the"
		lowest risk of infections and the highest rates of graft survival is a continuous
		"challenge. Lower doses of immunosuppression may diminish the risk of infections,"
		"metabolic and hemodynamic complications or even of malignancy, but may expose"
		patients to episodes of acute rejection. New drugs are being developed to improve
		graft survival at the lowest risk of side effects. Belatacept has recently been
		introduced in kidney transplantation to inhibit the co-ligand signal of T cell
		"stimulation. It is a drug with a safe profile, is well-tolerated and appears to"
		"improve long-term survival of kidney grafts. However, there may be an increase in"
		"opportunistic infections which may be facilitated by T cell depression, as"
		"Aspergillus sp., Cryptococcus neoformans or tuberculosis. CASE PRESENTATION: We"
		"describe a 59-year-old female who developed fever, clinical wasting and a"
		mediastinal mass 31 months after receiving a living non-related kidney transplant
		while on belatacept therapy. A mediastinal node biopsy disclosed the presence of
		Histoplasma capsulatum. Infection successfully resolved after appropriate
		"antifungal treatment. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first reported"
		case of Histoplasma capsulatum in a kidney transplanted patient on belatacept
		therapy.

PG	-	e17947
LID	-	10.7759/cureus.17947 [doi]
LID	-	e17947
AB	-	Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a life-threatening immune activation
		syndrome that should be recognized earlier for effective treatment. Adults
		usually have secondary HLH. An uncommon cause of secondary HLH is AIDS and
		simultaneous opportunistic infections. Acute human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
		"and opportunistic infections are also independent causes of HLH, so the presence"
		"of both should raise suspicion, especially if patients fulfill the criteria. HLH"
		secondary to severe babesiosis is a rare entity as well. Some patients might not
		"meet the full criteria of HLH on presentation, especially when some specific lab"
		test results are still pending. A delay in diagnosis can happen in those cases.
		"Here, we present two cases. The first case is of a 35-year-old homosexual male"
		who presented with constitutional symptoms of one-week duration. He was diagnosed
		and started on the treatment of HIV. His fever was not resolving and further
		investigations led to a diagnosis of disseminated histoplasma infection. The
		patient fulfilled the criteria of HLH as well. Prompt therapy resulted in the
		improvement of clinical and laboratory parameters. The second case is of a
		72-year-old female presenting with fever. A diagnosis of severe babesiosis and
		secondary HLH was made. Treatment of babesia resulted in the improvement of
		clinical and biochemical parameters.

TI	-	Pulmonary hyalinizing granuloma.
PG	-	463-8
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To present clinical and pathologic features of pulmonary hyalnizing
		granuloma through analyzing three cases found in our institution and reviewing
		cases reported in the English language literature. METHODS AND RESULTS: Three
		cases of pulmonary hyalnizing granuloma identified at our institution during the
		"past ten years were reviewed. In the first case, the patient presented with"
		concurrent pulmonary hyalinizing granuloma and histoplasmosis. In the second
		"case, the patient presented with a 5.5 cm lung mass and a separate smaller lesion"
		radiologically resembling bronchogenic carcinoma. There was very prominent
		polyclonal lymphocytic proliferation at the periphery especially of the smaller
		lesion likely representing an early stage of the disease process. In the third
		"case, the patient presented with multiple subpleural plaque-like lesions in"
		addition to nodular lesions of the lung. All cases also demonstrated various
		degrees of lymphocytic infiltration within the lesions. The English literature
		has been reviewed through searching the PubMed. CONCLUSION: Since patients with
		pulmonary hyalinizing granuloma demonstrated a spectrum of clinical
		"presentations, radiologic changes and histologic features with a variety of"
		"associated clinical disorders, pulmonary hyalnizing granuloma is more in keeping"
		with a clinicopathologic entity rather than a specific pathologic disease.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Current available treatments (benznidazole and nifurtimox) for Chagas
		disease (CD) show limited efficacy in chronic phase and frequent undesirable
		effects. Ergosterol synthesis inhibitors (ESI) had been considered as promising
		drugs for CD treatment and despite its recent poor results in several clinical
		"trials, different strategies have been proposed to optimize its role in this"
		infection. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of chronic Chagas disease in
		patient diagnosed with HIV who received treatment for histoplasmosis with
		itraconazol during twelve months. Even though T. cruzi rt-PCR was persistently
		"negative during treatment, when itraconazol was stopped she presented with a"
		positive blood rt-PCR. CONCLUSION: Several studies using different ESI had been
		published for CD treatment. Either in vitro or in vivo assays demonstrated
		activity against T. cruzi of the different triazole derivatives so different
		clinical trials had been carried out to evaluate its efficacy and safety. Despite
		"contradictory evidence in the animal model, longer treatments along with other"
		treatment strategies previously proposed suggests that ESI failure rates in
		positive peripheral blood rt-PCR are higher than that obtained with the current
		treatments of choice.

AB	-	"Disseminated histoplasmosis (DH) often mimics other diseases, leading to"
		misdiagnosis and delays in treatment. We present a patient who developed DH after
		treatment with immunosuppressants for an initial diagnosis of inflammatory bowel
		"disease (IBD). Upon diagnosing her with DH, liposomal amphotericin B was started,"
		and she eventually recovered after a prolonged hospitalization. Intrabdominal
		histoplasmosis has many similarities with IBD. Treatment with immunosuppressants
		in undiagnosed histoplasmosis can lead to dissemination with potentially
		catastrophic results.

PG	-	483-487

AB	-	Histoplasma capsulatum is a dimorphic fungus that causes histoplasmosis. Chronic
		"cavitary pulmonary histoplasmosis is rare, and typically manifests as apical"
		cavitary lesions in patients with pre-existing chronic obstructive pulmonary
		disease. We report a case involving a 60-year-old female who presented to our
		facility with acute onset of dyspnea and dry cough. Chest x-ray revealed a large
		left-sided pneumothorax with nearly complete collapse of the left lung. A chest
		computed tomography scan revealed a left upper lobe cavitary lesion with a
		"bronchopleural fistula. After thoracic surgical bleb resection, a surgical"
		specimen sent for biopsy was positive for Histoplasma capsulatum. The patient's
		pneumothorax was subsequently diagnosed as chronic cavitary pulmonary
		"histoplasmosis, and itraconazole treatment was initiated. After admission, the"
		patient underwent a thoracotomy with decortication to improve lung expansion;
		"however, the patient's pneumothorax persisted. After a prolonged hospital stay"
		"and serial chest x-rays that showed stable residual pneumothorax, the patient was"
		discharged to a long-term acute care facility and itraconazole treatment was
		"continued. Two months after discharge, a repeat chest x-ray showed resolution of"
		her left-sided pneumothorax. This case report highlights the importance of
		considering pulmonary histoplasmosis (or other endemic pulmonary fungal
		infections) when a patient presents with apical cavitary lesions.

LID	-	e2018028
AB	-	"In the advanced stage of AIDS, the diagnosis of the opportunistic infections may"
		be challenging due to the high risk of performing invasive diagnostic methods in
		"a patient with a critical clinical condition, as well as the correct"
		interpretation of the results of microbiological exams. One of the challenges for
		the diagnosis and treatment of the opportunistic infections is that they may
		"occur concomitantly in the same patient and they may mimic each other, leading to"
		a high discrepancy between clinical and autopsy diagnoses. We describe the case
		"of a 52-year-old man who was hospitalized because of weight loss, anemia, cough,"
		"and hepatosplenomegaly. During the investigation, the diagnosis of AIDS was made,"
		and the patient developed respiratory failure and died on the fourth day of
		"hospitalization. At autopsy, disseminated non-tuberculosis mycobacteriosis was"
		"found, affecting mainly the organs of the reticuloendothelial system. Also,"
		"severe and diffuse pneumonia caused by multiple agents (Pneumocystis jirovecii ,"
		"Histoplasma capsulatum, suppurative bacterial infection, non-tuberculosis"
		"mycobacteria, and cytomegalovirus) was seen in a morphological pattern that could"
		"be called ""collision pneumonia."" The lesson from this case, revealed by the"
		"autopsy, is that in advanced AIDS, patients often have multiple opportunistic"
		"infections, so the principle of Ockham's razor-that a single diagnosis is most"
		likely the best diagnosis-fails in this clinical context.

AB	-	A 78-year-old white male with chronic pancytopenia presented with acute transient
		aphasia and dysarthria. He had a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale
		(NIHSS) of zero. Physical examination revealed slight aphasia with mild
		dysarthria. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed nine ring-enhancing
		lesions in the left precentral gyrus with significant vasogenic edema. Lung
		computed tomography (CT) showed no evidence of pulmonary nodules. The serology of
		"blood and urine for infectious organisms was negative. Four weeks later, the"
		patient was re-admitted with worsening dysarthria and right upper extremity
		weakness. Repeat head MRI showed a slight increase in the size of the multiple
		supratentorial ring-enhancing lesions. The magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)
		findings of the evaluated lesion suggested a fungal etiology. Empiric
		"amphotericin B treatment was initiated, which mitigated central nervous system"
		(CNS) ring-enhancing lesions and resolved the patient's neurological deficits.
		Early empiric medical treatment of CNS histoplasmosis should be considered in the
		setting of multiple CNS ring-enhancing lesions and a positive history of
		"histoplasmosis infection, despite negative serological studies."

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Coccidioidomycosis is one of the most important endemic mycoses in
		"Northern Mexico. However, diagnosing this disease can be challenging,"
		particularly in patients who do not reside in endemic areas. CASE REPORT: The
		"case of a Mexican HIV+ patient who developed fever, general malaise, a severe"
		"cough, and dyspnea during a stay in Acapulco, Guerrero, Mexico, is presented."
		"Since various diseases are endemic to the state of Guerrero, the doctors"
		"originally suspected that the patient had contracted influenza A (H1N1), Q fever,"
		or tuberculosis. All the diagnostic tests for those diseases were negative. The
		"patient had received numerous mosquito bites while staying in Acapulco, and a"
		"nodule had appeared on his right cheek. Therefore, malaria, cryptococcosis, and"
		"histoplasmosis were also suspected, but those infections were also ruled out"
		through diagnostic tests. A direct microscopic examination was performed using
		KOH on a sample taken from the cheek nodule. The observation of spherules
		"suggested the presence of a species of Coccidioides. The fungus was isolated, and"
		its identity was confirmed by phenotypic and molecular methods. The geographic
		area in which the infection was likely acquired was identified by random
		amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. The results suggested a probable
		endogenous reactivation. CONCLUSIONS: This clinical case illustrates the
		difficulties associated with diagnosing coccidioidomycosis in non-endemic areas.

AB	-	Histoplasmosis-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is a rate but lethal
		disease in immunocompromised hosts. Unusual clinical presentations make
		diagnosing invasive fungal infection even more challenging. Here we present a
		case of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis secondary to progressive disseminated
		histoplasmosis presenting as cellulitis in a patient with systemic lupus
		erythematous. A high index of suspicion combined with histopathology and
		molecular diagnostic techniques are important to establish an accurate and timely
		diagnosis of opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients.

AB	-	CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 28-year old woman suffering loss of visual
		"acuity in her left eye, who presented an image suggestive of a subretinal"
		"neovascular membrane in her left eye, and bilateral retinal lesions compatible"
		with punctate inner choroidopathy (PIC). She was treated with intravitreal
		ranibizumab obtaining excellent results. DISCUSSION: The differential diagnosis
		"must be made between PIC and the rest of ""white dot syndromes"" and the presumed"
		ocular histoplasmosis syndrome (POHS). Antiangiogenic drugs may be a good
		alternative for the treatment of such diseases when they develop a subretinal
		neovascular membrane.

TI	-	Simultaneous erythema nodosum and erythema multiforme after local lidocaine
		injection.
PG	-	127-30
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To report a case of simultaneous erythema nodosum and erythema
		multiforme after local lidocaine injection. CASE SUMMARY: A 33-year-old female
		experienced coexisting erythema nodosum and erythema multiforme after lidocaine
		spray was used for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The reaction was exacerbated
		after localized injection of 2% lidocaine for a skin biopsy. An objective
		causality assessment revealed that an adverse drug reaction was highly probable.
		DISCUSSION: Lidocaine is the most frequently used local anesthetic agent. The
		coexistence of erythema nodosum and erythema multiforme has been reported in
		"lepromatous leprosy, Yersinia enterocolítica and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis"
		"gastrointestinal infection (both with diarrhea), histoplasmosis, hepatitis C, and"
		"milkeŕs nodule, but not with lidocaine. CONCLUSIONS: If clinicians observe"
		"similar lesions after lidocaine exposure, they should suspect an adverse drug"
		reaction and exercise caution in the administration of amide anesthetics to
		patients with a documented history of adverse reaction to lidocaine.

LID	-	10.2147/OPTH.S300662 [doi]
AB	-	Submacular hemorrhage (SMH) has been reported to be toxic to the retina based on
		"animal studies. However, observational studies of patients with"
		neovascular-related SMH and those treated with intravitreal anti-vascular growth
		factor (anti-VEGF) therapy have shown many favorable visual acuity outcomes. We
		report two cases of neovascular-related SMH with ten or more years of follow-up.
		The first case was an 83-year old female with a history of nonexudative
		age-related macular degeneration in both eyes presenting with sudden decrease in
		"vision (20/400) in her right eye due to a large SMH, treated with anti-VEGF"
		"therapy. Over the next following months, there was resolution of the hemorrhage"
		"and return of good visual acuity. At 10-year follow-up, visual acuity was 20/30"
		in the right eye. The second case was a 49-year old female with a history of
		"presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome (POHS), presenting with sudden vision"
		"loss (20/400) in her right eye due to large, thick SMH. With observation and"
		"intermittent anti-VEGF therapy, there was resolution of the hemorrhage. At"
		"30-year follow-up, visual acuity was 20/20 in the right eye."

		Mediastinitis.
PG	-	e10439

LID	-	e10439
AB	-	Fibrosing mediastinitis (FM) is a rare condition with extensive proliferation of
		fibrous tissue in the mediastinum usually happens few years after Histoplasma
		infection. FM usually occurs years later after presentation of Histoplasma
		"infection, and usually what makes patients seek medical attention are symptoms"
		"from compression and occlusion of vital mediastinal structures, such as the"
		"central airways, superior vena cava, pulmonary arteries, and veins. Rarely,"
		"heart, pericardium, coronaries, and aorta are involved. We report a case of"
		39-year-old-male who was admitted with fever and cough. The patient's condition
		"worsened despite being on broad-spectrum antibiotics, with worsening"
		encephalopathy and a new onset lower extremity weakness. Brain imaging showed
		multiple strokes suggestive of embolic event. CT chest/abdomen was suggestive of
		FM along with cavitary lung nodules and pneumomediastinum. Splenic and renal
		infarcts were also noted. Infective endocarditis was one of the top differential
		"diagnosis due to multiple embolic infarcts, and hence a transesophageal"
		echocardiography (TEE) was pursued. TEE showed a mass along with air bubbles
		entering the left atrium from the pulmonary vein. On re-evaluation of CT chest
		"images, a fistula was seen extending from the mediastinum to the left main"
		bronchus and the left upper pulmonary vein. This supported the diagnosis of FM
		with erosion of lymph node into the left main bronchus and left upper pulmonary
		"artery, leading to fistula formation and subsequent systemic air"
		"embolization. The diagnosis of FM requires a multimodality approach, high"
		"clinical suspicion, and accurate history taking. Treatment mainly aims at"
		managing the mechanical complications.

PG	-	e6800

LID	-	e6800
AB	-	Medical laboratory tests are becoming more reliable with increased specificity
		"and sensitivity, leading to their use as definitive diagnostic tests for many"
		medical conditions. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests are
		"convenient, sensitive, and standardly used for rapid detection and quantification"
		"of antigens or patient antibodies against specific antigens. However, based upon"
		"the specificity and sensitivity of an ELISA test, the results may not be"
		"definitive for a specific disease but merely suggestive, due to potential"
		"cross-reactivity of antigens and antibodies. Here, we present a case of a"
		"15-year-old male who presented with fever, nausea, and right upper quadrant"
		pain. Computed tomography scan showed an 18-cm liver mass with cystic features.
		Biopsy results confirmed a diagnosis of undifferentiated embryonal sarcoma of the
		"liver; however, the clinical picture was complicated by positive ELISA results"
		"for Echinococcus, Entamoeba histolytica, and histoplasmosis. Due to the absence"
		"of travel and positive ELISA result for three different infectious agents, we"
		hypothesize that tumor molecular mimicry might have led to false-positive ELISA
		"results in the absence of infection in this case, demonstrating a limitation of"
		ELISA serology. Critical appraisal of all possible evidence to ensure alignment
		when assigning the final diagnosis is essential for optimal patient outcomes.

TI	-	Fungal esophagitis associated with tuberculous pericarditis in an human
		immunodeficiency virus-positive patient: a case report.
PG	-	429

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Opportunistic infections are frequent in people living with the human
		immunodeficiency virus who either do not have access to antiretroviral therapy
		(ART) or use it irregularly. Tuberculosis is the most frequent infectious disease
		in PLHIV and can predispose patients to severe fungal infections with dire
		consequences. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the case of a 35-year-old Brazilian
		man living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 10 years. He reported no
		adherence to ART and a history of histoplasmosis with hospitalization for 1 month
		"in a public hospital in Natal, Brazil. The diagnosis was disseminated"
		Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. He was transferred to the health service in
		"Recife, Brazil, with a worsening condition characterized by daily fevers,"
		"dyspnea, pain in the upper and lower limbs, cough, dysphagia, and painful oral"
		lesions suggestive of candidiasis. Lymphocytopenia and high viral loads were
		"found. After screening for infections, the patient was diagnosed with tuberculous"
		pericarditis and esophageal candidiasis caused by Candida tropicalis. The
		isolated yeasts were identified using the VITEK 2 automated system and
		matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight-mass spectrometry.
		"Antifungal microdilution broth tests showed sensitivity to fluconazole,"
		"voriconazole, anidulafungin, caspofungin, micafungin, and amphotericin B, with"
		resistance to fluconazole and voriconazole. The patient was treated with COXCIP-4
		"and amphotericin deoxycholate. At 12 days after admission, the patient developed"
		sepsis of a pulmonary focus with worsening of his respiratory status. Combined
		"therapy with meropenem, vancomycin, and itraconazole was started, with fever"
		"recurrence, and he changed to ART and tuberculostatic therapy. The patient"
		remained clinically stable and was discharged with clinical improvement after
		30 days of hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Fungal infections should be considered in
		patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome as they contribute to worsening
		health status. When mycoses are diagnosed early and treated with the appropriate
		"drugs, favorable therapeutic outcomes can be achieved."

		"of dyspnea, and blood tests showed pancytopenia. The diagnosis of disseminated"
		histoplasmosis was made rapidly by peripheral blood smear. We encourage
		clinicians to check peripheral blood smear if disseminated histoplasmosis is

PG	-	4270852

LID	-	4270852
AB	-	Hypercalcemia is an uncommon finding in children. Hypercalcemia has various
		etiologies including parathyroid dependent and independent mechanisms. Increased
		activity of the 1-alpha-hydroxylase enzyme in granulomatous diseases is a
		"well-defined but an extremely rare cause of hypercalcemia in pediatric patients,"
		particularly in infants. We describe the case of an infant who presented with
		"failure to thrive, hepatosplenomegaly, and hypercalcemia who was initially"
		treated with steroids but was later diagnosed with disseminated histoplasmosis in
		the absence of an underlying immunodeficiency. Extra caution should be used
		"before considering steroids for the treatment of hypercalcemia and, whenever"
		"possible, steroids should not be initiated until a definite etiology is"
		identified.

		report.
PG	-	1661-3
AB	-	Pulmonary broncholithiasis can cause a management dilemma depending on its
		location and the possible involvement of vascular structures. Many patients
		undergo rigid bronchoscopy or surgical interventions for the removal of
		"broncholiths. In this case report, we describe a 38-year-old white man with a"
		"history of performing warehouse demolitions who presented with chronic cough,"
		"dyspnea on exertion, and recurrent pneumonia. Imaging studies revealed hilar and"
		"mediastinal calcifications, as well as a calcification in the right middle lobe"
		bronchus. Flexible bronchoscopy revealed a mobile obstructing calcified mass in
		the right middle lobe bronchus. Attempts at removing the mass with forceps were
		"unsuccessful. Instead, the mass was removed using cryotherapy with minimal"
		bleeding and complete resolution of the obstruction. Pathologic examination
		"confirmed that the mass was a broncholith, and stains revealed the presence of"
		histoplasma fungal forms. Partially attached broncholiths can be removed safely
		using flexible bronchoscopy with the aid of cryotherapy.

TI	-	A case of idiopathic sclerosing mediastinitis in a 7-year-old Japanese boy.
PG	-	302-5
AB	-	Sclerosing mediastinitis is a very rare benign disorder characterised by the
		development of dense fibrous tissue within the mediastinum. Affected patients are
		typically young adults with infant cases being uncommon especially in areas
		without endemic histoplasmosis. We report a Japanese boy with markedly elevated
		serum inflammatory markers for more than 1 year in the absence of any clinical
		manifestations. 67Ga-scintigraphy demonstrated an accumulation in the mediastinal
		region and an open biopsy revealed a hard fibrous mass in the anteriosuperior
		"mediastinum. Thus, a diagnosis of idiopathic sclerosing mediastinitis was made."
		"CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this case is the youngest patient"
		reported with this disorder. In patients with mediastinal mass lesions the
		"diagnosis of sclerosing mediastinitis should be considered as well as infectious,"
		autoimmune or neoplastic disease even in children.

TI	-	Misleading manifestations of Coccidioides immitis in vivo.
PG	-	3721-3
AB	-	We describe a case of coccidioidomycosis in which several unusual morphologic
		forms of Coccidioides immitis occurred in biopsy tissue from the right lower lung
		"of a patient. To our knowledge, this is the first case where so many diverse"
		morphologic forms were manifested in a single patient in the absence of typical
		endosporulating spherules. Immature spherules demonstrating segmentation mimicked
		morula forms of Prototheca spp. Certain elements resembled budding cells of
		Blastomyces dermatitidis. These consisted of juxtaposed immature spherules
		"without endospores, a germinating endospore, or thick-walled hyphal cells."
		"Branched, septate hyphae and moniliform hyphae consisting of chains of"
		thick-walled arthroconidia or immature spherules were also present. Complement
		fixation and immunodiffusion tests performed on the patient's serum were negative
		"for C. immitis, B. dermatitidis, and Histoplasma capsulatum antibodies."
		Fluorescent-antibody studies were carried out with a specific C. immitis
		conjugate. All of the diverse fungal tissue elements stained positive with a
		moderate to strong (2 to 3+) intensity.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: In endemic regions, histoplasmosis is often seen in hosts with"
		defective cell mediated immunity. We report a case of disseminated histoplasmosis
		"in a patient with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), a disorder mainly"
		characterized by B cell defects. CASE: A 35 year old male with CVID developed
		"fever, headache, dyspnea and pancytopenia within few weeks of swimming in the"
		Tennessee River. After a non-revealing initial evaluation he was transferred to a
		"tertiary facility for fever of unknown origin, where massive splenomegaly was"
		noted. Clinical course was complicated by hypoxia from extensive bilateral lung
		infiltrates requiring non-invasive ventilation. Urine and serum Histoplasma
		antigens were positive. He was treated with liposomal amphotericin B followed by
		itraconazole after clinical improvement within 48 h and discharged home by day 6.
		Fungal blood cultures sent on day 1 grew Histoplasma capsulatum on day 19. After
		5 months splenomegaly completely resolved and he successfully completed one year
		of treatment with itraconazole. CONCLUSIONS: Our case highlights the significance
		of T cell defects in CVID. More research focusing on T cell defects in CVID is
		required to understand the extent of vulnerability to such intracellular
		pathogens in CVID.

TI	-	Itraconazole therapy in a pancreatic adenocarcinoma patient: A case report.
PG	-	528-32
LID	-	10.1177/1078155215572931 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To report the case of a patient receiving itraconazole for the
		treatment of histoplasmosis and his subsequent reduction in pancreatic tumor
		size. CASE SUMMARY: A 64-year-old male was diagnosed with Stage III locally
		advanced unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The patient was administered
		"radiation plus chemotherapy, which included cisplatin and capecitabine. Upon"
		"restaging, the patient's tumor was again determined to be unresectable;"
		"therefore, palliative chemotherapy treatments were initiated, which included"
		"gemcitabine and erlotinib. After two gemcitabine cycles, he was admitted to the"
		hospital because of loss of motor function due to spinal cord hemisection. After
		"the surgery, the patient became neutropenic because of previous chemotherapy"
		cycle and developed disseminated histoplasmosis. After he received his nine-month
		"course of itraconazole, the pancreatic cancer was readdressed and he was then"
		"deemed to be resectable and had a Whipple procedure. Over the next several years,"
		he showed no evidence of pancreatic metastases or relapse. DISCUSSION:
		Itraconazole has been shown to have many mechanisms by which it could potentially
		"suppress tumor cell growth, which includes inhibition of the Hedgehog pathway,"
		"vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2, and P-glycoprotein efflux pump."
		This azole antifungal has been studied in small patient populations with various
		"types of cancers. Studies of basal cell carcinoma, nonsmall cell lung cancer,"
		"ovarian cancer, and malignant pleural mesothelioma have shown favorable results"
		suggesting that more study of itraconazole is warranted to decide its clinical
		utility. CONCLUSION: There would need to be much more research performed to
		"determine if this agent had a role as a chemotherapy agent; however, health care"
		professionals should be aware of itraconazole's potential antineoplastic
		mechanisms.

AB	-	Tracheoesophageal fistulas (TEF) are pathologic communications between the
		esophagus and the trachea or bronchi. The development of a TEF can result from
		malignant or benign etiologies. A common approach for the treatment of TEFs is
		the placement of endobronchial and esophageal stents to facilitate healing of the
		communication. This case report describes the successful treatment of a TEF
		resulting from calcified mediastinal lymphadenopathy due to a previous
		Histoplasmosis capsulatum infection. In addition to placement of endobronchial
		"and esophageal stents, the non-healing TEF was treated with ACell (Gentrix(®))"
		decellularized porcine urinary bladder matrix to facilitate complete closure of
		the fistulous tract.

AB	-	Histoplasmosis is common in many parts of the world but with areas of
		hyperendemicity. Disseminated histoplasmosis is the deadliest form of
		histoplasmosis and is most common among immunocompromised patients. Timely
		diagnosis is crucial to improve outcomes. We describe a patient on azathioprine
		and rituximab with disseminated histoplasmosis in which diagnosis was delayed in
		"part because of negative early Histoplasma antigen testing, which was positive"
		"later in the course. This case serves as an example of the concept of ""threshold"
		"of detection"" in which a certain concentration of a microbe must be present for"
		it to be detected by a diagnostic test that focuses on detection of a microbe or
		its components. This concept applies to many tests used to diagnose infectious
		diseases.

AB	-	Histoplasmosis is an AIDS-defining opportunistic infection. Disseminated
		histoplasmosis (DH) can be fatal without early diagnosis and treatment
		initiation. We present one confirmed and three probable cases of DH in advanced
		"HIV/AIDS disease patients diagnosed using OIDx Histoplasma LFA in Yaoundé,"
		"Cameroon. Four women with HIV but unknown CD4 count presented with asthenia,"
		"weight loss, productive cough, and fever (39°C) as common symptoms for at least"
		"3 weeks. Two of the patients had skin lesions. These included facial papules,"
		"macules, and umbilicated vesicles scattered over the trunk and limbs. These were"
		"diffuse lesions which were purulent, itching, and papillomatous lesions with a"
		"necrotic centre, and one patient had a right forearm ulcer. We performed the"
		"Histoplasma antigen tests using the OIDx Histo LFA, and they were strongly"
		positive in all four patients. Histopathology in skin biopsy allowed
		identification of the species as Histoplasma capsulatum var capsulatum in one
		"patient. In this same patient, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis were"
		cultured from the forearm ulcer. This patient later commenced antibiotics
		(Levofloxacin 500 mg) and oral itraconazole (800 mg/day) with immediate
		"improvement. Unfortunately, the other three patients could not access"
		"itraconazole, were discharged and lost to follow-up. Early diagnosis and"
		treatment are essential for the management of DH. LFA is a test that can be set
		up in any setting with limited resource. Access to this can be a major advance in
		the diagnosis of histoplasmosis in resource-limited settings.

AB	-	A 26-year-old woman had an enlarging dense macular lesion in the right eye. The
		funduscopic and angiographic findings were distinctly different from those in
		macular histoplasmosis. She was found to have a coccidioidomycotic granuloma in
		the left lung and was treated with amphotericin B. Within a month the macular
		lesion was cicatricial. This appears to be the first reported case of presumed
		ocular coccidioidomycosis in Canada.

AB	-	We report a rare case of Mycobacterium haemophilum presenting as an
		intraventricular granulomatous mass with loculated hydrocephalus and seizures in
		"a patient with human immunodeficiency virus. M. haemophilum, a slow-growing"
		"mycobacteria, causes localized and disseminated disease among immunocompromised"
		hosts. Central nervous system infection with M. haemophilum is extremely rare.
		"Preoperative laboratory testing of our patient for tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis,"
		sarcoidosis and histoplasmosis were negative. Surgical resection of the mass
		revealed a caseating granuloma that stained positive for acid-fast bacillus
		"suggesting possible tuberculoma. Despite negative testing for tuberculosis, a"
		polymerase chain reaction analysis was ultimately performed from the resected
		"mass which revealed M. haemophilum. To our knowledge, this is the first case of"
		M. haemophilum presenting as an intraventricular mass. We review the clinical
		manifestations of this pathogen and discuss the medical and surgical management.

		"acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients. The 1st case, a 38-year old"
		"black male homosexual, presented in 1982 with diarrhea, malabsorption, and weight"
		"loss. In the following 1 1/2 years, he experienced recurrent Candida esophagitis,"
		"cutaneous and pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, and"
		"cytomegalovirus. Autopsy in 1984 revealed residual Kaposi's sarcoma, disseminated"
		"cytomegalovirus, and M avium-intracellulare. The 2nd case, a 31-year old white"
		"male homosexual, presented in 1984 with Pneumocystis carinii penumonia and"
		"subsequently developed persistent fever, hepatomegaly, headaches, blurred vision,"
		"progressive liver function deterioration, and disseminated histoplasmosis"
		infection. Autopsy in 1984 revealed an overwhelming disseminated histoplasmosis
		infection. Tissues taken at postmortem were examined by electron microscopy.
		Particles that conformed with the morphologic characteristics of AIDS retrovirus
		"(a size of about 140 nm, a round shape with a double membrane, and an elongated"
		core) were detected in the prostate gland of patient 2 and in the salivary glands
		and testes of both patients. This finding suggests that saliva and semen may be
		body fluids by which transmission of the AIDS virus occurs.

AB	-	The histological and ultrastructural features of a case of malakoplakia affecting
		the testis and the epididymis of a 53-year-old man are described. Light
		"microscopy shows a granulomatous inflammatory process, characterized by the"
		accumulation of large mononuclear cells with abundant granular cytoplasm and
		PAS-positive calcific intracytoplasmic inclusions (so-called Michaelis-Gutman
		"bodies). On E.M., such inclusions appear as concentric lamellated structures with"
		"a mineralized core. Although the pathogenesis of malakoplakia is still unclear,"
		"an abnormality of the bacteria-digesting function of tissue macrophages, leading"
		"to persistence of phagolysosomes, has been postulated. Malakoplakia of testis is"
		"a benign entity, which must be differentiated from neoplastic lesions, especially"
		"germ cell tumours, and granulomatous disease such as histoplasmosis,"
		mycobacteriosis and idiopathic granulomatous orchitis.

TI	-	In situ hybridization in cutaneous deep fungal infections: a valuable diagnostic
		adjunct to fungal morphology and tissue cultures.
PG	-	426-32
AB	-	"Dimorphic fungal infections (histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis,"
		and cryptococcosis) can occur in immunocompromised and healthy individuals.
		Cutaneous involvement is often secondary and may be the presenting sign of
		"systemic disease. These ominous infections are frequently clinically indistinct,"
		and patient prognosis is influenced by a timely diagnosis and treatment.
		"Morphologic differentiation between these organisms is not definitive, and tissue"
		"cultures represent the diagnostic gold standard in current day practice. However,"
		tissue cultures are rarely obtained and merely represent an afterthought in
		"seemingly unsuspecting cases. Furthermore, when performed, they may take several"
		days or weeks for completion. In situ hybridization (ISH) utilizing
		oligonucleotide probes directed against fungal ribosomal RNA is a rapid and
		accurate assay for the identification of dimorphic fungi in paraffin-embedded
		tissue sections. We present five patients in whom ISH both prospectively and
		"retrospectively confirmed the presence of a cutaneous infection (histoplasmosis,"
		"blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, and cryptococcosis). In all of the skin"
		"sections analyzed, dimorphic fungi were morphologically apparent but not"
		"diagnostically discernible. In summary, ISH is a valuable tool in the prompt"
		diagnosis of cutaneous deep fungal infections.

TI	-	Pulmonary Histoplasmosis in a Japanese Man Infected During Travel to Mexico and
		Management of His Wife's Condition: A Case Report.
PG	-	83-7
AB	-	We report herein on the case of a 33-year-old Japanese man in whom an abnormal
		shadow was detected on chest radiography during a medical checkup after a
		1-year-stay in Mexico. Chest computed tomography showed a nodule in the left
		lower lobe adjacent to the visceral pleura. Histopathologic examination of a
		thoracoscopic partial pulmonary resection specimen showed coagulation necrosis
		"with a number of yeast-like forms on Grocott staining. In addition, serum"
		anti-Histoplasma antibody positivity was detected with an enzyme-linked
		"immunosorbent assay, and Histoplasma-specific nested real-time polymerase chain"
		"reaction results were positive in the pulmonary region. Finally, pulmonary"
		"histoplasmosis was diagnosed, and treatment with itraconazole was initiated. The"
		patient's wife who had accompanied him to Mexico was asymptomatic and was not
		found to have histoplasmosis based on diagnostic imaging and serological
		"findings. Although rare in Japan, histoplasmosis should be considered in the"
		differential diagnosis of pulmonary lesions in patients who have returned from
		travel to endemic areas.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is associated with age-related
		"macular degeneration (AMD), degenerative myopia, angioid streaks, presumed ocular"
		"histoplasmosis syndrome, and numerous other ocular and systemic conditions."
		"Idiopathic CNV is also a common form of the condition. However, CNV has rarely"
		been noted after laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) and a
		cause-and-effect relationship has not been found. A case of CNV after uneventful
		"LASIK is reported here, along with a literature review of previously reported"
		cases and suggested pathophysiology. A link between LASIK and CNV is sought.
		"METHODS: A case report of CNV in a young, healthy eye after uneventful LASIK is"
		presented. Review of the pertinent literature reporting a relationship between
		"LASIK and CNV was conducted through 2007, and few studies are reported after"
		"2005. CONCLUSION: To date, there is anecdotal evidence of CNV after LASIK. The"
		"incidence from prior reports ranges from 0.003% to 0.33%. However, a causal link"
		cannot be disregarded and merits further study. Each patient undergoing LASIK
		"warrants a thorough preoperative dilated fundus examination, including a thorough"
		"examination of the macula. This occurrence, albeit rare, should be considered for"
		inclusion in the refractive surgery consent form.

AB	-	Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a disorder that occurs due to
		unsuitable monocyte activation in a variety of infections. In human
		"immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections, patients with advanced immunossupression"
		associated with opportunistic infections are at increased risk of developing HLH.
		We describe a clinical case of a 33-year-old male student diagnosed with HIV who
		"was hospitalized for investigation of asthenia and dyspnea, accompanied by"
		"adynamia, decreased motor force in the left leg, dysphagia, and dysfluency. His"
		"general condition was regular, he was pale, feverish, and had normal cardiac and"
		pulmonary auscultation. Physical examination revealed ulcerated lesions in the
		perianal region and hepatosplenomegaly without palpable lymph node enlargement.
		"Laboratory parameters showed pancytopenia, a slight increase in liver function"
		"accompanied by high lactate dehydrogenase, and hiperferritinemia. The initial"
		"diagnosis was disseminated histoplasmosis, thus amphotericin B deoxycholate was"
		empirically prescribed while waiting on myeloculture and blood cultures for fungi
		"and mycobacteria. Other clinical procedures were blood transfusion, resumption of"
		antiretroviral therapy (ART) and secondary prophylaxis. Myeloculture blood
		cultures of fungi and mycobacteria were negative. Patient evolved well in
		relation to the initial complaints and showed partial clinical and laboratory
		"improvement. However, 23 days after hospitalization, he developed a febrile"
		episode accompanied by chills and a convulsive crisis. The patient was
		transferred to the intensive unit care and developed septic shock and respiratory
		failure. He died 25 days after the onset of the condition. After the postmortem
		"examination, histopathology revealed countless rounded fungal structures"
		"compatible with Histoplasma sp., which were observed in the peripancreatic lymph"
		"node, liver, and spleen, in addition to hemophagocytosis in the splenic"
		"parenchyma. We thus conclude that when the patient met criteria for HLH, such as"
		"fever, hepatosplenomegaly, hiperferritinemia, and pancytopenia, the evolution was"
		"fast due to the aggressive and rapidly fatal nature of HLH, despite anti-fungal"
		"and corticoid treatment. Therefore, this case report reinforces the need to"
		consider hemophagocytic syndrome in patients with HIV and disseminated
		"histoplasmosis, especially where histoplasmosis is highly endemic, in order for"
		the treatment be started early when there is high clinical suspicion.

PG	-	29-31
LID	-	10.1016/j.aace.2020.11.005 [doi]
AB	-	"OBJECTIVE: Adrenal insufficiency (AI), if not diagnosed in a timely manner, can"
		lead to fatal outcomes. Here we describe an unusual case of AI secondary to
		disseminated histoplasmosis (DH) and the importance of being aware of the
		association of infections and AI. METHODS: A 56-year-old Hispanic man with
		untreated HIV infection presented for the evaluation of left upper jaw swelling
		and pain. A brain magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed a 4-cm soft-tissue
		mass in the left maxilla. Biopsy of the mass was consistent with histoplasmosis.
		"He was also noted to have hyponatremia and hyperkalemia, which raised the"
		suspicion of AI. Laboratory investigation showed a baseline cortisol level of 7
		"μg/dL (normal, 7-23 μg/dL) and adrenocorticotropic hormone level of 86 pg/mL"
		"(normal, 7-69 pg/mL). His 60-minute cortisol level after a 250-μg cosyntropin"
		"stimulation test was 9 μg/dL (normal, 7-23 μg/dL). Computed tomography of the"
		chest incidentally noted bilateral adrenal enlargement. An adrenal biopsy was not
		pursued due to the high index of clinical suspicion of DH as the etiology of AI.
		RESULTS: He was diagnosed with adrenal histoplasmosis because of the evidence of
		AI and bilateral adrenal enlargement in the setting of DH. He was started on
		glucocorticoid replacement for primary AI and continues to be on glucocorticoids
		even after 5 years of diagnosis. DH frequently involves the adrenal gland (80%)
		and can present as adrenal enlargement but does not always cause primary AI.
		CONCLUSION: Our case demonstrates the importance of being vigilant about
		infections like histoplasmosis as a potential cause of AI. Delay in treatment in
		such cases could result in life-threatening consequences.

PG	-	e23700
LID	-	10.7759/cureus.23700 [doi]
LID	-	e23700
AB	-	Fibrosing mediastinitis (FM) is an uncommon diagnosis that involves the
		"proliferation of extensive, dense fibrous tissue in the mediastinum. FM accounts"
		for less than 1% of people with prior infection by Histoplasma capsulatum that
		develop hypersensitivity immune responses to antigens released during the initial
		"exposure. Other causes include tuberculosis, blastomycosis, sarcoidosis,"
		"radiation, and idiopathic.  We describe FM presenting with superior vena cava"
		(SVC) syndrome. A 66-year-old Caucasian male presented with a one-week history of
		"progressively worsening facial swelling associated with dysphonia, bilateral"
		"ptosis, dyspnea on exertion, and unintentional weight loss of 30 pounds within"
		the past three months. He had a 40-pack-year smoking history and a past medical
		"history of essential hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and bilateral"
		internal carotid artery stenosis. The CT chest demonstrated non-specific soft
		"tissue extending throughout the mediastinum and towards the right hilar region,"
		complicated by severe attenuation of the superior vena cava and a 2.4 cm × 1.6 cm
		necrotic lymph node. The mediastinum had hyperemic and desmoplastic changes
		heavily encased in venous collaterals. L4 lymph node pathological evaluation
		demonstrated sinus histiocytosis and reactive lymphoid hyperplasia without signs
		of malignancy or atypia. The patient was treated with corticosteroid and diuretic
		"therapy to achieve intermittent symptomatic relief, but continued to decline"
		"clinically, ultimately leading to his demise. The diagnosis of FM is best"
		obtained through CT chest with intravenous contrast to demonstrate abnormal
		mediastinal tissue and possible structural compromise. A biopsy of the
		mediastinal tissue may also help rule out malignancy. Only a few case reports
		have demonstrated mixed symptomatic and radiologic responses to anti-inflammatory
		and/or antifungal treatment. Even non-surgical and surgical interventions have
		"shown inconsistent efficacy, with frequent restenosis warranting re-exploration."

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Histoplasmosis is a systemic mycosis caused by the dimorphic fungus
		Histoplasma capsulatum. We report a case of disseminated cutaneous histoplasmosis
		with mucocutaneous involvement in an AIDS patient paradigmatic of the
		"multifaceted nature of the disease, which is an expression of the immune"
		reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). PATIENT PRESENTATION: A 39-year-old
		man presented with a three month history of asymptomatic papules and nodules with
		necrotic centres involving the centrofacial region. The patient was diagnosed as
		being HIV-positive a month earlier and was commenced on antiretroviral treatment.
		"Two weeks after the development of skin lesions, the patient complained of a sore"
		throat and hoarseness of his voice. A fibre-optic laryngoscopy and biopsies of
		"the skin, larynx and liver were performed. MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOME: The CD4 counts"
		"increased from 2 cells/µL to 124 cells/µL, whereas the viral load decreased from"
		one million to less than 20 copies/mL. A fibre-optic laryngoscopy revealed a
		"supraglottitis with ulceration on the epiglottis. Histology of the liver, larynx"
		and sections of the skin demonstrated pandermal necrotising granulomatous
		inflammation. Grocott-Gomori methenamine silver and Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)
		"stains revealed a relative paucity of intracellular, narrow-neck budding fungal"
		organisms. Culture findings confirmed the diagnosis of histoplasmosis. The
		patient was treated with intravenous amphotericin B for two weeks followed by
		"oral itraconazole 100 mg twice a day, with an excellent response to treatment."
		CONCLUSION: We present this case to remind clinicians that disseminated
		histoplasmosis in AIDS patients may occur as an expression of IRIS. A sudden
		onset of hoarseness with cutaneous lesions in a patient with disseminated disease
		should alert one to possible laryngeal histoplasmosis. Prompt recognition and
		treatment will avert the potential fatal complications of this disease.

AB	-	Histoplasmosis rarely causes significant illness in immunocompetent patients. In
		"endemic areas such as the Midwestern United States and Central America, most"
		"people are infected, but are rarely symptomatic, with variable presentation. The"
		"illness is usually self-limited in immunocompetent individuals. However, in"
		"immunocompromised patients, Histoplasma capsulatum can disseminate to various"
		organs and should be suspected especially in the endemic areas or if there is a
		significant travel history involving these areas. We present a case of a
		65-year-old male originally from Central America with no known past medical
		history presenting with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome complicated by
		disseminated intravascular coagulation due to acute histoplasmosis and
		incidentally found to have HIV/AIDS.

		few reports on the association of idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia (ICL) with

		progressive disseminated histoplasmosis. All immunocompromised conditions were
		"ruled out. In addition, her 2 consecutive CD4 counts were below 300. The patient"
		was diagnosed with PDH associated with ICL. The patient showed significant
		improvement with liposomal amphotericin B and itraconazole. Absolute CD4 counts
		should be done in all cases of progressive disseminated histoplasmosis even in
		HIV negative individuals to rule out associated ICL.

AB	-	African Histoplasmosis is deep mycosis caused by Histoplasma duboisii and
		genitourinary involvement is extremely rare. We report a case of African
		histoplasmosis in a 27-year-old subject with painful penis ulcer. Ulcer edge
		"biopsy had revealed inflammatory granulomas made of epithelioid cells,"
		"lymphoplasmocytes, polynuclear eosinophils and giant multinucleated cells, with"
		ovoid yeasts surrounded by a clear halo. PAS and Grocott stains revealed numerous
		fungal structures with a morphology measuring 7 to 15 nm. The diagnosis
		Histoplasma capsulatum var. duboisii was placed and the patient put on
		itraconazole (400 mg/day) for six months with a good course. African
		histoplasmosis of the subject penis is an extremely rare entity. The diagnosis of
		"certainty often makes use of histology and mycological examination, and makes it"
		"possible to eliminate differential diagnoses such as cryptoccocosis, tuberculosis"
		or cancer.

LID	-	10.5045/kjh.2012.47.1.77 [doi]
AB	-	A 38-year-old woman who presented with unexplained fever and pancytopenia was
		subjected to a bone marrow examination. Her bone marrow aspirate smear showed no
		obvious pathological finding except for the presence of hemophagocytosis and mild
		"plasmacytosis. In view of hemophagocytosis, a thorough examination of the smear"
		was conducted and revealed the presence of histoplasmosis. She was advised to
		"undergo evaluation of her immunological status, and she tested positive for human"
		immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. This case highlights that
		"hemophagocytosis in the marrow may be an early sign of underlying disease, and"
		that careful examination of bone marrow smears may reveal subtle infections. In
		"addition, histoplasmosis with hemophagocytosis may be associated with"
		"pancytopenia, and hence, the HIV status of the patient should always be"
		investigated.

PG	-	619-621

AB	-	Blastomyces dermatitidis is a thermally dimorphic fungus that can cause
		"pulmonary, extrapulmonary, or disseminated infections. Though it can infect both"
		"immune-competent and immunocompromised hosts, the disease can be severe in"
		"immunocompromised hosts. Exposure to silica dust is associated with silicosis,"
		and this is associated with impaired immunity and an increased risk of
		mycobacterial and fungal infections. The fungal infections commonly associated
		"with pneumoconiosis are pulmonary aspergillosis, histoplasmosis,"
		"coccidioidomycosis, and cryptococcosis. However, there is a dearth of data on the"
		association of pneumoconiosis and blastomycosis. Clinical deterioration and new
		cavitary lesions in patients with pneumoconiosis should alert clinicians of new
		pulmonary infection. Traditional sputum sampling may lead to poor diagnostic
		"yield, because the organism is frequently surrounded by a fibrotic wall."
		Aggressive diagnostic testing with lung or skin biopsies may be warranted. We
		present the first reported case of disseminated blastomycosis in a patient with
		coalworkers' pneumoconiosis.

		"sarcoidosis, is an uncommon entity and has diagnostic uncertainty. Treatment for"
		"neurosarcoidosis can increase the risk of infections, including fungal infections"
		such as disseminated histoplasmosis. Neurosarcoidosis may further predispose
		patients to infections of the central nervous system. CASE PRESENTATION: A
		54-year-old male with a history of probable neurosarcoidosis on methotrexate and
		"infliximab presented with encephalopathy, hypoxia, and reported fevers. The"
		patient was found to have disseminated histoplasmosis involving the lungs
		"(miliary histoplasmosis), central nervous system (neurohistoplasmosis), and"
		bloodstream. The Histoplasma capsulatum infection was treated with amphotericin
		and then voriconazole. DISCUSSION: Patients with neurosarcoidosis are suspected
		to have blood-brain barrier dysfunction. Lumbar puncture should be considered as
		part of initial investigative studies for infection. Empiric antimicrobial
		therapy for a patient with neurosarcoidosis on immunosuppressive agents may need
		to include antifungal agents.

AB	-	Histoplasmosis has heterogenous clinical presentation ranging from mild and
		self-limiting respiratory disease to disseminated forms with high mortality. In
		"progressive disseminated histoplasmosis (PDH), patient presents with fever,"
		"lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, adrenal enlargement, hemophagocytic"
		"lymphohistiocytosis and non-specific mucocutaneous lesions, usually in late stage"
		"of HIV. Cutaneous involvement is upto 25% in PDH which are papules, plaques,"
		"nodules and ulcers. Forty-two year old male, recently diagnosed as HIV positive"
		"presented with complaints of multiple painful ulcerated lesions over face, neck,"
		"tongue, arms, trunk & genitalia. Skin Biopsy was suggestive of histoplasmosis."
		Patient showed excellent response with amphotericin B and itraconazole. Since
		"histoplasmosis is relatively uncommon, there should be a high-index of suspicion"
		when an HIV patient presents with disseminated skin lesions.

AB	-	Idiopathic CD4 T-lymphocytopenia (ICL) is a rare entity that is associated with
		decreased immunity which predisposes affected individuals to opportunistic
		infections and malignancies. Autoimmune conditions are common in patients with
		ICL and they are considered part of its clinical spectrum as well. Treatment of
		ICL includes treatment of opportunistic infections and prophylaxis against them.

		a case of a 60-year-old man who was diagnosed with disseminated histoplasmosis
		"involving soft palate, duodenum, colon and bone marrow in the setting of"
		idiopathic CD4 T-lymphocytopenia.

PG	-	406102
LID	-	10.1155/2010/406102 [doi]
LID	-	406102
AB	-	Background. Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is rarely
		complicated by amyloidosis. Case. A 66-year-old white male presented to the
		emergency room (ER) after an unwitnessed fall and change in mental status.
		Patient was awake and alert but not oriented. There was no focal deficit on
		"neurological exam. Past medical history (PMH) included hypertension,"
		"hypercholesterolemia, aortic valve replacement (nonmetallic), incomplete heart"
		block controlled by a pacemaker and IgG- IgA type Monoclonal Gammopathy of
		Undetermined Significance. The MGUS was diagnosed 9 months ago on serum protein
		electrophoresis (SPEP) as patient was referred to the outpatient clinic for
		"hyperglobulinemia on routine blood work. In ER, a head-computed tomography (CT)"
		revealed multiple parenchymal hemorrhagic lesions suspicious for metastases. A CT
		"chest, abdomen and pelvis revealed numerous ground-glass and solid nodules in the"
		lungs. Lower extremity duplex and transesophageal echocardiogram were negative.
		"Serial blood cultures and serologies for cryptococcus and histoplasmosis,"
		"antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), antinuclear antibody (ANA),"
		"rheumatoid factor (RF), cryoglobulin, and antiglomerular basement membrane"
		(anti-GBM) antibodies were all negative. CT guided lung biopsy was positive for
		Thioflavin T amyloid deposits. Brain biopsy was positive for eosinophilic
		material (similar to the lungs) but negative for Thioflavin T stain. The
		patient's clinical status continued to deteriorate with cold cyanotic fingers
		"developing on day 12 and a health care acquired pneumonia, respiratory failure,"
		"and fungemia on day 18. On day 29, family withdrew life support and denied any"
		autopsies. Conclusion. Described is an atypical course of MGUS complicated by
		amyloidosis of the lung and nonamyloid eosinophilic deposition in the brain. As
		"MGUS might be complicated by diseases such as amyloidosis and multiple myeloma, a"
		scheduled follow-up of these patients is always necessary. Further research is
		needed in order to better define the optimal treatment and management strategies
		of MGUS and its complications.

PG	-	49-52

AB	-	Histoplasma capsulatum is an endemic fungus in eastern Canada. This organism has
		a wide spectrum of manifestations ranging from isolated pulmonary to disseminated
		disease. The latter usually occurs in immunocompromised hosts or those with
		"substantial environmental exposure. In rare instances, disseminated"
		histoplasmosis can present as an endovascular infection or chronic progressive
		"disseminated histoplasmosis. If not recognized, these entities are almost"
		uniformly fatal. We report a case of an immunocompetent man with a history of
		longstanding constitutional symptoms. An infectious cause was initially presumed
		to be unlikely given the chronic nature of his presentation and an extensive
		series of negative investigations. A diagnosis was only obtained post-mortem upon
		the unusual detection of both yeast and hyphal forms in blood culture bottles
		inoculated with a bone marrow aspirate.

AB	-	Gastrointestinal histoplasmosis (GIH) without pulmonary and bone marrow
		involvement is very rare worldwide. It can be misdiagnosed as intestinal
		tuberculosis or Crohn's disease. There are just few case reports of GIH in
		"patients with a positive HIV antibody test. Here, we report a patient who"
		presented to our hospital with repeated intestinal obstruction. The suspicious
		diagnosis was intestinal tuberculosis or Crohn's disease due to unspecific
		clinical manifestations and radiologic images. Our patient's HIV antibody test
		"was negative. She had no medical prescriptions. Therefore, our differential"
		"diagnosis needed to include ileum histoplasmosis besides intestinal lymphoma,"
		"intestinal tuberculosis, and Crohn's disease. Finally, the patient was diagnosed"
		with ileum histoplasmosis due to surgical resection. It is important to be aware
		"of potential infectious diseases, such as ileum histoplasmosis, when making a"
		"differential diagnosis. Moreover, surgical resection might be the final approach"
		for small-intestine stricture with fibrosis.

AB	-	"A 58-year-old woman from Zimbabwe, with a history of untreated human"
		"immunodeficiency virus, presented with leonine facies and a diffuse rash. The"
		rash occurred in the context of a 1-year history of constitutional symptoms and
		cognitive decline. Laboratory investigations confirmed that her human
		immunodeficiency virus had progressed to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
		"Through imaging, tissue biopsies, and polymerase chain reaction, a diagnosis of"
		disseminated histoplasmosis was made. Since there was no history of travel and
		"histoplasmosis is not locally endemic, the patient likely contracted this fungal"
		"infection more than 7 years ago, while living in Africa. We speculate that the"
		histoplasmosis remained latent until her immune system began to decline. The
		"work-up and management of this rare cutaneous presentation of a systemic disease,"
		"which should be added to the list of ""great mimickers"" in dermatology, are"
		discussed.

PG	-	239-242
LID	-	10.4103/aian.AIAN_511_20 [doi]
AB	-	Histoplasmosis occurs predominantly in immunocompromised hosts and typically
		"presents with mild constitutional symptoms, weight loss, weakness, fatigability,"
		"hepatosplenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy. The diagnosis is generally delayed and"
		is based upon isolating the organism in blood cultures or by identifying
		intracellular organisms in tissues. Disseminated Histoplasmosis is well described
		in HIV patients but Histoplasmosis myositis is a rare manifestation and has not
		been reported in seronegative patients till date. We here address a case of a
		pharmacologically immunosuppressed patient with extensive Histoplasmosis myositis
		invading almost all the skeletal muscles of body (including plantar foot muscles)
		with no evidence of dissemination to other organ-systems. Clinical examination
		and investigations co-related with infiltrative muscle disease and skeletal
		muscle biopsy revealed Histoplasma capsulatum. This patient illustrates a
		distinctive clinical presentation of fungal infection with subtle constitutional
		symptoms and isolated muscle weakness which added to the diagnostic challenge.
		"Hence, differential diagnosis of fungal infection must always be considered as a"
		cause of myopathy in any pharmacologically immunosuppressed patient.

AB	-	"Bacterial peritonitis is a common complication of peritoneal dialysis, but fungal"
		peritonitis is unusual and is mostly due to Candida species. Peritonitis due to
		Histoplasma capsulatum is rare and we report one such case. A 63-year-old female
		"presented with progressively worsening abdominal pain, fever, and altered mental"
		status. She had end-stage renal disease and had been on peritoneal dialysis for 4
		years. She had abdominal tenderness without rebound or guarding. Laboratory
		studies and CT of abdomen were significant for leukocytosis and peritoneal
		"membrane thickening, respectively. Peritoneal dialysis fluid study was consistent"
		with peritonitis and culture of the fluid grew Histoplasma capsulatum. Treatment
		recommendations include removal of catheter and initiation of antifungal therapy.
		"With the availability of newer antifungals, medical management without removal of"
		"PD catheter is possible, but at the same time if there is no response to"
		"treatment within a week, PD catheter should be removed promptly."

LID	-	rjx232
AB	-	Histoplasmosis is an endemic mycosis in the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys
		and can cause disseminated infection in immunocompromised hosts. Disseminated
		histoplasmosis is often respiratory in nature and most cases in transplant
		patients occur within 2 years post-transplantation. A 32-year-old male on
		mycophenolate and tacrolimus who underwent an orthotopic liver transplantation 10
		"years prior presented with generalized body aches, fevers, mild congestion,"
		dysuria and elevated transaminases. Liver biopsy revealed epithelioid granulomas
		"with narrow-based budding yeast, suggesting histoplasma. Liver involvement in"
		disseminated histoplasmosis is well characterized however the disease is usually
		pulmonary in origin. Only three other case reports describe isolated
		"granulomatous hepatitis, and this is the first to our knowledge to occur in a"
		liver transplant allograft. A high index of suspicion is essential for diagnosis
		and prompt treatment of histoplasmosis in transplant patients considering their
		immunocompromised state.

PG	-	K21-4
LID	-	10.1530/ERP-14-0103 [doi]
AB	-	"A 67-year-old man with myelodysplastic syndrome, disseminated histoplasmosis, and"
		mitral valve replacement presented with dyspnea and peripheral edema.
		Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated abnormal pulmonic valve with possible
		vegetation. Color flow imaging showed laminar flow from main pulmonary artery
		into right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) in diastole. The continuous wave
		Doppler signal showed dense diastolic envelope with steep deceleration slope.
		"These findings were consistent with severe pulmonic valve regurgitation, possibly"
		due to endocarditis. Transesophageal echocardiography demonstrated an echodense
		mass attached to the pulmonic valve. The mitral valve bioprosthesis appeared
		"intact. Bacterial and fungal blood cultures were negative; however, serum"
		"histoplasma antigen was positive. At surgery, the valve appeared destroyed by"
		vegetations. Gomori methenamine silver-stains showed invasive fungal hyphae and
		yeast consistent with a dimorphic fungus. Valve cultures grew one colony of
		filamentous fungus. Itraconazole was continued based on expert infectious
		"diseases diagnosis. After surgery, dyspnea and ankle edema resolved. To the best"
		"of our knowledge, histoplasma endocarditis of pulmonic valve has not been"
		"previously reported. Isolated pulmonic valve endocarditis is rare, accounting for"
		about 2% of infectious endocarditis (IE) cases. Fungi account for about 3% of
		cases of native valve endocarditis. Characterization of pulmonary valve requires
		thorough interrogation with 2D and Doppler echocardiography techniques.
		Parasternal RVOT view allowed visualization of the pulmonary valve and assessment
		"of regurgitation severity. As an anterior structure, it may be difficult to image"
		with transesophageal echocardiography. Mid-esophageal right ventricular
		inflow-outflow view clearly showed the pulmonary valve and vegetation. LEARNING
		POINTS: Identification and characterization of pulmonary valve abnormalities
		require thorough interrogation with 2D and Doppler echocardiography
		techniques.Isolated pulmonary valve IE is rare and requires high index of
		suspicion. Histoplasma capsulatum IE is rare and requires high index of
		suspicion.

PG	-	e332-e333
LID	-	10.1093/milmed/usx122 [doi]
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Blastomyces dermatitidis is a dimorphic fungus endemic to the
		Mississippi River valley. We describe a rare case of chronic pulmonary
		blastomycosis complicated by large pulmonary cavitation in a young service member
		who was misdiagnosed with active pulmonary tuberculosis. CASE PRESENTATION: A
		25-year-old active duty male presented to his primary care provider with
		"complaints of hemoptysis, fatigue, weight loss, and fever. Computed tomography"
		chest with contrast identified a large cavitary lesion in the right upper lobe
		(RUL). The patient was admitted to an outside hospital and he underwent
		bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsies and bronchoalveolar lavage of the RUL.
		Histology and cultures were unremarkable however; Histoplasma serum antigen was
		positive. The patient was empirically treated for active pulmonary tuberculosis
		and soon discharged. He returned for medical evaluation 3 mo later with continued
		hemoptysis. Repeat bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsies of the RUL cavity
		grew Blastomyces dermatitidis. The patient's symptoms resolved and chest imaging
		significantly improved with initiation of itraconazole. DISCUSSION: Chronic
		pulmonary blastomycosis can present with a constellation of symptoms that may be
		"indistinguishable from chronic pulmonary histoplasmosis, pulmonary tuberculosis,"
		or lung cancer. Knowledge of endemic diseases and a thorough travel history
		should be an integral part of a military physician's infectious disease
		evaluation.

AB	-	"PURPOSE: To report a case of a cat-scratch uveitis caused by Bartonella henselae,"
		"which was confirmed by histology, serology, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)"
		methodology. METHODS: An iris nodule was biopsied from a 4-year-old child who was
		scratched by a kitten on the side of his face and developed redness of the eye
		associated with cervical lymphadenopathy. Sections of the iridectomy specimen
		"were stained with hematoxylin-eosin, periodic acid-Schiff, and Warthin-Starry"
		"technique for histopathologic evaluation. Additionally, serologic tests and"
		molecular diagnosis using B. henselae-specific PCR were performed. RESULTS:
		"Histopathologically, sections of the iridectomy specimen showed a zonal"
		granulomatous inflammation with a central iris necrotic abscess surrounded by a
		mantle of epithelioid histiocytes and more peripherally by lymphocytes and plasma
		cells. The Warthin-Starry stain disclosed scattered short bacilli within the
		necrotic abscess morphologically compatible with B. henselae. Report of serologic
		tests for B. henselae disclosed a negative immunoglobulin G antibody (negative:
		less than 12) and a positive immunoglobulin M antibody of 18 (positive: greater
		"than 15). Other serologic studies including Toxocara, histoplasmin, blastomycin,"
		"coccidioidin, aspergillin, and Chlamydia were all negative. PCR was positive for"
		B. henselae DNA. CONCLUSIONS: Our case showed a unilateral chronic granulomatous
		iritis with the histopathologic features compatible with CSD caused by B.
		henselae bacillus as demonstrated in the iris biopsy and confirmed by serology
		and PCR technique. This case is an example of a relatively rare uveal
		manifestation of CSD.

LID	-	10.1155/2018/3246929 [doi]
LID	-	3246929
AB	-	A teenage girl was evaluated for recurrent right pneumonia. The evaluation
		revealed a calcified mediastinal mass that compressed the right intermediate and
		"middle lobar bronchi, as well as the right pulmonary artery and veins. The"
		clinical picture together with imaging studies and borderline positive serology
		testing suggested a diagnosis of fibrosing mediastinitis associated with
		histoplasmosis. This rare condition is characterized by the local proliferation
		of invasive fibrous tissue within the mediastinum due to a hyperimmune reaction
		to Histoplasma capsulatum. Antifungal and anti-inflammatory therapies are usually
		"ineffective, and surgical intervention contains a high morbidity risk. Palliative"
		"surgery and stenting of the compressed airway have been suggested. In the past,"
		"the prognosis was thought to be poor, but recent studies demonstrate a more"
		positive outcome. Our patient had been radiologically and functionally stable
		under follow-up for over thirteen years and has married and delivered two healthy
		"children, both following an uneventful pregnancy."

		Patients with suppressed cell immunity mainly due to HIV are at increased risk of
		disseminated disease. Dermatological manifestations of immune reconstitution
		inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) and cutaneous manifestations of histoplasmosis
		similar to an IRIS event have been previously described. We report the case of a
		43-year-old male who presented with cutaneous disseminated histoplasmosis due to
		Histoplasma capsulatum var. capsulatum 4 months after the onset of the
		antiretroviral therapy and some improvement in the immune reconstitution. After 2
		"weeks of amphotericin B and itraconazole therapy, the scheduled treatment"
		"involved fluconazole maintenance therapy, which resulted in an improvement of his"
		skin lesions.

AB	-	Fibrosing mediastinitis is rare in settings where histoplasmosis is not endemic.
		An idiopathic form of the disease may present with indistinguishable features and
		requires methodical exclusion of competing differential diagnoses. We report the
		case of a 30-year old female patient who presented with intermittent haemoptysis
		for the past 2 years with no constitutional symptoms. Computed tomography of the
		chest revealed a prominent right bronchial arterial circulation with a mass-like
		"lesion, which encased and attenuated the right pulmonary trunk and adjacent"
		structures. Endobronchial ultrasonography with transbronchial fine-needle
		aspiration showed a paucicellular aspirate with no evidence of malignancy or
		"granulomas. Fungal infection, tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, IgG4-disease, and"
		"connective tissue disease were ruled out by appropriate serological, molecular,"
		and microbiological tests. A diagnosis of idiopathic fibrosing mediastinitis was
		therefore made by exclusion and the patient was successfully treated with oral
		corticosteroids.

AB	-	Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare condition characterized by an
		overwhelming inflammatory cascade activation which is often associated with rapid
		progression and high mortality. It may be familial with an underlying genetic
		"mutation or triggered by infection, malignancy, and autoimmune disease."
		Disseminated histoplasmosis caused by histoplasma capsulatum is a granulomatous
		fungal disease seen typically in immunocompromised patients with varied clinical
		manifestations and requires long-term antifungal therapy. We present the case of
		a 61-year-old immunocompromised female with significant travel history who came
		"with fever, pancytopenia, and liver failure raising suspicion for HLH that"
		prompted a bone marrow biopsy procedure. Hemophagocytic figures consistent with
		HLH and numerous encapsulated fungi resembling histoplasma were visualized. She
		was treated with intravenous (IV) liposomal amphotericin B. Etoposide
		chemotherapy and interleukin-1 (IL-1) antagonist anakinra were deferred in order
		"to limit her immunosuppression, and treatment was focused on antifungal therapy."

AB	-	Miliary shadows on chest imaging have wide differential diagnoses. The most
		"common etiology is infectious, such as miliary tuberculosis (TB) and"
		"histoplasmosis, but miliary shadows can be the presentation of sarcoidosis,"
		"pneumoconiosis, and secondary metastasis to the lungs from primary cancers of the"
		"thyroid, kidney, and trophoblasts as well as sarcomas. Here we present the case"
		of a 35-year-old Indian male who presented with a 2-month history of dry cough
		and shortness of breath. Chest imaging showed diffuse bilateral miliary nodules.
		The initial impression was that of miliary pulmonary TB. Subsequent bronchoscopy
		with a transbronchial biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of pulmonary mucinous
		"adenocarcinoma with brain metastasis, which is a rare and unusual presentation of"
		"primary lung cancer. The tumor was positive for ALK5A4 and PD-L1, and the patient"
		"was started on tyrosine kinase inhibitor immunotherapy, with a favorable"

TI	-	Pulmonary mucormycosis diagnosed by fine needle aspiration cytology. A case
		report.
PG	-	411-4
AB	-	BACKGROUND: The usefulness of fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) in the
		diagnosis of lung lesions is well documented. Fungal lesions are among
		nonneoplastic lesions of the lung in which FNAC has proven a useful technique in
		both immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients. These include
		"cryptococcosis, aspergillosis, histoplasmosis and coccidiodomycosis. Pulmonary"
		"mucormycosis, an aggressive fungal infection, is rarely diagnosed on FNAC. We"
		report a case of isolated pulmonary mucormycosis diagnosed on FNAC. CASE: A
		"62-year-old renal transplant recipient with diabetes mellitus and hypertension,"
		"asymptomatic for four months, presented with tachypnea, generalized malaise and"
		"weakness. Radiologic studies showed an enlarging, cavitating lesion in the right"
		lung. Computed tomography-guided fine needle aspiration performed on the lung
		"lesion showed fungal profiles with broad, ribbonlike, aseptate hyphae with"
		"right-angled branching consistent with the Zygomycetes class of fungi, which"
		includes Rhizopus and Mucor species. Fungal cultures confirmed the presence of
		"Rhizopus. The patient underwent right pneumonectomy, was placed on liposomal"
		amphotericin B therapy and discharged with good pulmonary status and stable
		kidney function. CONCLUSION: FNAC is a useful technique in the diagnosis of
		pulmonary mucormycosis.

AB	-	A case of lung cavity with fungus ball is reported in a patient subsequent to the
		"treatment of tuberculosis for a year. Fungal serologic titers for histoplasmin,"
		"blastomycin, coccidiodin, and aspergillin were negative. Surgical resection of"
		the cavity and to be done because of episodes of hemoptysis. Numerous hyphae
		formed into a compact mass consistent with aspergilloma were seen in the cavity.
		The cultures for fungi were negative on material from the surgical specimen.
		Immunodiffusion studies of sera obtained prior to surgery were positive for
		Pseudallescheria boydii and very informative in assessing the correct morphologic
		characteristics of the organism.

PG	-	245-51
AB	-	We employed vitreous biopsy (needle aspiration and pars plana vitrectomy) in
		eight cases of patients with uveitis of unknown etiology. The results of
		cytological and culture analysis provided the diagnosis of disseminated
		histoplasmosis in one patient and ocular reticulum cell sarcoma in another
		"patient. In six patients, no specific, treatable causative agents or conditions"
		"were identified. In two of these patients, however, various etiologic agents were"
		"ruled out, which provided a basis for excluding certain therapeutic options."
		"Where chronic inflammatory cells were seen in the vitreous, the patients"
		responded satisfactorily to conventional therapy; patients with acute or mixed
		acute and chronic inflammatory cells did less well. No complications resulted
		"from the biopsy procedure. In cases of uveitis of unknown etiology, vitreous"
		"biopsy may provide identification of specific causative agents, as well as"
		information useful for more precise histopathologic grouping of entities in this
		disease.

PG	-	ED01-ED02
LID	-	10.7860/JCDR/2017/19676.9145 [doi]
AB	-	Histoplasmosis is a genus of dimorphic fungi having various varieties of which
		the commonest one causing infection is Histoplasma capsulatum known to cause
		histoplasmosis. It has a varied disease spectrum ranging from an acute infection
		"to chronic disease especially in lungs, disseminated disease and cutaneous"
		disorder. Histoplasma capsulatum usually causes subclinical infection and serious
		infections only manifest in immunocompromised patients. Frank cases of infection
		are seen in pulmonary histoplasmosis. The spores of these organisms are seen to
		be strongly associated with droppings of birds and bats. A combination of these
		droppings and some soil types provide for an excellent environment for the
		proliferation of spores. Pulmonary histoplasmosis and disseminated disease are
		very common in AIDS patients and are a great cause of morbidity and mortality in
		these patients. Primary cutaneous histoplasmosis is very rare and occurs due to
		"penetrating injuries. Once diagnosis is made, the lesions respond very well to"
		"oral itraconazole, fluconazole or amphotericicn B. We report a rare case of"
		Cutaneous Histoplasmosis (CHP) in a 70-year-old male with complaints of multiple
		nodules all over his body in a HIV seronegative and otherwise immunocompetent
		patient.

		This organism's ubiquity outside the traditionally defined region of the
		Mississippi and Ohio River Valley makes it an important yet often forgotten cause
		of systemic inflammatory disease. Progressive disseminated histoplasmosis is an
		"uncommon opportunistic infection, largely affecting immunocompromised individuals"
		with defects in T-cell immunity. The initial manifestations of disseminated
		"histoplasmosis present non-specifically with symptoms such as fever, malaise,"
		"anorexia, and weight loss. Given this fungi's endemic nature, disseminated"
		histoplasmosis is an essential disease for physicians to diagnose accurately.
		"Diagnosis can be established through antigen detection in the blood or urine,"
		although the gold standard is tissue diagnosis or fungal culture. Treatment of
		"mild to moderate disease consists of an itraconazole regimen for a year, yet"
		severe disease requires an additional 14-day induction therapy with amphotericin
		"B. We present a case of disseminated histoplasmosis in a breast cancer patient,"
		"recently treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, who presented with new-onset"
		pancytopenia.

		"However, it might manifest as a disseminated disease in immunocompromised"
		individuals. The involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) accounts for
		about 5-10% of cases with disseminated disease. Isolated histoplasmosis of the
		"CNS is rare, and the literature shows only a few reported cases. By imaging"
		"studies, it usually presents as an isolated ring-enhancing lesion. Its spectrum"
		"of symptoms ranges from acute severe infection to progressive chronic meningitis,"

		"States who misdiagnosed with Gliosarcoma in 2019, for which he underwent"
		appropriate management for Gliosarcoma. Presented for follow-up after new
		neurological symptoms; worsening in ring-enhancing brain lesions was found on
		magnetic resonance image MRI. After a re-examination of surgical pathological
		"cases, histoplasmosis of the CNS was diagnosed. Failure of diagnosis CNS"
		histoplasmosis early can lead to poor outcome and decrease chances of recovery.

AB	-	The incidence of bronchoesophageal fistula in presence of benign pathology of
		tracheal tree or oesophagus is rare. It is encountered in thoracic diseases like
		"tuberculosis, syphilis or histoplasmosis due to erosion by infected lymph node or"
		abscess to adjoining structures. The source of primary pathology has to be
		eliminated followed by appropriate steps of fistula tract closure is essential
		for optimal result. We report a 25-year-old patient with left sided
		bronchoesophageal fistula. He had a past history of pulmonary tuberculosis. A
		left lower lobectomy followed by repair of oesophageal fistula opening was
		performed by primary closure and reinforcement with an intercostal muscle flap
		based on posterior intercostal artery. Postoperative oesophagogram showed short
		"diverticula, which was occluded with n-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA) glue under"
		radiological guidance. Feeding was started one week after application of glue
		without further complication. Reports on intercostals muscle flap repair and
		intervention of residual oesophageal diverticula with n-butyl cyanoacrylate
		(NBCA) glue under radiological guidance are scanty.

LID	-	e17269
AB	-	Disseminated histoplasmosis can occur in immunocompromised patients such as in
		HIV disease and patients with medication-induced immunosuppression. Most of these
		"patients present with fever, weight loss, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy,"
		and pancytopenia. There are increasing reports of coronavirus disease 2019
		(COVID-19) pneumonia associated with fungal infections including aspergillus and
		mucormycosis. It is not typical for immunocompetent patients to present with
		disseminated fungal disease. We herein report a case of a 50-year-old
		immunocompetent male with a recent recovery from COVID-19 pneumonia who presented
		with fever and pancytopenia. Chest computed tomography (CT) demonstrated
		"new-onset right upper lobe lung mass, subcarinal lymphadenopathy, and"
		"splenomegaly. Mediastinal lymph nodes and bone marrow biopsies were performed,"
		and the patient was diagnosed with disseminated histoplasmosis. The association
		between COVID-19 pneumonia and fungal infections is increasingly reported.
		"Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion, especially in immunocompetent"
		patients.

LID	-	8923972
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Gastrointestinal histoplasmosis (GH) is a well-described albeit
		"uncommon disease. It is found almost exclusively in the immunocompromised host,"
		especially those with untreated HIV and low CD4 counts. Presentation with
		intestinal perforation is seen mostly commonly in the colon. We present a patient
		"with jejunal perforation, and there have been only 3 previous cases reported in"
		"the literature. CASE: A 39-year-old male with known, untreated HIV presented to"
		the ED with an acute abdomen after experiencing worsening intermittent abdominal
		"pain for 2 months before that was associated with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and"
		weight loss. CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed evidence of gas in the
		"mesentery, small bowel thickening, edema, and free fluid in the abdomen."
		Emergency exploratory laparotomy was conducted. Intraoperative findings included
		a perforated jejunum that was studded with nodular lesions as well as mesenteric
		masses. Histopathologic exam of these mesenteric masses and jejunal lesions were
		positive for histoplasmosis. CONCLUSION: Disseminated histoplasmosis is a
		life-threatening disease that occurs nearly exclusively in immunocompromised
		"hosts. Untreated, mortality is as high as 80%. This rare presentation with"
		jejunal perforation highlights the need for awareness of histoplasmosis
		involvement throughout the entirety of the GI tract.

TI	-	Fungal graft infections: case report and review of the literature.
PG	-	398-402
AB	-	"Fungal intravascular graft infections are rare. In addition to our case, which"
		"forms the basis of this article, only 13 documented instances could be found in"
		the literature in the 20-year period from 1966 to 1986. Three of these cases
		(21%) had both fungus and bacteria grown in culture. Candida and Aspergillus
		species constituted most of the infecting organisms (79%). There was no obvious
		difference in the clinical presentations between fungal and bacterial infections.
		"In two cases (14%), there was a strong predisposition toward fungal infection:"
		one in a patient with pulmonary histoplasmosis and one in a patient with
		leukemia. Appropriate intervention appears to be graft excision and
		extra-anatomic bypass with concomitant therapy with amphotericin B. Survival with
		"this approach was 84%, whereas other methods yielded a survival rate of 20%."

		gastrointestinal bleeding.
PG	-	140-2
AB	-	Traction diverticula of the mid-esophagus are usually incidental findings on
		barium swallow or upper endoscopy. They are thought to arise secondary to
		"adjacent inflammation in the mediastinum, usually from granulomatous infection"
		"such as histoplasmosis. They are usually asymptomatic. Rarely, erosion or"
		extension of the inflammatory process into the adjacent lung or bronchial
		arteries can result in clinical symptoms such as pneumonia or gastrointestinal
		bleeding. Diagnosis is often delayed due to the rarity of clinical symptoms. We
		present a case of massive upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to a mid-esophageal
		diverticulum.

		review of literature.
PG	-	31-41
AB	-	"Introduction. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), a rare but potentially"
		"fatal disease, is characterized by excessive immune activation and cytokine"
		release which stimulates bone marrow macrophages to engulf hematopoietic cells.
		"HLH could be secondary to infections: viral, fungal, and bacterial; malignancies"
		and autoimmune diseases. The diagnosis of HLH is usually delayed due to the
		presence of non-specific symptoms at presentation. This delay contributes to
		increased mortality. Cases and review. We present the case of 4 patients who
		presented with subjective fevers and extreme fatigue. Patients all had systemic
		inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). All patients were initially managed as in
		sepsis from an underlying infection. All unfortunately progressed to multiple
		organs dysfunction and died. The underlying causes for HLH in the patients were
		"considered to be: HIV/AIDS, T cell lymphoma, histoplasmosis and juvenile"
		rheumatoid arthritis. We have also included a brief review of the literature on
		HLH highlighting the treatment and outcomes of patients in case series; and the
		many conditions which can trigger HLH. Conclusion. Patients with HLH usually
		"share various non-specific symptoms, such as fever and malaise, with patients"
		across a wide spectrum of conditions: from bacterial sepsis to malignancies.
		Since early suspicion and diagnosis is critical to prompt therapy and improved
		"mortality, including HLH as a possible cause of fever particularly in patients"
		with prolonged fever of unknown origin and cytopenias will be crucial.

		"dysfunction (AGD) in renal transplant recipients (RTR), and the risk of"

		no current consensus on the management of immunosuppression during SARS-CoV-2
		infection in RTR. Case Presentation. A 35-year-old male RTR from a living related
		"donor presented with SARS-CoV-2 infection (January 2021). Two months later,"
		despite alterations to his immunosuppression regimen (tacrolimus (TAC) was
		"reduced by 50%, and the mycophenolic acid (MMF) was suspended with the remission"
		"of symptoms), the patient presented with pulmonary tuberculosis, pneumonia due to"
		"respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonitis, and"
		"histoplasmosis (HP). Management was initiated with antituberculosis medications,"
		"ganciclovir, antibiotics, and liposomal amphotericin B, and the"
		"immunosuppressants were suspended, yet the patient's evolution was catastrophic"
		"and the outcome fatal. CONCLUSION: We recommend that in RTR post-COVID-19, the"
		immunosuppression regimen should be gradually reinstated along with strict
		"vigilance in observing for highly prevalent coinfections (TB, HP, and CMV)."

PG	-	177-80
LID	-	10.1016/j.hrtlng.2011.01.002 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Fever of unknown origin (FUO) has been defined as a fever of ≥101°F
		that persists for 3 weeks or more. It is not readily diagnosed after 1 week of
		intensive in-hospital testing or after intensive outpatient or inpatient testing.
		"Fevers of unknown origin may be caused by infectious diseases, malignancies,"
		"collagen vascular diseases, or a variety of miscellaneous disorders. The relative"
		"distribution of causes of FUOs is partly age-related. In the elderly, the"
		"preponderance of FUOs is attributable to neoplastic and infectious etiologies,"
		"whereas in children, collagen vascular diseases, neoplasms, and viral infectious"
		disease predominate. The diagnostic approach to FUOs depends on a careful
		"analysis of the history, physical findings, and laboratory tests. Most patients"
		with FUOs exhibit localizing findings that should direct the diagnostic workup
		and limit diagnostic possibilities. The most perplexing causes of FUOs involve
		"those without specific diagnostic tests, e.g., juvenile rheumatoid arthritis"
		"(JRA) or adult Still's disease. In a young adult with FUO, if all of the cardinal"
		"symptoms are present, JRA may present either a straightforward or an elusive"
		"diagnosis, if key findings are absent or if the diagnosis goes unsuspected."
		METHODS: We present a 19-year-old man with a recurrent FUO. His illness began
		"3 years before admission and has recurred twice since. In the past, he did not"
		"manifest arthralgias, arthritis, or a truncal rash. On admission, he presented"
		"with an FUO with hepatosplenomegaly, aseptic meningitis, and pericarditis. An"
		"extensive diagnostic workup ruled out lymphoma and leukemia. Moreover, a further"
		extensive workup eliminated infectious causes of FUO appropriate to his clinical
		"presentation, ie, tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, brucellosis, Q fever, typhoid"
		"fever, Epstein-Barr virus, infectious mononucleosis, cytomegalovirus, human"
		"herpes virus (HHV)-6, babesiosis, ehrlichiosis, viral hepatitis, and Whipple's"
		disease. RESULTS: The diagnosis of JRA was based on the exclusion of infectious
		"and neoplastic disorders in a young adult with hepatosplenomegaly, aseptic"
		"meningitis, pericarditis, and a double quotidian fever. With JRA, tests for"
		"rheumatic diseases are negative, as they were in this case. The only laboratory"
		"abnormalities in this patient included elevated serum transaminases, a mildly"
		"elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and a moderately elevated level of serum"
		ferritin. CONCLUSION: Diagnostic fever curves are most helpful in cases where the
		"diagnosis is most elusive, as was the case here. Relatively few disorders are"
		"associated with a double quotidian fever, ie, visceral leishmaniasis, mixed"
		"malarial infections, right-sided gonococcal acute bacterial endocarditis, and"
		JRA. Because the patient received antipyretics during the first week of
		"admission, fever was not present. After infectious disease consultation during"
		"week 2 of hospitalization, antipyretics were discontinued, and a double quotidian"
		"fever was present, which provided the key diagnostic clue in this case."

AB	-	The clinical and morphologic findings in the case of a 47-year-old man with
		"fibrosing mediastinitis, most probably due to histoplasmosis, are described."
		Radionuclide angiography demonstrated obstruction of the superior vena cava with
		collateral vascularization. Computed tomography demonstrated a large calcific
		mass interposed between the pulmonary artery and superior vena cava suggesting
		"potential pulmonary vasculature involvement. For this reason, pulmonary"
		scintigraphy was performed which showed right lung perfusion and ventilation
		defects. Radionuclide angiography and pulmonary scintigraphy complement each

		"mediastinitis. However, contrast venography is necessary to correctly delineate"
		the anatomy of the obstructed superior vena cava and its collaterals.

AB	-	"OBJECTIVE: To report the case of a woman with AIDS who developed tremor, acute"
		"pancreatitis, and elevated serum creatinine levels while receiving"
		trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). CASE SUMMARY: A 37-year-old Puerto Rican
		"woman with AIDS, HIV nephropathy, and a recent history of disseminated"
		"histoplasmosis presented with fever, nonproductive cough, pancytopenia, and"
		elevated transaminase and alkaline phosphatase levels. Serum creatinine was near
		her baseline level of 2.9 mg/dL. Treatment was started with amphotericin B lipid
		complex for histoplasmosis and intravenous TMP/SMX for presumed Pneumocystis
		"carinii pneumonia. Two days later, the patient developed a high-frequency tremor"
		"and severe abdominal pain, and serum creatinine increased to 5.6 mg/dL. TMP/SMX"
		"was discontinued, after which the patient's symptoms resolved within 72 hours and"
		serum creatinine returned to baseline levels. DISCUSSION: A high incidence of
		adverse reactions to TMP/SMX has been reported among HIV-infected persons. Toxic
		sulfamethoxazole metabolites may elicit hypersensitivity reactions. Trimethoprim
		"can inhibit renal creatinine secretion, leading to high serum creatinine levels."
		"Trimethoprim also inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, causing decreased dopamine"
		"production, which may lead to parkinsonian symptoms. Use of the Naranjo"
		probability scale indicated a probable relationship between the adverse effect
		and TMP/SMX. CONCLUSIONS: The high frequency and wide range of potential adverse
		effects associated with the use of TMP/SMX in HIV-infected persons require that
		clinicians consider drug toxicity as a cause of new symptoms in patients
		receiving this medication.

AB	-	CASE SUMMARY: An 11-year-old neutered male domestic longhair cat was diagnosed
		with histoplasmosis from fine-needle aspirates of an abdominal lymph node. Lymph
		node size initially decreased with fluconazole therapy (11.8 mg/kg PO q12h);
		"however, after 13 months of continuous fluconazole therapy, lymphadenomegaly"
		worsened and samples were collected for culture and antifungal susceptibility.
		The Histoplasma capsulatum isolate had a very high fluconazole minimum inhibitory
		concentration (MIC) of 64 µg/ml and an itraconazole MIC of 0.06 µg/ml. The owner
		"declined a change to itraconazole and, ultimately, the cat developed neurologic"
		signs and was euthanized. Owing to the initial response to fluconazole followed
		"by treatment failure and high MIC value, acquired fluconazole resistance was"
		suspected. Clinical breakpoints for fluconazole for the dimorphic fungi are not
		available to define true antifungal resistance. RELEVANCE AND NOVEL INFORMATION:
		This is the first published report of reduced susceptibility to fluconazole in a
		cat being treated for histoplasmosis. Fluconazole failure and increases in MIC
		between pretreatment and long-term treatment isolates are known to occur in
		humans with histoplasmosis. Practitioners should be aware of this possibility
		when treating cats with fluconazole (particularly in cases with long-term [>1
		year] fluconazole therapy or in cases with disease recrudescence).

		"5-20% of AIDS patients, and in 95% of the cases it is manifested in its"
		"disseminated form. Serum antibodies and/or antigen research can make diagnosis,"
		but the demonstration of the agent by culture or histopathological examination
		remains the gold standard methods. Co-infections in patients with AIDS are well
		"known; however, reports on disseminated tuberculosis and histoplasmosis are"
		scarce. The authors report the case of a female patient who presented a
		"short-course history of weight loss, fever, and mild respiratory symptoms, with"
		hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy. Laboratory workup called attention to
		"anemia, altered liver, canalicular enzymes, liver function tests, high titer of"
		"lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and pulmonary nodules on thoracic computed"
		tomography. Incidental finding of yeast forms within the leukocytes during a
		routine blood cell count highlighted the diagnosis of histoplasmosis. The patient
		started receiving amphotericin B but succumbed soon after. The authors emphasize
		"the possibility of this co-infection, the diagnosis of severe infection through"
		"the finding of yeast forms within peripheral leukocytes, and for the high titer"
		of LDH in aiding the differential diagnosis.

AB	-	CASE SUMMARY: A 1-year-old male intact domestic shorthair cat was evaluated for
		acute onset non-weightbearing left forelimb lameness and generalized peripheral
		lymphadenopathy. CT identified a monostotic aggressive bone lesion with an
		incomplete fracture of the left radial metaphysis. Bone aspirates yielded
		osteoblasts with minimal nuclear atypia. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a nodular
		"spleen and lymphadenopathy; cytologically, both contained lymphoid hyperplasia. A"
		urine histoplasma antigen test was negative. Bartonella henselae and Mycoplasma
		haemominutum DNA was amplified by PCR from peripheral blood. Indirect
		"immunofluorescence documented strong B henselae immunoreactivity, with lower"
		Bartonella vinsonii subspecies berkhoffii and Bartonella koehlerae antibody
		titers. After the administration of doxycycline and pradofloxacin for suspected
		"Bartonella-induced osteomyelitis, lameness resolved rapidly. Six-week"
		"post-treatment radiographs identified healing of the affected bone, and"
		Bartonella species enrichment blood culture was negative. B henselae antibody
		"titers decreased four-fold over a year, supporting seroreversion. RELEVANCE AND"
		"NOVEL INFORMATION: B henselae is a flea-transmitted, host-adapted species, not"
		previously implicated as a cause of osteomyelitis in cats. B henselae subclinical
		"bacteremia is highly prevalent among cats; however, bacteremia has been"
		associated with lymphadenopathy and febrile illness in cats. This report
		describes a unique clinical presentation in association with B henselae infection
		in a cat.

LID	-	e01243
AB	-	Extrapulmonary Histoplasma capsulatum infections in the immunocompetent
		population are rare and pose a diagnostic challenge. Upper extremity
		histoplasmosis without a primary lung infection is uncommon. It is possible to
		acquire it by inadvertent trauma with direct inoculation. Our case describes an
		immunocompetent patient with progressive swelling with minimal pain in the wrist
		associated with a small puncture wound on the left dorsal forearm. The initial
		"workup failed to identify a specific etiology. For the following six weeks, the"
		"patient experienced progressive worsening of symptoms, warranting a referral to"
		an orthopedic hand surgeon. Left lower extremity magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
		findings were non-specific. The surgeon performed a surgical exploration and
		debridement with the excision of hypertrophic tissue. Initial stains showed a
		"granulomatous tissue but did not reveal an organism; however, a month later, mold"
		was identified on the growth medium. The patient was initiated in isavuconazole
		"empiric therapy. Four weeks later, a matrix assisted laser desorption"
		ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) confirmed the
		diagnosis as Histoplasma capsulatum. The patient had clinical remission with
		isavuconazole used as the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) off
		label use.

		sclerosing mediastinitis have rarely been reported. Sclerosing mediastinitis
		"typically involves the superior/middle mediastinum and, in the United States, is"

		"to us with fevers, a mixed anemia, and a posterior mediastinal mass that on"
		pathologic examination appeared to be due to idiopathic sclerosing mediastinitis.
		"Only inclusion of a biopsy specimen from a local celiac node, after a new porta"
		"hepatis mass was found, revealed the correct diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease of"
		"the nodular sclerosing type. With the correct diagnosis, early intervention and"
		appropriate therapy resulted in clinical cure.

TI	-	Paramacular coloboma.
PG	-	556-63
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Paramacular coloboma (plural: colobomata) is a solitary oval football
		or torpedo-shaped chorioretinal lesion located temporal to the fovea in one or
		"both eyes. Previous case reports have speculated varying etiology, but few have"
		justified its pathognomonic shape and location. We believe it to be congenital in
		nature and caused by incomplete differentiation of the arcuate bundles along the
		horizontal raphe in development of the macular architecture. Associated ocular
		"findings may include blepharophimosis, situs inversus, or other anomalous retinal"
		vascular patterns. CASE REPORTS: Three cases of asymptomatic unilateral
		"paramacular colobomata are presented. In each case, a single oval chorioretinal"
		lesion temporal to the macula was found during routine examination. Visual acuity
		and Humphrey threshold visual field testing were normal with no other associated
		"congenital, systemic, or ocular abnormalities. Because the lesion is"
		"nonprogressive, these patients can be followed on an annual basis. CONCLUSION:"
		"Due to their anatomical origin, paramacular colobomata are always located"
		temporal to the macula and have an oval football-shaped appearance. Visual acuity
		"and visual field testing are usually normal, although highly observant patients"
		may be aware of a mild scotoma. Differential diagnosis is important because the
		"clinical appearance can be similar to acquired conditions, most notably"
		age-related macular degeneration and presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome.

AB	-	"A 67-year-old man, with multiple skin lesions that appeared over 2 years, had"
		biopsies that disclosed granulomatous dermatitis with associated small yeasts.
		The urinary antigen test results were negative for Histoplasma infection;
		cultures from the biopsies did not grow any fungi or other potential pathogens.
		The chest roentgenogram results were normal. Morphologic examination revealed
		features of a Malassezia species. Broad-range fungal polymerase chain reaction
		and DNA sequencing disclosed that the infecting fungus was Malassezia sympodialis
		", a lipid-dependent yeast. This report supports one other case report that"
		"Malassezia species may cause granulomatous dermatitis; in the previous case, the"
		"etiologic agent was Malassezia pachydermatis , a nonlipid-dependent species. We"
		recommend the use of lipid-supplemented culture media for specimens from patients
		with granulomatous dermatitis because several Malassezia species are dependent on
		lipid; the absence of lipid supplementation in routine cultures likely explains
		"the negative culture results for this patient. This, to our knowledge, is the"
		first report of granulomatous dermatitis caused by M sympodialis.

TI	-	Subglottic tuberculosis: a case report.
PG	-	21-2
AB	-	Granulomatous disorders of the larynx can take on many forms and usually
		"represent the end stage of chronic disease. In the past, laryngeal granulomas"
		were much more prevalent primarily because of the frequency of tuberculosis.
		"Seldom is the larynx the site of origin for granulomatous disease, but it is"
		"usually a manifestation of a pulmonary entity such as histoplasmosis,"
		"blastomycosis, sarcoidosis, or tuberculosis. The actual diagnosis is frequently"
		"arrived at while trying to rule out carcinoma. Laryngeal tuberculosis, although"
		"rare in the United States, remains the most common granulomatous disease of the"
		larynx. Its increasing incidence has paralleled the diminished incidence of
		tuberculosis in the general population. Specific clinical characteristics for
		diagnosis are few and diagnosis is arrived at through a high index of suspicion
		"and biopsy. When biopsy is carried out, adequate tissue should be obtained for"
		"both histological sections, cultures, and sensitivities."

TI	-	Necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis: regarding two clinical cases.
PG	-	80-4
AB	-	The authors present two case reports of necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis. This
		disease is part of a spectrum of clinical conditions caused by the inhalation of
		Aspergillus spores. The necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis (NPA) corresponds to
		"an indolent, destructive process of the lung due to invasion by Aspergillus"
		"species, usually A. fumigatus. The diagnosis is confirmed by a histological"
		demonstration of tissue invasion by Aspergillus species and its growth on
		"culture. Due to the difficulty in confirming the diagnosis, the following"
		diagnosis criteria were established and when combined are highly indicative of
		"NPA: characteristic clinical and radiological findings, elevation of inflammatory"
		markers and either serological results positive for Aspergillus or the isolation
		"of Aspergillus from respiratory samples. Active tuberculosis, non tuberculosis"
		"mycobacteriosis, cavitary histoplasmosis and coccidioidomycosis should be"
		excluded. It is necessary to raise the level of suspicion and perform the
		adequate diagnostic tests in order to start therapy and avoiding disease
		progression.

PG	-	e167-72

AB	-	Central nervous system (CNS) histoplasmosis is rare and difficult to diagnose
		because it is often overlooked or mistaken for other pathologies due to its
		nonspecific symptoms. A 32-year-old Hispanic man with advanced acquired
		immunodeficiency virus presented with altered mental status and reported
		"confusion for the past 3 months. He had a Glasgow Coma Scale of 12, repetitive"
		"nonfluent speech, and a disconjugate gaze with a right gaze preference. Lung"
		computed tomography (CT) findings indicated a pulmonary histoplasmosis infection.
		Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed a ring-enhancing lesion in the
		left caudate nucleus. A CT-guided left retroperitoneal node biopsy was performed
		and indicated a benign inflammatory process with organisms compatible with fungal
		yeast. Treatment with amphotericin B followed by itraconazole was initiated in
		spite of negative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures and proved effective in
		mitigating associated CNS lesions and resolving neurologic deficits. The patient
		"was discharged 3 weeks later in stable condition. Six weeks later, his left basal"
		ganglia mass decreased. Early recognition of symptoms and proper steps is key in
		improving outcomes of CNS histoplasmosis. Aggressive medical management is
		"possible in the treatment of intracranial deep mass lesions, and disseminated"
		"histoplasmosis with CNS involvement can be appropriately diagnosed and treated,"
		despite negative CSF and serology studies.

LID	-	bcr2014209035
AB	-	A broncholith is defined as the presence of calcified material within a bronchus
		or within a cavity communicating with a bronchus. It is most frequently caused by
		"Histoplasmosis or tuberculosis (TB) spp. Bronchial distortion, irritation and"
		"erosion by broncholiths can cause bronchiectasis, recurrent pneumonias and"
		"haemoptysis. We present a case of recurrent pneumonia due to a broncholith, which"
		resolved conservatively with antibiotics. Owing to recurrent fevers and post
		"obstructive pneumonias, a lobectomy or rigid bronchoscopic removal were"
		considered but the patient was deemed not to be a candidate for general
		anaesthesia due to her comorbidities. Broncholiths are an uncommon cause of
		"bronchiectasis and recurrent pneumonias. However, the wide range of symptoms and"
		low clinical suspicion are the main reasons why a diagnosis can be delayed.
		Various treatment options are available and the choice of therapy should be made
		"depending on the broncholith's size, mobility, location and local surgical"
		expertise.

AB	-	Histoplasmosis is an endemic fungal infection caused by the fungus Histoplasma
		capsulatum. The disseminated form is associated with a high morbidity and
		mortality in pediatrics. Here we report the case of an immunocompetent female
		patient diagnosed with disseminated histoplasmosis. She was 3 years old and
		presented with protracted febrile syndrome and hepatosplenomegaly confirmed by
		ultrasound. Lab tests showed normocytic anemia and leukopenia. Diagnosis was made
		by periportal and perisplenic lymph node biopsy. The culture was positive for
		Histoplasma capsulatum and histopathological studies showed granulomatous
		lymphadenitis with intracellular yeast-like elements. Amphotericin B was
		"administered at 1 mg/kg/day for 6 weeks, with a favorable clinical course."
		Disseminated histoplasmosis should be considered in patients from endemic areas
		"who present the triad of fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and cytopenias so as to"
		"provide a timely treatment, improve prognosis, and reduce the mortality from this"
		disease.

AB	-	"Fibrosing mediastinitis (FM), also known as granulomatous or sclerosing"
		"mediastinitis, is an uncommon but serious cause of chest symptoms. Due to an"
		"infectious or inflammatory challenge, production of collagen occurs in the"

		following is a case of a previously healthy young woman who presented with a
		"3-month history of cough, chest pain and trouble breathing, and was subsequently"
		found to have fibrosing mediastinitis. Fibrosing mediastinitis should be

AB	-	"Aureobasidium pullulans (A. pullulans) is a dematiaceous, yeast-like fungus that"
		"is ubiquitous in nature, which can colonize the human hair and skin. A. pullulans"
		"has been clinically implicated to cause skin and soft tissue infections,"
		"meningitis, splenic abscesses, and peritonitis. Herein, molecular diagnostic of"
		internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing was used to investigate a suspected
		"case of A. pullulans infection, and the infection source had been traced. A"
		27-year-old female case was suspected of kala-azar due to the recurrent fever.
		"Bone marrow specimens were analyzed. The samples were negative for Leishmania,"
		Penicillium marneffei and Histoplasma capsulatum. DNA was extracted from the bone
		"marrow specimens, and the 583-bp sequence was amplified with the fungal ITS"
		universal primers. The sequence was compared by Blast query to be identified as
		A. pullulans. A strain of A. pullulans was also isolated from the kitchen of the
		patient's living room. Culture characteristics were the same as the human
		"pathogens of A. pullulans, and the ITS sequence was identical to the bone marrow"
		"ITS amplification. In conclusion, a deep infection caused by A. pullulans is"
		"rare, often occurring in the indwelling catheter, which may cause peritonitis and"
		other symptoms. ITS sequencing of fungi can be used as a diagnostic reference. As
		"A. pullulans is a common fungus in environment, amplification of ITS sequence of"
		A. pullulans in the aseptic body fluid would be necessary to make a comprehensive
		diagnosis based on the clinical symptoms and signs.

AB	-	The case of a 60 year old woman with hemoptysis and a thin-walled cavitary lesion
		at the upper lobe of the right lung is presented. The woman presented at the
		Mycology Unit of the Muñiz Hospital in Buenos Aires City 3 months after the
		beginning of her clinical manifestations. A hyaline micelial fungus with
		chlamido-arthroconidias was isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage.
		Immunodiffusion and counter-immnunoelectrophoresis with coccidioidin and
		"histoplasmin rendered positive results against both antigents, and skin tests"
		with coccidioidin and histoplasmin were also positive with strong reactions. The
		isolated fungus was identified as Coccidioides posadasii at the National
		"Microbiology Institute Carlos Malbrán, by means of a molecular technique. The"
		patient was treated with itraconazole by oral route at a daily dose of 200mg with
		"good clinical response, but due to the persistence of the lung cavity, a surgical"
		removal of the upper lobe of the right lung had to be scheduled.

		nasopharyngeal sample was positive. Chest X-ray showed bilateral parenchymal and

		"positive for TB on auramine staining. TB therapy (rifampicin, isoniazid,"
		"pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) and COVID-19 treatment were initiated, and the"
		symptoms improved after 2 weeks of treatment. The SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen and
		real-time polymerase chain reaction tests were negative after 2 weeks. She was
		discharged home on antiretroviral therapy and TB therapy. Coinfection with both
		"TB, HIV, and SARS-CoV-2 may be common in Cameroon but not reported. The similar"
		clinical features of COVID-19 and TB usually lead to misdiagnosis. Early
		diagnosis and initiation of appropriate treatment improve outcome.

		instability and diseases that may be of lesser importance in industrialized
		countries. The aim of this paper was to present two cases and histories of
		physicians working in hospitals in developing countries and to discuss the
		opportunities for clinical investigation and collaboration. Cases of patients in
		"Phnom Penh, Cambodia, with histoplasmosis, cryptococcal meningitis, crusted"
		"scabies, cerebral lesions and human immunodeficiency virus and of patients in"
		"Kabul, Afghanistan, with liver cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome and facial ulcer are"
		"discussed. Greater developmental support is required from industrialized nations,"
		and mutually beneficial cooperation is possible since similar clinical problems
		exist on both sides (e.g. opportunistic cardiovascular infections). Examples for
		possible support of hospital medicine include physician interchange visits with
		defined objectives (e.g. infection control or echocardiography training) and
		collaboration with clinical investigations and projects developed locally (e.g.
		epidemiology of cardiovascular diseases or nosocomial bloodborne infections).

TI	-	Clinical vignette in antiretroviral therapy: jaundice.
PG	-	133-9
AB	-	HIV caregivers face many challenges following initiation of ART. The development
		"of jaundice is uncommon but worrisome. In this case, two distinct and contrasting"
		"episodes of jaundice were observed. In the first instance, isolated elevation of"
		the indirect bilirubin without elevation of the alkaline phosphatase was noted.
		The normal PT and serum aminotransferase levels indicate the absence of intrinsic
		liver dysfunction. Elevations in the indirect bilirubin may result from either
		"impaired uptake/conjugation or excess production. The latter, usually from"
		"acquired hemolysis, may be a complication of an occult NHL. A work-up for this"
		AIDS-related malignancy was not initiated since the caregivers recognized
		"jaundice as a complication of IDV, which inhibits UDP-glucuronyl transferase and"
		produces a Gilbert's-like syndrome. Physicians can expect to encounter this
		syndrome even more frequently with ATV. Experienced patients given RTV-boosted
		ATV have experienced elevations of unconjugated hyper-bilirubinemia in up to 45
		"percent of cases in clinical trials. However, such elevations do not reflect"
		liver dysfunction and symptomatic jaundice requiring dosage reduction that
		occurred infrequently (7 to 8 percent of study patients). Counseling patients
		about this syndrome may promote adherence and prevent self-directed interruptions
		of ATV that compromise efficacy. The second case of jaundice provides a more
		formidable diagnostic challenge. The triad of LFT abnormalities (mild elevation
		"of aminotransferases, normal PT, and marked cholestatic jaundice) implies an"
		acute process that is mildly toxic to hepatocytes without affecting their
		synthetic function. The subacute nature of the patient's cholestatic jaundice
		suggests either intrahepatic infiltrative disease of the liver or extrahepatic
		"obstruction of the biliary tree, most likely due to the patient's relatively"
		modest level of pain and lack of fever. Despite LFT abnormalities occurring 17
		"months after a switch in his ART, cumulative drug-related toxicities must still"
		"be considered. Ritonavir can produce significant elevations in the AST/ALT,"
		especially with pre-existing chronic liver disease as with hepatitis C virus
		"coinfection. The NRTIs can produce hepatic steatosis, a result of mitochondrial"
		"toxicity and impaired fatty acid oxidation. However, jaundice and cholestasis are"
		not typical of the latter syndrome. With a negative contrast CT that excludes
		"parenchymal liver disease, investigation of the biliary tree to assess the"
		presence of AIDS-related cholangitis was the next step. Performing a
		"sphincterotomy or stent placement, and obtaining brushings or biopsy specimens to"
		determine the extent of extrahepatic obstruction may help define a pathogen and
		be life-saving. The negative results of the ERCP justify the final diagnostic
		"step, a liver biopsy to evaluate microscopic infiltrative disease that might not"
		have been detected on contrast abdominal CT. Examples might include granulomatous
		"disease (MAC), fungal etiologies (histoplasmosis), carcinomatosis (lymphoma,"
		"hepatoma, cholangiocarcinoma), and microvascular disease (bacillary"
		angiomatosis). The failure to observe granulomatous inflammation in the liver
		"does not exclude MAC infection, as MAC may involve other peri-aortic or"
		mesenteric lymph nodes. This form of IRIS is unlikely given the abdominal CT
		"findings, lack of systemic complaints, and extended persistence of liver"
		aminotransferases. The nonspecific results of the liver biopsy are a common
		outcome in advanced AIDS patients with elevated alkaline phosphatase levels.
		"Despite not having identified a pathogen, the biopsy establishes chronic liver"
		disease and prompts re-evaluation and change of treatment to NFV. The subsequent
		normalization of the patient's aminotransferase levels suggests a prior adverse
		"effect of LPV/r in the setting of unexplained, chronic liver disease. Most"
		"importantly, this case highlights the importance of HIV caregivers to review ART"
		for safety when noting chronic liver dysfunction. Patients need to be counseled
		"to minimize acetaminophen use, to consume alcohol in moderation, and to avoid"
		"behavior with risk for hepatitis C. Finally, all HIV patients should receive"
		appropriate vaccination against hepatitis A and B if serology shows lack of
		protective immunity.

		aureus. A light microscopic and electron microscopic study. A case report.
PG	-	292-9
AB	-	A Swedish farmer's wife aged 46 developed a unilateral panophthalmitis 6 weeks
		after a visit to Gambia in Africa. Vitreous puncture revealed growth of
		"Staphylococcus aureus, but in spite of adequate treatment the eye had to be"
		enucleated 5 weeks after the onset of symptoms. Gram-positive microorganisms in
		botryomycosis-like granules in the vitreal abscesses were at first suspected to
		be Histoplasma capsulatum. Electron microscopic examination revealed
		"microorganisms, consistent with staphylococci. There was extensive proliferation"
		"of mesosomes, most probably due to the intense treatment. The poor nutrition and"
		slow resorption of the dead microorganisms from the avascular vitreous did
		possibly also play a part in the proliferation of the mesosomes.

AB	-	"Hypercalcaemia occurs in many granulomatous diseases. Among them, sarcoidosis and"
		"tuberculosis are the most common causes. Other causes include berylliosis,"
		"coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, Crohn's disease, silicone-induced granulomas,"
		"cat-scratch disease, Wegener's granulomatosis and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia."
		Hypercalcaemia in granulomatous disease occurs as a consequence of dysregulated
		"production of 1,25-(OH)2 D3 (calcitriol) by activated macrophages in granulomas."
		Hypercalcaemia in patients with Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection has been
		reported in 0%-28% of cases. Uncultured bronchoalveolar lavage cells from
		patients with M. tuberculosis produce greater amounts of calcitriol compared with
		controls. Although Nayar et al described hypercalcaemia in a case of sepsis
		"associated with intravesical Bacille Calmette Guerin therapy, there are no"
		published reports describing hypercalcaemia in patients with pulmonary M. bovis
		infection. We describe a patient with M. bovis cavitary pulmonary infection with
		sustained hypercalcaemia that fluctuated and recurred repeatedly over the course
		"of therapy, ultimately culminating in normalisation of serum calcium when therapy"
		"had led to cure. Treatment consisted of antituberculous therapy, oral"
		corticosteroids and intravenous bisphosphonates with a favourable outcome.

TI	-	Gastric adenocarcinoma associated with isolated granulomatous gastritis.
PG	-	407-10
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Granulomatous gastritis is a rarely observed pathological diagnosis.
		"This condition often mimics gastric adenocarcinoma clinically, resulting in"
		"gastric resection. However, granulomatous gastritis has long been viewed as a"
		benign process not observed in association with adenocarcinoma of the stomach.
		This article describes a patient with granulomatous gastritis occurring in close
		proximity to an area of superficially invading gastric adenocarcinoma. METHODS:
		"Acid-fast stains, fungal stains, standard cultures, tuberculosis cultures, and a"
		VDRL serum test were all obtained. Both upper endoscopy and colonoscopy were
		performed. Chest radiographs were taken and pulmonary consultation was obtained.
		RESULTS: The gastric samples obtained from resection showed no evidence of
		"foreign body reaction. The acid-fast stains, fungal stains, cultures, and VDRL"
		were all negative. Endoscopic exams did not show granulomatous inflammation in
		any other part of the gastrointestinal tract. No pulmonary disease was evident on
		radiographic or pulmonary exam. CONCLUSION: Isolated granulomatous gastritis is a
		diagnosis of exclusion. The findings in this patient do not support a diagnosis
		"of Crohn's disease, tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, syphilis, histoplasmosis,"
		"berylliosis, or foreign-body reaction. This is a unique case suggesting an"
		association between isolated granulomatous gastritis and metaplastic mucosal
		changes.

AB	-	Elastography is a widely used procedure in conventional ultrasonography that has
		recently been incorporated in echoendoscopy. This is an innovative and promising
		technology that aims to increase the negative predictive value of endoscopic
		ultrasonography and fine-needle aspiration punctures. It is useful for directing
		"punctures in suspect areas and, consequently, improves diagnostic performance."
		"This is a non-invasive technique, easy to perform, without additional costs or"
		"complications. The main indications are the analysis of solid pancreatic masses,"
		"lymph nodes, subepithelial lesions, lesions in the left hepatic lobe and in the"
		left adrenal. Negative or inconclusive cases of fine-needle aspiration can be
		submitted to elastography when there is a strong suspicion of malignancy.
		Elastography has a high precision for the differential diagnosis of solid masses
		"and in difficult-to-access anatomic sites, as well as in mediastinal lymph nodes"
		and pancreatic tumors. The procedure is based on the degree of tissue elasticity
		"measurement, with a good correlation between the elasticity index and"
		histopathological features. We report the case of four patients evaluated by
		echoendoscopy and qualitative elastography who had differential diagnoses in
		"mediastinal lymph nodes: sarcoidosis, lymphoma, histoplasmosis and esophageal"
		neoplasia.

TI	-	DRUG-INDUCED ORAL ULCERATIONS: CASE REPORT.
PG	-	334-7
AB	-	A 70-year-old patient was admitted to the Department of Oral Medicine for
		"multiple oral ulcerations on the left buccal mucosa, around 0.5 cm in diameter,"
		"as well as on the gingiva. Otherwise, the patient suffered from chronic"
		"lymphocytic leukemia, hypogammaglobulinemia, chronic renal insufficiency, with"
		"complete afunction of the right kidney, asthma, hypertension, gastritis and"
		prostate hyperplasia. Differential diagnosis of oral ulcerations included drug
		"induced oral ulcerations, paraneoplastic pemphigus, viral ulcerations"
		"(cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex viruses), fungal ulcerations (candidiasis,"
		"aspergillosis, histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis) and bacterial ulcerations, as well"
		as neutropenic ulcers. One of the possible explanations was that the lesions were
		"due to the use of drugs, the more so as oral lesions evolved when the doses of"
		"allopurinol and chlorambucil were increased, and subsided when the doses of both"
		"drugs were decreased. However, we could not establish for sure whether the"
		"lesions were due to allopurinol or chlorambucil. According to literature data,"
		allopurinol is one of the most frequent drugs known to induce skin adverse
		"reactions, therefore we assumed that it was the culprit drug. Unfortunately,"
		"several weeks later the patient died from sepsis, pneumonia with respiratory"
		insufficiency and multiorgan failure.

AB	-	A 12-year-old girl from Zaire with AIDS (CDC: P2 D1) presented with a generalized
		molluscum contagiosum infection. She had suffered from systemic cryptococcosis
		and from cryptosporidiosis several months before admission. While molluscum
		contagiousum infection is usually a self-limiting disease in immunocompetent
		"persons, a fulminant appearance and persistence of giant mollusca occurs with"
		advanced immunodeficiency. Histological and immunohistological examinations
		showed a severe diminution of Langerhans and T cell populations that might
		enhance the dissemination of the infection. Molluscum-like lesions of cryptococci
		"have been described, and cutaneous cryptococcosis is the main condition to be"
		considered in the differential diagnosis. Further differential diagnoses should
		"include American and African histoplasmosis, and the cutaneous manifestations of"
		"mycobacterial infections, of toxoplasmosis and of Pneumocystis carinii infection."

AB	-	Intravitreal anti-VEGF injections are currently the most effective treatment
		option for neovascular age-related macular degeneration. The anti-VEGF treatment
		"of other, more common ocular diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy and vascular"
		"occlusions with neovascularization and retinal edema, is currently described in"
		"numerous studies and cases. Rare neovascular ocular diseases, such as Eales"
		"disease, presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome (POHS), retinopathy of"
		"prematurity, and idiopathic telangiectasia, may be future areas for anti-VEGF"
		therapy. In our case report we describe intravitreal bevacizumab (Avastin)
		therapy for central serous chorioretinopathy and for pseudoxanthoma elasticum
		with angioid streaks and choroidal neovascularization. In both cases the
		intravitreal injection resulted in morphological and functional rehabilitation.

TI	-	Dermoscopy of Mycobacterium marinum Skin infection: A Challenging Diagnosis.
PG	-	278-279
AB	-	"Dear Editor, Mycobacterium (M.) marinum is a slow-growing atypical mycobacterium"
		found mainly in saltwater environments. Infection occurs following inoculation of
		"a skin lesion and manifests as a localized granuloma; in fact, the most common"
		cause of infection with M. marinum is the exposure of traumatized skin to
		"affected aqueous environments (1), and it most commonly involves individuals with"
		occupational and recreational exposure to non-chlorinated water (2). An
		erythematous or bluish 0.5 to 3.0 cm nodule usually develops at the inoculation
		"site, while ulceration can occur later and subsequent lesions may be present"
		along the lymphatic drainage. We present the first case in the literature
		describing the dermatoscopic characteristics of a microbiologically proven
		"Mycobacterium marinum skin infection, although more cases are certainly needed to"
		"identify the main dermatoscopic features of this infection. In January 2019, a"
		66-year-old patient was referred to our Dermatological Clinic reporting the
		"appearance of two purplish nodules about 2 months earlier, located on the back of"
		the hand and on the left thumb (Figure 1) and of erythematous purplish appearance
		"and quite painful to palpation. Based on the clinical presentation, infection"
		"with atypical mycobacteria, botryomycosis, fungal infection (Cryptococcus"
		"neoformans, Histoplasma capsulatum) and infection with Francisella tularensis"
		were considered in the differential diagnosis. The patient was asked if he had an
		aquarium at home and he confirmed this by telling us of his passion for
		"aquariums, which made the diagnosis easier. Dermatoscopic examination performed"
		on the two lesions at the center of the first nodule located on the hand showed a
		whitish area surrounded by an erythematous background with fine scaling and
		dotted vessels and orange-whitish central areas with looped concentric
		"monomorphic vessels (Figure 2, a). However, the thumb lesion had a purplish"
		background with multiple structured rounded areas with orangish appearance
		"surrounded by looped vessels arranged in a crown-like shape (Figure 2, b). It is"
		interesting to note the dermoscopic-histological correlation in this disease: the
		"orangish areas in fact correspond to a granulomatous dermatitis, characterized by"
		inflammatory nodular infiltrate within the dermis (tuberculoid granulomas) (3).
		"Clinically and dermoscopically, the nodules had two different sets of features"
		because they were in different stages of development: the nodule of the thumb was
		"older than the other one on the hand, which the patient reported was of recent"
		"onset, also confirmed by the presence of suppuration and ulceration. Both lesions"
		had orange areas in the context of an erythematous background which led us to
		investigate a granulomatous disease. A deep culture examination and a skin biopsy
		"were thus performed, showing Mycobacterium marinum infection. Oral therapy with"
		clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily for 4 weeks was started and healing occurred in
		about 21 days. We present this case to emphasize the role of dermoscopy in
		differential diagnosis of granulomatous disease and to show dermoscopic clues
		that have not yet been described and that can be used in the future to establish
		"very early diagnosis of this infection, reducing the diagnostic delay."

		Series and Review of the Literature.
PG	-	e24656
LID	-	10.7759/cureus.24656 [doi]
LID	-	e24656
AB	-	The differential diagnosis of retroperitoneal masses includes a variety of benign
		"and malignant conditions, among which infections constitute a significant"
		subgroup. Familiarity with these infectious pseudotumours could facilitate prompt
		"diagnosis. In this report, we describe three patients with an infectious"
		"pseudotumour, which was clinically and radiologically highly suggestive of a"
		neoplasm. The first patient was a 62-year-old woman with a history of Richter
		"syndrome, who seven months after allogeneic haematopoetic stem cell"
		transplantation from an unrelated donor presented with a renal mass. A renal
		biopsy at that time revealed necrotic tissue. The patient displayed multiple
		relapses of Richter syndrome (for which she received also chimeric antigen
		receptor T-cell therapy salvage chemotherapy) and remissions of the lymphoma as
		well as an Aspergillus pneumonia for which she was treated with intravenous
		ambisome and afterwards oral posaconazole. Since the renal mass persisted and to
		"exclude malignancy, nephrectomy was performed which revealed the presence of"
		fungal hyphae. The second patient was a 51-year-old man with a history of a
		"low-grade non-muscle-invasive bladder urothelial carcinoma, who after"
		Mycobacterium bovis Calmette-Guerin instillation presentedwith fever and a
		suspicious renal mass. A partial nephrectomy was performed. Intraoperative frozen
		section analysis and routine histology suggested a Mycobacterium bovis-associated
		"lesion, which was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. The"
		"third patient was an 85-year-old man who presented with loss of appetite,"
		"fatigue, and significant weight loss (24 Kg in less than a year) as well as a"
		travel history. The laboratory tests showed a low sodium and a high potassium
		"level. CT scans revealed a solitary lesion in the right lung, a small liver"
		lesion as well as bilateral adrenal lesions. A CT-guided biopsy revealed the
		"presence of Histoplasma capsulatum, which was confirmed by PCR analysis. A"
		retrospective review of all parameters indicates that all three patients
		"presented with some risk factors, such as immunosuppression, travel, or clinical"
		history that could raise the suspicion of infection in order to be included in
		"the differential diagnosis, thus providing an additional tool for timely"
		diagnosis.

PG	-	722-733
LID	-	10.1007/s12328-022-01640-6 [doi]
AB	-	Granulomas consist of focal collections of immune cells that forms as a result of
		chronic inflammation. They can be formed in different organs and are considered
		the hallmark for several inflammatory and infectious diseases. The presence of
		granulomas in the mucosal biopsies of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of
		"immunocompetent patients, along with histological features of chronicity,"
		"confirms the diagnosis of Crohn's disease (CD) in the majority of cases. However,"
		"owing to their immunocompromised state, new-onset inflammatory bowel disease"
		(IBD) is rare in patients with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). In
		"these patients, diarrhea is often due to the presence of an opportunistic"
		"infection, including bacteria (Salmonella, Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC)),"
		"protozoa (Cryptosporidia, Giardia), viruses (Cytomegalovirus, Herpes simplex"
		virus) or fungi (Histoplasma). Infection by MAC is prevalent in patients with
		"AIDS, but isolated involvement of GI tract by this organism is rare. Positive"
		Acid-Fast Bacillus (AFB) stain and culture on mucosal biopsy usually establish
		the diagnosis. We report an unusual case of isolated MAC colitis that was
		"originally misdiagnosed as CD. The AFB stain and culture were negative,"
		indicating the importance of having a high suspicion for infectious etiologies
		when clinically indicated.

PG	-	88-90
AB	-	We report the first patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in whom
		molluscum contagiosum and Cryptococcus neoformans were documented in the same
		cutaneous lesion. While cases of the co-occurrence of two pathologic entities in
		"patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome have been reported, namely"
		cytomegalovirus with herpes simplex virus and Kaposi's sarcoma with Histoplasma
		"capsulatum, the findings in this patient are unique. The clinical presentation of"
		cutaneous lesions caused by molluscum contagiosum and by Cryptococcus neoformans
		is reviewed. The findings in this case are more remarkable still given the
		often-noted tendency of cutaneous cryptococcosis to masquerade as molluscum
		contagiosum. It may be that the lesions of molluscum contagiosum create a
		favorable environment for cryptococcal dissemination. Examination of a biopsy
		"specimen is crucial to the diagnosis of skin lesions, often atypical or"
		"deceptive, in immunosuppressed patients."

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Patients presenting with lung mass and/or nodules are common problems
		for pulmonologists. The common etiologies for this condition in this area (Ohio
		"River Mississippi Valley area) are malignancy, histoplasmosis, and sarcoidosis."
		"However, there can be other rare causes of this presentation for which a detailed"
		"clinical history, examination, and broad knowledge is needed for diagnosis. CASE"
		REPORT: A 41-year-old woman presented with complaints of progressive
		"nonproductive cough, shortness of breath, and decreased exercise limitation for"
		several months. The symptoms were progressive and were hindering her daily work.
		"Physical examination, including vital signs, was within normal limits. A chest"
		X-ray followed by CT chest was done. CT chest showed a right infrahilar mass
		3.5×2.5 cm along with multiple bilateral lung nodules of size 9 to 11 mm.
		Bronchoscopy with transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) and transbronchial
		biopsy (TBB) and CT-guided biopsy failed to show any diagnosis. Repeat CT scan at
		follow-up showed the same lesion and the patient had an open-lung biopsy. A
		"diagnosis of benign metastasizing leiomyoma (BML) was made based on clinical,"
		"radiological, and histological features, and immunophenotype of the lesion. The"
		patient was started on leuprolide (a GnRH agonist). Follow-up imaging showed
		decrease in size of lesions. The patient is asymptomatic with increased exercise
		"tolerance. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians need to be aware of rare causes of lung mass,"
		like BML. This will help in timely diagnosis and treatment.

AB	-	"Histoplasmosis is a common fungal infection, normally infecting people exposed to"
		demolition sites or bat/bird droppings in the central and eastern states. When a
		child presents with a chest mass and eosinophilia in a non-endemic region the
		likelihood of an infectious process like pulmonary histoplasmosis is unknown. A
		seven year old immunocompetent child with a mediastinal mass and eosinophilia
		"presented with acute cough, fever, non-bloody emesis, and four pound weight loss."
		A neoplastic work up was negative. Further evaluation showed a positive M band
		(chronic histoplasmosis infection) and negative H band (acute infection). Tissue
		obtained by thoracotomy demonstrated necrotizing granulomatous inflammation with
		calcification consistent with histoplasmosis. Patient recovered after completion
		of a twelve week course of itraconazole. A mediastinal mass in a symptomatic
		child has a 50% risk of cancer as the primary diagnosis. The Infectious Disease
		Society of America guidelines recommend treatment of histoplasmosis granulomatous
		disease with itraconazole if symptomatic and surgery only for obstruction. Thus
		our patient did not have a clear indication for surgery. In a child with a
		"mediastinal mass, despite low risk factors should they be evaluated for a fungal"
		infection prior to invasive surgery? This case demonstrates that histoplasmosis
		can cause a granuloma in a non-endemic region and that an infectious etiology
		ought to be considered when working up a symptomatic child with a chest mass as
		it may prevent unnecessary surgery.

		pathogen.
PG	-	346-51
AB	-	The nontuberculous mycobacteria are responsible for considerable morbidity in the
		"immunocompromised and immunocompetent host, especially in the older patient with"
		chronic fibrotic or cavitary disease of the lung. Mycobacterium szulgai is a slow
		growing mycobacterium infrequent in nature and man. Except from a snail and a
		"tropical fish, it has been isolated only from humans and nearly always represents"
		a true pathogen. Three-drug therapy using in vitro susceptibilities as a guide
		for 12 to 18 months increases the likelihood of success. We present a patient who
		developed M szulgai pulmonary infection 30 years after an episode of pulmonary
		"tuberculosis. After successful therapy for his M szulgai infection, this patient"
		developed chronic pulmonary histoplasmosis. We review the 25 years of clinical
		experience with this mycobacteria; particular emphasis is on the presentation and
		treatment of this very unusual infection.

AB	-	Patients with Mendelian Susceptibility to Mycobacterial Diseases (MSMD) exhibit
		variable vulnerability to infections by mycobacteria and other intramacrophagic
		"bacteria (e.g., Salmonella and Klebsiella) and fungi (e.g., Histoplasma, Candida,"
		"Paracoccidioides, Coccidioides, and Cryptococcus). The hallmark of MSMD is the"
		inherited impaired production of interferon gamma (IFN-γ) or the lack of response
		to it. Mutations in the interleukin (IL)-12 receptor subunit beta 1 (IL12RB1)
		"gene accounts for 38% of cases of MSMD. Most IL12RB1 pathogenic allele mutations,"
		"including ten known stop-gain variants, cause IL-12Rβ1 complete deficiency"
		"(immunodeficiency-30, IMD30) by knocking out receptor cell-surface expression."
		"IL12RB1 loss-of-function genotypes impair both IL-12 and IL-23 responses. Here,"
		"we assess the health effects of a rare, novel IL12RB1 stop-gain homozygous"
		genotype with paradoxical IL-12Rβ1 cell-surface expression. We appraise four MSMD
		"children from three unrelated Brazilian kindreds by clinical consultation,"
		"medical records, and genetic and immunologic studies. The clinical spectrum"
		narrowed down to Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine-related suppurative
		"adenitis in all patients with one death, and recrudescence in two,"
		"histoplasmosis, and recurrence in one patient, extraintestinal salmonellosis in"
		"one child, and cutaneous vasculitis in another. In three patients, we established"
		the homozygous Trp7Ter predicted loss-of-function inherited genotype and inferred
		it from the heterozygote parents of the fourth case. The Trp7Ter mutation maps to
		the predicted IL-12Rβ1 N-terminal signal peptide sequence. BCG- or
		phytohemagglutinin-blasts from the three patients have reduced cell-surface
		expression of IL-12Rβ1 with impaired production of IFN-γ and IL-17A. Screening of
		227 unrelated healthy subjects from the same geographic region revealed one
		"heterozygous genotype (allele frequency 0.0022) vs. one in over 841,883 public"
		genome/exomes. We also show that the carriers bear European ancestry-informative
		alleles and share the extended CACCAGTCCGG IL12RB1 haplotype that occurs
		worldwide with a frequency of 8.4%. We conclude that the novel IL12RB1 N-terminal
		signal peptide stop-gain loss-of-function homozygous genotype confers IL-12Rβ1
		deficiency with varying severity and early-onset age through diminished
		cell-surface expression of an impaired IL-12Rβ1 polypeptide. We firmly recommend
		attending to warning signs of IMD30 in children who are HIV-1 negative with a
		history of adverse effects to the BCG vaccine and presenting with recurrent
		Histoplasma spp. and extraintestinal Salmonella spp. infections.

PG	-	137-44
AB	-	Two cases of Addison's disease secondary to active adrenal tuberculosis are
		"reported. Computed tomography showed hypertrophy of the adrenal gland, which was"
		bilateral in one case and unilateral in the other. Repeat computed tomography
		scans during antituberculous chemotherapy demonstrated a progressive change of
		"the adrenals toward atrophy and calcification, while the adrenal function"
		remained impaired. The authors recall that adrenal tuberculosis may be unilateral
		"first, then bilateral, and that the gland is initially hypertrophic before"
		"hormonal deficiency appears; later on, adrenal atrophy and calcification develop."
		Computed tomography seems to be useful in the aetiological diagnosis of Addison's
		"disease. Moreover, it helps in determining whether or not antituberculous therapy"
		"is indicated, which is not always easy to decide in the absence of ""active"""
		"focus. The finding, with or without positive tuberculin skin tests, of an adrenal"
		"hypertrophy unexplainable by any other pathology (e.g. metastasis,"
		"histoplasmosis) should call for antituberculous treatment, especially since it"
		sometimes results in recovery of adrenal function.

AB	-	Fibrosing mediastinitis (FM) is a rare condition characterized by extensive
		proliferation of fibrous tissue in the mediastinum resulting in mass like lesion.
		Histoplasma and Mycobacterium tuberculosis are the common infective causes of
		"fibrosing mediastinitis, but Aspergillus infection is an extremely rare cause."
		Fibrosing mediastinitis due to Aspergillus usually occurs following Aspergillus
		bronchopneumonia. Cardiac involvement due to Aspergillus-related fibrosing
		mediastinitis is extremely rare in immune-competent individuals and occurs
		following some intervention or as a part of disseminated systemic fungal
		"infection. Here, we report two cases of Aspergillus FM with dominant cardiac"
		involvement in immune-competent patients. Both cases presented with large
		mediastinal mass and large vegetation in the left atrium. Autopsy findings showed
		the granulomatous Aspergillus mediastinitis and extension into the heart with
		associated fibrosis. One case was proven to be due to Aspergillus flavus by
		"fungal genomic sequencing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report"
		of Aspergillus FM with pancarditis.

PG	-	261-5
AB	-	"We report the case of a 43 year-old man, smoker, who used to live in Africa,"
		consulting for a chronic ulcer of the mobile tongue. An initial biopsy did not
		show any carcinoma. A second biopsy highlighted an inflammation with numerous
		"tuberculoid granulomas. However, the Ziehl-Neelsen stain was negative."
		Histoplasmosis of the tongue was then suspected as some round structures looking
		like yeasts and stained by the Gomori Grocott method were seen within the
		"cytoplasm of giant cells. However, immunohistochemistry using anti-Histoplasma"
		antibodies was negative. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay performed on
		deparaffinized sections allowed the diagnosis of infection by Mycobacterium
		tuberculosis. A third biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of tuberculosis by showing
		some exceptional acid-fast bacilli. Culture was negative. Tuberculosis of the
		tongue is a very rare condition with different differential diagnosis including
		carcinoma in smoker population or histoplasmosis in endemic area.

TI	-	Submacular neovascular membrane and focal granulomatous inflammation.
PG	-	586-9
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Subretinal choroidal neovascular membranes in persons younger than 55
		years old are commonly idiopathic or associated with the ocular histoplasmosis
		syndrome. There have been a few reports describing the histopathologic features
		of these membranes. Studies have shown that idiopathic membranes have the same
		morphologic features as membranes in age-related macular degeneration except for
		the absence of basal laminar deposits. METHOD: The authors studied a
		clinicopathologic case of a macular lesion associated with two peripheral
		hypopigmented spots in a healthy 30-year-old woman. RESULTS: The clinical and
		fluorescein angiographic findings in this patient were characteristic of
		"submacular neovascular membranes, except that the edge of the lesion remained"
		distinct in the late phase of the fluorescein angiogram. Results of
		histopathologic examination of the surgically excised membrane showed a
		well-circumscribed granuloma containing some eosinophils. Attenuated vascular
		spaces were present within the hard tubercle. Special stains for micro-organisms
		were negative. The patient had no evidence of a systemic inflammatory disease.
		CONCLUSIONS: A visible edge despite intense staining in the late phases of a
		fluorescein angiogram may suggest the possibility of subretinal granulomatous
		inflammation in a lesion that otherwise appears like a neovascular membrane. The
		clinical distinction between this pattern of subretinal neovascularization and a
		typical idiopathic membrane may be important because subretinal granulomatous
		inflammation could respond to treatment with systemic corticosteroids.

AB	-	Talaromycosis is a rare deep fungal infection caused by Talaromyces marneffei.
		"Currently, methamphetamine has become the second-largest drug abuse category in"
		the world after cannabis and has become a serious public health problem.
		Methamphetamine can inhibit human immune system and increase the probability of
		"pathogenic microorganism infection. On 8 October 2016, a 20-year-old man with a"
		fever history of 2 months was admitted to our hospital. He had bloody stools and
		abdominal pain during hospitalization. There was no significant abnormality in
		"physical examination. Because of the misdiagnosis, he underwent improper"
		treatment. Periodic acid-Schiff stain (PAS) staining showed that the mucosa of
		"distal ileum, ascending colon, transverse colon, and sigmoid colon were"
		"infiltrated by a large number of tissue cells, which contained a large number of"
		"blue purple particles. In addition, a large number of histiocytes and"
		"multinucleated giant cells can be seen in the lamina propria of ileum mucosa, and"
		"fungal spores can be seen in histiocytes. Finally, he was diagnosed as"
		"talaromycosis and took itraconazole 0.2 g twice a day. After 5 days, the"
		"temperature dropped to normal and the inflammation disappeared, and he continued"
		to take itraconazole for 6 months. Due to the neglect of the history of drug
		"abuse and the concealment, drug-related talaromycosis is often misdiagnosed."
		Pathological examination is warranted for diagnosis talaromycosis. This condition
		requires a long-term anti-fungal therapy.

TI	-	[Diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis in a patient with AIDS].
PG	-	485-97
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: A patient with a leishmaniasis-Aids co-infection was presented and
		"discussed.. METHODS AND RESULTS: A 29-year -old soldier, coming from the Province"
		"of San José del Guaviare, Colombia, complained of a weight loss of 18 kgs in the"
		previous ten months as well as a two-month-old cutaneous leision. Elisa and
		Western blot tests were positive for HIV infection. LT CD4 were 92/mm3. He had a
		"generalized erythematous, psoriasiform dermal lesion, which, upon biopsy,"
		revealed an abundance of phagocytosed microorganisms that stained black with
		Gomory's technique. Disseminated histoplasmosis was diagnosed. The patient
		"received anti-retroviral therapy and itraconazole, without regression of the"
		lesions. Amphotericin B was beneficial but the lesions recurred several months
		"later, more numerous, nodular and with occurrence in the oral mucosa. Nine months"
		after the initial diagnosis additional skin biopsies and review of the previous
		biopsies established that the patient had diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis. The
		leishmania parasite did not grow in culture. Miltefosine produced marked
		"improvement, but the lesions recurred and were cured finally with 52 Glucantime"
		"injections administered for two months. Presently, the patient remains in good"
		condition 21 months after diagnosis of leishmaniasis. CONCLUSIONS: Diffuse
		cutaneous leishmaniasis may be a common clinical manifestation when leishmaniasis
		and AIDS co-occur. Its treatment is difficult and must include an antiparasitic
		"drug as well as prophylactic, and anti-retroviral therapy. Leishmania amastigotes"
		typically are not Gomory-positive and can be differentiated from Histoplasma by
		"morphology, immunohistochemistry, culture, antibody-specific response and PCR."
		The leishmaniasis-AIDS co-infection enhances invasive capacity for both causal
		"microorganisms. Increasing case numbers can be expected in Colombia, due to the"
		high frequency of both diseases.

AB	-	"OBJECTIVES: To elucidate the etiology, pathohistology, clinical characteristic"
		"and differential diagnosis, reduce missed diagnosis and improve the early"
		"detection and treatment of Penicillium Marneffei infection, by means of this case"
		report and literature review. METHODS: A patient hospitalized Penicillium
		"Marneffei infection were presented here, together with 27 cases in the"
		"literature, among which 10 patients had complications of AIDS and 5 with other"
		"diseases. RESULTS: Penicillium Marneffei is a temperature-sensitive, two-phase"
		"fungus, which can infect healthy and immunocompromised subjects. The common"
		symptoms are lymphadenopathy and infection of the lung. The infection may be
		"local or diffuse, involving the intestinal tract, soft tissue, bone, liver,"
		"spleen and bone marrow etc. The lesion can be classified into the granuloma type,"
		suppurative type and anergy/necrosis type histologically. The yeast-like fungus
		"were mainly found in the cytoplasm of macrophages, which were demonstrated by PAS"
		and Giemsa staining. The wine red color developed on the culture confirms the
		diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of Penicillium Marneffei infection should
		"be considered when tuberculosis is suspected but not confirmed, and if the"
		"patient has a history of having lived or traveled in Southeast Asia, is anemic or"
		resistant to anti-tuberculosis treatment. The major differential diagnosis is
		histoplasmosis. Early administration of anti-fungus drugs is essential for
		recovery.

		"department of our hospital with a 2-month history of dysarthria, progressively"
		"worsening vertigo, and difficulty walking. A diagnosis of retinitis pigementosa"
		was made in this patient's childhood. He did not have any history of congenital
		"syphilis. He did not have a history of nausea or vomiting, fever, weight loss,"
		"headache, photophobia, seizure, extremity weakness, or sensory disturbance."
		"Physical examination revealed dysarthria, dysmetria, and ataxia. Kernig and"
		"Brudzinski signs were absent, and pathergy test results were negative. Laboratory"
		evaluation revealed normal complete and differential blood counts and normal
		"serum chemistry, including a normal serum angiotensin-converting enzyme level."
		"Analysis of his serum was negative for antinuclear antibody (or ANA), cytoplasmic"
		"antineutrophil cvtoplasmic antibody (or cANCA), Sjögren syndrome antigens A and B"
		"(SS-A and SS-B, respectively), antitissue transglutaminase and antiendomysial"
		"antibodies, and paraneoplastic profile. Serum analysis was also negative for"
		"human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and type 2 RNA, Venereal Disease Research"
		"Laboratory (VDRL) test, rapid plasma regain (RPR), and fluorescent treponemal"
		"antibody absorption. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed clear fluid, a"
		"normal glucose level (64 mg/dL [3.6 mmol/L]; normal range, 40-70 mg/dL [2.2-3.9"
		"mmol/L]), an elevated protein level (97 mg/dL; normal range, 12-60 mg/dL), and an"
		elevated white blood cell count (7/mm(3) [0.007 ×10(9)/L] in tube 1 and 17/mm(3)
		[0.017 × 10(9)/L] in tube 2) with 84% lymphocytes. CSF immunoglobulin G level was
		"elevated (30.1 mg/dL; normal, <5.9 mg/dL); however, there were no oligoclonal"
		"bands. Gram staining, acid-fast staining, and lactic acid, cryptococcal antigen,"
		"histoplasma antigen, herpes simplex virus polymerase chain reaction, VDRL, and"
		"RPR test results for CSF were negative. CSF did not grow any bacteria, fungus, or"
		acid-fast bacillus at culture. CSF flow cytometry did not reveal a monoclonal
		lymphoid population. Initial imaging included brain magnetic resonance (MR)
		"imaging. Computed tomography (CT) images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were"
		normal (not shown). The patient's clinical symptoms and imaging findings
		"responded to treatment with a high dose of oral steroids. However, the patient's"
		symptoms exhibited clinical and radiologic progression after several attempts to
		taper the steroid dose.

AB	-	The aim is to review the encephalitis in infants and adolescents as well as its
		"etiology, clinical manifestation, epidemiology, physiopathology, diagnostic"
		"methods and treatment, and the neuropsyquiatric signs appearing an influenza"
		epidemy. Encephalitis is an inflammation of the central nervous system (CNS)
		"which involves the brain. The clinical manifestations usually are: headache,"
		"fever and confusional stage. It could also be manifested as seizures, personality"
		"changes, or psiqyiatric symptoms. The clinical manifestations are related to the"
		virus and the cell type affected in the brain. A meningitis or encephalopathy
		"need to be ruled out. It could be present as an epidemic or isolated form, beeing"
		this the most frequent form. It could be produced by a great variety of
		"infections agents including virus, bacterias, fungal and parasitic. Viral causes"
		"are herpesvirus, arbovirus, rabies and enterovirus. Bacterias such as Borrelia"
		"burgdorferi, Rickettsia and Mycoplasma neumoniae. Some fungal causes are:"
		Coccidioides immitis and Histoplasma capsulatum. More than 100 agents are related
		to encephalitis. The diagnosis of encephalitis is a challenge for the clinician
		and its infectious etiology is clear in only 40 to 70% of all cases. The
		diagnosis of encephalitis can be established with absolute certainty only by the
		microscopic examination of brain tissue. Epidemiology is related to age of the
		"patients, geographic area, season, weather or the host immune system. Early"
		intervention can reduce the mortality rate and sequels. We describe four patients
		with encephalitis and neuropsychiatric symptoms during an influenza epidemic.

TI	-	Dermoscopic Features of Giant Molluscum Contagiosum in a Patient with Acquired
		Immunodeficiency Syndrome.
PG	-	233-235
AB	-	Giant molluscum contagiosum (MC) is a peculiar variant of the disease with the
		presence of multiple or single lesions larger than 5 mm. In contrast to typical
		"molluscum contagiosum, dermoscopic features of giant lesions have been poorly"
		"described, and none of the reports included multiple giant lesions in an"
		immunocompromised patient. We present a patient with acquired immunodeficiency
		syndrome diagnosed with multiple giant molluscum contagiosum along with the
		dermoscopic features of this entity. We examined a 40-year-old patient who had
		been diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) two months earlier.
		The disease defining AIDS was cerebral toxoplasmosis (initially presenting as a
		brain tumor several months earlier). Laboratory investigation showed a decreased
		CD4 cell count of 11 cells/mm3 and HIV viral load of 252 472 copies/mL. The
		patient was referred to the Department of Dermatology due to multiple
		"flesh-colored, asymptomatic nodules with superficial telangiectasia that had been"
		"observed on the face for several weeks (Figure 1, a). Dermoscopy of larger (>5"
		mm) skin lesions showed yellowish globules of different size and random
		"distribution, separated by smaller, oval-shape white globules and polymorphic"
		"vessels (Figure 1, b-d). Dermoscopy of smaller skin lesions showed the presence"
		of a central yellow globule and white structureless area with irregular linear
		"vessels of radial arrangement at the periphery (Figure 1, e). Histopathological"
		examination confirmed the diagnosis of molluscum contagiosum (MC); special
		"staining showed the details of the lesion (Figure 2, a-c). Antiretroviral therapy"
		with Triumeq® (dolutegravir + abacavir + lamivudine) was initiated. After
		"discussing MC treatment options with the patient, we decided to delay the"
		treatment and wait for the effect of antiretroviral therapy. Partial regression
		of MC lesions was observed after 5 months; laboratory investigations showed a CD4
		cell count of 99 cells/mm3 and a HIV viral load of 56 copies/mL. Along with
		"continuation of antiretroviral therapy, the patient received treatment with"
		"topical imiquimod (Aldara®) for 12 weeks. Subsequently, a few lesions resistant"
		to previous treatment were treated with cryosurgery and the patient was
		instructed to apply imiquimod only to new-onset/regrowing lesions. Clinical
		evaluation after 2 months revealed a good clinical and aesthetic effect (Figure
		3). MC is a viral disease caused by a DNA virus of the Poxviridae family (MCV-1
		or MCV-2). The infection most commonly affects children and sexually active
		"adults, and may be diagnosed based on physical examination in the majority of"
		"cases. Typical clinical presentation includes single to multiple, 2-5 mm,"
		"flesh-colored, asymptomatic nodules with central umbilication. Dermoscopy is a"
		"non-invasive diagnostic method that allows skin examination with magnification,"
		therefore improving the accuracy of dermatological diagnosis. It was primarily
		"developed to detect melanoma, but in recent years the role of this method in"
		general dermatology has been constantly increasing. There have been several
		published reports that demonstrated the utility of dermoscopy in the diagnosis of
		MC. Most commonly observed structures include a central orifice and blood vessels
		"arranged in punctiform, radial or mixed flower pattern (1). Giant molluscum"
		"contagiosum is an atypical variant of the disease, with the presence of multiple"
		or single lesions larger than 5 mm (2). The diagnosis of giant MC usually
		indicates immunodeficiency and has been mainly described in HIV-positive
		"patients, but also in coexistence with leukemia, sarcoidosis, Wiskott-Aldrich"
		"syndrome, selective immunoglobulin M deficiency, atopic dermatitis, and after"
		"splenectomy, bone marrow transplantation, and during immunosuppressive therapy"
		"(3). Giant MC may mimic other benign or malignant dermatoses, and the final"
		diagnosis is usually based on histopathological examination. The list of
		"differential diagnoses is long and includes basal cell carcinoma,"
		"keratoacanthoma, viral wart, varicella, intradermal nevi, pyogenic granuloma,"
		"lichen planus, atypical mycobacterial infection, pneumocystosis, cutaneous"
		"cryptococcosis, and histoplasmosis (3). In contrast to typical MC, dermoscopic"
		"features of giant MC have been poorly described, and none of the reports included"
		multiple lesions in immunocompromised patient. Mun et al. described a pattern of
		multiple shiny white clods in giant MC observed in a 2-year-old girl in the
		perianal area (4). A different dermoscopic image - with prominent arborizing
		vessels and polylobular white structureless areas - was reported by Uzuncakmak et
		"al., who described giant MC on the eyelid in a 25-year-old woman (2). Similar"
		dermoscopic features of atypical MC (5 mm in size) were described by Zaballos et.
		al. (5). The course and treatment of MC differ in immunocompetent and in
		immunocompromised individuals. While the infection is usually mild and
		"self-limiting in the former group, in the latter it may be extensive,"
		"symptomatic, and resistant to therapy. Treatment methods commonly applied in"
		"immunocompetent patients such as cryotherapy, curettage, and electrocautery are"
		not generally recommended in patients with severe immunodeficiency as they pose a
		"risk of secondary infection or autoinoculation (6). Additionally, such treatment"
		of multiple lesions is connected with pain and higher risk of postinflammatory
		"changes/scarring (7). According to the literature, treatment with local"
		"immunomodulators - including imiquimod cream, interferon-a (IFN-a) injections and"
		cidofovir - appears to be effective (6). Topical 5% imiquimod was most commonly
		"used, and although not licensed for this indication it was shown to be effective"
		"in HIV-positive individuals, including treatment of giant MC lesions (7)."
		"Regardless of the topical treatment, previous reports documented a correlation"
		"between immunity status and the extension of MC lesions. Therefore, effective"
		"antiretroviral therapy may itself lead to resolution of MC [8]. To sum up, the"
		presented report introduced additional observations into the dermoscopic spectrum
		of giant MC. The observed dermoscopically large yellowish globules seem to
		correspond with the crypts and the surrounding white structures with the areas of
		"lobulated, endophytic epidermal hyperplasia. The presence of vascular structures"
		in dermoscopy corresponds with the blood vessels tightly surrounding inverted
		"hyperplastic epidermal lobules (Figure 2, b). Dermoscopic features od giant MC"
		"are different than those observed in small lesions. Interestingly, the"
		dermoscopic appearance of smaller lesions observed in our patient seemed to be
		similar to MC eruptions described in immunocompetent patients (1). In case of
		"clinical suspicion giant MC coexisting with smaller lesions, dermoscopic"
		assessment of the latter may serve as a clue to diagnosis.
