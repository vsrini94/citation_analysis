AB	-	BACKGROUND: The oral mucosa is likely to be compromised by acquired systemic
		disease. There are no data available on the prevalence of oral candidiasis and
		"the species distribution among patients with oral mucosal diseases. Therefore, it"
		is necessary to conduct a study assessing the characterization of oral
		candidiasis and the species profiles in such patients. METHODS: Over a period of
		"four consecutive years, patients with oral mucosal diseases were screened for"
		oral candidiasis by a combination of clinical presentation and laboratory
		"findings (smear test and Candida cultures). In addition, Candida species were"
		"isolated and identified for further analysis. RESULTS: In total, 9769 (6.09%) of"
		"the 160,357 patients screened were diagnosed with oral candidiasis on the basis"
		of both clinical manifestations and laboratory testing. The ratio of females to
		"males was 1:0.61, and females had higher overall infection rates than males in"
		"all age subgroups. Patients with HIV infection, anaemia-related stomatitis,"
		"Sjögren's syndrome/xerostomia, pemphigoid, and radiation-induced stomatitis were"
		"highly susceptible to oral candidiasis. Of the 11,161 isolated Candida strains,"
		"C. albicans remained the most common species (75.37%), followed by C. tropicalis"
		"(6.06%), C. krusei (2.79%), and C. glabrata (2.02%). Surprisingly, both the"
		proportion and the number of C. glabrata isolates increased dramatically over the
		"4 consecutive years. CONCLUSIONS: In this large-scale population-based study, the"
		features of oral candidiasis prevalence and the species profile among patients
		with oral mucosal diseases were summarized. The information gleaned will enhance
		the understanding of and improve management strategies for oral candidiasis and
		the underlying systemic and oral conditions.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: The goal of the study was to measure the prevalence of Candida spp. in
		the oral cavity of patients with diabetes types 1 and 2 when compared to healthy
		individuals and to study antifungal resistance profile of the isolates. DESIGN:
		There were 162 subjects in the study: diabetes type 1 (n=39); control group 1
		"(n=50): healthy individuals matched in gender, age, and oral conditions to"
		diabetes type 1 patients; diabetes type 2 (n=37); control group 2 (n=36) who were
		matched to each patient of the diabetes type 2 group. Stimulated saliva was
		collected and isolates were identified with phenotypic tests. The presence of C.
		dubliniensis was determined by multiplex PCR. RESULTS: There were no
		statistically significant differences in Candida spp. frequency between the
		diabetes 1 group and its control (p=0.443) nor between the diabetes 2 group and
		its control (p=0.429). C. albicans was the most frequently isolated yeast in all
		"groups. In the diabetes groups, C. stellatoidea, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis,"
		"C. lipolytica, C. glabrata, and C. krusei were also identified. Additionally, in"
		"control groups, C. kefyr was also detected. None of the isolates were resistant"
		to amphotericin B and flucytosine. A low percentage of the isolates were
		resistant to ketoconazole. CONCLUSIONS: No differences were detected in
		colonization of Candida spp. oral isolates from type 1 and type 2 diabetes when
		compared to matched controls. The antifungal resistance of Candida spp. isolates
		for ketoconazole from type 1 diabetes patients was significantly higher than that
		of its matched control.

AB	-	Vaginal candidiasis (VC) continues to be a health problem to women worldwide.
		"Although the majority of VC cases are caused by Candida albicans (C. albicans),"
		non-albicans Candida spp. like C. glabrata and C. tropicalis are emerging as
		important and potentially resistant opportunistic agents of VC. The objective of
		this study was to evaluate the prevalence and epidemiology of VC in the UAE
		through retrospective analysis of pertinent data compiled by the microbiology and
		"infection control unit at Latifa Hospital, Dubai between 2005 and 2011. The"
		incidence of VC significantly increased from 10.76% in 2005 to 17.61% in 2011;
		"average prevalence was 13.88%. C. albicans occurred at a frequency of 83.02%, C."
		glabrata at 16.5% and C. tropicalis at 1.2%. A single C. dubliniensis isolate was
		identified in the sample population. The percentage of C. albicans significantly
		decreased from 83.02% in the sample population as a whole to 60.8% in subjects
		"over 45 years of age (P < 0.01) and that of C. glabrata, C. tropicalis and C."
		"krusei significantly increased from 13.88%, 0.9% and 0.03% to 29.7%, 6.7% and"
		1.4% (P < 0.05) respectively. The incidence of VC in the UAE is on the rise and
		the frequency of non-albicans Candida spp. is noticeably increasing especially in
		postmenopausal women.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is the second most common infection of
		the genital tract affecting millions of women worldwide. Data concerning the
		distribution and antifungal resistance of Candida species responsible of VVC vary
		among countries and population studied. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this work was to
		"determine the prevalence, species distribution and antifungal susceptibility"
		patterns of Candida species among symptomatic women over a 20-year period.
		"METHODS: A total of 5,820 unique samples were retrospectively identified. Out of"
		"them, 1,046 (18%) were diagnosed with VVC. RESULTS: Women between 18 and 30 years"
		had the highest prevalence rate of VVC (21%). Women aged less than 18 years and
		greater than 51 years had the highest prevalence rates of vaginal bacterial
		infections. Thirty-five (3.3%) women presented recurrent VVC. The most common
		"yeast isolated was C. albicans, followed by C. glabrata, C. krusei, and C."
		parapsilosis. Non-Candida albicans species (NAC) were more significantly isolated
		"among women aged 51 or above, than in women included in other groups (p < 0.01)."
		Resistance to fluconazole and amphotericin B was infrequent in C. albicans
		strains. Resistance to fluconazole and amphotericin B was infrequent in C.
		albicans strains. NAC species presented higher resistance rates against
		fluconazole (30%) and voriconazole (25%). C. krusei and C. glabrata isolates
		showed lower MICs than most of the strains against amphotericin B (1 mg/L) and
		flucytosine (1 mg/L). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated that continued
		surveillance on Candida species distribution and non-susceptibility rates to
		antifungals should be routinely reported to help the selection of the most
		"appropriate drug, to avoid the emergence of resistant strains, and to improve the"
		patient's outcomes.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Pregnant women are more susceptible to vaginal colonization and
		infection by yeast. The role of Candida colonization in the occurrence of preterm
		birth is well established. The knowledge of local epidemiology and identification
		of risk factors for preterm birth is important for the prevention and management
		strategies. The purpose of the study was to determine the prevalence of
		Candida sp. in vaginal swabs of pregnant women. METHODS: Pregnant women attending
		routine antenatal visits in three primary health centres in Bobo-Dioulasso
		(Burkina Faso) were enrolled into a cross-sectional study carried out from
		February to April 2015. Vaginal swabs samples were taken from participants after
		obtaining oral consent. The swabs were inoculated into Sabouraud's glucose agar
		supplemented with chloramphenicol and incubated at 37°C for 24 to 48hours under
		aerobic conditions in order to perform fungal culture. The identification of the
		Candida species was done by culture on HiCrome Candida Differential Agar at 35°C
		for 48h for production of species-specific colors. RESULTS: A total of
		229 pregnant women were included. The prevalence of vulvovaginal candidiasis
		"(VVC) was 22.71%, (95% CI [17.45-28.69]). Candida albicans accounted for 40.39%"
		"and non-Candida albicans species for 59.61% of the isolates, with mainly"
		"C. glabrata (32.69%), C. tropicalis (15.38%) and C. krusei (11.54%). CONCLUSIONS:"
		This study revealed a high prevalence of non-C. albicans species. The syndromic
		management guidelines for VVC in Burkina Faso will be revised to include a
		specific protocol for pregnant women.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candida species are the most common cause of systemic fungal
		infections in children. Risk factors for candidemia vary in different patient
		"populations, posing challenges for clinical prediction of infection. We describe"
		the epidemiology and clinical disease of candidemia in children admitted to a
		tertiary pediatric hospital. METHODS: Retrospective audit of children ≤18 years
		of age with candidemia at a tertiary pediatric hospital over a 16-year period.
		RESULTS: There were 139 episodes of candidemia in 124 children. A central venous
		"catheter was present in 94% of episodes, prior antibiotic exposure in 86% and"
		"parenteral nutrition in 43%. During the study period, the proportion of"
		candidemia due to non-albicans Candida spp. increased primarily due to a rise in
		C. krusei. Colonization with Candida spp. in the 30 days before developing
		candidemia was identified in 40% of episodes and the species was concordant in
		"60%. Infection at other sites was rare, including pulmonary dissemination (9/38,"
		"24%), renal fungal disease (9/114, 8%), fungal endophthalmitis (8/102, 8%) and"
		"hepatosplenic nodules (5/92, 5%). Overall, 8/127 (6%) isolates were"
		fluconazole-resistant (7 C. krusei and 1 C. glabrata) and 7/127 (6%) had
		intermediate susceptibility to fluconazole. The overall 30-day mortality was 12%
		and significant risk factors for mortality on multivariate analysis were male
		"sex, liver disease and mucositis. CONCLUSIONS: Our study outlines low rates of"
		disseminated candidiasis and low mortality associated with candidemia at our
		"institution. Additionally, it suggests that prior colonization may be an"
		"important risk factor, however, this should be validated in large prospective"
		controlled studies.

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To investigate the risk factors and outcomes associated with Candida
		krusei bloodstream. METHODS: We performed a case control study of patients with
		C. krusei bloodstream infection at the University of Pennsylvania from 1982 to
		"2010. Controls were without candidemia, and matched to cases on duration of"
		hospitalization and underlying disease. RESULTS: We enrolled 34 cases and 114
		matched controls. Most subjects (62%) had hematologic malignancies. In the
		"multivariate model, including a priori the duration of fluconazole use (OR 1.06;"
		"95% CI 1.00, 1.11) and days of neutropenia (OR 1.01; 95% CI 0.98, 1.13), risk"
		factors associated with C. krusei bloodstream infection were splenectomy (OR
		"11.66; 95% CI 1.04, 130.64), and exposure to antimicrobials with anaerobic"
		"activity (OR 5.74; 95% CI 1.76, 18.67). Outcomes of infected patients were poor."
		"Only 32% of case patients survived to hospital discharge, compared to 89% of"
		controls. For 48% death was attributed to C. krusei infection. CONCLUSIONS: C.
		krusei bloodstream infection occurs most commonly in neutropenic patients with
		hematologic malignancy. The association with prior fluconazole exposure is less
		marked than previously described. Splenectomy and the receipt of antimicrobials
		with anaerobic activity are significant risk factors. The outcome of infected
		"patients remains poor, despite appropriate antifungal therapy."

PG	-	104
LID	-	10.1186/s13756-022-01143-6 [doi]

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Vaginal discharge syndrome (VDS) is a common condition. Clinical
		management targets sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and bacterial vaginosis
		(BV); there is limited focus on Candida infection as cause of VDS. Lack of
		"Candida treatment coverage and, if present, antifungal resistance may result in"
		VDS treatment failure. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of Candida
		"infection, antifungal resistance, and coinfections in Namibian women with VDS."
		METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed using 253 vaginal swabs from women
		"with VDS in Namibia. Demographic data was collected, and phenotypic and molecular"
		detection of Candida species was performed followed by fluconazole susceptibility
		testing of Candida isolates. BV was diagnosed using Nugent score microscopy;
		"molecular detection of Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and"
		Trichomonas vaginalis was performed. RESULTS: Candida species was detected in
		110/253 women (43%). Ninety women (36%) had Candida albicans and 24 (9.5%) had
		non-albicans Candida species. The non-albicans species detected were 19 (17%)
		"Candida glabrata, 4.0 (3.5%) Candida krusei, and 1.0 (0.9%) Candida parapsilosis."
		Candida albicans were more frequently isolated in younger (p = 0.004) and
		pregnant women (p = 0.04) compared to non-albicans Candida species. Almost all
		(98%) Candida albicans isolates were susceptible to fluconazole while all
		non-albicans Candida species were fluconazole resistant. STIs were diagnosed in
		"92 women (36%): 30 (12%) with C. trachomatis, 11 (4.3%) N. gonorrhoeae, and 70"
		(28%) T. vaginalis; 98 (39%) women had BV. Candida infection alone was diagnosed
		"in 30 women (12%), combined with STIs in 42 women (17%) and was concurrent with"
		BV in 38 women (15%). Candida infection was more often detected in swabs from
		"women without C. trachomatis detected (6.4% vs. 16%; OR 0.30; 95% CI 0.10-0.77,"
		"p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of Candida infection, especially"
		"those due to non-albicans Candida species that are resistant to fluconazole, is a"
		great concern in our setting and may lead to poor treatment outcomes. Access to
		microbiological testing for Candida species in the context of syndromic
		management is warranted.

PG	-	e954-66
LID	-	10.1016/j.ijid.2010.04.006 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candidemia is among the leading causes of nosocomial bloodstream
		infections and is associated with significant mortality. Several centers have
		published data regarding the incidence and relative frequency of Candida spp.
		OBJECTIVE: We performed a systematic review to summarize and evaluate the
		available evidence regarding the distribution of the relative frequency of
		"Candida spp isolated from blood, according to geographic region and study design,"
		during the period 1996 to 2009. METHODS: We searched PubMed and Scopus and
		retrieved 81 relevant articles reporting data on the relative frequency of
		Candida spp. RESULTS: C. albicans was the predominant species in almost all
		studies. The highest proportion of C. albicans was found in North and Central
		"Europe and the USA. Non-albicans species were more common in South America, Asia,"
		and South Europe. C. glabrata was commonly isolated in the USA and North and
		"Central Europe; C. parapsilosis in South America, South Europe, and several parts"
		of Asia; and C. tropicalis in South America and Asia. The relative frequency of
		C. krusei was low in all regions. Significant differences were noted depending on
		"study design (surveillance study, multicenter or single centre, prospective or"
		retrospective) and setting (hospital or intensive care unit). CONCLUSIONS:
		Significant geographic variation is evident among cases of candidemia in
		different parts of the world. Local epidemiological data continue to be of major
		significance.

		bacterial mediastinitis: a case-matched comparative study.
PG	-	523-530
LID	-	10.1093/ejcts/ezab437 [doi]
AB	-	"OBJECTIVES: Postoperative mediastinitis, a feared complication after cardiac"
		"surgery, is associated with high mortality, especially of critically ill"
		"patients. Candida species infections are rare and severe, with poorly known"
		"outcomes. We conducted a case-control study to describe the characteristics,"
		management and outcomes of patients with postoperative Candida mediastinitis.
		"METHODS: This French, monocentre, retrospective study included all patients with"
		postoperative Candida mediastinitis (January 2003-February 2020) requiring
		intensive care unit admission. Candida mediastinitis patients (henceforth cases)
		"were matched 1:1 with postoperative bacterial mediastinitis (henceforth control),"
		"based on 3 factors during mediastinitis management: age >40 years, cardiac"
		transplantation and invasive circulatory device used. The primary end point was
		the probability of survival within 1 year after intensive care unit (ICU)
		admission. RESULTS: Forty cases were matched to 40 controls. The global
		"male/female ratio was 2.1, with mean age at admission 47.9 ± 13.8 years. Candida"
		"species were: 67.5% albicans, 17.5% glabrata, 15% parapsilosis, 5.0% tropicalis,"
		2.5% krusei and 2.5% lusitaniae. The median duration of mechanical ventilation
		"was 23, 68.8% of patients received renal replacement therapy and 62.5%"
		extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. The probability of survival within
		the first year after ICU admission was 40 ± 5.5% and was significantly lower for
		"cases than for controls (43 ± 8% vs 80 ± 6.3%, respectively; Log-rank test: P <"
		0.0001). The multivariable Cox proportional hazards model retained only renal
		"replacement therapy [hazard ratio (HR) 3.7, 95% confidence interval (CI)"
		"1.1-13.1; P = 0.04] and Candida mediastinitis (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.1-5.6; P = 0.04)"
		as independently associated with 1-year mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Candida
		mediastinitis is a serious event after cardiac surgery and independently
		associated with 1-year mortality. Further studies are needed to determine whether
		deaths are directly attributable to Candida mediastinitis.

TI	-	Candidemia in major burns patients.
PG	-	391-8
LID	-	10.1111/myc.12488 [doi]
AB	-	Major burn patients have characteristics that make them especially susceptible to
		"candidemia, but few studies focused on this have been published. The objectives"
		"were to evaluate the epidemiological, microbiological and clinical aspects of"
		"candidemia in major burn patients, determining factors associated with a poorer"
		prognosis and mortality. We conducted a retrospective observational study of
		candidemia between 1996 and 2012 in major burn patients admitted to the La Fe
		"University Hospital, Valencia, Spain. The study included 36 episodes of"
		"candidemia in the same number of patients, 55.6% men, mean age 37.33 years and"
		low associated comorbidity. The incidence of candidemia varied between 0.26 and
		6.09 episodes/1000 days stay in the different years studied. Candida albicans was
		the most common species (61.1%) followed by Candida parapsilosis (27.8%).
		"Candidemia by C. krusei, C. glabrata or C. tropicalis were all identified after"
		2004. Central vascular catheter (CVC) was established as a potential source of
		"candidemia in 36.1%, followed by skin and soft tissues of thermal injury (22.2%)"
		and urinary tract (8.3%). Fluconazole was used in 19 patients (52.7%) and its in
		"vitro resistance rate was 13.9%. The overall mortality was 47.2%, and mortality"
		related to candidemia was 30.6%. Factors associated with increased mortality were
		those related to severe infection and shock. CVC was the most usual focus of
		candidemia. Fluconazole was the most common antifungal drug administered. The
		management of candidemia in major burn patients is still a challenge.

TI	-	Prolonged Outbreak of Candida krusei Candidemia in Paediatric Ward of Tertiary
		Care Hospital.
PG	-	257-268
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-020-00427-y [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: A sudden rise of Candida krusei candidemia cases was noticed in our
		hospital within 1 year with maximum cases from paediatric unit. The present study
		reports the results of epidemiological investigation of possible outbreak of
		candidemia by C. krusei in paediatric unit at our tertiary care centre. METHODS:
		Clinical characteristics and risk factors associated with C. krusei candidemia
		were evaluated. Yeast identification and antifungal susceptibility testing was
		performed according to standard protocol. To find the potential source of C.
		"krusei in hospital environment and hand colonization, swabs were collected from"
		"different fomites (n = 40) and hand washings from 24 health care workers (HCW),"
		respectively. Infection control and prevention practices were intensified
		following the recognition of outbreak. Genetic typing was done by fluorescent
		amplified fragment length polymorphism (FAFLP) technique. Case-control comparison
		was performed with C. tropicalis and C. pelliculosa cases. RESULTS: Candida
		"krusei fungaemia significantly affected paediatric group (82/186, 44%) as"
		"compared to adults (14/130, 10.8%; p < 0.001). Among paediatric group, maximum"
		isolation was reported from neonatal unit of paediatric emergency (NUPE). C.
		krusei was isolated from hands of one HCW and washbasin in NUPE. FAFLP revealed
		clonality between blood and environmental isolates indicating cross-transmission
		"of C. krusei. Gastrointestinal disease (p = 0.018), previous antibiotics"
		"(p = 0.021) especially to carbapenems (p = 0.039), was significant among C."
		krusei candidemia cases compared to C. pelliculosa cases. CONCLUSION: We report
		the largest outbreak of C. krusei candidemia in paediatric unit within 1 year
		with isolation of related strains from environment and hands of HCW. Routine
		screening of hand hygiene practices revealed non-compliance to standard practices
		leading to the increase in C. krusei candidemia cases.

TI	-	Vulvovaginal candidiasis: species distribution of Candida and their antifungal
		susceptibility pattern.
PG	-	94

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Vulvovaginal candidiasis is a global issue of concern due to its
		"association with economic costs, sexually transmitted infections, and ascending"
		genital tract infection. The aim of this study was to determine species
		distribution and antifungal susceptibility pattern of Candida species causing
		vulvovaginal candidiasis. METHODS: A cross sectional study was conducted from
		November 2015 to December 2016 at the Family Guidance Association of Ethiopia.
		Vaginal swabs collected from study subjects that were clinically diagnosed with
		vulvovaginal candidiasis were cultured. Yeast identification and antifungal
		susceptibility testing were determined by the automated VITEK 2 compact system.
		The association of vulvovaginal candidiasis with possible risk factors was
		assessed and analyzed using SPSS version 20. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of
		vulvovaginal candidiasis was 41.4%. The association of vulvovaginal candidiasis
		"was statistically significant with previous genital tract infection (p = 0.004),"
		"number of life-time male sex partners (p = .037), and number of male sex partners"
		"in 12 month (p = 0.001). Of 87 Candida isolates recovered, 58.6% were C. albicans"
		while 41.4% were non-albicans Candida species. The highest overall drug
		"resistance rate of Candida species was observed against fluconazole (17.2%),"
		followed by flycytosine (5.7%). All Candida isolates were 100% susceptible to
		"voriconazole, caspofungin, and micafungin. C. albicans, was 100% susceptible to"
		all drugs tested except fluconazole and flycytosine with a resistance rate of 2%
		"each drug. C. krusei, was 100 and 33.3% resistant to fluconazole and flycytosine,"
		respectively. CONCLUSIONS: High prevalence rate of vulvovaginal candidiasis and
		observation of high prevalence rate of non-albicans Candida species in the
		"present study substantiate, the importance of conducting continuous"
		epidemiological surveys to measure changes in species distribution from C.
		"albicans to non-albicans Candida species in Ethiopia. Although, fluconazole still"
		appeared to be active against all isolates of C. albicans and non-albicans
		Candida species high resistance rate of C. krusei against the drug may
		demonstrate a search for alternative antifungal drugs when treating vulvovaginal
		candidiasis caused by C. krusei.

		study.
PG	-	1387-1395
LID	-	10.1111/myc.13297 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Considering the emergence of fungaemia due to rare yeasts at our
		"centre, we performed a systematic epidemiologic study on fungaemia due to rare"
		yeast. OBJECTIVES: We undertook the present prospective observational study to
		explore the epidemiological features and clinical characteristics of fungaemia
		due to rare yeasts in paediatric ICUs at our centre. METHODS: The successive
		yeasts isolated from blood at our PICUs during December 2017 through March 2019
		were identified by molecular methods. Fungaemia due to yeasts other than
		"C. albicans, C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, C. krusei and C. parapsilosis was"
		categorised as rare yeasts. Antifungal susceptibility testing of the yeast
		isolates was performed as per clinical and laboratory standards institute (CLSI)
		guidelines. We also compared different clinical parameters of fungaemia due to
		"common versus rare yeasts, and rare yeasts in neonates versus non-neonates."
		"RESULTS: During the study period, 212 yeast isolates were obtained from 159"
		"patients at PICUs of our hospital, and 127 isolates from 98 patients (61.6%) were"
		categorised as rare yeasts. Neonates acquired fungaemia significantly earlier
		after ICU admission than non-neonates (median:4 vs 6 days; p = .005). Regarding
		"epidemiology study of rare yeast fungaemia, Wickerhamomyces anomalus (43.8%) and"
		Candida utilis (40.8%) were common isolates; surgical intervention and
		"gastrointestinal disease were significantly associated; overall, azole,"
		"echinocandin and amphotericin B resistance was at 9.1%, 1.02% and 1.02%,"
		respectively; overall mortality was 65.3%. CONCLUSIONS: The emergence of rare
		yeasts especially W. anomalus and C. utilis causing fungaemia in our children
		demands urgent attention to control the spread.

		pancreas-kidney transplantation: A single-center retrospective experience.
PG	-	e13486
LID	-	10.1111/tid.13486 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Data on the risk factors and outcome of intra-abdominal fungal
		infections (IAFI) following simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation (PKT)
		are scarce. MATERIALS/METHODS: A retrospective monocentric study was conducted on
		all patients who underwent simultaneous PKT from January 2007 to December 2016.
		Deep sites positive cultures for fungi during the first post-transplantation year
		"were collected. Clinical, radiological, and microbiological data of proven and"
		probable invasive fungal infections were analysed. RESULTS: Among sixteen PKT
		"patients, 15 were included. Seven patients (47%) developed an invasive fungal"
		"infection, exclusively IAFI (six proven, one probable). The proven IAFI included"
		"four peritonitis, one pancreatic necrosis with infected hematoma, and one patient"
		with positive preservation fluid only (PF). Candida albicans (n = 4) was the most
		"prevalent species (associated with Galactomyces candidus in one case), C"
		"glabrata, C dubliniensis, and C krusei were found in one case each. Three"
		patients had either a positive direct examination and/or culture for renal or
		pancreatic PF and the culture of PF was positive for the same species that caused
		IAFI. IAFIs were significantly associated with pancreatic graft arterial
		"thrombosis (5/7 vs 0/8, P = .007) and fungal contamination of PF (3/7 vs 0/8,"
		"P = .008). Among patients with IAFI, all required an early surgical revision"
		post-transplantation [1-18 days] and six had early or delayed pancreatic graft
		removal. One patient died in the first post-transplant year. CONCLUSION: IAFI is
		"a common complication in PKT, associated with pancreatic graft thrombosis or"
		"fungal contamination of the graft PF, and can sometimes lead to pancreatic"
		detransplantation.

TI	-	Oral Candidiasis in children and adolescents with cancer. Identification of
		Candida spp.
PG	-	E419-23
AB	-	Oral candidiasis represents a serious problem for children with cancer. The
		"mortality rate of this infection has increased due to fungal septicemia,"
		associated with a primary buccal infection. OBJECTIVE: Identify the Candida spp.
		"in buccal lesions of patients with cancer, establish the predominant species and"
		"correlate them to age and sex of the patient, clinical presentation, type of"
		"neoplasic disease and cytostatic therapy received. STUDY DESIGN: 62 patients,"
		"between 0-16 years, were investigated in a cross sectional study. SAMPLE"
		INCLUSION CRITERIA: Patients with malignant neoplasic disease that were receiving
		cytostatic treatment and had suspicious lesions of oral candidiasis. Patients
		"with antifungal therapy, active caries, calculus or intraoral appliances were"
		excluded. A clinical evaluation was carried out. The lesion sample was taken and
		studied by direct exam and culture in CHROMagar-Candida and Sabouraud-Dextrose
		Agar with chloramphenicol. The identification of the isolated yeast was done by
		"the filamentation test, carbohydrate fermentation and assimilation. RESULTS: Most"
		"of the cases (69.35%) were positive to oral candidiasis, C. albicans was the most"
		"frequent species found, followed by C. parapsilosis (14.89%), C. tropicalis"
		"(12.77%), C. krusei (4.26%), C. glabrata (2.13%) and C. lusitaniae (2.13%). In"
		some cases more than one specie were isolated (9.30%). The most frequent location
		of the lesion was in the tongue (72.70%). The pseudomembranous candidiasis was
		the most frequent clinical presentation found (78.71%). There were not
		"significant statistically differences with regard to sex and age of the patient,"
		type of neoplasic disease and cytostatic agent received. CONCLUSION: The results
		suggest that oral candidiasis is a frequent complication in the pediatric
		"oncological population, being C. albicans the main etiological agent, however,"
		there is an important participation of other Candida species.

		"least one episode of infection in their lives, with pregnancy being a"
		"predisposing factor. If left untreated, vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) can lead"

		"infection of the neonate. We aimed to determine the prevalence of VVC, identify"
		"the recent and most frequently occurring species of Candida in pregnant women,"
		and determine the most effective antifungal drug of choice for treatment. METHOD:
		A prospective cross-sectional study in which 176 high vaginal swab samples of
		consented pregnant women visiting the antenatal clinic from February 2018 to
		April 2018 were subjected to direct gram smear and culture for Candida isolation.
		Candida isolates were identified using a germ tube test and HiCrome Candida
		differential agar. Candida isolates were then subjected to a disk diffusion
		"method using fluconazole (25 μg), nystatin (100 units), and voriconazole (1 μg)"
		on Mueller-Hinton agar supplemented with 2% (w/v) glucose and 0.5 μg/ml methylene
		blue dye to determine the susceptibility pattern as per the guidelines of the
		Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI). Chi-square analysis was used to
		ascertain the significant association of participants' sociodemographics and
		clinical presentations to VVC. A univariate logistic regression model was used to
		identify potential risk factors of VVC. RESULTS: The prevalence of VVC among our
		study participants was 30.7%. Non-albicans Candida (NAC) and Candida albicans had
		"a prevalence of 74.1 and 25.9%, respectively. Candida glabrata was the most"
		"common species, followed by Candida albicans, Candida krusei, and Candida"
		"parapsilosis. 50.0, 18.5 and 3.7% of Candida species were susceptible to"
		"voriconazole, fluconazole and nystatin, respectively, whereas 37.0, 48.1 and 9.3%"
		"of Candida species were resistant to voriconazole, fluconazole and nystatin,"
		respectively. The majority of isolates were susceptible dose dependent to all
		"three antifungal agents, with voriconazole being the most efficacious antifungal"
		agent. There was no significant association between participants'
		socio-demographic information and clinical presentations to VVC. CONCLUSION: The
		prevalence of VVC was high in the study area. C. glabrata was found to be the
		"most common cause of VVC among the pregnant women attending antenatal clinics, in"
		the Ho Municipality region of Ghana. The majority of the Candida isolates were
		"susceptible and resistant to voriconazole and fluconazole, respectively."

AB	-	PURPOSE: To analyze trends in incidence and mortality of candidemia in intensive
		care units (ICUs) vs. non-ICU hospitalized patients and to determine risk factors
		for infection by specific species and for death. METHODS: Active hospital-based
		surveillance program of incident episodes of candidemia due to common species in
		"24 tertiary care hospitals in the Paris area, France between October 2002 and"
		"September 2010. RESULTS: Among 2,507 adult cases included, 2,571 Candida isolates"
		"were collected and species were C. albicans (56 %), C. glabrata (18.6 %), C."
		"parapsilosis (11.5 %), C. tropicalis (9.3 %), C. krusei (2.9 %), and C. kefyr"
		"(1.8 %). Candidemia occurred in ICU in 1,206 patients (48.1 %). When comparing"
		"ICU vs. non-ICU patients, the former had significantly more frequent surgery"
		"during the past 30 days, were more often preexposed to fluconazole and treated"
		"with echinocandin, and were less frequently infected with C. parapsilosis. Risk"
		factors and age remained unchanged during the study period. A significant
		increased incidence in the overall population and ICU was found. The odds of
		being infected with a given species in ICU was influenced by risk factors and
		preexposure to fluconazole and caspofungin. Echinocandins initial therapy
		"increased over time in ICU (4.6 % first year of study, to 48.5 % last year of"
		"study, p < 0.0001). ICU patients had a higher day-30 death rate than non-ICU"
		patients (odds ratio [OR] 2.12; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.66-2.72; p <
		0.0001). The day-30 and early (<day 8) death rates increased over time in ICU
		(from 41.5 % the first to 56.9 % the last year of study (p = 0.001) and 28.7-38.8
		"% (p = 0.0292), respectively). Independent risk factors for day-30 death in ICU"
		"were age, arterial catheter, Candida species, preexposure to caspofungin, and"
		lack of antifungal therapy at the time of blood cultures results (p < 0.05).
		CONCLUSIONS: The availability of new antifungals and the publication of numerous
		guidelines did not prevent an increase of candidemia and death in ICU patients in
		the Paris area.

AB	-	"OBJECTIVES: To determine the epidemiology of Candida bloodstream infections,"
		"variables influencing mortality, and antifungal resistance rates in ICUs in"
		"Spain. DESIGN: Prospective, observational, multicenter population-based study."
		SETTING: Medical and surgical ICUs in 29 hospitals distributed throughout five
		metropolitan areas of Spain. PATIENTS: Adult patients (≥ 18 yr) with an episode
		of Candida bloodstream infection during admission to any surveillance area ICU
		from May 2010 to April 2011. INTERVENTIONS: Candida isolates were sent to a
		reference laboratory for species identification by DNA sequencing and
		susceptibility testing using the methods and breakpoint criteria promulgated by
		the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing. Prognostic
		factors associated with early (0-7 d) and late (8-30 d) mortality were analyzed
		using logistic regression modeling. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We detected
		"773 cases of candidemia, 752 of which were included in the overall cohort. Among"
		"these, 168 (22.3%) occurred in adult ICU patients. The rank order of Candida"
		"isolates was as follows: Candida albicans (52%), Candida parapsilosis (23.7%),"
		"Candida glabrata (12.7%), Candida tropicalis (5.8%), Candida krusei (4%), and"
		others (1.8%). Overall susceptibility to fluconazole was 79.2%. Cumulative
		mortality at 7 and 30 days after the first episode of candidemia was 16.5% and
		"47%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that early appropriate antifungal"
		"treatment and catheter removal (odds ratio, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.08-0.91), Acute"
		"Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (odds ratio, 1.11; 95% CI,"
		"1.04-1.19), and abdominal source (odds ratio, 8.15; 95% CI, 1.75-37.93) were"
		independently associated with early mortality. Determinants of late mortality
		"were age (odds ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.07), intubation (odds ratio, 7.24; 95%"
		"CI, 2.24-23.40), renal replacement therapy (odds ratio, 6.12; 95% CI,"
		"2.24-16.73), and primary source (odds ratio, 2.51; 95% CI, 1.06-5.95)."
		CONCLUSIONS: Candidemia in ICU patients is caused by non-albicans species in 48%
		"of cases, C. parapsilosis being the most common among these. Overall mortality"
		remains high and mainly related with host factors. Prompt adequate antifungal
		treatment and catheter removal could be critical to decrease early mortality.

PG	-	84-91
LID	-	10.1007/s11684-017-0612-x [doi]
AB	-	A multicenter prospective epidemiological survey on the etiologic agents of
		invasive candidosis was conducted in Russia in the period of 2012-2014. Samples
		were collected from 284 patients with invasive candidosis and Candida species
		isolated by culture. The species were identified by DNA sequencing and MALDI-TOF
		"massspectrometry. A total of 322 isolates were recovered, in which 96% of Сandida"
		"species belonged to six major species, namely, C. albicans (43.2%), C."
		"parapsilosis (20.2%), C. glabrata (11.5%), C. tropicalis (9.6%), C. krusei"
		"(6.2%), and C. guilliermondii (5.3%). Most Candida species were isolated from"
		"blood samples (83.23%). Notably, the prevalence rate of C. albicans reduced from"
		52.38% to 32.79% (2012 vs. 2014) (P = 0.01) whereas that of non-C. albicans
		increased from 47.62% (2012) to 67.21% (2014) (P < 0.01). Species distribution
		"differed among geographical regions; specifically, the prevalence rate of C."
		albicans as an etiologic agent of invasive candidosis in Siberian Federal region
		was significantly higher than that in other Federal regions. Results indicated a
		"shift from C. albicans to non-C. albicans. Therefore, a detailed investigation on"
		the contributing factors and appropriate treatment of invasive candidosis is
		needed.

		survey.
PG	-	777-785
LID	-	10.1111/myc.12816 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To identify the epidemiology and antifungal susceptibilities of
		Candida spp. among blood culture isolates to identify the epidemiology and
		antifungal susceptibilities of Candida spp. among blood culture isolates in
		"Sweden. METHODS: The study was a retrospective, observational nationwide"
		laboratory-based surveillance for fungaemia and fungal meningitis and was
		"conducted from September 2015 to August 2016. RESULTS: In total, 488 Candida"
		blood culture isolates were obtained from 471 patients (58% males). Compared to
		"our previous study, the incidence of candidaemia has increased from 4.2/100 000"
		(2005-2006) to 4.7/100 000 population/year (2015-2016). The three most common
		"Candida spp. isolated from blood cultures were Candida albicans (54.7%), Candida"
		glabrata (19.7%) and species in the Candida parapsilosis complex (9.4%). Candida
		"resistance to fluconazole was 2% in C. albicans and between 0% and 100%, in"
		non-albicans species other than C. glabrata and C. krusei. Resistance to
		"voriconazole was rare, except for C. glabrata, C. krusei and C. tropicalis."
		Resistance to anidulafungin was 3.8% while no Candida isolate was resistant to
		amphotericin B. CONCLUSIONS: We report an overall increase in candidaemia but a
		minor decrease of C. albicans while C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis remain
		constant over this 10-year period.

TI	-	Fungal peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis: 5-year review from a North China
		center.
PG	-	35-43
LID	-	10.1007/s15010-018-1204-7 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: Fungal peritonitis (FP) is a rare but devastating complication in
		"peritoneal dialysis (PD), accounting for high rates of technique failure,"
		morbidity and mortality. This study was conducted to investigate FPs with regard
		"to peritonitis rate, microbiology testing, patient characteristics, clinical"
		"features, antifungal treatments, and clinical outcomes in patients on PD."
		METHODS: This single-center study retrospectively reviewed all FP episodes
		"diagnosed from June 1, 2012 to June, 2017. All FPs were matched in a 1:5 ratio"
		"with PD patients diagnosed with bacterial peritonitis. Clinical, biochemical"
		characteristics and detailed data on peritonitis episodes were recorded. RESULTS:
		Eleven fungal peritonitis episodes (rate of 0.0067 episodes per patient-year on
		dialysis) were identified. All FPs were caused by Candida species (identification
		and antifungal susceptibility testing were performed with VITEK 2(®) compact
		"system), including C. albicans (6/11), C. parapsilosis (4/11) and C. krusei"
		"(1/11). Except C. krusei, no Candida resistance to fluconazole was detected."
		"Compared to bacterial peritonitis (matched cases, n = 55), FP group showed higher"
		"rate of previous antibiotic use (p = 0.002), higher total effluent cell count"
		"(p = 0.007), and lower serum albumin (p = 0.01), higher rate of infection-related"
		"surgery (p < 0.001), HD transfer (p = 0.001), and all-cause death (p = 0.006)."
		"High prevalence (≥ 50%) of female gender, anuria, CCI ≥ 4, hypoalbuminemia,"
		"anemia, and hypokalemia were also observed in FP patients. More than half of the"
		FP patients presented gastrointestinal symptoms (7/11) and extraperitoneal
		infection (6/11). Eight (72.7%) patients had catheter surgically removed with a
		"median 5.5 lag days, four (36.4%) patients died within 3 months and six (54.5%)"
		cases led to technique failure. CONCLUSIONS: FP results in high rates of catheter
		"loss and all-cause mortality in 3 months of follow-up, candida species were the"
		commonest pathogens in our center. Variations of clinical features and
		susceptibility patterns were observed. Gastrointestinal disorders maybe a
		potential risk factor for FP.

TI	-	Bilateral polymicrobial osteomyelitis with Candida tropicalis and Candida krusei:
		a case report and an updated literature review.
PG	-	e16-22
LID	-	10.1016/j.ijid.2011.10.001 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: We present a case of bilateral polymicrobial osteomyelitis with
		"Candida tropicalis and Candida krusei, and review the literature on Candida"
		osteomyelitis. METHODS: PubMed was searched for cases of Candida osteomyelitis
		published in the English-language literature between 1970 and 2010. CASE: A
		60-year-old previously healthy man was hospitalized with gallstone pancreatitis.
		"Between 3 weeks and 6 months after hospitalization, he developed bilateral"
		osteomyelitis of the feet with C. tropicalis and C. krusei. The patient was
		"treated with surgery, fluconazole, and a liposomal formulation of amphotericin B."
		"The left lower limb was amputated, and at a 2-year follow-up, the patient had"
		almost no pain in his right foot. LITERATURE REVIEW: We identified 40 new cases
		in the literature since the latest review in 2004. Most cases of Candida
		"osteomyelitis are caused by Candida albicans, but an increasing number are caused"
		"by non-albicans species. The prognosis is favorable, with full recovery in the"
		majority of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Candida osteomyelitis should be considered when a
		"patient presents with risk factors and pain without previous trauma, because"
		"Candida, despite being part of the normal flora, is the fourth leading cause of"
		hematogenous nosocomial infections. The recommended treatment is surgery and
		"fluconazole as monotherapy or initially combined with a fungicidal agent, either"
		a different amphotericin B formulation or an echinocandin.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Osteomyelitis due to Candida krusei are extremely rare, given that"
		"only six cases have been reported, all of which are limited to the patients with"
		immunocompromising risk factors. Here we report a case of C. krusei osteomyelitis
		"in an immunocompetent patient, presenting with multiple huge cystic lesions of"
		talus. CASE PRESENTATION: A 66-year-old female presented with one year history of
		painful swelling of right ankle and a draining sinus around lateral malleolus.
		"Five months and three months ago, she had undergone arthroscopic synovectomy and"
		bursectomy which revealed no causative organism. Open bursectomy with sinus tract
		excision was performed and intravenous antibiotic was administered. Two year
		"after the surgery, the patient revisited the clinic for recurrent painful"
		swelling with pus drainage at the same location. Multiple huge cystic lesions
		with osteolysis and sclerotic rim of talus were found and C. krusei was isolated
		from tissue culture. The patient received surgical debridement and prolonged
		antifungal treatment comprising caspofungin and voriconazole. CONCLUSIONS: In
		"this case, C. krusei infection showed atypically aggressive osteolysis shown as"
		multiple huge cystic abscess. High index of suspicion is critical for early
		diagnosis and treatment to prevent such devastating results even in an
		immunocompetent patient.

AB	-	PURPOSE: To assess the risk factors and outcomes associated with fungemia caused
		by the six most commonly occurring Candida species in patients with and without
		malignancies. METHODS: Analysis of the episodes of fungemia due to common Candida
		"species in adults, based on an active hospital-based surveillance program (Paris"
		"area, France, 2002 to 2014). RESULTS: Of the 3417 patients (3666 isolates), 1164"
		(34.1%) had a solid tumor (45.7% digestive tract) and 586 (17.1%) a hematological
		"malignancy (41.8% lymphoma, 33.5% acute leukemia). The hematology patients were"
		"significantly younger, more often pre-exposed to antifungals, more often infected"
		"by C. tropicalis, C. krusei, or C. kefyr, and more often treated in the first"
		instance with an echinocandin. Compared with inpatients who were not in ICU at
		"the time of fungemia, those in ICU were less frequently infected by"
		"C. parapsilosis (p < 0.02), had more recent surgery (p < 0.03), and died more"
		frequently before day 8 and day 30 (p < 0.0001). An increase in crude mortality
		over time in ICU was observed only in oncology patients (p < 0.04). For all
		"patients, lack of prescription of antifungals despite knowledge of positive blood"
		culture increased the risk of death. The odds of being infected by a given
		"Candida species compared with C. albicans were uneven regarding age, gender, type"
		"of malignancy, hospitalization in ICU, central venous catheter, HIV status,"
		"intravenous drug addiction, and previous exposure to antifungal drugs. Compared"
		"with C. albicans, C. glabrata (OR = 0.69 [0.54-0.89]) and C. parapsilosis"
		(OR = 0.49 [0.35-0.67]) were associated with a decreased risk of death by day 8
		and day 30. CONCLUSION: The clinical context of underlying malignancy and
		hospitalization in ICU may be relevant to the initial management of candidemia.

LID	-	32
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Vaginal candidiasis is frequent in pregnant women and is associated
		with sepsis and adverse neonatal outcomes. This study determined the prevalence
		of candida species in symptomatic pregnant women and evaluated the antifungal
		susceptibility profile of the isolated Candida strains. It also aimed to explore
		whether Candida species predicts gestational complications and adverse neonatal
		outcomes. METHODS: A total of 258 pregnant women with vaginal discharge at 35 to
		37 week of gestation participated in this study. Vaginal swabs from these
		patients were collected at various obstetrics and gynecology clinics in Lebanon
		for a period of 14 months. Candida isolates were identified at species level and
		"antifungal susceptibility of Candida albicans to fluconazole (FCZ), amphotericin"
		"B (AMB), itraconazole (ICZ) and voriconazole (VCZ) was determined by the"
		"agar-based E-test method. RESULTS: Among 258 women tested, 100 (39%) were"
		"positive for Candida species. C. albicans, C. glabrata and C. krusei were"
		"isolated from 42, 41 and 17% of the women, respectively. C. albicans was"
		significantly associated only with gestational diabetes while C. krusei or C.
		glabrata had significant positive associations with other gestational
		complications. The antifungal susceptibility tests of C. albicans isolates
		"revealed 97.5, 90, 87.5 and 97.5% susceptibility to AMB, FCZ, ICZ and VCZ,"
		respectively. CONCLUSION: The current study revealed high incidence of both C.
		albicans and non-C. albicans Candida strains causing vulvovaginitis among
		"pregnant women in Beirut, Lebanon. Candida screening as antenatal follow up is"
		advised to minimize the risk of adverse neonatal outcome or gestational
		complications.

		liver transplantation.
PG	-	e13811
LID	-	10.1111/tid.13811 [doi]
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Candidiasis is the most common invasive fungal infection in solid
		"organ transplant recipients, and liver transplant (LT) recipients are at"
		heightened risk. We hypothesized that pre-transplant screening for azole
		non-susceptible Candida (ANSC) allows for tailored antifungal prophylaxis to
		reduce the incidence of post-LT ANSC infection. METHODS: We performed a
		retrospective chart review of adult (age ≥18 years) patients who underwent LT at
		"Yale New Haven Hospital from April 2019 to March 2021. Screening for ANSC,"
		"defined as Candida glabrata or Candida krusei, was performed using a rectal swab"
		"prior to or at the time of LT. RESULTS: During the study period, ANSC screening"
		"was performed in 47 patients who underwent a total of 48 LTs, with 46/48 (96%)"
		primary LTs and two re-transplantations. Ten of 48 screened cases (21%) had
		ANSC-positive rectal swabs. Only seven of 10 ANSC-colonized patients received
		"appropriate antifungal prophylaxis (i.e., anidulafungin), and one of these seven"
		patients developed candidemia within 30 days of LT. The median number of
		"candidiasis risk factors was one, and 29% of the cohort had two or more risk"
		factors. DISCUSSION: Routine ANSC screening of LT candidates may assist in
		selecting appropriate antifungal prophylaxis but may be insufficient to prevent
		infection in those with multiple risk factors for Candida infection.

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to determine the frequency of Candida species in
		women of different age groups as well as to suggest the criteria for the
		diagnosis of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC). STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study of
		"vulvovaginal candidiasis was carried out using laboratory diagnosis, with the"
		estimation of vaginal pH and the direct microscopic and biochemical examination
		of vaginal discharge/secretions. Vaginal cultures for Candida species were
		"collected from 1050 women with vulvovaginal symptoms. RESULTS: Out of 1050 women,"
		"215 (20.47%) were positive for Candida species. Of 215 women, 172 (80%) had pH"
		within the normal range and 167 (77.67%) were showing yeast cells and mycelia on
		"direct microscopic examination. Candida albicans accounted for 46.9% of cases,"
		"Candida glabrata 36.7%, Candida parapsilosis 10.2%, Candida tropicalis 2.8%,"
		"Candida krusei 1.4%, and Candida kiefer 1.9%. The frequency of culture positivity"
		"was related to pregnancy (P<0.001), an increase in parity (P<0.001), and use of"
		oral contraceptives (P<0.001) and antibiotics (P<0.001). The most common signs
		and symptoms in 215 women with positive cultures were pruritus with or without
		vaginal discharge and vaginal erythema. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that
		vulvovaginal candidiasis can only be diagnosed by using clinical criteria in
		correlation with vulvovaginal symptoms and Candida cultures.

AB	-	Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC) is a major health problem for sexually
		active women because of its severe effect on their quality of life. A thorough
		"knowledge of their epidemiology leads to their efficient management. Therefore, a"
		cross-sectional study was conducted in 2014 in women with leucorrhoea associated
		or not with other clinical signs. Recurrence was based on the occurrence of at
		least four annual episodes of Candida vulvo-vaginitis. An individual interview
		based on a questionnaire was conducted to identify the socio-demographic
		parameters that could be associated with the RVVC. Vaginal samples were collected
		at the obstetrical gynaecology department of the University Hospital of Cocody
		"and at the Pasteur Institute of Côte d'Ivoire. On each sample, a direct"
		examination and culture on Sabouraud-chloramphenicol medium with or without
		actidione were performed. Yeast identification was performed using chromogenic
		media (CandiSelect(®)4 [Bio-Rad]) and the study of sugar assimilation using the
		Auxacolor(®) 2 gallery (Bio-Rad). A total of 400 patients were included. The
		"average age was 29.2 years (SD=7.2 years). Of these, 94 had recurrent"
		"vulvovaginal candidiasis, with a prevalence of 23.5% (CI(95%): 19.49-28.02). Five"
		"species of the genus Candida have been identified: Candida albicans (59.6%),"
		"Candida glabrata (19.1%), Candida tropicalis (16%), Candida krusei (4.2%) and"
		"Candida inconspicua (1.1%). Some factors such as education level, history of"
		"sexually transmitted infection, type of underwear used, frequency of personal"
		hygiene and type of product used for these hygiene have been associated with the
		occurrence of RVVCs. The occurrence of RVVCs is relatively high in our study
		population. Non-albicansCandida species occupy a significant place in this
		disease epidemiology. By addressing the factors associated with the occurrence
		"and/or persistence of RVVCs, it will be possible to reduce their incidence in"
		sexually active women.

		predominance of Candida parapsilosis.
PG	-	903-910
LID	-	10.47665/tb.37.4.903 [doi]
AB	-	Candida parapsilosis is an important pathogen of healthcare-associated
		bloodstream infections (BSI) causing high mortality and morbidity in
		immunocompromised patients in addition to other Candida species including C.
		"albicans, C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, and C. krusei. Knowledge on recent local"
		species distribution and trend is essential. An increase in the proportion of C.
		parapsilosis candidemia has been recently observed as a result of many risk
		factors. The distribution of candidemia has been changing in the last three
		decades. To determine the proportion of different Candida species causing
		"candidemia in a tertiary-care hospital during January 2001 - December 2018, a"
		retrospective study performed in a 853-bedded tertiary-care hospital in
		north-eastern Malaysia. All cases of candidemia from January-2001 to
		"December-2018 were included, and the review was performed based on patients'"
		medical records and laboratory database. The frequency of different Candida
		species was determined. This study showed that out of 1175 patients with
		"candidemia, C. parapsilosis was the most common species contributing to 29.2%"
		"(343/1175) of candidemia, followed by C. albicans 20.1% (236/1175), C. tropicalis"
		"18.7% (220/1175), C. glabrata 6.0% (71/1175), C. guilliermondii 3.7% (43/1175),"
		"C. rugosa 1.9% (22/1175), C. famata 1.7% (20/1175), C. krusei 1.4% (16/1175), C."
		"dubliniensis 0.8% (9/1175), C. lusitaniae 0.7% (8/1175), C. lipolytica 0.3%"
		"(4/1175), C. pelliculosa 0.3% (4/1175), C. haemulonii, C. kefyr, C. utilis and C."
		"inconspicua (1/1175 each). In addition, 14.9% (175/1175) belonged to Candida spp."
		"which were not identified to species level. In conclusion, a different scenario"
		for the proportion of Candida species with C. parapsilosis predominates over C.
		albicans as a nosocomial pathogen leading to candidemia has been shown in this
		study.

		0.33% of total patient discharges. These percentages represent a 20-fold increase
		in the incidence of candidemia at our hospital in comparison with that during
		"1976-1979. Candida albicans was the most frequently isolated species (63%),"

		"parapsilosis (6.5%), and Candida krusei (0.9%). Overall mortality was 57%, and 14"
		(23%) of 60 deaths occurred within 48 hours of the detection of candidemia.
		Mortality was associated with higher APACHE II scores (25 for nonsurvivors vs. 16
		"for survivors; P = .0001), the presence of a rapidly fatal underlying illness (P"
		"= .0009), and sustained positivity of blood cultures (P = .02). In cases of"

		"candidemic patients (28%) did not receive any antifungal therapy, and 19 (63%) of"
		these untreated patients died. Eleven untreated patients (37%) survived without
		sequelae. There has been a marked increase in the incidence of candidemia in our
		institution that is associated with a high overall mortality. Candidemia lasting
		less than 24 hours was associated with a lower mortality than was that of longer
		duration. Severity of illness and duration of candidemia should be used as
		stratifying factors in prospective studies to determine optimum therapy.

		infection. The epidemiology of IC in hospitalized patients has been widely
		"investigated in many metropolitan cities; however, little information from medium"
		and small cities is known. METHODS: A 5-year retrospective study was carried out
		"to analyze the prevalence, species distribution, antifungal susceptibility, risk"
		factors and mortality of inpatients with invasive Candida infection in a regional
		tertiary teaching hospital in Southwest China. RESULTS: A total of 243 inpatients
		with invasive Candida infection during the five-year study period were
		"identified, with a mean annual incidence of 0.41 cases per 1000 admissions and a"
		"30-day mortality rate of 12.3%. The species distributions of Candida albicans,"
		"Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, Candida krusei, Candida parapsilosis and"
		"other Candida species was 45.3, 30.0, 15.2, 4.9, 2.1 and 2.5%, respectively. The"
		"total resistance rates of fluconazole (FCA), itraconazole (ITR) and voriconazole"
		"(VRC) were 18.6, 23.1 and 18.5%, respectively. Respiratory dysfunction, pulmonary"
		"infection, cardiovascular disease, chronic/acute renal failure, mechanical"
		"ventilation, abdominal surgery, intensive care in adults, septic shock and IC due"
		to C. albicans were associated with 30-day mortality (P < 0.05) according to the
		"univariate analyses. Respiratory dysfunction [odds ratio (OR), 9.80; 95%"
		"confidence interval (CI), 3.24-29.63; P < 0.001] and IC due to C. albicans (OR,"
		"3.35; 95% CI, 1.13-9.92; P = 0.029) were the independent predictors of 30-day"
		mortality. CONCLUSIONS: This report shows that the incidence and mortality rates
		are lower and that the resistance rates to azoles are higher in medium and small
		cities than in large cities and that the species distributions and risk factors
		in medium and small cities are different from those in large cities in China. It
		is necessary to conduct epidemiological surveillance in medium and small cities
		to provide reference data for the surveillance of inpatients with IC infections.

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: Breakthrough candidemia (BTC) on fluconazole was associated with
		non-susceptible Candida spp. and increased mortality. This nationwide FUNGINOS
		study analyzed clinical and mycological BTC characteristics. METHODS: A 3-year
		prospective study was conducted in 567 consecutive candidemias. Species
		identification and antifungal susceptibility testing (CLSI) were performed in the
		FUNGINOS reference laboratory. Data were analyzed according to STROBE criteria.
		"RESULTS: 43/576 (8%) BTC occurred: 37/43 (86%) on fluconazole (28 prophylaxis,"
		median 200 mg/day). 21% BTC vs. 23% non-BTC presented severe sepsis/septic shock.
		Overall mortality was 34% vs. 32%. BTC was associated with gastrointestinal
		"mucositis (multivariate OR 5.25, 95%CI 2.23-12.40, p < 0.001) and"
		"graft-versus-host-disease (6.25, 1.00-38.87, p = 0.05), immunosuppression (2.42,"
		"1.03-5.68, p = 0.043), and parenteral nutrition (2.87, 1.44-5.71, p = 0.003)."
		Non-albicans Candida were isolated in 58% BTC vs. 35% non-BTC (p = 0.005). 63% of
		"16 BTC occurring after 10-day fluconazole were non-susceptible (Candida glabrata,"
		"Candida krusei, Candida norvegensis) vs. 19% of 21 BTC (C. glabrata) following"
		"shorter exposure (7.10, 1.60-31.30, p = 0.007). Median fluconazole MIC was 4 mg/l"
		vs. 0.25 mg/l (p < 0.001). Ten-day fluconazole exposure predicted non-susceptible
		BTC with 73% accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes of BTC and non-BTC were similar.
		Fluconazole non-susceptible BTC occurred in three out of four cases after
		prolonged low-dose prophylaxis. This implies reassessment of prophylaxis duration
		and rapid de-escalation of empirical therapy in BTC after short fluconazole
		exposure.

		"results, antifungal therapy, and mortality were analysed. RESULTS: The cumulative"
		IAC incidence was 18.4 cases per 1000 admissions (2013: 12.6; 2014: 17.7; 2015:
		"16.8; 2016: 24.5), including hospital-acquired IAC incidence (2013: 9.8; 2014:"
		13.3; 2015 10.1; 2016: 13.3) and community-acquired IAC incidence (2013: 2.8;
		2014: 4.4; 2015: 6.7; 2016: 11.2). Candida albicans represented the most common
		"species (n = 35, 50.0%) followed by Candida glabrata (n = 15, 21.4%), Candida"
		"tropicalis (n = 6, 8.6%) and other yeasts (each &lt; 5.0%). Incidence rate of C."
		albicans (2013: 7(78%); 2014: 10(59%); 2015: 6(35%); 2016: 12(44%)) and incidence
		rate of C. non-albicans (2013: 2(22%); 2014: 7(41%); 2015: 9(53%); 2016: 14(52%))
		"were different in trend. All fungal isolates were susceptible to echinocandins,"
		"amphotericin B and voriconazole. Regarding fluconazole susceptibility, C. krusei"
		(n = 3) was resistant and C. glabrata (n = 9) was susceptible-dose dependent
		(SDD). The ratio of SDD C. glabrata isolates to all isolated C. glabrata strains
		was 9/15 (60%) (2013: 0/2; 2014: 0/2; 2015: 1/3; 2016: 8/8). Decreased
		fluconazole susceptibility for C. glabrata isolates was reported in both
		community-acquired IAC (n = 3) and hospital-acquired IAC (n = 6). Overall 30-day
		mortality rate was 25.0% (16/64). CONCLUSIONS: We have revealed slowly raising of
		"overall IAC incidence, more increasing trend in incidence of community-acquired"
		IAC compared to rather steady incidence of hospital-acquired IAC. During period
		2013-2016 we have observed a significant shift in the aetiology of IAC towards an
		"increased proportion of non-albicans Candida species, particularly C. glabrata."
		Acquired decreased fluconazole susceptibility was related to C. glabrata isolates
		exclusively. Emergence of decreased antifungal susceptibility has been preceded
		by increase of non-albicans Candida isolates.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Blood stream infections are serious infections that usually induce
		"prolongation of hospital stay, morbidity and mortality in several countries"
		including Ethiopia. The aim of this study was to determine bacterial and fungal
		"profile, their drug resistance patterns, and risk factors associated with blood"
		stream infections. METHODS: A cross sectional study design was conducted from
		"February 23 to June 23, 2020 at Ethiopian public health. A structured"
		questionnaire was used to collect data on socio-demographic factors and clinical
		conditions. Blood specimens were analyzed using standard microbiological
		techniques. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed using Kirby-Bauer
		disc diffusion technique and Vitek compact 2. Simple and multiple logistic
		regressions were used to assess the potential risk factors. RESULTS: A total of
		"175 pathogens isolated from 346 blood specimens. Of these, 60% Gram-negative"
		"bacteria, 30.86% Gram-positive bacteria and 9.14% fungal isolates were"
		identified. Burkholderia cepacia and Coagulase negative staphylococcus were the
		predominant pathogen among Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria respectively.
		"Among fungus, Candida krusei (56.25%) was the most predominant isolate. The"
		highest proportions of antibacterial resistance were observed among 3rd
		generation cephalosporin and penicillin. Most fungal isolates expressed
		"resistance to fluconazole. Sex (P = 0.007), age (P < 0.001) and use of invasive"
		medical devices (P = 0.003) were identified as risk factors for bacterial blood
		stream infections. CONCLUSION: The study showed high prevalence of blood stream
		infection was due to B. cepacia and non-C. albicans spp. This finding alarming
		ongoing investigation of blood stream infection is important for recognizing
		future potential preventive strategies including environmental hygiene and
		management of comorbid medical diseases to reduce the problem.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Different yeast species have different susceptibilities to commonly
		"prescribed antifungal drugs. Thus, it is important to accurately determine the"
		"species of pathogenic yeasts, especially when more than one species are in a"
		specimen. METHODS: Clinically significant yeast isolates were collected via the
		Taiwan Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance of Yeasts from July to September
		in 2010. The identifications of isolates were assessed in the core laboratory at
		"the National Health Research Institutes. RESULTS: Of the 1127 isolates recovered,"
		"1088 were of Candida genus, accounting for 96.53% of the total isolates, followed"
		"by Cryptococcus (15, 1.33%), Trichosporon (12, 1.06%), Kodamaea (4, 0.35%),"
		"Pichia (4, 0.35%), and three others. In all, 38 out of 1116 (3.4%) specimens had"
		"mixed yeast cultures. One ascites specimen had three species, Candida albicans,"
		"Candida glabrata, and Candida tropicalis. In the remaining 37 specimens, 16 had a"
		"combination of C. albicans and C. glabrata, eight C. albicans and C. tropicalis,"
		"five C. glabrata and C. tropicalis, three Candida krusei and C. tropicalis, and"
		five with different combinations. CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of cultures
		"with mixed yeasts may be an emerging issue. Thus, to determine mixed yeast"
		"cultures in the same specimen, we highly recommend CHROMagar Candida medium to"
		culture yeast isolates directly from the specimen.

TI	-	Ten-year review of invasive Candida infections in a tertiary care center in Saudi
		Arabia.
PG	-	821-6
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To review the epidemiology of invasive Candida infections in a single
		center in Saudi Arabia over a subsequent 10-year period. METHODS: This
		retrospective study was carried out in a single center in Saudi Arabia over a
		10-year period. Records of all patients with invasive Candida infections (ICI)
		over the period from January 2003 to December 2012 were reviewed. Mann-Whitney U
		test was used for comparison of Candida albicans (C. albicans) versus
		"non-albicans Candida species, and fluconazole resistance versus fluconazole"
		susceptible in relation to crude mortality at 30 days and 90 days. RESULTS: Eight
		"hundred positive sterile site cultures, associated with 652 ICI were identified."
		Median age was 52 years and 53% of patients were males. Candida albicans were the
		"most common species (38.7%), followed by Candida tropicalis (18.9%), and Candida"
		glabrata (C. glabrata) (16.3%). The proportion of ICI caused by C. albicans
		"remained stable over time (p=0.07), but C. glabrata increased significantly"
		"(p<0.001). The median rate of ICI per 1,000 hospital discharges per year was"
		"1.65, with a significant trend towards higher rates over time (p=0.01). Most"
		"isolates were susceptible to fluconazole, voriconazole, and amphotericin B. Only"
		66.7% of Candida krusei were susceptible to caspofungin. Overall 30-day crude
		mortality was 40.6%. There was no significant difference in crude mortality in
		"association with C. albicans compared with non-albicans species, nor in"
		association with fluconazole resistance. CONCLUSION: The rate of ICI increased
		significantly in the proportion of ICI caused by C. glabrata. Most isolates
		"remain susceptible to caspofungin, voriconazole, and amphotericin B. The crude"
		mortality remains high.

PG	-	S120-5
AB	-	This study reviews data on patients with fungemia and confirms the high
		prevalence (50%) of infections caused by non-albicans species of Candida.
		Fungemia due to C. albicans or Torulopsis glabrata occurred significantly more
		"often in patients with a solid tumor, while fungemia due to Candida tropicalis or"
		Candida krusei was significantly more common in patients with hematologic
		"malignancy (P = .001). For 31% of patients, only a single blood culture was"
		"positive for yeasts, and the prognosis for these patients was not significantly"
		different than that for patients with three or more positive blood cultures (P =
		"1), including those who had C. albicans fungemia. The overall mortality rate was"
		"41.8%, which is much lower than that previously reported in studies of patients"
		with cancer. No significant difference was observed between patients treated with
		amphotericin B and those treated with fluconazole in this retrospective analysis.
		Although no significant difference was observed in the mortality rate among
		"patients who had fungemia with or without neutropenia, the incidence of"
		disseminated candidiasis was significantly higher among neutropenic patients (P =
		.03).

AB	-	Recent changes in the aetiology and epidemiology of invasive candidiasis have
		"serious implications for current and future diagnosis, treatment and prognosis."
		The aim of the current review was to discuss the epidemiology of invasive
		"candidiasis, the distribution of Candida species in different regions of the"
		"world, the medical concerns of the changing aetiology and the emergence of"
		"antifungal resistance. Overall burden of invasive candidiasis remains high,"
		"especially in vulnerable persons, such as the elderly, immunosuppressed or"
		"debilitated patients. Moreover, there is a progressive shift in the aetiology of"
		"invasive candidiasis from Candida albicans to other species of Candida, probably"
		related to the increased use of azole drugs with a clear trend towards increased
		"antifungal resistance. Finally, the emergence and rise of multiresistant species,"
		"such as Candida auris or Candida glabrata, is a major threat making necessary"
		invasive candidiasis worldwide surveillances. These changes have serious
		"implications for the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of invasive candidiasis."
		Updated knowledge of the current local epidemiology of invasive candidiasis is
		critical for the clinical management.

TI	-	Factors influencing the presence of Candida dubliniensis and other non-albicans
		species in patients with oral lichen planus: a retrospective observational study.
PG	-	333-342
LID	-	10.1007/s00784-021-04004-5 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: The epidemiologic distribution of non-albicans species in the oral
		"cavity of oral lichen planus (OLP) patients remains uncertain. Therefore, the aim"
		of this study was to identify factors associated with the presence of C.
		"dubliniensis and other non-albicans species. Furthermore, independent risk"
		factors for Candida superinfection in OLP should be identified. MATERIAL AND
		METHODS: Epidemiologic data and microbiological findings from 268 symptomatic OLP
		patients who underwent continuous oral swab culture over a 5-year period
		(2015-2019) were retrospectively reviewed. Candida species identification and
		"semi-quantification were obtained by culture on CHROMagar Candida, followed by"
		matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry
		(MALDI-TOF MS). RESULTS: C. albicans was the most frequently isolated species
		"(72.3%), followed by C. glabrata (7.3%), C. dubliniensis (5.8%), C. krusei and C."
		parapsilosis (both 2.6%). The presence of C. dubliniensis was significantly
		associated with tobacco smoking. Other non-albicans spp. were significantly more
		often detected in patients using removable dentures. Increasing age and the
		intake of psychotropic drugs were identified as independent risk factors of
		"Candida superinfection in OLP. CONCLUSION: In OLP patients, certain local and"
		systemic factors increase the risk of carrying potentially drug-resistant Candida
		species and the development of Candida superinfection of OLP lesions. CLINICAL
		"RELEVANCE: Due to the frequent detection of non-albicans species in OLP,"
		resistance or at least reduced sensitivity to azole antifungals should be
		"expected, especially in smokers and patients using removable dentures. In the"
		"case of oral complaints, a superinfection with Candida should be considered,"
		whereby older patients and patients taking psychotropic drugs have an increased
		risk for oral infection with Candida.

TI	-	Spontaneous fungal peritonitis: a rare but severe complication of liver
		cirrhosis.
PG	-	1010-1016
LID	-	10.1097/MEG.0000000000000927 [doi]
AB	-	INTRODUCTION AND AIM: Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is the most common
		infectious complication in cirrhosis. Spontaneous fungal peritonitis is rare and
		"remains unknown. In this work, spontaneous fungal peritonitis as well as risk"
		factors and prognosis are characterized. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective
		case-control study of 253 consecutive admissions by peritonitis in cirrhotic
		patients was carried out between 2006 and 2015. Comparison of patients with
		spontaneous fungal peritonitis (cases) and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis with
		positive microbiologic ascitic fluid culture (controls) was performed. Variables
		"such as sociodemographic and clinical features, cirrhosis etiology, liver"
		"dysfunction scores, ascitic and laboratory parameters, invasive procedures, and"
		"prognosis were evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 231 patients, eight (3.5%) developed"
		"spontaneous fungal peritonitis, 62.5% of cases being coinfected with bacteria."
		"Candida spp. was isolated in 87.5% of cases, mainly Candida albicans (37.5%) and"
		C. krusei (25.0%). Patients with spontaneous fungal peritonitis had higher
		"ascitic fluid lactate dehydrogenase (288.4±266.6 vs. 161.0±179.5; P=0.011), blood"
		"leukocyte count (15187.5±5432.3 vs. 10969.8±6949.5; P=0.028), blood urea nitrogen"
		"(69.8±3.1 vs. 36.3±25.5; P=0.001), higher number of invasive procedures"
		"(colonoscopy: 25.0 vs. 0.8%, P=0.001; urinary catheterization: 87.5 vs. 49.6%,"
		"P=0.038; nasogastric intubation: 87.5 vs. 26.9%, P=0.001), and longer duration of"
		hospital stay (30.0±32.9 vs. 18.9±17.0 days; P=0.031). No statistical difference
		"was found between the two groups for Model for End-Stage Liver Disease, Model for"
		"End-Stage Liver Disease-sodium, and Child-Pugh scores. Spontaneous fungal"
		"peritonitis was associated with a worse prognosis, particularly severe"
		"sepsis/septic shock (87.5 vs. 42.8%, P=0.023), admission in the gastroenterology"
		"intensive care unit (87.5 vs. 24.4%; P=0.001), and overall (62.5 vs. 31.9%;"
		"P=0.039) or 30-day mortality (50.0 vs. 24.4%; P=0.034), with a mean"
		diagnosis-death time of 17.6±11.5 days. CONCLUSION: Despite being a rare
		"condition, spontaneous fungal peritonitis was associated with worse prognosis and"
		"higher mortality than SBP. The ascitic fluid lactate dehydrogenase, blood"
		"leukocyte count and urea nitrogen, invasive procedures, and longer admission time"
		were independent risk factors for spontaneous fungal peritonitis.

LID	-	10.1016/j.ijid.2016.07.001 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Non-albicans Candida (NAC) spp. in immunocompromised patients are
		linked to invasive infections with narrow treatment choice. This study aimed at
		comparing the oral colonization of NAC spp. between HIV and non-HIV infected
		"individuals in Mwanza, Tanzania. METHOD: Oral rinse of 351 HIV-infected and 639"
		non-HIV infected individuals were collected between March and July 2015.
		Phenotypic identifications of Candida spp. was done using Candida Chromogenic
		agar and confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS. RESULTS: NAC spp. were detected in 36/351
		(10.3%) HIV-infected individuals compared to 28/639 (4.4%) of non-HIV infected
		"individuals; P=0.0003. In HIV infected individuals, commonly isolated NAC spp."
		"were Candida tropicalis, 10(2.8%), C. krusei (Issatschenki orientalis) 9(2.6%)"
		and C. glabrata 8(2.3%). While for non-HIV infected individuals C. dubliniensis
		8(1.3%) and C. tropicalis 5(0.9%) were commonly detected. As CD4 count/μl
		decreases by one unit the risk of being colonized by NAC spp. among HIV infected
		"individuals increases by 1% (OR 1.01, 95% CI; 1.001-1.004, P=0.001). CONCLUSION:"
		The prevalence of NAC spp. is high among HIV-infected individuals with low CD4
		count placing them at higher risk of invasive infections. Further studies to
		investigate the role of NAC spp. in causing invasive infections among
		immunocompromised patients are recommended.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating
		autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system. Since immune system
		"plays a key role in this disease, patients with MS can present higher risk of"
		infections. PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of Candida
		spp. in the oral cavity of MS patients in relation to a control group METHODS: In
		"total, 100 individuals were selected: 55 diagnosed with MS and 45 healthy"
		individuals (control group). Saliva samples were collected and seeded in culture
		"media selecting for Candida. Following an incubation period of 48 h,"
		colony-forming units (CFU mL(-1)) were counted and colonies were isolated for
		Candida species identification by multiplex PCR. The results were analysed by
		chi-squared and Mann-Whitney U statistical tests considering a significance level
		of 5%. RESULTS: Candida spp. were confirmed in the oral cavity of 50.09% patients
		in the MS group and 35.55% individuals in the control group. In individuals
		"positive for the growth of Candida spp., the median values of Candida colonies"
		were 220 CFU mL(-1) for the MS group and 120 CFU mL(-1) for the control group.
		"However, no statistically significant differences were observed between groups"
		"for both prevalence and CFU mL(-1) count. Of the Candida species identified,"
		"73.91% were C. albicans, 21.73% C. glabrata, 2.17% C. tropicalis, and 2.17% C."
		krusei. CONCLUSIONS: The colonization of Candida spp. in the oral cavity of
		individuals with multiple sclerosis was higher than in the control group; however
		these findings were not proven to be statistically significant.

TI	-	Prior antimicrobial therapy and risk for hospital-acquired Candida glabrata and
		Candida krusei fungemia: a case-case-control study.
PG	-	4555-60
AB	-	"The incidence of infections caused by Candida glabrata and Candida krusei, which"
		"are generally more resistant to fluconazole than Candida albicans, is increasing"
		"in hospitalized patients. However, the extent to which prior exposure to specific"
		antimicrobial agents increases the risk of subsequent C. glabrata or C. krusei
		candidemia has not been closely studied. A retrospective case-case-control study
		"was performed at a university hospital. From 1998 to 2003, 60 patients were"
		identified with hospital-acquired non-C. albicans candidemia (C. glabrata or C.
		"krusei; case group 1). For comparison, 68 patients with C. albicans candidemia"
		(case group 2) and a common control group of 121 patients without candidemia were
		"studied. Models were adjusted for demographic and clinical risk factors, and the"
		risk for candidemia associated with exposure to specific antimicrobial agents was
		assessed. After adjusting for both nonantimicrobial risk factors and receipt of
		"other antimicrobial agents, piperacillin-tazobactam (odds ratio [OR], 4.15; 95%"
		"confidence interval [CI], 1.04 to 16.50) and vancomycin (OR, 6.48; CI, 2.20 to"
		19.13) were significant risk factors for C. glabrata or C. krusei candidemia. For
		"C. albicans candidemia, no specific antibiotics remained a significant risk after"
		adjusted analysis. Prior fluconazole use was not significantly associated with
		either C. albicans or non-C. albicans (C. glabrata or C. krusei) candidemia. In
		"this single-center study, exposure to antibacterial agents, specifically"
		"vancomycin or piperacillin-tazobactam, but not fluconazole, was associated with"
		subsequent hospital-acquired C. glabrata or C. krusei candidemia. Further studies
		are needed to prospectively analyze specific antimicrobial risks for nosocomial
		candidemia across multiple hospital centers.

AB	-	PURPOSE: This study examined the prevalence of Candida species in the saliva of
		oral squamous cell carcinoma patients and its effect on the mortality rate.
		MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred patients with oral cavity squamous cell
		carcinoma undergoing protocol treatment at Helsinki University Hospital were
		"recruited into the study from March 2011 through 2014. For comparison, 75"
		age-matched controls with no current or previously treated oral cancer were
		recruited. Paraffin-stimulated whole saliva samples were collected and cultivated
		"on CHROMagar Candida medium (CHROMagar, Paris, France) to establish possible"
		"Candida growth. The API ID 32C yeast identification kit (bioMérieux, Lyon,"
		"France) and Bichro-Dubli Fumouze latex agglutination test (Fumouze Diagnostics,"
		"Levallois-Perret, France) were used for further identification of different"
		Candida species. Patients' medical records were studied for information on their
		"health habits and general health status, as well as tumor-related data. The"
		patients' status regarding being alive and cancer free was checked at a follow-up
		point in December 2017. Descriptive statistics and cross tabulation were carried
		"out, and the P value was set at .05. RESULTS: Candida species were detected in"
		"74% of the oral cancer patients' samples, with C. albicans being the most common"
		"species (84%). Other species identified were C. dubliniensis (8%), C. tropicalis"
		"(4%), C. glabrata (3%), C. parapsilosis (3%), C. sake (3%), C. krusei (1%), and"
		"C. guilliermondii (1%). After the follow-up period, 63% of the patients were"
		alive and 86% of them were cancer free. Harboring Candida species in the saliva
		was not associated with any increase in the mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS: C.
		albicans was common in the oral cavity of the oral squamous cell carcinoma
		"patients. However, in this patient population, we did not observe a statistically"
		significant effect of the yeast on the mortality rate.

AB	-	Damage to gut mucosa following conditioning regimens may favour bacterial
		infections that can trigger graft versus host disease (GvHD) in patients
		"undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Rifaximin,"
		"an oral and non-absorbable antibiotic, has been recently proposed as effective"
		prophylaxis to reduce bacterial infections in the gut and consequently acute GvHD
		in this setting. The present study evaluated safety and outcomes of HSCT patients
		that were treated with rifaximin prophylaxis at Perugia University Hospital.
		Rifaximin prophylaxis was introduced as standard of care in HSCT patients in May
		"2018. We retrieved data from 118 consecutive transplants, and we compared the"
		outcomes of rifaximin-treated patients with historical controls that did not
		"receive antibiotic prophylaxis. While incidences of neutropenic fever, documented"
		"bacterial infections, and aGvHD were similar in the two groups, we found an"
		increased frequency of invasive candidiasis and clinically relevant Candida spp.
		"infections in rifaximin-treated patients (5 patients vs 1 patient, 25% [± 0.99%]"
		"vs 1% [± 0.01%], p < .0001). Three rifaximin-treated patients experienced"
		"life-threating candidemia (2 C. krusei, 1 C. orthopsilosis). Rifaximin was the"
		only factor that increased the risk of Candida spp. infections. Rifaximin could
		have contributed to microbiome disruption which favoured an outbreak of
		life-threatening Candida infections. This important complication forced us to
		"halt its use. Larger, prospective studies are needed to assess the impact of"
		"rifaximin prophylaxis on incidence of bacterial infections, aGvHD, and survival"
		of HSCT patients.

		"followed by haematological (15.9%), 'others' (19.2%) and neonatological (4.6%)"
		units. Candida albicans was isolated from 50.96% of episodes; its prevalence was
		"higher in intensive care unit and neonatology (61.22% and 73.33%, respectively),"
		and significantly lower in haematology (22%; P < 0.001). The frequency of C.
		krusei and C. tropicalis was significantly higher (24% and 18%) in haematology
		"(P < 0.02); whereas, the distribution of C. glabrata (14.1%) and C. parapsilosis"
		(13.1%) did not possess statistically significant differences between compared
		departments. Obtained data indicates that species distribution of Candida blood
		"isolates in Polish hospitals reflects worldwide trends, particularly a decrease"
		in the prevalence of infections due to C. albicans.

AB	-	Candidemia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing
		hemodialysis but it has not been well defined in this patient population. We
		"performed a retrospective case-control study to characterize the epidemiology,"
		"microbiology, and outcomes of hemodialysis-associated candidemia. All cases of"
		candidemia at our institution were evaluated from 1 January 2000 until 1
		"September 2004. For each case, two non-candidemic dialysis patients served as"
		"controls. Among 350 cases of candidemia, 78 (22%) occurred in adult hemodialysis"
		"patients. Cases and controls were similar with respect to age, corticosteroid,"
		"antibiotics use, prevalence of diabetes mellitus, liver cirrhosis, surgical"
		"procedures, and cancer. Multivariate analysis found total parenteral nutrition"
		(TPN) (19.5% vs. 1.3%; P<0.0001) and dialysis through a vascular catheter (74%
		vs. 46.8%; P=0.0001) to be independently associated with candidemia.
		Non-C.albicans Candida spp. particularly C. glabrata and C. krusei were more
		common in hemodialysis recipients than in candidemic patients not receiving
		hemodialysis (31% vs. 17% p = 0.009). In-hospital mortality was significantly
		elevated for candidemic vs. non-candidemic hemodialysis recipients (51.9% vs.
		7.8%; P<0.0001). Candidemia in hemodialysis recipients is frequently caused by
		"non-C. albicansCandida species, is associated with TPN and dialysis via a"
		vascular catheter (vs. shunt or fistula) and carries a high mortality rate.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Oral candidiasis is one of the most common opportunistic infection
		in HIV/AIDS patient and it is caused by Candida species. The low absolute
		CD4+T-lymphocyte count has traditionally been cited as the greatest risk factor
		for the development of Oral Candidiasis. The aim of this study was to identify
		"Candida species isolated from the oral cavity of HIV/AIDS patients, to determine"
		their in vitro antifungal susceptibility and to investigate the possible risk
		factors associated with oral candidiasis. METHODS: This was a hospital based
		cross sectional study that was carried out for a period of 3 months amongst
		"HIV/AIDS patients in Kumba District Hospital, whether on HAART or not. Mouth"
		swabs were collected from 378 participants using sterile cotton wool swabs and
		5ml venous blood were collected for determination of CD4 cell. Candida species
		were isolated and identified. Antifungal sensitivity testing was performed using
		modified kirby-bauer susceptibility testing technique. RESULTS: Candida species
		were present in 42.86% of the samples and Candida albicans was the most prevalent
		"(60.2%) amongst the six Candida isolates identified, followed by Candida glabrata"
		"(16.9%), Candida krusei (12.3%), Candida tropicalis (6.4%), Candida parapsilosis"
		"(2.3%) and Candida pseudotropicalis (1.8%). Pregnancy, oral hygiene and"
		antibiotic usage were significantly associated with oral candidiasis in HIV/AIDS
		patients (P<0.05). Oral candidiasis was mostly frequent in HIV/AIDS patients
		between 21-40 years. A CD4 cell count less than 200 cells/μl was a significant
		risk factor for acquiring oral candidiasis in HIV/AIDS patients (P<0.001).
		Nystatin was the most sensitive drug (83.6%) meanwhile ketonazole was the most
		"resistant drug (29.2%), followed by fluconazole (24.6%) to all oral Candida"
		isolates. CONCLUSION: Oral Candida colonization occurs more frequently in
		HIV/AIDS patients and the is a need for the government to implement regular
		"checks for opportunistic infections in HIV/AIDS patients, including oral"
		candidiasis in HIV/AIDS patients to monitor disease progression and prevent
		subsequent complications such as candidemia and diarrhea.

		retrospectively analyzed. The incidence of IC increased during the 10-year
		"period, but the proportion due to NAC did not change significantly in that of 141"
		"cases, 55 (39%) were due to NAC and 86 (61%) to C. albicans (CA). The NAC species"

		"C. parapsilosis (eight of 141, 5.7%), C. krusei (three of 141, 2.1%) and C."
		"lusitaniae (one of 141, 0.71%); other Candida species accounted for four of the"
		141 cases (2.8%). Twenty-one isolates (38%) of NAC were not susceptible to
		fluconazole. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) (OR 4.2; 95% CI 3.5-58; P < 0.001)
		and previous fluconazole therapy (OR 7.7; 95% CI 2.2-27; P = 0.001) were risk
		"factors for invasive NAC candidiasis, whereas patient age ≥65 years (OR 0.37; CI"
		0.16-0.88; P = 0.025) and invasive mechanical ventilation (OR 0.22; CI
		0.069-0.70; P =0.010) were connected with invasive CA candidiasis. Prior
		fluconazole therapy was a risk factor (P = 0.007) for infections caused by NAC
		"not susceptible to fluconazole. In conclusion, TPN and prior fluconazole therapy"
		"are independent risk factors for NAC infection, while prior fluconazole therapy"
		is a risk factor for infection due to NAC not susceptible to fluconazole.

PG	-	1829-35
AB	-	We conducted population-based surveillance for Candida bloodstream infections in
		"Spain to determine its incidence, the extent of antifungal resistance, and risk"
		factors for mortality. A case was defined as the first positive blood culture for
		"any Candida spp. in a resident of Barcelona, from 1 January 2002 to 31 December"
		2003. We defined early mortality as occurring between days 3 to 7 after
		candidemia and late mortality as occurring between days 8 to 30. We detected 345
		"cases of candidemia, for an average annual incidence of 4.3 cases/100,000"
		"population, 0.53 cases/1,000 hospital discharges, and 0.73 cases/10,000"
		"patient-days. Outpatients comprised 11% of the cases, and 89% had a central"
		venous catheter (CVC) at diagnosis. Overall mortality was 44%. Candida albicans
		"was the most frequent species (51% of cases), followed by Candida parapsilosis"
		"(23%), Candida tropicalis (10%), Candida glabrata (8%), Candida krusei (4%), and"
		other species (3%). Twenty-four isolates (7%) had decreased susceptibility to
		"fluconazole (MIC > or = 16 microg/ml). On multivariable analysis, early death was"
		"independently associated with hematological malignancy (odds ratio [OR], 3.5; 95%"
		"confidence interval [CI], 1.1 to 10.4). Treatment with antifungals (OR, 0.05; 95%"
		"CI, 0.01 to 0.2) and removal of CVCs (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1 to 0.9) were"
		"protective factors for early death. Receiving adequate treatment, defined as"
		"having CVCs removed and administration of an antifungal medication (OR, 0.2; 95%"
		"CI, 0.08 to 0.8), was associated with lower odds of late mortality; intubation"
		"(OR, 7.5; 95% CI, 2.6 to 21.1) was associated with higher odds. The incidence of"
		candidemia and prevalence of fluconazole resistance are similar to other European
		"countries, indicating that routine antifungal susceptibility testing is not"
		warranted. Antifungal medication and catheter removal are critical in preventing
		mortality.

PG	-	1328-35
LID	-	10.1017/S0950268809991531 [doi]
AB	-	The incidence of nosocomial candidaemia was evaluated in a retrospective study in
		"a Turkish tertiary-care hospital. Over a 12-year period (1996-2007), a total of"
		"743 episodes of candidaemia occurred in 743 patients, accounting for an average"
		incidence of 1.9 episodes/1000 admissions and 2.9 episodes/10 000 patient-days
		per year. The annual incidence was almost constant during the study period except
		for 1996 when it was significantly higher in comparison with other years
		"(P<0.05). The most common species isolated was Candida albicans (45%), followed"
		"by C. parapsilosis (26%), C. tropicalis (7%), C. krusei (7%), and C. glabrata"
		(3.5%). A significant increase in C. albicans isolates causing candidaemia linked
		to a decrease in C. parapsilosis isolates in adult patients and C. krusei
		isolates in children was found between the two 6-year study periods. This trend
		reflects improved infection control at Uludağ University Hospital. Ninety percent
		of isolates were susceptible to fluconazole (8 microg/ml) and resistance was
		found only in C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis isolates. Regular local
		surveillance of Candida spp. is important in order to develop empirical treatment
		protocols to reduce the incidence and mortality of candidaemia.

AB	-	"INTRODUCTION: In the last years, the incidence of Candida infections in liver"
		transplant recipients has increased with still higher morbidity and mortality.
		"Anidulafungin, a new echinocandin that does not interfere with cytochrome p450,"
		shows no need for dosage adjustment based upon renal or hepatic function or
		weight. AIM: To analyze tolerance to and microbiologic and clinical efficacy of
		Anidulafungin to treat Candida infections in liver transplant patients. MATERIALS
		"AND METHODS: This phase 3b, prospective, open-label, single-center study focused"
		on liver transplant patients with a suspected and/or diagnosed Candida infection.
		"The patients received Anidulafungin intravenously, optionally followed by oral"
		therapy with azoles. The primary endpoint was the global response at the end of
		"therapy; secondary endpoints were the efficacy of intravenous therapy, 90-day"
		"survival, as well as tolerance for and interaction with immunosuppresants."
		RESULTS: We considered 42 consecutive liver recipients transplanted between 2009
		and 2010 among whom 13 (31%) were recruited for the study and four patients were
		"treated with Anidulafungin as empirical therapy, six as preemptive therapy, and"
		three as targeted treatment for documented candidemia (7.1%). The
		immunosuppressive regimen consisted of tacrolimus and low dose of steroids. The
		"Candida species were: C albicans (50%), C glabrata (12.5%), C parapsilosis"
		"(12.5%), C krusei (12.5%), C lusitaniae (6.2%), C tropicalis (6.2%), and multiple"
		"others (25%). The principle site of isolation was the bile (53.8%), followed by"
		"the bloodstream (23.1%), central venous catheters (15.4%), bronchoalveolar lavage"
		"(15.4%), peritoneum (7.7%), and other locations (7.7%). Two patients (15.4%) died"
		of severe sepsis with multiple organ failure. There was no alteration of hepatic
		"enzymes, indices of cholestasis or changes in immunosuppressant drug levels."
		"CONCLUSION: Anidulafungin was an effective, safe, and well-tolerated drug. There"
		were neither toxic effects to the grafts or adverse interactions with
		immunosuppresants.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: This paper aimed to identify and quantify Candida on head and neck
		irradiated patients with two comparative elderly populations. MATERIALS AND
		METHODS: Saliva was sampled from 29 head and neck irradiated patients (group 1)
		34 non-institutionalized elderly patients (group 2) and 29 institutionalized
		"elders (group 3) and matched by age. For quantification, the obtained saliva was"
		"sewed on CHROMagar Candida(®), which was used also for presumptive identification"
		"of Candida, API 20C AUX(®), microculture and RAPD (OPE-18) were used for the"
		"final identification. RESULTS: Among the 92 patients surveyed, 51 (55.4%) had"
		"scores classified as positive for Candida, and among individuals of groups 1 and"
		"3, 58.6% had Candida. There was higher positive/carrier conditions (CFU/sample)"
		"in groups 1 and 3, comparing with group 2 (P=0.011). Gender was not associated"
		with Candida portability (P=0.334). Candida portability was significantly
		associated with the presence of candidosis (P=0.031) and xerostomic state
		"(P=0.007). The isolates and definitive confirmed colonies were Candida albicans,"
		"Candida dubliniensis, Candida tropicalis, Candida krusei, Candida glabrata,"
		"Candida parapsilosis, Candida guilliermondii, Candida lusitaniae, and Candida"
		"kefyr. Among the species identified, C. albicans was the most frequent, followed"
		"by C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis and C. glabrata. C. albicans was more prevalent"
		"in group 2 and 3, 45% and 41.2%, respectively, whereas, the most prevalent"
		"species in group 1 were C. tropicalis (27%), C. albicans and C. parapsilosis"
		"(16.2% for both). On multiple statistical models, only radiotherapic treatment"
		was associated with positiveness to Candida. CONCLUSIONS: Diversification and
		major prevalence of non-albicans species were observed in irradiated patients on
		head and neck and this treatment is straightly associated with fungus
		positiveness.

TI	-	Candidaemia in haematological malignancy patients from a SEIFEM study:
		Epidemiological patterns according to antifungal prophylaxis.
PG	-	900-910
LID	-	10.1111/myc.13130 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candidaemia is an important infectious complication for
		haematological malignancy patients. Antifungal prophylaxis reduces the incidence
		of candidaemia but may be associated with breakthrough candidaemia. OBJECTIVE: To
		analyse the Candida species' distribution and relative antifungal susceptibility
		profiles of candidaemia episodes in relation to the use of antifungal prophylaxis
		among Italian SEIFEM haematology centres. METHODOLOGY: This multicentre
		retrospective observational SEIFEM study included 133 single-species candidaemia
		episodes of haematological malignancy patients for whom antifungal susceptibility
		testing results of blood Candida isolates were available between 2011 and 2015.
		Each participating centre provided both clinical and microbiological data.
		RESULTS: Non-Candida albicans Candida (NCAC) species were the mostly isolated
		"species (89, 66.9%), which accounted for C parapsilosis (35, 26.3%), C glabrata"
		"(16, 12.0%), C krusei (14, 10.5%), C tropicalis (13, 9.8%) and uncommon species"
		"(11, 8.3%). C albicans caused the remaining 44 (33.1%) episodes. Excluding 2"
		"C albicans isolates, 23 of 25 fluconazole-resistant isolates were NCAC species"
		"(14 C krusei, 6 C glabrata, 2 C parapsilosis and 1 C tropicalis). Fifty-six"
		(42.1%) of 133 patients developed breakthrough candidaemia. Systemic antifungal
		"prophylaxis consisted of azoles, especially fluconazole and posaconazole, in 50"
		(89.3%) of 56 patients in whom a breakthrough candidaemia occurred.
		"Interestingly, all these patients tended to develop a C krusei infection (10/56,"
		"P = .02) or a fluconazole-resistant isolate's infection (14/50, P = .04) compared"
		"to patients (4/77 and 10/77, respectively) who did not have a breakthrough"
		candidaemia. CONCLUSIONS: Optimisation of prophylactic strategies is necessary to
		"limit the occurrence of breakthrough candidaemia and, importantly, the emergence"
		of fluconazole-resistant NCAC isolates' infections in haematological malignancy
		patients.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: There is no data available on the prevalence of oral mucosal lesion
		and candida infection among DM patients which necessitate conducting a local or
		nation-wide study to assess the oral mucosa lesions and candida prevalent in
		"diabetic patients in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. OBJECTIVES: The objective of the"
		"present study was to characterize oral mucosa lesions, and the prevalence of"
		yeasts in diabetic patients and their association with the risk factors in
		comparison with a group of non-diabetic controls. METHODS: Study design: A
		cross-sectional comparative study was conducted assuming 50% of the diabetic
		patients have oral lesions compared to nondiabetic patients and a power of 80%
		"with 5% level of significance, the minimum required sample size was estimated to"
		be 115 in each group. The buccal swabs were collected to isolate Candida species
		from the individual patient with a current and former history of diabetes. The
		laboratory findings were collected and the clinical examination of the oral
		mucosa was processed at the department of microbiology. RESULTS: The results
		inferred a significant presence of oral mucosa alterations in the diabetic group.
		A majority of the patients were suffering from type 2 diabetes for the past 10
		"years. C. albicans was the predominant yeast, followed by. C. tropicalis and C."
		krusei nonalbicans species that were most frequently isolated. Diabetes and
		smoking habit were the two risk factors for oral mucosa alterations. CONCLUSIONS:
		The study found a significant presence of oral mucosa alterations in the diabetic
		group and the fungal infection tended to be more in the diabetic group with a
		high incidence of C. albicans. The presence of diabetes and smoking habit were
		two risk factors identified as significant for oral mucosa alterations. The
		significant variation in education level in groups indicates that education would
		help to enhance the prognosis in diabetic patients and healthcare behavior.

LID	-	10.1111/evj.12657 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Yeasts are commensal organisms found in the reproductive and
		"gastrointestinal tracts, and on the skin and other mucosa in mammals. OBJECTIVES:"
		The purpose of this study was to isolate and identify yeast flora in the caudal
		reproductive tract in healthy female horses. STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal study.
		METHODS: A total of 453 samples were collected using double-guarded swabs from
		"the vestibule, clitoral fossa and vagina in 151 horses. All samples were cultured"
		on Sabouraud 4% dextrose agar and incubated at 35°C for 7-10 days. Isolates were
		identified according to their morphological characteristics and biochemical
		profiles. RESULTS: Yeast colonies were isolated from 60 (39.7%) of the 151
		"horses. The isolated yeasts belonged to nine genera, and included Candida spp."
		"(53.2%), Cryptococcus spp. (12.2%), Saccharomyces spp. (10.5%), Geotrichum spp."
		"(8.0%), Rhodotorula spp. (7.1%), Malassezia spp. (3.7%), Trichosporon spp."
		"(2.6%), Kluyveromyces spp. (2.6%) and Sporothrix spp. (0.2%). Candida krusei"
		(43.1%) was the most frequent Candida species isolated. There was a significant
		difference in prevalence between C. krusei and other Candida species (P<0.05).
		The vestibule contained more yeast isolates (48.0%) than the vagina (18.3%). The
		isolation of yeast colonies from multiparous females (76.8%) was significantly
		higher than from maiden mares (P<0.05). MAIN LIMITATIONS: The study was limited
		by the difficulty of distinguishing between normal flora and potential pathogens.
		"CONCLUSIONS: Candida spp., in particular C. krusei, represent important flora"
		resident in the caudal reproductive tract in healthy female horses. This is
		particularly important in contexts that require the initiation of empirical
		treatment prior to the completion of culture results.

LID	-	10.3899/jrheum.100819 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of oral candidiasis and multiple oral
		"Candida infections in patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome (SS), and the"
		clinical and drug susceptibility profile. METHODS: Thirty patients with primary
		SS were enrolled in our study. The diagnosis of oral candidiasis was based on the
		"clinical manifestation, and confirmed by a concentrated rinse culture. Candida"
		spp. assessment was accomplished using standard methods: Sabouraud dextrose agar
		with 50 mg/l chloramphenicol and CHROMagar were used for the rapid screening of
		"clinical species, followed by the API 20C system for further species"
		identification. In vitro antifungal drug susceptibility of Candida isolates was
		"determined by the minimal inhibitory concentrations. RESULTS: In our study, 87%"
		"(26/30) of subjects had oral candidiasis, in which 42% (11/26) had multiple"
		"Candida spp. infection. Although C. albicans remains the predominant isolate,"
		"other rare species such as C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, and C."
		"krusei were present, alone or in combination. Chronic atrophic candidiasis is the"
		most common clinical type of oral candidiasis in patients with SS. The
		susceptibilities of the 44 Candida isolates to 7 antifungal agents varied
		"dramatically. The resistance to azoles was remarkable, and the phenomenon of"
		cross-resistance between itraconazole and fluconazole was observed. CONCLUSION:
		Patients with primary SS carry a high risk of oral candidiasis and a high
		frequency of multiple Candida infections. The azole resistance patterns of
		Candida spp. support the necessity for drug susceptibility testing as a routine
		procedure for patients with oral Candida infections.

AB	-	Candidemia is a growing problem in hospitals all over the world. Despite advances
		"in the medical support of critically ill patients, candidiasis leads to prolonged"
		"hospitalization, and has a crude mortality rate around 50%. We conducted a"
		multicenter surveillance study in 16 hospitals distributed across five regions of
		"Brazil to assess the incidence, species distribution, antifungal susceptibility,"
		and risk factors for bloodstream infections due to Candida species. From June
		"2007 to March 2010, we studied a total of 2,563 nosocomial bloodstream infection"
		(nBSI) episodes. Candida spp. was the 7th most prevalent agent. Most of the
		"patients were male, with a median age of 56 years. A total of 64 patients (46.7%)"
		were in the ICU when candidemia occurred. Malignancies were the most common
		underlying condition (32%). The crude mortality rate of candidemia during the
		hospital admission was 72.2%. Non-albicans species of Candida accounted for 65.7%
		"of the 137 yeast isolates. C. albicans (34.3%), Candida parapsilosis (24.1%),"
		Candida tropicalis (15.3%) and Candida glabrata (10.2%) were the most prevalent
		species. Only 47 out of 137 Candida isolates were sent to the reference
		"laboratory for antifungal susceptibility testing. All C. albicans, C. tropicalis"
		and C. parapsilosis isolates were susceptible to the 5 antifungal drugs tested.
		"Among 11 C. glabrata isolates, 36% were resistant to fluconazole, and 64% SDD."
		All of them were susceptible to anidulafungin and amphotericin B. We observed
		that C. glabrata is emerging as a major player among non-albicans Candida spp.
		and fluconazole resistance was primarily confined to C. glabrata and C. krusei
		strains. Candida resistance to echinocandins and amphotericin B remains rare in
		Brazil. Mortality rates remain increasingly higher than that observed in the
		"Northern Hemisphere countries, emphasizing the need for improving local practices"
		"of clinical management of candidemia, including early diagnosis, source control"
		and precise antifungal therapy.

TI	-	Candida glabrata and Candida krusei fungemia after high-risk allogeneic marrow
		transplantation: no adverse effect of low-dose fluconazole prophylaxis on
		incidence and outcome.
PG	-	873-8
AB	-	"Candidemia is a serious complication in patients following allogeneic blood,"
		"marrow, and organ transplantation. Fourteen patients developed nosocomial"
		fungemia among 204 allogeneic marrow transplants performed during 1997-1999.
		Incidence of hematogenous candidiasis was 6.8 per 100 allogeneic BMT. All 14 had
		an indwelling central venous catheter (CVC) and fluconazole (100-200 mg daily)
		"was given prophylactically. In 11 (78.5%) neutropenic patients, duration between"
		"agranulocytosis and diagnosis of fungemia was (median, +/- s.d.) 10 +/- 8 days."
		"Candida glabrata (53.3%) was the most common yeast species, followed by C. krusei"
		"(33.3%), and C. parapsilosis (13.3%). Candida albicans was conspicuously absent."
		Ten patients (71.4%) had primary transplant-related complication (>2 days)
		including hemolytic uremic syndrome/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (HUS/TTP)
		"(n = 5), severe hemorrhagic cystitis (n = 3), and bacteremia (n = 2). Seven"
		(50.0%) patients expired and in three (21.4%) deaths were attributed to fungemia.
		The impact of a primary transplant-related complication on short-term survival in
		this setting was not significant (P = 0.07) (HUS/TTP (P > 0.5); neutropenia (P >
		0.5); GVHD (P = 0.35)). Removal of CVC did not alter outcome in our group (P > or
		"= 0.5) although in patients with persistent fungemia (>72 h), and those with"
		"preceding bacteremia, mortality was significantly higher (P = 0.002)."
		Conventional prognosticators of poor outcome did not adversely effect short-term
		survival in our transplant recipients with hematogenous candidiasis. The
		predominance of C. glabrata and C. krusei breakthrough infections was similar to
		"what is seen with high-dose fluconazole (400 mg) prophylaxis, and no adverse"
		effects of low-dose fluconazole in terms of increased incidence of
		non-susceptible Candida species was seen.

AB	-	PURPOSE OF RESEARCH: The aim of the current study was gut profiling of culturable
		Candida species and their possible pathogenic potential to asses role in obesity.
		METHODS: This case control study includes stool samples from 75 obese individuals
		and 50 controls. Isolation and identification of various Candida species was
		"carried out by standard microbiological techniques. For pathogenic profiling,"
		"extracellular enzymatic assays, biofilm forming ability and resistance to azole"
		were analyzed. RESULTS: Culturable gut profiling identified comparative higher
		abundance and diversity of Candida species among obese compared to controls. The
		most abundant specie among both groups was C.kefyr. A comparatively higher
		"pathogenic potential as more hydrolases expression was detected in C.kefyr,"
		C.albicans and Teunomyces krusei from obese group. Majority isolates from obese
		group were strong biofilm formers (47.1%) compared to control group (35.4%)
		suggesting it as strong risk factor for obesity. Fluconazole resistance was
		highest among C.kefyr (51%) followed by Teunomyces krusei and C.albicans. All the
		isolates from different species were voriconazole sensitive except C.kefyr
		displaying a 4.2% resistance in obese group only. A significant association of
		"dominant colonizing species with meat, fruit/vegetable consumption and residence"
		area was present (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The presence of hydrolytic enzymes in
		gut Candida species showed strong association with protein's degradation and
		enhanced pathogenicity. C.kefyr and Teunomyces krusei has emerged as potential
		pathogen showing increased colonization as result of protein rich and low carb
		diet. Thus presenting it as a bad choice for weight loss in obese individuals.

		incidence of fungaemia and numbers of isolates with reduced azole susceptibility.
PG	-	487-94
LID	-	10.1111/j.1469-0691.2008.01954.x [doi]
AB	-	A semi-national laboratory-based surveillance programme for fungaemia was
		initiated in 2003 that now covers c. 3.5 million inhabitants (64%) of the Danish
		"population. In total, 1089 episodes of fungaemia were recorded during 2004-2006,"
		corresponding to an annual incidence of 10.4/100 000 inhabitants. The annual
		number of episodes increased by 17% during the study period. Candida spp.
		accounted for 98% of the fungal pathogens. Although Candida albicans remained
		"predominant, the proportion of C. albicans decreased from 66.1% in 2004 to 53.8%"
		"in 2006 (p <0.01), and varied considerably among participating departments, e.g.,"
		from 51.1% at a university hospital in Copenhagen to 67.6% in North Jutland
		"County. Candida glabrata ranked second, and increased in proportion from 16.7% to"
		"22.7% (p 0.04). Candida krusei was isolated rarely (4.1%), but the proportion"
		doubled during the study period from 3.2% to 6.4% (p 0.06). MIC distributions of
		amphotericin B and caspofungin were in close agreement with the patterns
		"predicted by species identification; however, decreased susceptibility to"
		"voriconazole, defined as an MIC of >1 mg/L, was detected in one (2.5%) C."
		"glabrata isolate in 2004 and in 12 (14.0%) isolates in 2006 (p 0.03). Overall,"
		the proportion of isolates with decreased susceptibility to fluconazole exceeded
		30% in 2006. The incidence of fungaemia in Denmark was three-fold higher than
		that reported from other Nordic countries and is increasing. Decreased
		"susceptibility to fluconazole is frequent, and a new trend towards C. glabrata"
		isolates with elevated voriconazole MICs was observed.

LID	-	10.1080/13693780903161216 [doi]
AB	-	This study presents data on the incidence of candidemia in a Portuguese oncology
		hospital during a 6-year period. The species distribution and their antifungal
		"susceptibility, as well as the clinical outcomes associated with candidemia were"
		"evaluated. A total of 119 episodes were reported, with the majority occurring"
		among patients older than 56 years. The most common underlying medical conditions
		were solid tumors (64.5%) and hematological disease (28.2%). The most frequent
		"species found was Candida albicans (48.7%), followed by C. parapsilosis (20.2%),"
		"C. tropicalis (8.4%), C. krusei (6.7%) and C. glabrata (5.0%), but Saccharomyces"
		cerevisiae and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa were also isolated. Candida albicans was
		more frequently associated with solid tumors of the gastrointestinal and
		"genitourinary tracts and breast (P=0.005), while non-C. albicans Candida species"
		were most frequently recovered from hematological patients (P=0.007). The
		mortality rate associated with candidemia was 31.9% (P=0.016). All C. albicans
		"and C. parapsilosis isolates were susceptible to fluconazole, voriconazole and"
		itraconazole. Resistance to caspofungin was only observed in C. albicans and in
		the R. mucilaginosa isolates. Posaconazole was active against all C. parapsilosis
		"isolates tested but resistant strains were found among C. albicans (4.9%), C."
		"tropicalis (12.5%), C. krusei (25%) and C. glabrata (50%). This study provides"
		useful information regarding the local epidemiology of candidemia in cancer
		patients.

TI	-	Prevalence and antifungal susceptibility of 442 Candida isolates from blood and
		other normally sterile sites: results of a 2-year (1996 to 1998) multicenter
		"surveillance study in Quebec, Canada."
PG	-	949-53
AB	-	"During a 2-year surveillance program (1996 to 1998) in Quebec, Canada, 442"
		strains of Candida species were isolated from 415 patients in 51 hospitals. The
		"distribution of species was as follows: Candida albicans, 54%; C. glabrata, 15%;"
		"C. parapsilosis, 12%; C. tropicalis, 9%; C. lusitaniae, 3%; C. krusei, 3%; and"
		"Candida spp., 3%. These data, compared to those of a 1985 survey, indicate"
		"variations in species distribution, with the proportions of C. glabrata and C."
		"parapsilosis increasing by 9 and 4%, respectively, and those of C. albicans and"
		"C. tropicalis decreasing by 10 and 7%, respectively. However, these differences"
		are statistically significant for C. glabrata and C. tropicalis only. MICs of
		"amphotericin B were > or =4 microg/ml for 3% of isolates, all of which were"
		non-C. albicans species. Three percent of C. albicans isolates were resistant to
		flucytosine (> or =32 microg/ml). Resistance to itraconazole (> or =1 microg/ml)
		"and fluconazole (> or =64 microg/ml) was observed, respectively, in 1 and 1% of"
		"C. albicans, 14 and 9% of C. glabrata, 5 and 0% of C. tropicalis, and 0% of C."
		parapsilosis and C. lusitaniae isolates. Clinical data were obtained for 343
		"patients. The overall crude mortality rate was 38%, reflecting the multiple"
		serious underlying illnesses found in these patients. Bloodstream infections were
		"documented for 249 patients (73%). Overall, systemic triazoles had been"
		administered to 10% of patients before the onset of candidiasis. The frequency of
		isolation of non-C. albicans species was significantly higher in this group of
		"patients. Overall, only two C. albicans isolates were found to be resistant to"
		"fluconazole. These were obtained from an AIDS patient and a leukemia patient,"
		"both of whom had a history of previous exposure to fluconazole. At present, it"
		appears that resistance to fluconazole in Quebec is rare and is restricted to
		patients with prior prolonged azole treatment.

		large outbreak of Candida krusei bloodstream infections among infants in Gauteng
		"Province, South Africa, during a 4-month period; a series of candidemia and"
		bacteremia outbreaks in the neonatal unit followed. We detected cases by using
		enhanced laboratory surveillance and audited hospital wards by environmental
		"sampling and epidemiologic studies. During July-October 2014, among 589 patients,"
		48 unique cases of C. krusei candidemia occurred (8.2% incidence). Risk factors
		"for candidemia on multivariable analyses were necrotizing enterocolitis,"
		"birthweight <1,500 g, receipt of parenteral nutrition, and receipt of blood"
		"transfusion. Despite initial interventions, outbreaks of bloodstream infection"
		"caused by C. krusei, rarer fungal species, and bacterial pathogens continued in"
		"the neonatal unit through July 29, 2016. Multiple factors contributed to these"
		outbreaks; the most functional response is to fortify infection prevention and
		control.

TI	-	Blood stream infections by Candida glabrata and Candida krusei: a single-center
		experience.
PG	-	263-9
LID	-	10.3904/kjim.2009.24.3.263 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND/AIMS: The increasing incidence of Candida glabrata and Candida krusei
		infections is a significant problem because they are generally more resistant to
		fluconazole. We compared the risk factors associated with C. glabrata and C.
		krusei fungemia with Candida albicans fungemia and examined the clinical
		manifestations and prognostic factors associated with candidemia. METHODS: We
		"retrospectively reviewed demographic data, risk factors, clinical manifestations,"
		and outcomes associated with C. glabrata and C. krusei fungemia at a
		tertiary-care teaching hospital during a 10-years period from 1997 to 2006.
		"RESULTS: During the study period, there were 497 fungemia episodes. C. glabrata"
		fungemia accounted for 23 episodes and C. krusei fungemia accounted for 8.
		Complete medical records were available for 27 of these episodes and form the
		"basis of this study. Compared to 54 episodes of C. albicans fungemia, renal"
		insufficiency and prior fluconazole prophylaxis were associated with development
		of C. glabrata or C. krusei fungemia. The overall mortality was 67%. The
		fungemia-related mortality of C. glabrata and C. krusei was higher than that of
		"C. albicans (52 vs. 26%, p=0.021). Empirical antifungal therapy did not decrease"
		the crude mortality. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that high
		"APACHE II scores, catheter maintenance, and shock were independently associated"
		with an increased risk of death. CONCLUSIONS: Renal insufficiency and prior
		fluconazole prophylaxis were associated with the development of C. glabrata or C.
		krusei fungemia. Fungemia-related mortality of C. glabrata or C. krusei was
		higher than that of C. albicans. Outcomes appeared to be related to catheter
		"removal, APACHE II scores, and shock."

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candidiasis is the commonest opportunistic fungal infection in
		patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). CD4+ lymphocyte counts
		have been found to be a marker of HIV disease progression. AIM: This study
		"focused on determining the spectrum of Candida isolates in urine, stool, and oral"
		specimens among HIV patients in a tertiary hospital. METHODS: A total of 300
		subjects comprising of 200 HIV patients and 100 non-HIV subjects were used for
		"this study. Three samples (urine, stool, and oral swab) were collected from each"
		subject. Each specimen was processed using standard microbiological techniques
		and emergent Candida isolates were identified with CHROMagar™ Candida and sugar
		fermentation tests. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of Candida colonisation among
		HIV patients was 52.5%. HAART-naive patients had a significantly higher
		prevalence (OR = 3.65; 95% CI = 2.03-6.56; p<0.0001) than their counterpart on
		highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) (OR = 1.99; 95% CI = 1.13-3.50;
		p=0.0232). Female gender was a significant risk factor for acquiring Candida
		infection (OR = 3.40; 95% CI = 1.14-10.13; p=0.0289). The effect of age on
		prevalence of candidiasis was observed among HIV patients on HAART (p=0.0161). A
		CD4+ count <200 cells/µl was a significant risk factor for acquiring candidal
		infection only among HAART-naive patients (OR = 4.37; 95% CI = 1.60-11.95;
		p=0.0042). The five species of Candida recovered from this study were C.
		"albicans, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, and C. glabrata. CONCLUSION:"
		"There is a significant relationship between antiretroviral therapy, CD4+ counts,"
		and the prevalence of candidiasis.

LID	-	10.1093/cid/cix1095 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Blood cultures are approximately 50% sensitive for diagnosing
		invasive candidiasis. The T2Candida nanodiagnostic panel uses T2 magnetic
		resonance and a dedicated instrument to detect Candida directly within whole
		"blood samples. METHODS: Patients with Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida"
		"parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, or Candida krusei candidemia were identified at"
		14 centers using diagnostic blood cultures (dBCs). Follow-up blood samples were
		collected concurrently for testing by T2Candida and companion cultures (cBCs).
		"T2Candida results are reported qualitatively for C. albicans/C. tropicalis, C."
		"glabrata/C. krusei, and C. parapsilosis. T2Candida and cBCs were positive if they"
		detected a species present in the dBC. RESULTS: Median time between collection of
		"dBC and T2Candida/cBC samples in 152 patients was 55.5 hours (range, 16.4-148.4)."
		"T2Candida and cBCs were positive in 45% (69/152) and 24% (36/152) of patients,"
		"respectively (P < .0001). T2Candida clinical sensitivity was 89%, as positive"
		results were obtained in 32/36 patients with positive cBCs. Combined test results
		"were both positive (T2+/cBC+), 21% (32/152); T2+/cBC-, 24% (37/152); T2-/cBC+, 3%"
		"(4/152); and T2-/cBC-, 52% (79/152). Prior antifungal therapy, neutropenia, and"
		C. albicans candidemia were independently associated with T2Candida positivity
		and T2+/cBC- results (P values < .05). CONCLUSIONS: T2Candida was sensitive for
		diagnosing candidemia at the time of positive blood cultures. In patients
		"receiving antifungal therapy, T2Candida identified bloodstream infections that"
		were missed by cBCs. T2Candida may improve care by shortening times to Candida
		"detection and species identification compared to blood cultures, retaining"
		sensitivity during antifungal therapy and rendering active candidemia unlikely if
		results are negative. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: NCT01525095.

		patients: A matter of concern?
PG	-	e22343
LID	-	10.1002/jcla.22343 [doi]
LID	-	e22343
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Among the fungal pathogens, Candida species are the most common cause"
		of urinary tract infection (UTI). Some predisposing factors such as diabetes
		"mellitus, urinary retention, urinary stasis, renal transplantation, and"
		hospitalization can increase the risk of candiduria. The aim of this
		cross-sectional study was to evaluate candiduria among type 2 diabetic patients
		and identification of the Candida isolates. METHOD: Four hundred clean-catch
		midstream urine specimens were obtained from patients with type 2 diabetes
		mellitus. The specimens were centrifuged and the sediments were examined by
		direct examination and cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar. The plates were
		incubated for 2-3 days at 35°C. The Candida colonies were counted and purified
		using CHROMagar Candida. The isolates were identified by matrix-assisted laser
		desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) system.
		"RESULTS: Of the 400 urine specimens, 40 (10%) had positive cultures for Candida"
		species with a colony count of ≥1 × 10(3) colony forming units (CFU)/mL. The
		"frequencies of the Candida species were as follows: C. albicans (n = 19, 47.5%),"
		"C. glabrata (n = 15, 37.5%), C. kefyer (n = 4, 10%) and C. krusei (n = 2, 5%)."
		Seventy-three (88%) of the patients with candiduria had hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)
		levels above 7%. CONCLUSION: The rate of candiduria was relatively high in type 2
		diabetic patients and they were also suffering from a lack of proper blood
		glucose control. Although the frequency of non-albicans Candida species had not
		"significantly higher than C. albicans, however, they obtained more from those"
		with symptomatic candiduria.

PG	-	369-74
AB	-	"OBJECTIVE: To examine the incidence, epidemiology, and clinical characteristics"
		of candidemia in a pediatric intensive care unit. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort
		study. SETTING: Pediatric intensive care unit of a tertiary care teaching and
		referral hospital in north India. SUBJECTS: All patients with candidemia from
		March 1993 to December 1996. INTERVENTIONS: Patient-related data were analyzed to
		"study candidemia in relation to reason for fungal culture, underlying medical"
		"conditions, predisposing factors, Candida isolates, antimicrobial and antifungal"
		"treatment, and deaths. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Sixty-four patients with"
		candidemia were identified. The Candida species isolated were Candida tropicalis
		"(48.4%), C. albicans (29.7%), C. guillermondii (14.1%), C. krusei (6.3%), and C."
		glabrata (1.6%). Thirty-three patients were detected by a high-risk surveillance
		"blood culture, whereas 31 patients were detected while undergoing septic workup."
		Sixteen (25%) patients were asymptomatic; they recovered without any antifungal
		"therapy and without any sequelae. Of 48 symptomatic patients, 11 died before"
		institution of antifungal therapy; 37 received oral itraconazole (10
		mg.kg(-1).day(-1)). Seven (19%) of these 37 patients died. Those who recovered
		"had sterile culture on average by day 14 (range, 4-30) and received the"
		"antifungal therapy on average for 24 days (range, 9-42 days). Overall mortality"
		"rate was 28.1%, and bivariate analysis showed significant association with"
		"Pediatric Risk of Mortality score (p =.0001), presence of symptoms (p =.003),"
		isolation of nonalbicans Candida in general (p =.04) and C. tropicalis
		"specifically (p =.001), and failure to give presumptive antifungal therapy (p"
		"=.055). On multivariate analysis, Pediatric Risk of Mortality score and isolation"
		of C. tropicalis were the only significant predictors of mortality. CONCLUSIONS:
		Nonalbicans Candida accounted for 70% of candidemia in a pediatric intensive care
		unit. High-risk surveillance blood cultures aided diagnosis in about half the
		patients. Severity of illness and isolation of C. tropicalis were significant
		predictors of mortality.

TI	-	Identification of Candida strains isolated from Tanzanian pregnant women with
		vaginal candidiasis.
PG	-	226-34
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To identify Candida strains isolated from Tanzanian women (13 to 45
		years) with vaginal candidiasis. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. SETTING:
		"Antenatal clinic in Ilala district hospital in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania from March"
		1998 to December 2000. RESULTS: The identities of the 272 isolates tested with
		"API Candida were: Candida albicans 180(66.2%), Candida tropicalis 13(4.7%),"
		"Candida glabrata 20(7.35%), Candida famata 6(2.2%), Candida parapsilosis 6 (2.2%)"
		and Candida lusitaniae one (0.37%). API Candida could not speciate 43 (15.8%)
		"isolates of these; two (0.7%) fell between C. albicans and C. tropicalis,"
		"17(6.25%) C. lusitaniael, C. guilliermondii/C. famata, 14(5.15%) C. krusei, C."
		"inconspicua, and C. norvegensis and nine (3.3%) either C. parapsilosis, C."
		"krusei, C. incospicua or Geotrichum spp. Four (1.5%) isolates had an assimilation"
		"pattern of Trichosporo spp, but were all germ tube positive and had morphological"
		features on cornemeal agar that were consistent with C. albicans. API 20C AUX was
		"used for testing 29 isolates and results showed: 11/29 (37.9%) C. albicans, 1/29"
		"(3.4%) C. tropicalis, 4/29 (13.8%) C. glabrata, 1/29 (3.4%) C. parapsilosis, 1/29"
		"(3.4%) C. famata, 1/29 (3.4%) C. lusitaniae, 1/29 (3.4%) C. colliculosa/C."
		"magnoliae, 5/29(17.2%) C. albicans/ C. tropicals 2/29 (6.8%) C. norvegensis/C."
		"parapsilosis, and 2/29(6.8%) C. kruseil/C. inconspicua. Results of 20 isolates"
		identified by Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPID) technique showed a 95%
		agreement with API Candida and a 100% agreement with API 20C AUX. CONCLUSION:
		Although most (66.3%) of the species isolated from Dar es Salaam women with
		"vaginal candidiasis were C. albicans, a considerable percentage (33.7%) were"
		"non-albicans, mainly C. glabrata, C. krusei and C. tropicalis. The high"
		prevalence of non-albicans Candida spp observed in this population may have
		therapeutic implications.

AB	-	"Many uncommon Candida spp. (species other than C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, C."
		"glabrata, C. tropicalis, and C. krusei) have been shown to emerge in tertiary"
		care facilities. We aimed to investigate these uncommon candidemia in children.
		Forty-six cases of candidemia caused by uncommon Candida spp. were identified
		during 2003-2015 from a medical center in Taiwan. The most common specie was C.
		"guilliermondii (31.2%), followed by C. lusitaniae (18.8%) and C. metapsilosis"
		(18.8%). These cases were analyzed and compared with 148 episodes of C. albicans
		candidemia. The incidence density of uncommon Candida spp. candidemia and the
		proportion to all candidemia episodes increased substantively during the study
		"period. Prior exposure to azoles was uncommon in the 30 days prior to infection,"
		"but fluconazole resistant strains were significantly more common (n = 19, 41.3%)."
		The increased incidence density of uncommon Candida spp. candidemia was
		associated with increasing use of antifungal agents. No differences in
		"demographics, underlying comorbidities, risk factors, clinical features,"
		"dissemination, and 30-day mortality were found between uncommon Candida spp. and"
		C. albicans candidemia. Patients with uncommon Candida spp. candidemia were more
		likely to require modifications in antifungal treatment and receive echinocandin
		"drugs (43.5% vs 21.6%, p = 0.007). Candidemia caused by uncommon Candida spp. had"
		"poorer response to antifungal treatment, led to longer duration of candidemia"
		"(median 4.0 versus 2.5 days, p = 0.008), and had a higher treatment failure rate"
		"(56.5% vs 38.5%, p = 0.040)."

TI	-	Successful eradication of chronic symptomatic Candida krusei urinary tract
		infection with increased dose micafungin in a liver and kidney transplant
		recipient: Case report and review of the literature.
PG	-	e13118
LID	-	10.1111/tid.13118 [doi]
AB	-	Treatment of symptomatic candiduria is notoriously challenging because of the
		limited repository of antifungals that achieve adequate urinary concentrations.
		"Fluconazole, amphotericin B-based products, and flucytosine are established"
		treatment options for most Candida species. Candida krusei exhibits intrinsic
		resistance to fluconazole and decreased susceptibility to amphotericin B and
		"flucytosine. In transplant patients, both amphotericin B-based products and"
		flucytosine are less desirable because of their toxicities. Other triazole
		antifungals are unappealing because they do not achieve adequate urinary
		"concentrations, have multiple toxicities, and interact with transplant-related"
		immunosuppressive medications. Echinocandins are well-tolerated but have been
		traditionally deferred in the treatment of symptomatic funguria because of their
		poor urinary concentrations but there is a small but emerging body of literature
		"supporting their use. Here, we present a case of successful eradication of"
		chronic symptomatic C krusei urinary tract infection with micafungin 150
		"milligrams daily in a liver and kidney transplant recipient, and we review the"
		literature on treatment of symptomatic candiduria.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: There are few recent studies evaluating trends in the epidemiology of
		candidemia including changes in species or utilization of antifungal agents in
		children. METHODS: We performed a retrospective case series of candidemia at our
		children's hospital from 2002 to 2006. Our objectives were to study trends in the
		"rates of candidemia, demographic characteristics, Candida species, antifungal"
		"susceptibility, and antifungal utilization. These data were obtained from the"
		electronic medical records. RESULTS: There were 203 episodes of candidemia in 154
		"subjects. During the study period, the average rate of candidemia was 5.52 per"
		1000 patient-discharges and did not change throughout the study. The mean and
		"median ages of subjects were 3 years versus 9 months, respectively, and 38% were"
		less than 3 months of age. Gastrointestinal disorders were a common comorbid
		"condition (33%), especially for subjects with multiple episodes of candidemia."
		"Overall, Candida parapsilosis and Candida albicans caused 43% and 26% of"
		"episodes, respectively, and candidemia caused by Candida glabrata (5.3%-23%) and"
		Candida krusei (0%-8.5%) increased during the study. Ninety-eight percent of C.
		albicans and C. parapsilosis isolates remained susceptible to all antifungal
		"drugs. From 2003-2006, the use of antifungal agents increased from 79 days to 150"
		days per 1000 hospital-days. CONCLUSIONS: While antifungal use at our hospital
		"increased, candidemia rates remained stable. C. parapsilosis was the most common"
		species but other non-C. albicans species increased during the study period.
		Local epidemiology should be monitored in pediatric populations for potential
		impact on management strategies.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candida is the commonest opportunistic fungi in human. Candida
		species cause diverse types of diseases. Vaginal candidiasis has been reported as
		one of the most common type of fungal diseases among pregnant women. However; In
		"Ethiopia, due to scarcity of data, much has not been documented regarding the"
		prevalence of Candida among pregnant women. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to
		"determine the prevalence, possible risk factors and antifungal susceptibility"
		profile of Candida species among pregnant women attending Debre Markos Referral
		"Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was conducted from"
		February to May 2017. A total of 384 pregnant women were included using a
		"systematic random sampling technique. Vaginal specimens were collected,"
		inoculated on Candida HiV eg culture Medium and incubated at 37 °C for
		24 h.Colonies were identified using standard microbiological methods and selected
		for further Candida Species identification using Hi Chrome agar and germ tube
		test. Fungal suspensions were made and adjusted at 0.5% MacFarland standard.
		Modified Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion technique was used for antifungal
		"susceptibility. Data was entered, cleaned using Ep info version 7.1and"
		transported to Statistical Packages for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21 for
		analysis. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were performed. P. value
		< 0.05 at 95% confidence interval was considered as statistically significant.
		"RESULT: From a total of 384 study participants, 96 (25%) were positive for"
		Candida species. The predominant Candida species was Candida albicans 54(56.25%)
		"followed by Candida krusei 21(21.9%), Candida glabrata 17(17.7%), Candida"
		tropicalis 1(1%) and 3(3.1%) were other Candida species. Contraceptive use (AOR:
		0.394; 95% CI = 0.20-0.74) and prolonged antibiotic uses (AOR: 0.393; 95%
		CI = 0.21-0.72) were risk factors. All isolates except Candida krusei were 100%
		susceptible to amphotericin-B. Resistance rate was high against itraconazole and
		Ketoconazole 55(57.3%). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of Candida species among
		symptomatic pregnant women was significantly higher than asymptomatic pregnant
		women. Age group between 26 and 40 years was significantly associated with
		Candida infection. Amphotericin B was the most sensitive antifungal drug. High
		rate of multiple drugs resistant Candida species was detected. Therefore
		Symptomatic women should be routinely screened and treated.

TI	-	Distributions and antifungal susceptibility of Candida species from mucosal sites
		in HIV positive patients.
PG	-	282-7
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Mucocutaneous candidiasis (almost endogenous) is one of the most
		common manifestations of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The aim of
		"this study was the investigation of colonization patterns of Candida species,"
		"particularly C. dubliniensis, among mucosal sites of HIV-positive patients and"
		determining corresponding in vitro susceptibility patterns to the antifungals.
		"METHODS: From July 2006 to May 2008, specimens from the mucosal sites of 273"
		seropositive HIV patients were collected for Candida colonization. All isolates
		were identified by standard methods and carbohydrate assimilation patterns.
		Isolates phenotypically identified as C. albicans or C. dubliniensis were
		subjected to molecular identification. Susceptibility patterns of the isolated
		species to seven antifungal agents were determined using the broth microdilution
		method. RESULTS: The 359 samples from mucosal sites which consisted of 273 oral
		and 86 vaginal were collected and evaluated for Candida species distributions and
		their corresponding susceptibility patterns. The most commonly isolated species
		"were: C. albicans (50%) followed by C. glabrata (21.4%), C. dubliniensis (13.3%,"
		"reported for the first time in Iran), C. krusei (9.8%), C. kefyr (3.1%), C."
		"parapsilosis (1.6%), and C. tropicalis (0.8%). All species were sensitive to"
		"amphotencin B, ketoconazole, nystatin, voriconazole, and caspofungin. In some"
		"isolates, resistance to fluconazole and itraconazole was noted. CONCLUSION: As"
		"demonstrated, resistance to fluconazole and itraconazole, the most frequent"
		antifungals in use in the region suggests regular investigation into antifungal
		resistance in medical centers should be undertaken in order to promote the
		effective management of invasive candidiasis in HIV/AIDS patients.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candida yeasts are considered the main agents of nosocomial fungal
		infections. AIMS: This study aimed to establish the epidemiological profile of
		"patients with candiduria hospitalized in the capital of the State of Mato Grosso,"
		in the Central-Western region of Brazil. METHODS: Patients from three private
		hospitals and a public hospital participated in the study. This was an
		observational and cross-sectional study including analysis of patients mortality.
		It was carried out from March to August 2015. RESULTS: A total of 93 patients
		with candiduria were evaluated. Candida tropicalis was found most commonly
		"(37.6%; n=35), followed by Candida albicans (36.6%; n=34), Candida glabrata"
		"(19.3%; n=18), psilosis complex (4.3%; n=4), Candida lusitaniae (1.1%; n=1) and"
		Candida krusei (1.1%; n=1). Antibiotic therapy (100%) and the use of an
		indwelling urinary catheter (89.2%; n=83) were the most frequent predisposing
		"factors. Antifungal treatment was given to 65.6% of the patients, and"
		anidulafungin was the most used antifungal. Mortality rates were 48% higher among
		patients with candiduria who had renal failure. Micafungin was the antifungal
		most prescribed among the patients who died. Candidemia concomitant with
		candiduria occurred in eight (8.6%; n=8) cases. Considering the species recovered
		"in the blood and urine, only one patient had genetically distinct clinical"
		"isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Non-C. albicans Candida species were predominant, with C."
		tropicalis being the most responsible for most cases of candiduria.

		patients.
PG	-	2659-64
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candida krusei is inherently resistant to fluconazole and is emerging
		as a frequent cause of fungemia in patients with hematologic malignant neoplasms.
		OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk and prognostic factors associated with C krusei
		fungemia in comparison with Candida albicans fungemia in patients with cancer.
		METHODS: Retrospective study of 57 cases of C krusei fungemia occurring at the M.
		"D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Tex, from 1989 to 1996. The C krusei cases"
		"were compared with 57 cases of C albicans fungemia with respect to demographics,"
		"underlying cancer, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score,"
		"immunosuppression status, chemotherapy, and the use of central venous catheters,"
		"as well as fluconazole prophylaxis. RESULTS: At our institution, C krusei"
		accounted for 5% of fungemias during 1989 through 1992 and for 10% during 1993
		through 1996. Patients with C krusei fungemia more often had leukemia than
		"patients with C albicans (77% vs 11%; P =.02), whereas catheter-related"
		infections were more common among patients with C albicans fungemia (42% vs 0%;
		P<.001). Patients with C krusei fungemia had a lower response rate (51% vs 69%; P
		"=.05), largely because they more frequently were neutropenic and had disseminated"
		infection. Mortality related to fungemia was 49% in the cases with C krusei vs
		28% in C albicans. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that persistent
		neutropenia (P =.02) and septic shock (P =.002) were predictors of poor
		"prognosis. CONCLUSION: In neutropenic patients, C krusei fungemia is associated"
		with high mortality. It should be suspected in patients with leukemia who are
		receiving fluconazole prophylaxis and should be treated aggressively with an
		amphotericin B regimen.

		"patients, 403 isolates were recovered, yielding an incidence of 4.2 cases per 100"
		"000 inhabitants. Candida albicans was the most common species (61%), followed by"
		Candida glabrata (20%) and Candida parapsilosis (9%). The rates of resistance to
		fluconazole were ≤ 1% in C. albicans and 6-29% in non-albicans species other than
		"C. glabrata and Candida krusei. Resistance to voriconazole was rare, except for"
		C. glabrata and C. krusei. Only three isolates had reduced susceptibility to
		"amphotericin B, and one had reduced susceptibility to caspofungin."

AB	-	Candidaemia remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the healthcare
		setting. Candida spp. bloodstream infection episodes prospectively recorded
		through a blood culture surveillance programme in a single institution from 1991
		to 2008 were included in the study. Data regarding candidaemia episodes were
		"analysed, including specific fungal species and patient survival at 30 days after"
		diagnosis. There were 529 candidaemia episodes during the study period (495 were
		nosocomial infections). The incidence of candidaemia caused by non-Candida
		albicans Candida spp. (52%) was higher than the incidence of candidaemia caused
		by C. albicans (48%). The overall crude 30 day mortality rate was 32%. Patients
		with Candida parapsilosis candidaemia had the lowest mortality rate (23%).
		Candida krusei candidaemia was most commonly associated with haematological
		"malignancy (61%; P < 0.001), stem cell transplantation (22%; P = 0.004),"
		neutropenia (57%; P = 0.001) and prior use of antifungal azole agents (26%; P <
		0.001). Patients with C. krusei candidaemia had the highest crude 30 day
		mortality in this series (39%). Epidemiological studies are important to define
		clinical and microbiological candidaemia characteristics and to guide empirical
		treatment in every setting.

TI	-	Prevalence of oral Candida species in leprosy patients from Cambodia and
		Thailand.
PG	-	342-6
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Leprosy is a chronic bacterial infection which may lead to
		"significant orofacial morbidity. However, reports on the oral mycotic flora of"
		leprosy patients are rare. The aim of the current study was to explore the oral
		yeast carriage in two groups of leprosy patients. METHODS: 40 Cambodian (seven
		"men, 33 women) and 48 Thai (14 men, 34 women) leprosy patients from Leprosy"
		"Rehabilitation Centre Khien Kleang, Phnom Penh, Cambodia and McKean"
		"Rehabilitation Center, Chiangmai, Thailand were randomly selected and their"
		demographic data and clinical history were recorded. Tongue and palatal swabs of
		"each patient were collected using sterile Fungi-Quick swabs (Hain Diagnostika,"
		"Nehren, Germany) and they were cultured aerobically on Sabouraud's dextrose agar"
		"and CHROMAgar (CHROMagar, Paris, France). Yeast were identified by germ tube,"
		"chlamydospore production, and assimilation tests (API 20C AUX, Bio-Merieux, Marcy"
		"l'Etoile, France) and reconfirmed using APILAB Plus system (Bio-Merieux)."
		RESULTS: Two groups (Cambodian and Thai) had median age of 35 and 64 years. They
		"had been with leprosy for median durations of 17.7 and 38.9 years (P<0.05),"
		respectively. Overall yeast carriage in two cohorts were 80% and 93.75%. Candida
		"albicans had highest carriage rate in either group (65.6%, 44.4%). Candida krusei"
		and C. glabrata existed as second-line colonizers after C. albicans. Candida
		glabrata carriage was significantly higher in Thai patients (P<0.05).
		Multispecies carriage was seen in three Cambodian (9.4%) and five Thai (11.5%)
		patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates high oral yeast carriage in leprosy
		patients. Candida albicans remains predominant while C. krusei and C. glabrata
		are second-line oral colonizers. Co-inhabitation of multiple yeast species is
		also noted in these patients' oral mycotic flora.

TI	-	Gastrointestinal Disease Associated with Non-albicans Candida Species in Six
		Birds.
PG	-	413-418
LID	-	10.1647/2018-419 [doi]
AB	-	A non-albicans Candida species was identified in 6 birds exhibiting clinical
		signs associated with gastrointestinal disease. The clinical disease signs noted
		"in these 6 birds included diarrhea, regurgitation, and melena, and were"
		considered concurrent or identified secondary to other comorbidities. Candida
		"glabrata was identified in a yellow-naped Amazon parrot (Amazona auropalliata), a"
		"ring-necked dove (Streptopelia capicola), a blue-and-gold macaw (Ara ararauna),"
		and 2 cockatiels (Nymphicus hollandicus). Candida krusei was identified in a
		white-crowned parrot (Pionus senilis). Fungal culture and matrix-assisted laser
		desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry identification was
		"correlated with results of fecal and/or crop Gram's stains, and DNA sequencing"
		"was used in one case. Three cases resolved after treatment, 2 birds died, and 1"
		was lost to follow-up. Non-albicans Candida infections are an emerging issue in
		human health care and are known to have an increased resistance to antifungal
		"drugs. Similar to Candida albicans, these non-albicans Candida species are often"
		identified in patients that have a history of prior antibiotic exposure. Recent
		data in human medicine describe a shift in species distribution away from C
		"albicans dominance and toward other species, including C glabrata and C krusei."
		Both species are considered normal flora within the human and bird mycobiota and
		"may emerge to cause disease, especially when the normal gastrointestinal"
		environment has been disrupted.

		with Down Syndrome: A Case-Control Study.
PG	-	537-543
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-020-00457-6 [doi]
AB	-	Candida species are common in the human oral microbiota and may cause oral
		candidiasis (OC) when the microbiota equilibrium is disturbed. Immunosuppressed
		individuals are susceptible to oral infections as individuals with Down syndrome
		"(IDS) due to particularities of their mouth morphoanatomy, saliva and"
		comorbidities. This study aimed to analyze the molecular epidemiology of Candida
		spp. from the oral cavity of IDS and their relatives. A case-control study with
		80 IDS and 80 non-syndromic (non-DS) was evaluated by oral swab collection for
		"culture on Sabouraud dextrose agar, selection of yeast colonies to Gram staining"
		and culturing on chromogenic media. DNA extraction was performed with the
		phenol/chloroform method for screening of 6 Candida species medically important
		"in PCR, applying SPSS for statistics. We confirmed four species in 46 IDS without"
		"use of antimicrobials (57.54%), with a high prevalence of C. albicans/Ca"
		"(93.48%/43) and 3 C. glabrata/Cg (6.52%), being 25 of these IDS (31.25%)"
		"colonized by species other than C. albicans: Ca + Cg (16), Ca + C. tropicalis/Ct"
		(7) and Ca + C. krusei/Ck (2). Only 10 non-DS were colonized by one species
		"(11.25%): 6 C. albicans, 2 C. glabrata, 1 C. tropicalis and 1 C. krusei. Previous"
		"OC was reported by 39 IDS (48.75%), being 33 positives for Candida spp. (84.61%)"
		and 17 with active OC (21.25%). Five non-DS reported OC previously and had no
		active lesions. Behavioral changes and buccal health programs directed to IDS may
		"help prevent OC and its recurrence, providing information on oral hygiene for"
		self-care.

PG	-	707-14
LID	-	10.1093/jac/dkr511 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine the impact of timing of appropriate antifungal
		"therapy, as assessed by susceptibility results, on patient survival. METHODS:"
		Patients ≥16 years of age with first episodes of candidaemia during 2001-09 were
		"included. Clinical data were collected retrospectively, including time to"
		appropriate antifungal therapy and patient survival. RESULTS: The study
		"population included 446 patients [243 (54%) female, mean age 53 years] with"
		"candidaemia, 380 (85%) of whom had antifungal susceptibility data. Candida"
		"albicans was the most common pathogen (221, 50%) followed by Candida glabrata"
		"(99, 22%), Candida parapsilosis (59, 13%), Candida tropicalis (48, 11%) and"
		"Candida krusei (6, 1%). Appropriate antifungal therapy consisted of fluconazole"
		"(177, 40%), an echinocandin (125, 28%), amphotericin B (41, 9%) and voriconazole"
		"(6, 1%); 97 (22%) failed to receive appropriate antifungal therapy. The 30 day"
		mortality was 34% (151/446) and there was no clear relationship between time from
		positive culture to receipt of appropriate antifungal therapy and 30 day
		"survival. On multivariable Cox regression, increased APACHE II score [hazard"
		"ratio (HR) 1.11, 95% CI 1.09-1.13, P<0.001], cirrhosis (HR 2.15, 95% CI"
		"1.48-3.13, P<0.001) and HIV infection (HR 2.03, 95% CI 1.11-3.72, P=0.02) were"
		independent predictors of mortality. A secondary analysis requiring patients in
		the early treatment group to have received ≥24 h of effective antifungal therapy
		did show a significant mortality benefit to receiving antifungal treatment within
		72 h of a positive blood culture being drawn (30 day mortality for early
		"treatment: 27% versus 40%, P=0.004; HR for mortality with delayed treatment on"
		"multivariable analysis: 1.41, 95% CI 1.01-1.98, P=0.045). CONCLUSIONS: Candida"
		"bloodstream infection is associated with high mortality, despite timely receipt"
		of appropriate antifungal therapy.

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To review the epidemiology of candidemia in a UK tertiary referral
		center. METHODS: Clinical and laboratory data from patients with candidemia were
		"collected prospectively from October 1, 2005 to June 30, 2008 (a 33-month"
		period). RESULTS: A total of 107 episodes were identified. The incidence was 10.9
		episodes/100 000 bed-days. The most common predisposing factors were the use of
		"broad-spectrum antibiotics (92%), the presence of an intravascular device (IVD)"
		"(82%), admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) (51%), and recent surgery (50%)."
		"Non-Candida albicans species accounted for 58% of the episodes, which is higher"
		than the percentage reported from other UK centers. C. albicans was the most
		"common species, accounting for 43% of episodes, followed by C. glabrata (31%) and"
		"C. parapsilosis (20%). Overall C. tropicalis, C. krusei, C. norvegensis, and C."
		lusitaniae caused 7% of episodes. The crude 30-day mortality rate was 37%.
		Advanced age (p = 0.003) and the presence of septic shock (p = 0.038) were
		associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Candidemia continues to be associated
		with a high mortality. Preventative measures should be targeted against high-risk
		"hospitalized patients, especially those in ICUs, the elderly, and those"
		undergoing major surgery. Local surveillance of candidemia is important to
		optimize management.

TI	-	The impact of oral contraceptives on women's periodontal health and the
		subgingival occurrence of aggressive periodontopathogens and Candida species.
PG	-	1010-8
LID	-	10.1902/jop.2010.090575 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the influence of oral
		contraceptive (OC) use on the subgingival occurrence of specific
		periodontopathogens and the host's periodontal status. METHODS: Ninety-two
		females aged 19 to 40 years were included in the study. They were divided into
		"two groups, OC users and non-users, and subgrouped according to the most severe"
		periodontal condition and duration of OC usage. A pooled subgingival sample from
		"each subject was cultured to investigate the presence of Candida species,"
		"Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously"
		"Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), and Prevotella intermedia. RESULTS: OC"
		"users, particularly smokers, show a statistically significant increase in the"
		prevalence of severe periodontitis. OC users had deeper probing depths (>or=5 mm)
		"than non-users. Moreover, OC users had higher gingival index scores and clinical"
		"attachment loss, >or=2 and >or=5 mm, respectively, than non-users (P <0.01)."
		Patients taking OCs had significantly higher numbers of cultures positive for
		Candida. Seven Candida species were isolated. Subgingival Candida was associated
		"with P. gingivalis and P. intermedia in 82.9% and 85.4%, respectively, in"
		patients taking OCs. A. actinomycetemcomitans was isolated in patients with
		moderate and severe periodontitis and was associated with subgingival P.
		"gingivalis, P. intermedia, and Candida. CONCLUSIONS: OC use may increase the risk"
		of severe periodontitis and seems to cause a selection of certain Candida species
		"in periodontal pockets. OC users showed a higher prevalence of P. gingivalis, P."
		"intermedia, and A. actinomycetemcomitans compared to non-users. C. albicans, C."
		"parapsilosis, C. krusei, C. tropicalis, and C. glabrata were the species with the"
		ability to survive in the conditions created by the sex hormones after 3 years.

TI	-	Low rates of invasive fungal disease in patients with multiple myeloma managed
		with new generation therapies: Results from a multi-centre cohort study.
PG	-	30-34
LID	-	10.1111/myc.13178 [doi]
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: A multi-centre study to determine the outcomes and risks for
		invasive fungal disease (IFD) in myeloma (MM) patients treated with
		"second-generation immunomodulatory drugs, proteasome inhibitors and monoclonal"
		antibodies was conducted. METHODS: Clinical and microbiology records were
		"reviewed to capture patient demographics, disease characteristics, treatment, IFD"
		episodes and outcomes. Categorical and continuous variables between patients with
		"IFD and without IFD were compared using chi-square test, Fisher's exact test and"
		"Mann-Whitney rank sum test, respectively, with P-value < .05 considered"
		statistically significant. RESULTS: Five out of 148 (3.4%) MM patients were
		"diagnosed with five episodes of IFI: 3 were proven, 1 probable and 1 possible."
		Median time from commencement of new generation therapy to IFD diagnosis was
		"4.0 months (Interquartile range [IQR]: 3.4-5.7). In patients with IFD, median"
		cumulative steroid dose over 60 days was 1119 mg (IQR: 1066-1333 mg). None of the
		patients with IFD had prolonged neutropenia (neutrophil count < 0.5 × 10(9) /L
		for more than 10 days). Common sites of infection were the respiratory tract
		(40.0%) and bloodstream (40.0%). Cryptococcus neoformans (n = 2) and Candida
		krusei (n = 1) were the fungal pathogens isolated in the three proven cases.
		30-day mortality rate was 40.0%. Patients with IFD were younger (median 58 versus
		"68 years, P = .52) and treated with more lines of therapy (median 5 vs 3,"
		P = .04). CONCLUSION: IFD rate is low in heavily treated MM patients treated with
		second-generation therapy including monoclonal antibodies. Patients do not appear
		to have traditional risk factors such as prolonged neutropenia.

		fungaemia in a Spanish multicentre prospective survey.
PG	-	1181-7
LID	-	10.1093/jac/dks019 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To update the knowledge of the epidemiology of fungaemia episodes in
		"Spain, the species implicated and their in vitro antifungal susceptibilities."
		METHODS: Episodes were identified prospectively over 13 months at 44 hospitals.
		Molecular methods were used to determine the cryptic species inside the Candida
		"parapsilosis and Candida glabrata complexes. Susceptibility to amphotericin B,"
		"anidulafungin, caspofungin, fluconazole, flucytosine, itraconazole, micafungin,"
		posaconazole and voriconazole was determined by a microdilution colorimetric
		"method. New species-specific clinical breakpoints (SSCBPs) for echinocandins,"
		fluconazole and voriconazole were applied. RESULTS: The incidence of the 1357
		fungaemia episodes evaluated was 0.92 per 1000 admissions. The incidence of
		"Candida albicans fungaemia was the highest (0.41 episodes/1000 admissions),"
		followed by Candida parapsilosis sensu stricto (0.22). Candida orthopsilosis was
		"the fifth cause of fungaemia (0.02), outnumbered by Candida glabrata and Candida"
		"tropicalis. Interestingly, the incidence of fungaemia by C. parapsilosis was 11"
		"and 74 times higher than that by C. orthopsilosis and Candida metapsilosis,"
		respectively. Neither Candida nivariensis nor Candida bracarensis was isolated.
		Fungaemia was more common in non-intensive care unit settings (65.2%) and among
		"elderly patients (46.4%), mixed fungaemia being incidental (1.5%). Overall"
		"susceptibility rates were 77.6% for itraconazole, 91.9% for fluconazole and"
		96.5%-99.8% for the other agents. Important resistance rates were only observed
		"in C. glabrata for itraconazole (24.1%) and posaconazole (14.5%), and in Candida"
		krusei for itraconazole (81.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Fungaemia is more common in
		"non-critical patients. C. albicans is the most common species, followed by C."
		parapsilosis and C. glabrata. Nearly 90% of yeasts are susceptible to all
		antifungal agents tested. Resistance rates change moderately when applying the
		new SSCBPs.

		"non-transplant surgery, and patients with solid tumors, the most prevalent"
		"non-albicans species was C. glabrata at 63.7%, 48.0%, and 53.8%, respectively. In"
		"1,883 patients receiving antifungal therapy on day 3, fluconazole (30.5%) and"
		echinocandins (47.5%) were the most frequently administered monotherapies. Among
		"the 15 reported species, 90-day survival was highest for patients infected with"

		infected with an unknown species (46.7%) or two or more species (53.2%). In
		"conclusion, this study expands the current knowledge of the epidemiology and"

		North America. The variability in species distribution in these centers
		underscores the importance of local epidemiology in guiding the selection of

AB	-	To describe the incidence and susceptibility profile of Candida bloodstream
		"infections in a tertiary-care hospital, we performed a retrospective"
		observational study from 1998 to 2007. Comorbidities and risk factors were
		"compiled from all cases. In vitro susceptibility testing to fluconazole,"
		"itraconazole, voriconazole, and amphotericin B was performed for 100 isolates,"
		and caspofungin was tested for C. parapsilosis complex. In a ten-year evaluation
		"of candidemias, 44 % were caused by C. albicans, and species of the C."
		parapsilosis complex were the second most frequent agents (37 %). Other species
		"presented lower incidences (C. tropicalis, 13 %, C. glabrata, 5 %, and C. krusei,"
		1 %). Neither C. dubliniensis nor C. metapsilosis were observed in this study. C.
		orthopsilosis (3 %) and C. parapsilosis stricto sensu (34 %) were also found.
		"Species distribution was independent of catheterization, mechanical ventilation,"
		or previous use of antifungals or corticoids. Parenteral nutrition administration
		"was strongly related to C. glabrata infection, and the highest mortality (80 %)"
		was observed in patients infected by this species. All C. albicans isolates
		"showed high susceptibility to all tested drugs. However, two C. parapsilosis"
		stricto sensu isolates presented high minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) (4
		"mg/L each) to fluconazole, and one exhibited voriconazole MIC of 0.25 mg/L,"
		highlighting the cross-resistance to these azoles. All isolates of C. tropicalis
		and C. glabrata showed no resistance to any drug tested. No difference was noted
		between C. parapsilosis and C. orthopsilosis susceptibilities to caspofungin. Our
		"results suggest that resistance to amphotericin B, fluconazole, voriconazole,"
		"itraconazole, and caspofungin in Brazilian Candida bloodstream isolates is still"
		uncommon.

TI	-	Epidemiology and risk factors for nosocomial Non-Candida albicans candidemia in
		adult patients at a tertiary care hospital in North China.
PG	-	684-90
LID	-	10.1093/mmy/myv060 [doi]
AB	-	"Nosocomial candidemia extends the length of hospital stay, increases the costs of"
		"medical care, and is associated with a high mortality rate. Epidemiological data"
		that assist in the choice of initial therapy may help to improve the prognosis.
		The present study was undertaken to investigate the epidemiology of nosocomial
		candidemia and identify risk factors for nosocomial candidemia caused by C.
		albicans and non-albicans Candida species (NAC). A retrospective chart review was
		undertaken to analyze cases of nosocomial candidemia treated at the Beijing
		Friendship Hospital between January 2008 and December 2012. All cases of
		candidemia were identified using the previously published criteria. Among 106
		"patients analyzed, 53.8% had nosocomial candidemia caused by NAC. Candida"
		"albicans was the most common causative agent, accounting for 46.2% of all cases,"
		"followed by C. glabrata (25.5%), C. tropicalis (15.1%), C. parapsilosis (10.4%)"
		and C. Krusei (0.9%). Comparison of nosocomial C. albicans and NAC candidemia by
		multivariate logistic regression showed that factors independently associated
		with nosocomial NAC candidemia included exposure to azole agents (odds ratio
		[OR]: 3.359; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.136-10.154; P = .031) and artificial
		surgical implants (OR: 37.519; 95% CI: 2.5-562.998; P = .009). A significant risk
		factor for nosocomial C. albicans candidemia was cancer surgery (OR: 0.075; 95%
		CI: 0.013-0.437; P = .004). Clinical and epidemiological differences in the risk
		factors between nosocomial candidemia caused by C. albicans and NAC should be
		considered when selecting an initial antifungal regimen for the treatment of
		adult patients. This should be undertaken before the availability of species
		identification and/or antifungal susceptibility results.

PG	-	19-28
AB	-	The incidence of nosocomial candidemia increased 27-fold over the past 13 years
		at National Taiwan University Hospital. In order to investigate its predisposing
		"factors, clinical manifestations and prognostic determinants, a prospective"
		observational study of nosocomial candidemia was undertaken at the hospital. From
		"1 May 1994 to 30 April 1995, 118 consecutive adult patients with 120 Candida spp"
		blood isolates were analyzed. Clinical presentations included fever (100%) with a
		"median duration of 3 days, diarrhea within 7 days of candidemia (27.9%) and"
		macronodular skin emboli (7.6%). Laboratory studies showed worsening azotemia
		"(35.6%), elevation of aminotransferase (28.3%), leukocytosis (27.1%) and"
		"thrombocytopenia (23.3%). Use of multiple antibiotics, retained vascular"
		catheters and parenteral nutritional support were the three most common
		predisposing factors for candidemia. C. albicans was the most common isolate
		"(50%), followed by C. tropicalis (20%), C. glabrata (14%), C. parapsilosis"
		"(9.2%). C. guilliermondii (2.5%), and C. Krusei (1.7%). C. tropicalis was more"
		"frequently the cause of candidemia in patients with leukemia and neutropenia,"
		while C. glabrata was more commonly seen in patients receiving fluconazole
		prophylaxis. A severity scoring system adopted from prospective bacteremia
		studies proved to be highly predictive of mortality in candidemic patients. The
		"overall case fatality rate was 70/118 (59.3%), and 51/70 (72.9%) were"
		"attributable to candidemia. In a multivariate analysis, the prognostic factors"
		"adversely influencing outcome were: higher severity scores, no removal of the"
		"catheter, persistent candidemia and lack of antifungal therapy."

PG	-	532-8
LID	-	10.1128/AAC.01128-10 [doi]
AB	-	A prospective multicenter surveillance program on yeast bloodstream infections
		"was implemented in the Paris, France, area without restrictions on ward of"
		"hospitalization (intensive care unit, hematology, and surgery) or age (adults and"
		"children). The present analysis concerns 2,618 isolates collected over 7 years"
		"from 2,441 patients. Centralized species identification and antifungal"
		susceptibility testing using the EUCAST methodology were performed. Almost 10%
		"(232/2,441) of the patients had recently (≤30 days) been treated with antifungal"
		drugs. We analyzed the effect of recent exposure to fluconazole (n = 159) or
		caspofungin (n = 61) on the proportions of the five major Candida species. For
		"both drugs, preexposure was associated with a decreased prevalence of Candida"
		albicans in favor of less drug-susceptible species (C. glabrata and C. krusei for
		"the former and C. parapsilosis and, to a lesser extent, C. glabrata and C. krusei"
		"for the latter; P = 0.001). In the multivariate analysis, the risk of being"
		infected with an isolate with decreased susceptibility to fluconazole was
		independently associated with an age of ≥15 years (odds ratio [OR] = 2.45; 95%
		confidence interval [CI] = 1.39 to 4.31; P = 0.002) and with recent exposure to
		"fluconazole (OR = 2.17; 95% CI = 1.51 to 3.13; P < 0.001), while the risk of"
		being infected with an isolate with decreased susceptibility to caspofungin was
		independently associated with an age <15 years (OR = 2.53; 95% CI = 1.43 to 4.48;
		P = 0.001) and with recent exposure to caspofungin (OR = 4.79; 95% CI = 2.47 to
		9.28; P < 0.001). These findings could influence future recommendations for the
		management of candidemia.

		"still scarce. AmarCand was a prospective, non-interventional study in 271 adult"

		"received systemic antifungal therapy (France, 2005-2006). Of these ICU patients,"
		"93 (median age 65 years, simplified acute physiology score II 52) had Candida"
		"peritonitis, including 73 nosocomial peritonitis, 53 concomitant bacterial"
		peritoneal infections and 26 candidaemias. Candida species were C. albicans (n =
		"63/108 isolates, 58%), C. glabrata (n = 22, 20%), C. krusei (n = 9), C. kefyr (n"
		"= 5), C. parapsilosis (n = 3), C. tropicalis (n = 3), C. ciferii (n = 2) and C."
		"lusitaniae (n = 1). Of tested isolates, 28% were fluconazole-resistant or"
		"susceptible dose-dependent (C. albicans 3/32, C. glabrata 9/14, C. krusei 4/4)."
		Empiric antifungal treatment was started 1 day (median) after peritonitis
		"diagnosis, with fluconazole (n = 2 patients), caspofungin (n = 12), voriconazole"
		"(n = 3), amphotericin B (n = 2), or a combination (n = 4). Following"
		"susceptibility testing, empiric antifungal treatment was judged inadequate in"
		9/45 (20%) patients and modified in 30 patients (fluconazole was replaced by
		caspofungin (n = 14) or voriconazole (n = 4)). Mortality in ICU was 38% (35/93)
		"and was not influenced by type of Candida species, fluconazole susceptibility,"
		"time to treatment, candidaemia, nosocomial acquisition, or concomitant bacterial"
		"infection. No specific factors for death were identified. In summary, a high"
		proportion of fluconazole-resistant or susceptible dose-dependent strains was
		cultured. These results confirm the high mortality rates of Candida peritonitis
		and plead for additional investigation in this population. Antifungal treatment
		for severe cases of Candida peritonitis in ICU patients remains the standard
		care.

PG	-	739

LID	-	739
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive infections with Candida krusei are uncommon and rarely
		complicated by spondylitis. Previous described cases were solely treated with
		"antimycotic therapy, despite guidelines recommending surgical interventions. CASE"
		PRESENTATION: We describe a case of C. krusei spondylitis in a patient treated
		"with chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia. After induction chemotherapy, the"
		"patient developed a candidemia, which was treated with micafungin. One month"
		"after the candidemia, the patient was admitted with severe lumbar pain."
		"Spondylitis of the L4 and L5 vertebra was diagnosed on MR-imaging, with signs"
		suggesting an atypical infection. The patient was treated with anidulafungin
		combined with voriconazole. Despite maximal conservative management symptoms
		gradually worsened eventually requiring surgical intervention. CONCLUSIONS: In
		"contrast to previous case reports, antimycotic treatment alone could be"
		insufficient in treating C. krusei spondylitis.

TI	-	The epidemiology of hematogenous candidiasis caused by different Candida species.
PG	-	1122-8
AB	-	The medical records of patients with hematogenous candidiasis at M. D. Anderson
		Cancer Center (Houston) between 1988 and 1992 were retrospectively reviewed.
		"There were 491 episodes of infection (6 per 1,000 admissions), 79% of which"
		occurred outside the intensive care unit setting. A significant decrease in
		"incidence was observed among patients with leukemia over the study period,"
		together with a relative decrease in Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis
		infections and an increase in Candida krusei and possibly Candida glabrata
		"infections. In the multivariate analysis, fluconazole prophylaxis provided strong"
		protection against the development of C. tropicalis infection (odds ratio [OR] =
		"0.08) and C. albicans infection (OR = 0.15), in comparison with protection"
		"against infections due to other species, but it was the single most important"
		determinant for the relative increase in C. krusei (OR = 27.07) and C. glabrata
		"(OR = 5.08) infections. In conclusion, there has been a substantial shift in the"
		epidemiology of hematogenous candidiasis caused by different Candida species in
		recent years. Fluconazole appears to be playing a major role in this observed
		shift.

		"centers. Among 1,354 episodes of BSI, 494 (36.5%) were classified as CO and 860"

		voriconazole [6.4%]) was most prevalent among nosocomial BSI isolates of C.
		glabrata. CO candidemia is not uncommon and appears to be increasing worldwide
		due to changing health care practices. Although resistance to the azoles and
		"echinocandins remains uncommon among CO isolates, we demonstrate the emergence of"
		nosocomial occurrences of C. glabrata expressing resistance to both monitored
		classes of antifungal agents.

TI	-	Genetic relatedness of commensal strains of Candida albicans carried in the oral
		cavity of patients' dental prosthesis users in Brazil.
PG	-	255-63
AB	-	The aim of this study is to describe the degree of yeast-colonization in diabetic
		and hemodialysed-users of dental prostheses. Individuals (306) were examined
		using an oral rinse technique in order to evaluate the incidence of
		"yeast-carriage, and genotype of C. albicans. Yeasts were isolated from 68.4%"
		(91/133) individual's dental prostheses users. Dental prostheses were found to be
		"a significant factor for the yeast colonization (P < 0.05). Overall, the"
		intensity of carriage was higher in diabetic patients as compared with health and
		hemodialysed individuals (P < 0.05). The isolation rates were: C. albicans
		"(51.7%), C. parapsilosis (20.9%), C. tropicalis (14.3%), C. glabrata (6.6%), C."
		"krusei (3.3%), C. rugosa (1.1%), and Pichia (Pichia ohmeri, 2.2%). Ready-To-Go"
		RAPD Analysis Beads were used and primer OPJ 6 distinguished the C. albicans
		isolates found in prostheses users. All the isolates were grouped into 11 RAPD
		"profiles in four main clusters and, the average S (AB) for the entire collection"
		of 47 C. albicans isolates were 0.779 +/- 0.178. Over 85% of isolates had a
		similarity level higher than or equal to 0.8 reinforcing the idea that the use of
		"dental prostheses, independently of the host's clinical condition, probably"
		provides the necessary conditions for these strains to gain a growth-specific

TI	-	Inadequacy of fluconazole dosing in patients with candidemia based on Infectious
		Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines.
PG	-	919-27
AB	-	"INTRODUCTION: Based on Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines,"
		inappropriate fluconazole therapy in patients with candidemia is defined as an
		"empiric dose <6 mg/kg/d, <12 mg/kg/d after Candida glabrata identification, or"
		"continued fluconazole use after identification of Candida krusei. However, the"
		extent to which inappropriate antifungal therapy is due to improper dosing or
		drug selection has not been well investigated. The objectives of this study were
		to assess the incidence of inappropriate fluconazole therapy in patients with
		candidemia and to identify variables associated with inappropriate therapy.
		METHODS: Retrospective cohort study from four medical centers of hospitalized
		patients with candidemia prescribed fluconazole. Appropriateness of fluconazole
		dosages (adjusted for renal dysfunction) was assessed at the time of symptom
		onset and after Candida identification. RESULTS: Patients (206) were identified.
		Sixty-one of 112 (55%) patients who were given empiric therapy received an
		initial dose of fluconazole <6 mg/kg. After identification of the Candida
		"species, 97 of 206 (47%) patients received inadequate fluconazole therapy based"
		on IDSA guideline recommendations due to a fluconazole dose <12 mg/kg after
		"isolation of C. glabrata (12%), continued use of fluconazole after isolation of"
		"C. krusei (3%), or a dose <6 mg/kg for all other Candida species (32%). Using"
		"multivariate logistic regression, increased weight in 1-kg increments (OR: 1.02;"
		p = 0.0142) and a creatinine clearance (CRCL) >50 ml/minute (OR: 3.17; p =
		0.0003) were associated with increased risk of inadequate fluconazole therapy.
		CONCLUSION: A high prevalence of suboptimal dosing of fluconazole given
		empirically or after Candida species identification was documented. Increased
		weight and CRCL were significant predictors of inadequate fluconazole doses.

TI	-	One-year follow-up of the effect of fixed orthodontic treatment on colonization
		by oral Candida.
PG	-	26-9
AB	-	The aim of this study was to assess quantitative and qualitative alterations in
		"the carrier rate of Candida spp. in south-eastern Turkey among adolescents, and"
		to investigate the effect of fixed orthodontic appliances on the Candida count in
		"a 1-year follow-up study. In the first phase of the study, the oral Candida"
		carriage rate of 72 patients was evaluated. Samples were collected from the
		"dorsal surface of the tongue, the mid-palate and saliva. In the second phase of"
		"the study, 42 patients who were determined to be carriers of oral Candida were"
		"treated with fixed orthodontic appliances, and from these patients a second set"
		of samples were collected from the saliva and the orthodontic brace surfaces of
		eight teeth adjacent to the enamel surfaces. The saliva samples were collected
		"before and during orthodontic treatment at 1st, 6th and 12th month, and samples"
		"from the braces were collected during the 1st, 6th and 12th month of treatment."
		Forty-two of the 72 patients (58.5%) were oral Candida carriers. The distribution
		of Candida spp. in these patients was as follows: (i) Candida albicans was
		"identified in 31 patients (73.8%), (ii) C. tropicalis, C. krusei and C. kefyr"
		were found in three patients each (7.14%) and (iii) C. parapsilosis occurred in
		"two patients (4.76%). During orthodontic treatment, the micro-organism count"
		increased both in the saliva and on tooth surfaces. The results indicate that the
		prevalence of oral Candida spp. is high in young adults in south-eastern Turkey
		and that the Candida counts increase when braces are involved.

PG	-	299-303
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To provide the clinical profile and assess the significance of
		various risk factors contributing to the occurrence of oral candidosis in
		newborns. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Neonatal Intensive Care Unit
		(NICU). SUBJECTS: Twenty newborns with oral candidosis and an equal number of age
		and weight matched controls. INTERVENTIONS: All cases of oral candidosis were
		treated with local application of 1% Clotrimazole. RESULTS: Oral candidosis was
		documented in 3.2% (20/650) cases in the NICU. Acute pseudomembranous candidosis
		was the most common presentation. The mean age of onset was 10.5 days. Candida
		"albicans was isolated in 50% cases in addition to C. tropicalis, C."
		"paratropicalis, C. krusei, C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis. On univariate"
		"analysis, male sex, birth asphyxia and prolonged antibiotic therapy had a"
		significant correlation with occurence of oral candidosis in neonates. Out of
		"these, birth asphyxia was the only factor significantly associated with oral"
		"candidosis (OR 8.09, 95% CI 1.34-48.8, p = 0.0226) on multivariate analysis."
		CONCLUSIONS: C. albicans was the predominant isolate in this series of oral
		candidosis. Clinical manifestations were evident in the second week of life and
		birth asphyxia was the most important associated perinatal event.

		intensive care unit of the University College of Medical Sciences and G.T.B.
		Hospital were screened for oral thrush. A case control study was conducted to
		determine risk factors for oral candidiasis in newborns. The rate of oral
		candidiasis in this population was 3.2% (20 cases). The most common pathogen was
		Candida albicans (50%). All but 1 oral thrush case had acute pseudomembranous
		candidiasis. 75% of oral thrush cases were asymptomatic. Mean age of onset was
		"10.4 days (median, 9.5 days). Clotrimazole solution was applied to oral lesions"
		of all oral thrush cases. The multiple logistic regression revealed that birth
		asphyxia was the only significant factor responsible for oral thrush in newborns
		(odds ratio = 8.09; p = 0.0226). These findings show that the most important
		perinatal event associated with oral thrush in newborns was birth asphyxia.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Surveillance of current changes in the epidemiology of Invasive
		Fungal Diseases (IFDs) as an important component of the antifungal stewardship
		"programs (ASP), requires careful regular monitoring, especially in high-risk"
		settings such as oncology centers. This study aimed to examine Candida
		colonization status and corresponding current changes in children with malignancy
		during repeated admissions and also investigate the possible epidemiological
		shifts after the implementation of ASP. METHODS: In this prospective
		"observational study, all eligible patients younger than 18 years were recruited"
		"during 2016-2017 at Amir Medical Oncology Center (AMOC) in Shiraz, Iran. Totally,"
		136 patients were enrolled and 482 samples were collected from different sites
		"(oral/nasal discharges, urine and stool). Weekly regular sampling was carried out"
		during hospitalization. Candida colonization status and epidemiological changes
		were monitored during repeated admissions. Samples were cultivated on Sabouraud
		Dextrose agar medium and identified by Polymerase Chain Reaction -Restriction
		Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). RESULTS: Estimated Candida colonization
		incidence was 59.9% (82/136) in our patients. Candida colonization was found to
		be higher in oral cavity and rectum than that in nasal cavity. Among those
		"long-term follow ups and repetitive hospitalizations, a significant number of"
		patients exhibited changes in their colonization patterns (37.7%). Candida
		"colonization did not reveal any significant relationship with age, sex, oncologic"
		diseases and degree of neutropenia. C. albicans (72.0%) was found as the most
		"common Candida species in colonized patients, followed by C. krusei, C. kefyr, C."
		glabrata and C. parapsilosis. CONCLUSION: Given the high incidence of Candida
		"infections in children with cancers, close monitoring of epidemiologic changes is"
		"essential for judicious management, based on local surveillance data and"
		improvement of overall quality of care in high risk patients.

PG	-	1735-45
AB	-	"Fluconazole in vitro susceptibility test results for 205,329 yeasts were"
		collected from 134 study sites in 40 countries from June 1997 through December
		"2005. Data were collected for 147,776 yeast isolates tested with voriconazole"
		from 2001 through 2005. All investigators tested clinical yeast isolates by the
		CLSI M44-A disk diffusion method. Test plates were automatically read and results
		"recorded with a BIOMIC image analysis system. Species, drug, zone diameter,"
		"susceptibility category, and quality control results were collected quarterly."
		"Duplicate (same patient, same species, and same susceptible-resistant biotype"
		profile during any 7-day period) and uncontrolled test results were not analyzed.
		"Overall, 90.1% of all Candida isolates tested were susceptible (S) to"

		susceptibility (<75% S) on the order of that seen with the resistant (R) species
		"C. glabrata and C. krusei. Among 137,487 isolates of Candida spp. tested against"

		"fluconazole-resistant isolates of C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, and C."
		"rugosa remained S to voriconazole. The non-Candida yeasts (8,821 isolates) were"
		"generally less susceptible to fluconazole than Candida spp. but, aside from"
		"Rhodotorula spp., remained susceptible to voriconazole. This survey demonstrates"
		the broad spectrum of these azoles against the most common opportunistic yeast
		pathogens but identifies several less common yeast species with decreased
		susceptibility to antifungal agents. These organisms may pose a future threat to
		optimal antifungal therapy and emphasize the importance of prompt and accurate
		species identification.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to investigate the pattern of oral yeast colonization
		"of Sjögren's syndrome patients and its correlation to salivary flow rates, age,"
		and time of the disease progression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Saliva and swab
		specimens were obtained from 45 patients (primary Sjögren's syndrome = 15/
		secondary Sjögren's syndrome = 15/ healthy controls = 15). Yeast species were
		identified using culture method through chromogenic medium followed by polymerase
		chain reaction and Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: Eleven species from six different
		genera were detected. The most prevalent species found was Candida albicans
		"followed by Candida tropicalis, Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis, and"
		Candida krusei. Both groups of Sjögren's syndrome showed higher counts of
		"C. albicans (Total and CFU counts) when compared to control group. In contrast, a"
		greater variety of yeast species was identified on samples of the control group.
		"CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that C. albicans is the most prevalent yeast, but"
		also that a variety of other yeast species can colonize the oral cavity of
		Sjogren's syndrome patients. The identification of most of the colonies was not
		obtained by culturing-PCR methods combined.

		Against Nystatin and Fluconazole.
PG	-	7-Jan
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-015-9949-3 [doi]
AB	-	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a general term for a group of complex
		neurodevelopmental disorders of brain development that limits a person's ability
		"to function normally. Etiology has not been clearly defined up to date. However,"
		gut microbiota and the bidirectional communication between the gastrointestinal
		"tract and brain, the so-called microbiota-gut-brain axis, are hypothesized, which"
		may be involved in the etiology of several mental disorders. Recent reports
		"suggest that Candida, particularly Candida albicans, growth in intestines may"
		cause lower absorption of carbohydrates and minerals and higher toxin levels
		which are thought to contribute autistic behaviors. The aim of this study was to
		identify the 3-year deposited yeasts isolated from stool samples of children with
		diagnosed or suspected ASD and to determine in vitro activity of nystatin and
		fluconazole against these isolates using Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute
		M27-A3 guidelines. A 17-year retrospective assessment was also done using our
		"laboratory records. Among the species identified, intrinsically"
		fluconazole-resistant Candida krusei (19.8 %) and Candida glabrata (14.8 %) with
		"elevated MICs were remarkable. Overall, C. albicans (57.4 %) was the most"
		commonly isolated species in 17 years. The species identification and/or
		antifungal susceptibility tests have to be performed using the strain isolated
		"from stool sample, to select the appropriate antifungal agent, if antimycotic"
		therapy is needed.

		SETTING: Freestanding tertiary care children's hospital. PATIENTS: Patients with
		"Candida CLABSI from January 31, 2000, through December 31, 2010, compared with"
		"age- and year-matched controls. METHODS: Demographics, comorbidities, presence of"
		"indwelling foreign bodies, exposure to antibiotics or corticosteroids, total"
		"parenteral nutrition (TPN) or blood transfusions, complications, and outcome were"
		evaluated. Bivariate and then logistic regression were used to compare temporal
		trends and risk factors. Results. A total of 160 Candida CLABSI patients (median
		"age, 1.96 years) were compared with 457 controls. Those with Candida CLABSIs were"
		"more likely to have intestinal failure (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 6.777 [95%"
		"confidence interval (CI), 2.315-19.839]; P< .001), to have a gastrostomy tube in"

		"1.841-4.856]; P< .001), and they had a 3-fold increase in mortality (aOR, 3.543"
		"[95% CI, 1.501-8.364]; P< .004). Candida albicans was most common, but"
		non-albicans strains resistant to amphotericin (C. lusitaniae) and fluconazole
		(C. glabrata and C. krusei) were also found. Conclusions. Those patients with
		"intestinal failure, gastrostomy tube presence, and/or receipt of TPN and blood"
		transfusions are at increased risk for development of Candida CLABSI.

AB	-	"As detection rates of non-albicans Candida species are increasing, determining"
		their pathogen profiles and antifungal susceptibilities is important for
		antifungal treatment selection. We identified the antifungal susceptibility
		patterns and predictive factors for mortality in candidemia.A multicenter
		retrospective analysis of patients with at least 1 blood culture positive for
		Candida species was conducted. Candida species were classified into 3 groups
		"(group A, Candia albicans; group B, Candida tropicalis, and Candida parasilosis;"
		"group C, Candida glabrata and Candida krusei ) to analyze the susceptibility"
		"patterns, first-line antifungal administered, and mortality. Univariate and"
		multivariate comparisons between outcomes were performed to identify mortality
		"risk factors.In total, 317 patients were identified, and 136 (42.9%) had recorded"
		mortality. Echinocandin susceptibility was higher for group A than group B
		"(111/111 [100%] vs 77/94 [81.9%], P < .001). Moreover, group A demonstrated"
		"higher fluconazole susceptibility (144/149 [96.6%] vs 39/55 [70.9%], P < .001)"
		"and lower mortality (68 [45.3%] vs 34 [61.8%], P = .036) than those of group C."
		"In the multivariate analysis, the sequential organ failure assessment score (odds"
		"ratio OR 1.351, 95% confidence interval 1.067-1.711, p = 0.013) and positive"
		"blood culture on day 7 of hospitalization (odds ratio 5.506, 95% confidence"
		"interval, 1.697-17.860, P = .004) were associated with a higher risk of"
		mortality.Patients with higher sequential organ failure assessment scores and
		sustained positive blood cultures have an increased risk of mortality.

TI	-	Caspofungin use in patients with invasive candidiasis caused by common
		non-albicans Candida species: review of the caspofungin database.
PG	-	1864-71
LID	-	10.1128/AAC.00911-09 [doi]
AB	-	Increasing rates of invasive candidiasis caused by non-albicans Candida species
		have been reported worldwide. Particular concerns have been raised for C.
		parapsilosis because of reduced in vitro susceptibility to echinocandins. We
		identified 212 patients with invasive candidiasis due to non-albicans Candida
		species (>or=5 cases per species) in 5 clinical trials of caspofungin monotherapy
		"from the pharmaceutical sponsor's (Merck and Co., Inc.) database: 71 cases were"
		"caused by C. parapsilosis, 65 by C. tropicalis, 54 by C. glabrata, 10 by C."
		"krusei, 9 by C. guilliermondii, and 5 by C. lusitaniae. One hundred sixty-seven"
		cases caused by C. albicans were also identified. Efficacy was assessed at the
		end of caspofungin therapy. Success (favorable overall response) required
		favorable clinical and microbiological responses. The mean APACHE II scores were
		16.5 in the non-albicans group and 15.7 in the C. albicans group. Neutropenia at
		study entry was more common in the non-albicans group (12%) than in the C.
		albicans group (5%). The median duration of caspofungin therapy was 14 days in
		both groups. The success rates were 77% in both groups and at least 70% for each
		"non-albicans species: 74% for C. parapsilosis, 71% for C. tropicalis, 85% for C."
		"glabrata, 70% for C. krusei, 89% for C. guilliermondii, and 100% for C."
		lusitaniae. The times to negative blood culture were similar for the various
		species. The overall mortality rates were 26% in the non-albicans group and 29%
		in the C. albicans group. Drug-related serious adverse events and
		discontinuations due to caspofungin toxicity were uncommon. Although the sample
		"sizes were limited, caspofungin demonstrated favorable efficacy and safety"
		profiles in the treatment of invasive candidiasis caused by the following
		"non-albicans Candida species: C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, C."
		"krusei, C. guilliermondii, and C. lusitaniae."

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the"
		"incidence of fungal infections attributed to Candida species worldwide, with a"
		"major shift toward non-albicans Candida (NAC). In this study, we have described"
		the distribution of Candida species among different hospital departments and
		calculated the antifungal consumption in our facility. We also correlated the
		consumption of certain antifungals and the prevalence of specific Candida
		species. METHODS: This was a retrospective review of all the Candida isolates
		recovered from the computerised microbiology laboratory database of Makassed
		"General Hospital, a tertiary care centre in Beirut, Lebanon, between January 2010"
		and December 2015. Data on antifungal consumption between January 2008 and
		December 2015 were extracted from the hospital pharmacy electronic database. We
		used Spearman's coefficient to find a correlation between Candida species
		"distribution and antifungal consumption. RESULTS: Between 2008 and 2015, we"
		observed that the highest antifungal consumption was in the haematology/oncology
		"department (days of therapy/1000 patient days = 348.12 ± 85.41), and the lowest"
		"was in the obstetrics/gynaecology department (1.36 ± 0.47). In general, the"
		difference in antifungal consumption among various departments was statistically
		"significant (P < 0.0001). Overall, azoles were the most common first-line"
		antifungals in our hospital. Echinocandins and amphotericin B were mostly
		prescribed in the haematology/oncology department. As for Candida species
		"distribution, a total of 1377 non-duplicate isolates were identified between 2010"
		and 2015. A non-homologous distribution of albicans vs. non-albicans was noted
		among the different departments (P = 0.02). The most commonly isolated NAC was
		"Candida glabrata, representing 14% of total Candida species and 59% of NAC."
		"Candida famata (9% of NAC), Candida parapsilosis (3.6% of NAC) and Candida krusei"
		(3% of NAC) were recovered unequally from the different departments. The total
		antifungal consumption correlated positively with the emergence of NAC. The use
		"of azoles correlated positively with Candida glabrata, while amphotericin B"
		formulations correlated negatively with it. None of these correlations reached
		statistical significance. CONCLUSION: Different Candida species were unequally
		"distributed among different hospital departments, and this correlated with"
		"consumption of antifungals in respective departments, highlighting the need for"
		antifungal stewardship.

		xerostomia.
PG	-	149-54
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the relationship between salivary flow and
		Candida colony counts in the saliva of patients with xerostomia. STUDY DESIGN:
		Sialometry and Candida colony-forming unit (CFU) counts were taken from 112
		subjects who reported xerostomia in a questionnaire. Chewing-stimulated whole
		saliva was collected and streaked in Candida plates and counted in 72 hours.
		Species identification was accomplished under standard methods. RESULTS: There
		was a significant inverse relationship between salivary flow and Candida CFU
		counts (P =.007) when subjects with high colony counts were analyzed (cutoff
		"point of 400 or greater CFU/mL). In addition, the median sialometry of men was"
		"significantly greater than that of women (P =.003), even after controlling for"
		confounding variables like underlying disease and medications. Sjögren's syndrome
		was associated with low salivary flow rate (P =.007). There was no relationship
		between the median Candida CFU counts and gender or age. There was a high
		frequency (28%) of mixed colonization. Candida albicans was the most frequent
		"species, followed by C parapsilosis, C tropicalis, and C krusei. CONCLUSIONS: In"
		subjects with high Candida CFU counts there was an inverse relationship between
		salivary flow and Candida CFU counts.

		based on an exhaustive surveillance programme (2002-14).
PG	-	1784-1793
LID	-	10.1093/jac/dkx045 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: Using registry data to compare fungaemia caused by uncommon yeast
		"species (UYS; i.e. other than Candida albicans , Candida glabrata , Candida"
		"parapsilosis , Candida tropicalis and Candida krusei ) and C. albicans -related"
		fungaemia can reveal specific predisposing factors of UYS with potential impact
		on treatment strategies. METHODS: We analysed 338 episodes of UYS fungaemia
		"prospectively collected from 27 hospitals (Paris, France; 1 October 2002-31"
		December 2014) and compared these with 1998 single episodes of C. albicans
		fungaemia using univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: The proportion of
		UYS fungaemia was stable over time. Thirty-five different species were identified
		"(27 ascomycetes, 8 basidiomycetes), 11 had caspofungin MIC 50  >0.25 mg/L and 15"
		fluconazole MIC 50  >4 mg/L. Haematological malignancies [OR=2.39 (95% CI
		1.79-3.18)] and prior exposure to antifungal drugs [OR=1.87 (1.30-2.69)] were
		independent predisposing factors for UYS infections upon multivariate analysis.
		"However, when considering the genus/species complex level, only infections due to"
		Candida kefyr -related species [OR=4.01 (2.42-6.64)] and to Trichosporon spp.
		"[OR=5.38 (1.72-16.81)] remained associated with haematological malignancies,"
		"those due to the GEOTRICHUM group with acute leukaemia [OR=61.29 (19.23-195.36)],"
		and infections with Trichosporon spp. or the GEOTRICHUM group with prior exposure
		"to caspofungin [OR=15.67 (3.62-67.80) and OR=13.17 (3.33-52.03), respectively]"
		but not to fluconazole. The global mortality at day 30 for UYS was similar to
		"that for C. albicans (35.4%, and 39.9%, respectively), but very divergent results"
		were observed according to the specific UYS. CONCLUSIONS: UYS encompass a high
		"diversity of species, each with its own behaviour and predisposing factors for"
		human infections. This variety makes it important to rapidly identify an isolate
		to the species level in order to optimize antifungal treatment.

AB	-	The low incidence of mixed candidaemia (MC) may have precluded a better knowledge
		of its clinical presentation. The aim of the study was to analyse the risk
		"factors, clinical presentation and prognosis of MC episodes. A comparison between"
		MC and monomicrobial candidaemia within a prospective programme on candidaemia
		was performed in 29 hospitals between April 2010 and May 2011. In fifteen
		"episodes of candidaemia corresponding to 15 patients, out of 752, two species of"
		Candida (1.9%) were isolated. MC was more frequent in patients with HIV infection
		"(12%, P = 0.038) and those admitted due to extensive burns (23%, P = 0.012). The"
		Candida species most frequently identified in MC were C. albicans 12 patients
		"(40%), C. glabrata seven patients (23.3%) and C. parapsilosis six patients (20%)."
		"Early mortality was higher (nine patients, 60%) in patients with MC than in"
		"patients with MMC (223 patients, 30.3%, P = 0.046). In conclusion, MC was was"
		independently associated with increased mortality even after considering other
		prognostic factors. MC is an infrequent event that is more common in HIV
		"infection and in patients suffering from burns, and is associated with increased"
		mortality.

TI	-	Economic analysis of inadequate fluconazole therapy in non-neutropenic patients
		with candidaemia: a multi-institutional study.
PG	-	557-62
AB	-	Mortality significantly increases in patients with candidaemia who receive
		inappropriate fluconazole therapy. The goals of this study were to compare
		hospital length of stay and costs for non-neutropenic patients with candidaemia
		treated with fluconazole based on the empirical dose and time until initiation of
		therapy. A retrospective cohort study was conducted of patients with candidaemia
		who were prescribed fluconazole at the onset of candidaemia or later.
		Hospital-related costs were compared based on time to initiation of fluconazole
		therapy and empirical fluconazole dose. A total of 192 non-neutropenic patients
		"(55% male; mean age+/-standard deviation, 56+/-17 years) were identified."
		"Isolated Candida species included C. albicans (59%), C. glabrata (15%), C."
		"parapsilosis (11%), C. tropicalis (6%), C. krusei (3%) or other Candida spp."
		"(6%). Time to initiation of fluconazole was Day 0 (35.4%), Day 1 (14.1%), Day 2"
		(26.6%) or Day >or=3 (23.9%). Thirty-two patients (17%) received a dose of
		fluconazole >or=6 mg/kg on Day 0. Total costs were lowest for patients started on
		"fluconazole on the culture day with adequate doses ($35,459+/-25,988) compared"
		"with all other patients ($52,158+/-53,492) (P=0.0088). After controlling for"
		"covariates, each 1-day delay in fluconazole therapy was associated with increased"
		"total hospital costs of $6392+/-3000 (P=0.0344), and an adequate fluconazole dose"
		"was associated with decreased total hospital costs of $18,744+/-7173 (P=0.0097)."
		A delay or an inadequate dose or fluconazole in patients with candidaemia was
		associated with increased hospital costs. Improved methods to diagnose patients
		with candidaemia quickly are needed.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Bloodstream Candida infection is a life-threatening event among ICU
		admitted patients. This infection is caused by a diverse range of Candida species
		having varied minimum inhibitory concentrations. OBJECTIVES: To identify Candida
		species causing bloodstream infections with their antifungal susceptibility
		determination. METHODS: Candida species isolated from the blood of ICU admitted
		patients were identified by phenotypic as well as by molecular methods including
		PCR-RFLP using MspI restriction enzyme and MALDI TOF MS. The minimum inhibitory
		"concentration of fluconazole, voriconazole, amphotericin B and caspofungin was"
		determined against isolated Candida species by CLSI M27A(3) guidelines. RESULTS:
		"A total of 119 Candida species were isolated. Among them, C. tropicalis(n=29) was"
		"the predominant isolate followed by C. parapsilosis(n=18), C. glabrata (n=12), C."
		krusei (n=11) and C. albicans(n=11). Uncommon Candida species isolated were;
		"Wickerhamomyces anomalus(n=15), Kodaemia ohmeri(n=8), C. lusitaniae (n=5) and C."
		auris (n=2). A varied antifungal MIC values were observed. Caspofungin had the
		lowest MIC among the tested antifungals. Increased fluconazole MIC was observed
		against the isolated Candida species including C. tropicalis. All the isolated C.
		lusitaniae and C. auris strains have ≥1mcg/ml amphotericin B MIC. In comparison
		"to fluconazole, voriconazole was more effective when tested in vitro. CONCLUSION:"
		Emergence of uncommon Candida species having varied antifungal MIC warns the
		"physicians to have a prompt, accurate identification with antifungal MIC"
		determination in each case of bloodstream Candida infections.

LID	-	573
AB	-	BACKGROUND: The goal was to determine whether one medical centres' unique
		antifungal prophylactic regimen for patients at high risk for invasive
		"candidiasis because of their haematological malignancies, haematopoietic stem"
		"cell transplants, or high-dose chemotherapy might lead ultimately to a higher"
		"incidence of infection, to increasing fluconazole resistance, or to a shift in"
		the predominant strain of Candida in invasive fungal episodes. METHODS: Data were
		"collected retrospectively, for a ten-year period from ONKO-KISS surveillance"
		"records, and from hospital, medical, and pharmacy records and then evaluated with"
		"respect to incidence of fungal infection episodes, emergence of antifungal drug"
		"resistance, and predominance of specific Candida strains in isolate cultures."
		Fisher's exact test and linear regression were used to compare minimum inhibitory
		"concentrations and to compare the incidence of different Candida isolates,"
		respectively. RESULTS: The incidence of infection remained quite stable over 10
		"years with a median of 0.67 episodes/1000 bed days. Overall, Candida glabrata was"
		the predominant species with 29% followed by C. albicans and C. krusei (14%
		each). No significant increment of non-albicans Candida species with decreased
		fluconazole susceptibility was perceived over this decade. CONCLUSIONS: Once
		weekly administration of 400 mg of fluconazole to prevent candidaemia appears to
		have no negative impact on the efficacy as a prophylaxis when compared to
		standard of care (400 mg of fluconazole daily).

		for death of invasive Candida infections in intensive care units (ICUs). DESIGN:
		"Prospective, observational, national, multicenter study. SETTING: One hundred"
		"eighty ICUs in France. PATIENTS: Between October 2005 and May 2006, 300 adult"
		patients with proven invasive Candida infection who received systemic antifungal
		therapy were included. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: One
		"hundred seven patients (39.5%) with isolated candidemia, 87 (32.1%) with invasive"
		"candidiasis without documented candidemia, and 77 (28.4%) with invasive"
		"candidiasis and candidemia were eligible. In 37% of the cases, candidemia"
		occurred within the first 5 days after ICU admission. C. albicans accounted for
		"57.0% of the isolates, followed by C. glabrata (16.7%), C. parapsilosis (7.5%),"
		"C. krusei (5.2%), and C. tropicalis (4.9%). In 17.1% of the isolates, the"
		causative Candida was less susceptible or resistant to fluconazole. Fluconazole
		"was the empirical treatment most commonly introduced (65.7%), followed by"
		"caspofungin (18.1%), voriconazole (5.5%), and amphotericin B (3.7%). After"
		"identification of the causative species and susceptibility testing results,"
		treatment was modified in 86 patients (31.7%). The case fatality ratio in ICU was
		45.9% and did not differ significantly according to the type of episode.
		Multivariate analysis showed that factors independently associated with death in
		ICU were type 1 diabetes mellitus (odds ratio [OR] 4.51; 95% confidence interval
		"[CI] 1.72-11.79; p = 0.002), immunosuppression (OR 2.63; 95% CI 1.35-5.11; p ="
		"0.0045), mechanical ventilation (OR 2.54; 95% CI 1.33-4.82; p = 0.0045), and body"
		"temperature >38.2 degrees C (reference, 36.5-38.2 degrees C; OR 0.36; 95% CI"
		0.17-0.77; p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: More than two thirds of patients with
		invasive candidiasis in ICU present with candidemia. Non-albicans Candida species
		reach almost half of the Candida isolates. Reduced susceptibility to fluconazole
		is observed in 17.1% of Candida isolates. Mortality of invasive candidiasis in
		ICU remains high.

LID	-	10.3855/jidc.4186 [doi]
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: This study was conducted to determine characteristics of Candida
		colonization and candidemia in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of a
		tertiary care children's hospital. METHODOLOGY: Patients between 6 months and 15
		years of age consecutively admitted to the PICU of Mansoura University Children's
		"Hospital in Mansoura, Egypt, during one year period, were evaluated for Candida"
		colonization and candidemia. Susceptibility of Candida species isolated from
		blood to fluconazole and amphotericin B was determined by Etest. RESULTS:
		Sixty-six patients without prior fluconazole prophylaxis had 88 episodes of
		"candidemia, representing 19% of all cases with blood stream infections (BSIs)."
		Candida albicans (CA) and non-albicans Candida (NAC) species accounted for 40%
		"and 60% of candidemia episodes respectively. C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, and"
		"C. glabrata accounted for 25%, 17%, and 8% of NAC candidemias respectively."
		Fluconazole resistance was detected in 11.4% and 18.9% of CA and NAC isolates
		"respectively. Of the fluconazole resistant NAC isolates, four were C. krusei."
		Amphotericin B resistance was detected in 17% of NAC isolates. Candida
		"colonization was detected in 78.8% of patients. Compared to CA candidemia, higher"
		"risk for NAC candidemia was associated with age older than 1 year, Candida"
		isolation from endotracheal tube (ETT) and from central venous catheter.
		"Mortality rate was 42.4%, attributable mortality of candidemia was 16.7%."
		Regression analysis showed that the most significant independent predictors of
		"death were ETT and mechanical ventilation (MV), MV longer than 7 days, and"
		candiduria. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents important epidemiological features
		of Candida BSIs in a non-neonatal population.

LID	-	S0034-9356(17)30072-5 [pii]
LID	-	10.1016/j.redar.2017.03.007 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: The presence of resistant microorganisms is a major cause of failure
		in initial empirical antimicrobial therapy. The objectives of this study are to
		determine the resistance profile of microorganisms that cause bacteraemia of
		abdominal origin and to identify whether the previous use of antibiotics and the
		place of acquisition of bacteraemia are risk factors associated with the presence
		"of resistant organisms. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A clinical, observational,"
		"epidemiological, retrospective cohort study was conducted with all the adult"
		patients admitted to a university hospital from 2011-2013. Antimicrobial
		resistance profiles were described and a 95% confidence interval chi-square test
		was used to determine whether the variables studied were risk factors in the
		isolation of resistant microorganisms. RESULTS: Of the 1245 patients with
		"bacteraemia, 212 (17%) presented bacteraemia of abdominal origin. The resistance"
		profile highlights the incidence of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus
		"(50%), coagulase-negative staphylococci resistant to linezolid (20.58%),"
		"enterococci resistant to vancomycin (3.12%), Escherichia coli resistant to"
		"third-generation cephalosporins (9.9%) and fluoroquinolones (35.64%), Klebsiella"
		"pneumoniae resistant to third-generation cephalosporins (8.33%), Pseudomonas"
		aeruginosa resistant to fluoroquinolones and carbapenem (25% and 25%
		respectively) and Acinetobacter baumanii resistant to fluoroquinolones and
		"carbapenem (100% and 100% respectively), Candida albicans resistant to"
		"fluconazole (11.11%), single Candida krusei isolate resistant to fluconazole and"
		"Candida parapsilosis resistant to echinocandins (12.5%). In our study, previous"
		use of antibiotics had a statistically significant association with the isolation
		of resistant microorganisms (P=.013) but not the place of acquisition of
		bacteraemia (P=.239). CONCLUSION: Establishing the incidence of resistant
		organisms can improve empirical antimicrobial therapy in patients with
		bacteraemia of abdominal origin. Previous use of antibiotics was statistically
		significantly related to the isolation of resistant microorganisms.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infection (UTI) remains to be one of the most common
		infectious diseases diagnosed in developing countries. And a widespread use of
		antibiotics against uropathogens has led to the emergence of antibiotic resistant
		species. A laboratory based cross-sectional survey was conducted in Shashemene
		referral hospital to determine the prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility of
		uropathogens. METHODS: We have collected 384 clean catch mid-stream urine samples
		from all suspected UTI outpatients using sterile screw capped container. The
		urine samples were cultured and processed for subsequent uropathogens isolation.
		The isolated pure cultures were grown on BiOLOG Universal Growth agar (BUG) and
		identified using GEN III OmniLog® Plus ID System identification protocols. The
		identified species were then exposed to selected antibiotics to test for their
		susceptibility. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of urinary tract infection in the
		area was 90.1%. Most frequently isolated uropathogen in our study was Escherichia
		"coli (39.3%). While, Staphylococcus species (20.2%), Leuconostoc species (11.4%),"
		"Raoultella terrigena/Klebsiella spp./ (8.4%), Salmonella typhimurium (6.3%),"
		"Dermacoccus nishinomiyaensis (6.3%), Citerobacter freundii (5.2%) and"
		Issatchenkia orientalis/Candida krusei/ (2.7%) were the other isolates. We find
		that the relationship between uropathogens and some of UTI risk factors was
		statistically significant (P < 0.05). Gentamicin was the most effective drug
		against most of the isolates followed by chloramphenicol and nitrofurantoin. In
		"contrast, amoxicillin, vancomycin and cephalexin were the antibiotics to which"
		most of the isolates developed resistance. CONCLUSION: Urinary tract infection
		was highly prevalent in the study area and all uropathogens isolated developed a
		resistance against mostly used antibiotics.

TI	-	Candida albicans and non-albicans species as etiological agent of vaginitis in
		pregnant and non-pregnant women.
PG	-	89-97
AB	-	Pregnancy represents a risk factor in the occurrence of vaginal candidosis. The
		objectives of our study were: to make determination of the microscopic findings
		"of vaginal swab, frequency of Candida species in the culture of pregnant women"
		"and patients who are not pregnant, determine the Candida species in all cultures,"
		and to determine the frequency and differences in the frequency of C. albicans
		"and other non-albicans species. In one year study performed during 2006 year, we"
		tested patients of Gynaecology and Obstetrics clinic of the Clinical Centre in
		Sarajevo and Gynaecology department of the General hospital in Sarajevo. 447
		woman included in the study were separated in two groups: 203 pregnant (in the
		"last trimester of pregnancy), and 244 non-pregnant woman in period of fertility."
		"Each vaginal swab was examined microscopically. The yeast, number of colonies,"
		and the species of Candida were determined on Sabouraud dextrose agar with
		"presence of antibiotics. For determination of Candida species, we used germ tube"
		"test for detection of C. albicans, and cultivation on the selective medium and"
		assimilation tests for detection of non-albicans species. The results indicated
		"positive microscopic findings in the test group (40,9%), as well as greater"
		"number of positive cultures (46,8%). The most commonly detected species for both"
		"groups was C. albicans ( test group 40.9% and control group 23,0%). The most"
		"commonly detected non-albicans species for the test group were C. glabrata (4,2"
		"%) and C. krusei (3,2%), and for the control group were C. glabrata (3,2%) and C."
		"parapsilosis (3,2%). The microscopic findings correlated with the number of"
		"colonies in positive cultures. In the test group, we found an increased number of"
		"yeasts (64,3%), and the pseudopyphae and blastopores by microscopic examination"
		"as an indication of infection. In the control group, we found a small number of"
		"yeasts (64,6%) , in the form of blastopores, as an indication of the candida"
		"colonisation. Our results indicate that gravidity, as the risc factor for"
		"incidence of infection, has the significant role in the incidence of vaginal"
		candidosis.

AB	-	The risk factors for and clinical features of bloodstream infection with uncommon
		"Candida spp. (species other than C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, C."
		tropicals and C. krusei) are incompletely defined. To identify clinical variables
		"associated with these species that might guide management, 57 cases of"
		candidaemia resulting from uncommon Candida spp. were analysed in comparison with
		517 episodes of Candida albicans candidaemia (2001-2004). Infection with uncommon
		"Candida spp. (5.3% of candidaemia cases), as compared with C. albicans"
		"candidaemia, was significantly more likely to be outpatient-acquired than"
		"inpatient-acquired (15 of 57 vs. 65 of 517 episodes, p 0.01). Prior exposure to"
		fluconazole was uncommon (n=1). Candida dubliniensis was the commonest species
		"(n=22, 39%), followed by Candida guilliermondii (n=11, 19%) and Candida"
		"lusitaniae (n=7, 12%).C. dubliniensis candidaemia was independently associated"
		"with recent intravenous drug use (p 0.01) and chronic liver disease (p 0.03), and"
		infection with species other than C. dubliniensis was independently associated
		"with age<65 years (p 0.02), male sex (p 0.03) and human immunodeficiency virus"
		infection (p 0.05). Presence of sepsis at diagnosis and crude 30-day mortality
		"rates were similar for C. dubliniensis-related, non-C. dubliniensis-related and"
		C. albicans-related candidaemia. Haematological malignancy was the commonest
		"predisposing factor in C. guilliermondii (n=3, 27%) and C. lusitaniae (n=3, 43%)"
		candidaemia. The 30-day mortality rate of C. lusitaniae candidaemia was higher
		"than the overall death rate for all uncommon Candida spp. (42.9% vs. 25%, p not"
		"significant). All isolates were susceptible to amphotericin B, voriconazole,"
		"posaconazole, and caspofungin; five strains (9%) had fluconazole MIC values of"
		16-32 mg/L. Candidaemia due to uncommon Candida spp. is emerging among hospital
		outpatients; certain clinical variables may assist in recognition of this entity.

TI	-	Evaluation of Candida colonization and use of the Candida Colonization Index in a
		paediatric Intensive Care Unit: a prospective observational study.
PG	-	159-167
AB	-	"Invasive candidiasis is an important cause of morbidity and mortality, which"
		primarily occurs in intensive care units. The Candida colonization index is an
		accepted score as an early warning tool for invasive candidiasis. This study was
		performed in a medical PICU with patients prone to contracting invasive
		"candidiasis, to determine the usefulness of the Candida colonization index in"
		forecasting invasive candidiasis in children. This prospective study including 87
		patients (children 1 month to 16 years old with several illnesses and requiring
		"ICU care) was conducted in a 22-bed medical PICU, Health Science University of"
		"Kayseri Training and Research Hospital, between January 2015 and September 2016."
		"Those patients not on antifungal therapy, who were expected to stay more than"
		seven days in PICU and had no history of a PICU stay within the previous two
		"months were included in the study. In all patients, rectal, cervical, throat,"
		"axillary, perineal and nasal swab cultures, urine culture and blood culture tests"
		"were performed at admission and every week throughout their stay. Overall, 2639"
		swab and urine cultures (mean: 30.3) and 325 blood cultures (mean: 3.73) were
		obtained from 87 patients and a total of 576 grew Candida spp. In patients' swab
		"and urine cultures C. albicans was detected in 64.5%, C. parapsilosis in 12.1%,"
		"C. glabrata in 7.5%, Saccharomyces spp in 3.0 %, C. tropicalis in 2.4%, C. krusei"
		in 2.1% and C. kefyr in 1.2%. Three patients had C. albicans and one had C.
		"parapsilosis growth in blood culture. Sensitivity, specificity, positive"
		"predictive value and negative predictive value for CI were found to be 33.73%,"
		"100%, 6.7%, and 100%, respectively. Patients are at risk of fungal infection in"
		paediatric intensive care units. Specificity and the negative predictive value of
		100 % indicate that CI is a useful score to rule out the presence of invasive
		"fungal disease. On the other hand, the low rate of sensitivity (33.3 %) and"
		"positive predictive value (6,7%) make this score less reliable in forecasting"
		invasive candidiasis in children.

		in patients with hematological malignancies in the era of newer antifungal
		agents.
PG	-	197-206
LID	-	10.1093/mmy/myx038 [doi]
AB	-	Although yeast bloodstream infections (BSIs) are increasingly being reported in
		"patients with hematological malignancies undergoing antifungal therapy, clinical"
		information regarding breakthrough infections is scarce. The aim of this study
		was to determine the risk factors for and clinical outcomes of breakthrough yeast
		BSIs in patients with hematological malignancies in the era of newer antifungal
		"agents. Between 2011 and 2014, all consecutive patients with hematological"
		malignancies who developed yeast BSIs were included in a case-control study
		wherein breakthrough infections (cases) and de novo infections (controls) were
		"compared. Of 49 patients with yeast BSIs, 21 (43%) met the criteria for"
		breakthrough infections. The proportions of Candida krusei and Candida tropicalis
		"in the cases and controls were significantly different (32% [7/22] vs. 3% [1/29],"
		"P = .015; 5% [1/22] vs. 38% [11/29], P = .007, respectively). Acute leukemia,"
		presence of a central venous catheter and neutropenia in the 3 days prior to BSI
		were significant risk factors for breakthrough infections. Six-week mortality
		rates was 33% [7/21] in the cases and 43% [12/28] in the controls (P = .564).
		Refractory neutropenia and the Pitt bacteremia score were independent predictors
		"of 6-week mortality. In conclusion, breakthrough infections accounted for a"
		significant proportion of yeast BSIs in patients with hematological malignancies.
		"However, these infections did not increase the risk of death by themselves. Our"
		"results suggest that current clinical management of breakthrough yeast BSIs,"
		which includes switching to a different antifungal class and prompt catheter
		removal is reasonable.

AB	-	The incidence of multiple-species candidemia (MSC) among cases of candidemia
		ranges between 2.8% and 8.0%. We sought to study the epidemiology and outcome of
		MSC at a tertiary care center. A retrospective analysis of MSC episodes occurring
		between 2004 and 2007 was performed. MSC was defined as > or =2 different Candida
		spp. growing concomitantly within the same blood culture bottle or within 72 h of
		"each other. Information on demographics, comorbidities, antifungal use, and"
		survival was collected. Forty MSC patients with 81 Candida isolates were
		"identified. Non-albicans Candida spp. (54 of 81 isolates, 66.7%) were more"
		frequently identified. The most common combinations observed were Candida
		"albicans/Candida glabrata (15 of 40 patients, 37.5%), C. albicans/Candida"
		"parapsilosis (8, 20.0%), and C. glabrata/Candida krusei (5, 12.5%). The overall"
		"crude 4- and 12- week mortality, excluding patients lost to follow-up, was 41.9%"
		"and 66.7%, respectively. In this contemporary sampling of patients with MSC, the"
		combination of C. albicans/C. glabrata was most frequently observed and mortality
		was high.

LID	-	10.1111/myc.12470 [doi]
AB	-	Candidemia remains a major cause of disease worldwide and is associated with a
		high mortality rate. We conducted a retrospective study of candidemia at Nantes
		"Hospital, France, between 2004 and 2010. A total of 191 episodes (n = 188"
		"patients) were reviewed. Incidence, demographics, risk factors, antifungal"
		"management, species identification, in vitro susceptibility and 12 weeks survival"
		were analysed. Global incidence of candidemia was 0.37‰ admissions. Higher
		incidences were observed in haematology (6.65‰) and intensive care units (2‰).
		Central venous catheter and antibiotic exposure were the most frequent risk
		factors (77% and 76% respectively). Candida albicans was the predominant species
		"(51.8%) followed by C. parapsilosis (14.5%), C. glabrata (9.8%), C. tropicalis"
		"(9.8%) and C. krusei (4.1%). However, species distribution differed significantly"
		between medical units with frequency of C. tropicalis being higher in haematology
		compared to other medical units. Fluconazole and caspofungin were the main
		"antifungals given as first-line therapy. Although not significant, 12 weeks"
		"mortality rate was 30.9%, being higher for C. tropicalis (44.4%) than for C."
		parapsilosis (16%). Acquired azole or echinocandin resistance was noted in some
		"isolates, underlining the need for systematic antifungal susceptibility testing"
		in patients with candidemia. These epidemiological findings will be of interest
		for antifungal stewardship at our hospital.

AB	-	Routine identification of fungal pathogens from positive blood cultures by
		"culture-based methods can be time-consuming, delaying treatment with appropriate"
		antifungal agents. The GenMark Dx ePlex investigational use only blood culture
		identification fungal pathogen panel (BCID-FP) rapidly detects 15 fungal targets
		simultaneously in blood culture samples positive for fungi by Gram staining. We
		aimed to determine the performance of the BCID-FP in a multicenter clinical
		study. Blood culture samples collected at 10 United States sites and tested with
		BCID-FP at 4 sites were compared to the standard-of-care microbiological and
		"biochemical techniques, fluorescence in situ hybridization using peptide nucleic"
		acid probes (PNA-FISH) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of
		flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Discrepant results were analyzed by
		bi-directional PCR/sequencing of residual blood culture samples. A total of 866
		"clinical samples, 120 retrospectively and 21 prospectively collected, along with"
		725 contrived samples were evaluated. Sensitivity and specificity of detection of
		"Candida species (C. albicans, C. auris, C. dubliniensis, C. famata, C. glabrata,"
		"C. guilliermondii, C. kefyr, C. krusei, C. lusitaniae, C. parapsilosis, and C."
		"tropicalis) ranged from 97.1 to 100% and 99.8 to 100%, respectively. For the"
		"other organism targets, sensitivity and specificity were as follows: 100% each"
		"for Cryptococcus neoformans and C. gattii, 98.6% and 100% for Fusarium spp., and"
		"96.2% and 99.9% for Rhodotorula spp., respectively. In 4 of the 141 clinical"
		"samples, the BCID-FP panel correctly identified an additional Candida species,"
		undetected by standard-of-care methods. The BCID-FP panel offers a faster
		turnaround time for identification of fungal pathogens in positive blood cultures
		"that may allow for earlier antifungal interventions and includes C. auris, a"
		highly multidrug-resistant fungus.

		"22-28; p<0.004 and 16; 14-18; p<0.002), SBP (26; 22-28; p<0.004 and 16; 14-18;"
		p<0.002) and SP (24; 18-30; p<0.045 and 14; 10-18; p<0.044) as compared to NP
		(22; 16-24 and 12; 10-14). CHILD Pugh classification was mainly CHILD C and MELD
		"Score was in patients with SFP (34; 18-40; p<0.001), SBP (32;12-40 p<0.002) and"
		SP (29; 14-40 p<0.003) significantly higher as compared to NP (25;8-40).
		Nosocomial peritonitis could be significantly more often found in patients with
		"SFP (65%; p<0.023) and SBP (62%, p<0.030) as compared to SP (51 p = 0.243) and NP"
		(45%). Antibiotic pretreatment last 3 month prior peritonitis was significantly
		"more often in patients with SFP (85%; p<0.002), SBP (71%, p<0.033), and SP (56;"
		p<0.040) as compared to NP (33%). Candida albicans (60%; 12/20) was the most
		"common isolated fungus, followed by Candida glabrata (13%) and Candida krusei"
		"(13%). Mortality rate was significantly higher in patients with SFP (90%,"
		"p<0.001), followed by SBP (75%; p<0.001) and SP (69%; p<0.001) as compared to NP"
		(45%). CONCLUSION: SFP is not a rare complication in end stage liver disease
		which is associated with increased mortality. Physicians should be aware of SFP
		"in patients with CHILD C liver cirrhosis, elevated MELD score, antibiotic"
		pretreatment and nosocomial peritonitis.

PG	-	83-9
LID	-	10.1111/j.1600-0714.2010.00937.x [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the epidemiology of oral
		yeast colonization and infection amongst cancer patients. METHODS: Patients with
		"solid tumor, head-neck cancer or hematological malignancy were recruited into the"
		"study. Demographic data on age, gender, type of cancer, preceding treatment with"
		"antibiotics, anti-fungal agents, chemotherapy, radiation or surgery and presence"
		of dentures were recorded on admission. Oral examination and microbial swabs were
		"obtained and yeast culture, identification and antifungal susceptibility"
		performed. RESULTS: Oral yeast colonization was prevalent in 56.8% (227/400) of
		all cancer patients and 18.9% (43/227) of those had clinical and microbiological
		evidence of infection. The incidence of oral candidiasis in yeast colonized
		patients was highest in head neck cancer (29.2%) followed by hematological
		malignancies (20.5%) and solid tumor (17%) patients. Age and dentures were
		identified as independent risk factors associated with yeast carriage. Candida
		albicans was the dominant (74%) species (497.5 per 1000 cancer admissions)
		"followed by C. glabrata (11.5%), C. tropicalis (2.6%), C. krusei (2.6%) and C."
		parapsilosis (1.9%). The overall resistance to azoles was 28.2% (75/266).
		"Resistance to specific drugs was seen for fluconazole (4.5%), itraconazole"
		"(11.7%), ketoconazole (11.3%), voriconazole (0.75%) and caspofungin (41.1%) but"
		none to amphotericin B or nystatin. CONCLUSIONS: The highest incidence of oral
		candidiasis amongst cancer patients was seen in head neck cancers. The majority
		of infections were caused by C. albicans but almost one third of patients
		harbored non-C. albicans strains such as C. glabrata which were often more
		resistant to anti-fungal agents.

		"1991-2000. A total of 189 episodes of fungemia were encountered, of which 121"
		"(64%) occurred during 1991-1995, whereas only 68 cases (36%) were found between"
		"1996 and 2000. Overall, 50.3% episodes were due to Candida albicans including"

		"episodes during the second 5 years. Moreover, no fungemia due to C. glabrata and"
		"C. krusei were observed during the last 3 years. Overall, during the years of the"
		"study, a decreasing incidence of yeast fungemia was observed. Fungemia occurred"
		"more frequently in patients with leukemia (24%), prematurity (16%), postsurgery"
		"(10.6%), and lymphoma (9.5%). Patients with respiratory infections and preterm"
		"infants more often had C. albicans fungemia, whereas C. tropicalis predominated"
		in patients with hepatic disorders and leukemia. The study reports for the first
		time the involvement of C. dubliniensis in yeast fungemia occurring in Saudi
		Arabia.

		hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients: a study of 573 transplanted
		patients.
PG	-	1173-80
LID	-	10.12659/MSM.893267 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Fungal colonization and infections remain a major cause of infection
		morbidity and mortality following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)
		in patients with hematological malignancies. The aim of this study was to analyze
		"the spectrum of fungal microflora of the respiratory tract (oral cavity, pharynx,"
		"epiglottis, and sputum) in patients undergoing HSCT and to evaluate the"
		relationship between HSCT type and incidence of mycotic colonization and
		infections. MATERIAL/METHODS: Retrospective analysis of fungal isolates collected
		"from the respiratory tract (oral cavity, pharynx, epiglottis, and sputum) of 573"
		patients undergoing HSCT was performed. RESULTS: The overall rate of fungal
		colonization in patients undergoing HSCT was 8.7%. Patients undergoing allogeneic
		HSCT were statistically significantly more often colonized (12.95%) compared to
		autologous HSCT recipients (4.7%). Colonizing cultures were mainly C. albicans
		"and C. krusei, and sporadically C. glabrata, C. famata, Aspergillus spp. and"
		Saccharomyces cerevisiae. C. albicans was the most frequent species found in
		"isolates from the pharynx, sputum, and oral cavity collected from patients"
		undergoing HSCT. Aspergillosis was more common after allogeneic than after
		autologous HSCT. The pharynx was the most frequently colonized site. CONCLUSIONS:
		Allogeneic HSCT recipients are more susceptible to fungal infections compared to
		the autologous group. Selection of species during prophylaxis and antifungal
		therapy requires developing more effective prevention and treatment strategies
		based on new antifungal drugs and microbe-specific diagnoses.

PG	-	145-9
LID	-	10.2174/1874306401206010145 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Persistent Candida from fungal cultures of respiratory secretions are
		often ignored and not treated due to assumptions concerning benign colonization.
		OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical course of patients with chronic sputum and
		"fungi on culture, including response to antifungal treatment. METHODS: All"
		patients seen at a single long term acute care hospital (LTAC) between May 2009
		and September 2010 with at least two months of daily sputum and fungus on more
		"than one sputum culture were identified. LTAC, inpatient, and outpatient records"
		through June 2011 were reviewed to assess clinical features and response to
		"therapy or to cessation of therapy. RESULTS: Eleven patients were identified,"
		"having sputum duration of 5 months to 28 years, and respiratory cultures growing"
		"Candida species. Fungi included C albicans (8 patients), C glabrata (2), C krusei"
		"(2), C tropicalis (1), C parapsilosis (1), Aspergillus fumigatus (1), Aspergillus"
		"terreus (1), and Scedosporium (1), the latter 3 in conjunction with Candida"
		"species. All had abnormal chest CT scans, often with bronchiectasis and sometimes"
		"atelectasis or consolidation, and ten of 11 patients were on chronic steroids"
		"(inhaled and/or systemic). Antifungal therapy, mostly oral voriconazole and"
		"nebulized amphotericin, led to improved respiratory symptoms and sputum within 3"
		weeks in 10 of 10 treated patients. Lack of antifungal therapy or early cessation
		of treatment was associated with progressive or recurrent symptoms and death of
		one patient. CONCLUSIONS: This case series suggests that chronic candidal
		bronchitis is associated with significant morbidity and responds well to
		treatment. Such patients may benefit from extended antifungal therapy. Guidelines
		for the treatment of Candida in pulmonary secretions should be reevaluated.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candidemia is one of the most common nosocomial infections globally
		"and it is associated with considerable excess mortality and costs. Abreast,"
		biofilm-forming strains are associated with even higher mortality rates and poor
		prognosis for the patient. AIMS: To evaluate a possible association between the
		biofilm-forming capability of Candida bloodstream isolates and the clinical
		"evolution in patients with candidemia. METHODS: An observational, retrospective"
		study was conducted at a tertiary care university hospital during 9 years
		(2006-2015). The biofilm quantitation of the Candida bloodstream isolates was
		determined by crystal violet staining and XTT reduction assay. RESULTS: A total
		of 218 cases of candidemia had been diagnosed and 89 isolates were obtained. The
		mortality rate was 36% and the main risk factors were antibiotic exposure and the
		"use of catheters. Candida tropicalis (52.8%) was the most frequent species,"
		"followed by Candida albicans (30.4%), Candida parapsilosis sensu stricto (10.1%),"
		"Candida orthopsilosis (3.4%), Candida krusei (2.2%) and Candida glabrata sensu"
		"stricto (1.1%). All the strains were biofilm producers, which is an important"
		contribution to the patient's mortality. C. tropicalis showed the highest
		"production of biomass biofilm, whereas C. glabrata exhibited the highest"
		metabolic activity. CONCLUSIONS: This study contributes to expand the knowledge
		about the local epidemiology of candidemia and highlights the impact of Candida
		biofilm on patient's outcome.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: This retrospective study investigated clinical manifestations of
		candidemia caused by uncommon Candida species and antifungal susceptibility of
		the isolates in a regional hospital in Taiwan. METHODS: The uncommon Candida
		"species was initially defined as Candida species other than C. albicans, C."
		"tropicalis, C. glabrata complex, C. parapsilosis complex and C. krusei. All"
		uncommon Candida isolates were identified and confirmed by molecular methods.
		In vitro susceptibility testing of the uncommon Candida species to nine
		antifungal agents was conducted using the broth microdilution method with the
		"Sensititre YeastOne (SYO) system (Trek Diagnostic Systems, Ltd., East Grimstead,"
		"UK). RESULTS: Twenty-one patients, comprising 11 males and 10 females with a"
		"median age of 69 years, were recruited. Cancer (n = 11) was the most common"
		"underlying disease, 19 (90.5%) cases had prior antibiotic exposure, and only two"
		patients had prior antifungal use. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was
		"38.1% (n = 8). C. guilliermondii (n = 11) was the most common pathogen, followed"
		by C. curvata (n = 3). C. guilliermondii isolates exhibited relatively high rates
		of azole minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) above epidemiological cut-off
		"values (ECVs), whereas C. pelliculosa and C. lusitaniae isolates all remained"
		susceptible to azoles. All three C. curvata isolates had high caspofungin
		(>8 mg/L) and fluconazole MICs (8 mg/L) and could be defined as
		multidrug-resistant. CONCLUSIONS: Uncommon Candida species frequently exhibit
		high rates of non-susceptibility to antifungals. Identification of all Candida
		isolates at the species level from blood samples is of value for treatment.

		Index of Suspicion.
PG	-	8039803
LID	-	10.1155/2018/8039803 [doi]
LID	-	8039803
AB	-	Empyema thoracis is a serious condition characterized by the accumulation of
		"purulent fluid in the pleural cavity, typically following a pneumonia,"
		"subdiaphragmatic abscess, or esophageal rupture. Fungal empyema thoracis is a"
		"rare form of this condition with especially high mortality, in which the most"
		frequently isolated fungus is Candida spp. This article presents a 74-year-old
		"female with Candida krusei pneumonia and a complicated hospital course, initially"
		"presenting with nausea, vomiting, and dysphagia. She was initially suspected to"
		have community-acquired pneumonia and was started on azithromycin and
		ceftriaxone. Worsening respiratory function led to the diagnosis of
		hydropneumothorax. Pleural fluid and an independent sample of pus and pleural
		"tissue grew Candida krusei, giving the diagnosis of fungal empyema. With further"
		"respiratory deterioration, the patient was intubated and switched to"
		piperacillin/tazobactam and micafungin. Decortication with extensive pleural peel
		and removal of foul-smelling pus and food particles within the chest was
		"performed. This further lead to confirmation of esophageal perforation, and she"
		"was started on voriconazole and meropenem. After developing septic shock, the"
		"patient was managed with phenylephrine and vasopressin. Finally, after improving"
		"she was weaned off pressors and extubated, followed by an"
		esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EDG) with pneumatic balloon dilation and WallFlex
		"stent placement. This patient's case demonstrated an example of empyema thoracis,"
		which required a high index of suspicion since the presentation was with a
		community-acquired infection. Candida empyema thoracis may be a complication of
		"operation, gastroesophageal fistula, and spontaneous esophageal rupture. On the"
		"other hand, the course of this patient's hospital stay progressed from esophageal"
		"perforation to Candida krusei pneumonia, empyema, and pneumothorax. Thus,"
		community-acquired fungal empyema should be considered in patients with
		"respiratory symptoms and suspected esophageal perforation; nevertheless, after a"
		"diagnosis of fungal empyema, esophageal perforation should also be ruled out in"
		"addition to other causes like pneumonia, subphrenic abscess, and hematogenous"
		spread. Improved communication between clinicians and microbiologists can lead to
		early diagnosis and a reduction in the morbidity and mortality of this condition.

		transplantation and neutropenia treated prophylactically with fluconazole.
PG	-	1274-7
AB	-	BACKGROUND: In early 1990 fluconazole was introduced as a prophylactic antifungal
		agent after bone marrow transplantation. During the same year Candida krusei
		emerged as the chief candida pathogen among patients with bone marrow
		transplants. METHODS: To determine whether there was a correlation between the
		"introduction of fluconazole and the increased incidence of C. krusei, we"
		"conducted a retrospective study based on the medical, mycologic, and autopsy"
		records of all adult inpatients who had undergone bone marrow transplantation (n
		= 296) or who had leukemia (n = 167) at the study center during 1989 and 1990.
		RESULTS: The 84 patients who received antifungal prophylaxis with fluconazole had
		a sevenfold greater frequency of C. krusei infection than the 335 patients who
		"did not receive fluconazole (8.3 percent vs. 1.2 percent, P = 0.002), despite"
		having a lower frequency of disseminated C. albicans and C. tropicalis infections
		"(0 vs. 6.0 percent, P = 0.02). Ten of the 11 C. krusei infections were controlled"
		by a combination of amphotericin B and flucytosine. Colonization by C. krusei was
		found in 40.5 percent of the patients who received fluconazole but in only 16.7
		percent of those who did not receive it (P less than 0.0001). Colonization was
		independently associated with the prophylactic use of both fluconazole (odds
		"ratio, 3.50; P less than 0.001) and norfloxacin (odds ratio, 2.53; P = 0.04). C."
		krusei was not susceptible to fluconazole in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: In patients at
		"high risk for disseminated candida infections, suppression of bacterial flora and"
		"the more common candida pathogens may permit some less pathogenic, but natively"
		"resistant candida species, such as C. krusei, to emerge as systemic pathogens."

TI	-	Polymicrobial candidaemia revealed by peripheral blood smear and chromogenic
		medium.
PG	-	196-8
AB	-	Candida spp are the fourth most common group of nosocomial pathogens isolated
		"from patients on medical, surgical, and intensive care wards. Polymicrobial"
		candidaemia has rarely been described. The diagnosis of candidaemia from
		peripheral blood smears has not been widely reported. This report describes the
		case of a young woman suffering from Ewing's sarcoma who developed a syndrome of
		septic shock. Deep fungal infection was diagnosed from a systematic peripheral
		blood smear and yeasts were isolated within 24 hours. A subculture on CHROMagar
		Candida allowed the differentiation and presumptive identification of Candida
		tropicalis and Candida krusei. Species identification was confirmed by the ID 32C
		system. This report underlines the usefulness of peripheral blood smears in the
		"diagnosis of fulminant deep fungal infections, and of a differential isolation"
		medium in the rapid presumptive identification of clinically important yeast
		species from clinical samples. This medium is particularly useful for the
		"detection of mixed fungal infections, allowing early and better adapted"
		antifungal treatment.

TI	-	Prevalence and antifungal susceptibility of Candida species in a tertiary care
		"hospital in Islamabad, Pakistan."
PG	-	986-991
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and antifungal susceptibility pattern of
		"Candida species. METHODS: This prospective, cross-sectional study was conducted"
		"at the Quaid-e-Azam International Hospital, Islamabad, Pakistan, from January"
		"2014 to February 2015, and comprised different clinical samples which were"
		analysed for various types of microbial infections. Species differentiation was
		confirmed by biochemical and molecular methods. Antifungal susceptibility against
		"amphotericin B, fluconazole and voriconazole was determined by Clinical and"
		Laboratory Standards Institute M44-A disk diffusion method. RESULTS: Of the 219
		"Candida isolates, majority of them were isolated from urine 78(35.6%) and vaginal"
		"swabs 59(26.9%). Moreover, 144(65.8%) samples were of females and 75(34.2%) were"
		of males. Candida albicans 128(58.45%) was the most predominant species followed
		"by Candida glabrata 30(13.69%), Candida tropicalis 26(11.87%), Candida krusei"
		"17(7.76%), Candida parapsilosis 12(5.47%), Candida dubliniensis 3(1.37%) and"
		Candida lusitaniae 3(1.37). All isolates were least susceptible to amphotericin B
		with a susceptibility rate of 213(97.26%). The highest resistance was found for
		voriconazole 40(18.26%) compared to fluconazole 32(14.61%). CONCLUSIONS: Candida
		species possessed high resistance rate against various antifungal agents.

AB	-	"Candida spp. are among the most frequent nosocomial pathogens, contributing"
		significantly to morbidity and mortality. Longitudinal data on the epidemiology
		of Candida bloodstream infections (BSIs) are still limited. Isolates and clinical
		data from 1218 episodes of Candida BSI were prospectively collected from patients
		in 52 hospitals in the USA between 1998 and 2006. Susceptibilities to
		"amphotericin B, flucytosine, fluconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole,"
		"anidulafungin, caspofungin and micafungin were determined for 1077 Candida"
		isolates by the CLSI reference broth microdilution method using the recently
		published species-specific clinical breakpoints. Candida albicans was the most
		"prevalent species (50.7%), followed by Candida parapsilosis (17.4%), Candida"
		glabrata (16.7%) and Candida tropicalis (10.2%). The prevalence of non-albicans
		Candida spp. increased over time. Patients had a mean age of 51 years and a mean
		length of hospital stay prior to BSI of 22 days. The main underlying conditions
		were gastrointestinal (20.1%) and pulmonary (13.0%) diseases. Intravenous
		catheters (19.1%) and the urinary tract (8.0%) were the most frequently
		"determined likely sources, whilst in the majority of patients (61.1%) no source"
		"could be identified. Overall mortality was 38.1%. Of the isolates studied, 0.8%"
		"of C. albicans, 100.0% of C. glabrata, 2.9% of C. parapsilosis and 4.9% of C."
		"tropicalis were non-susceptible to fluconazole, and 0.6% of C. albicans, 5.0% of"
		"Candida krusei, 7.6% of C. parapsilosis and 9.8% of C. tropicalis were"
		non-susceptible to voriconazole. All echinocandins showed good activity against
		"most Candida spp., including the majority of C. parapsilosis isolates, but only"
		38.1% of C. glabrata tested susceptible to caspofungin.

		"Results of a randomized placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter trial."
PG	-	495-503
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of fluconazole for prevention of
		"fungal infections. DESIGN: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind,"
		multicenter trial. PATIENTS: Adults (257) undergoing chemotherapy for acute
		leukemia. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomly assigned to receive either
		fluconazole (400 mg orally once daily or 200 mg intravenously every 12 hours) or
		placebo. The study drug was started at initiation of chemotherapy and continued
		"until recovery of neutrophil count, development of proven or suspected invasive"
		"fungal infection, or the occurrence of a drug-related toxicity. MEASUREMENTS:"
		"Fungal colonization, proven superficial or invasive fungal infection, empiric"
		"antifungal therapy with amphotericin B, drug-related side effects, and mortality."
		MAIN RESULTS: Fluconazole decreased fungal colonization (83 of 122 [68%] placebo
		patients compared with 34 of 119 [29%] fluconazole patients colonized at end of
		"prophylaxis, P < 0.001) and proven fungal infections (27 of 132 [21%] placebo"
		"patients compared with 11 of 123 [9%] fluconazole patients infected, P = 0.02)."
		Superficial fungal infections occurred in 20 of 132 (15%) placebo patients but in
		"only 7 of 123 (6%) fluconazole patients (P = 0.01), whereas invasive fungal"
		infections developed in 10 of 132 (8%) placebo patients and in 5 of 123 (4%)
		fluconazole patients (P = 0.3). Fluconazole was especially effective in
		eliminating colonization and infection by Candida species other than Candida
		krusei (66 of 122 [64%] placebo patients colonized at end of prophylaxis compared
		"with 11 of 119 [9%] fluconazole patients, P < 0.001; 22 of 132 [17%] placebo"
		"patients infected compared with 7 of 123 [6%] fluconazole patients, P = 0.005)."
		Aspergillus infections were infrequent in both fluconazole (3 cases) and placebo
		"groups (3 cases). The use of amphotericin B, the incidence of drug-related side"
		"effects, and overall mortality were similar in both study groups. CONCLUSION:"
		Prophylactic fluconazole prevents colonization and superficial infections by
		Candida species other than Candida krusei in patients undergoing chemotherapy for
		acute leukemia and is well tolerated. Fluconazole could not be clearly shown to
		"be effective for preventing invasive fungal infections, reducing the use of"
		"amphotericin B, or decreasing the number of deaths."

		transplant recipients: a multicenter retrospective study. Italian Study Group of
		Fungal Infections in Thoracic Organ Transplant Recipients.
PG	-	112-6
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Fungal infections (FI) after solid organ transplantation (Tx) remain
		a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Aspergillus and Candida account for
		more than 80% of FI. METHODS: One thousand nine hundred and sixty-three patients
		"undergoing thoracic organ Tx [1,852 heart and 111 lung (35 heart-lung Tx, 30"
		"double-lung Tx, 46 single-lung Tx)] in 12 Italian Centers between November 1985"
		and January 1997 were included in the study. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients (41
		heart Tx - 2.2%; 9 heart-lung Tx - 25.7%; 1 single-lung Tx - 2.2%) developed 53
		invasive FI at a median of 58 days (range 6-2479) after Tx. Aspergillosis was the
		most frequent FI in our series accounting for 64.1% (34/53) of all FI [A
		"fumigatus, n=29 (85.3%); A nidulans, n=2 (5.9%); A niger, n=2 (5.9%); A terreus,"
		"n=1 (2.9%)]; 30 (88.2%) patients developed invasive lung aspergillosis, 2 (5.9%)"
		"a tracheobronchitis, 1 (2.9%) a skin infection, and 1 (2.9%) a sternal wound"
		"infection. Twelve patients (22.6%) developed candidiasis [C albicans, n=8"
		"(66.6%); C krusei, n=1 (8.3%); C glabrata, n=1 (8.3%); C parapsilosis, n=1"
		"(8.3%); C sake, n=1 (8.3%)]. There were seven episodes (58.3%) of candidemia, two"
		"(16.7%) esophagitis, two (16.7%) gastritis, and one (8.3%) tracheobronchitis."
		Mortality was 29.4% for patients developing aspergillosis and 33.3% for those
		"experiencing candidiasis. Furthermore, four patients developed the following: one"
		"C neoformans meningitis, one Sporothrix cyanescens pneumonia, one Rhizopus spp."
		"tracheobronchitis, and one Trichosporon beigelii disseminated infection. Three"
		additional patients were diagnosed affected by deep mould infection by histology
		"alone. CONCLUSIONS: Deep-seated FI were relatively rare in our series, although"
		their mortality rate is still very high.

		prior to and after fluconazole had been introduced into antifungal prophylaxis.
PG	-	283-7
AB	-	"From 1989 until 1996, during the last 8 years, the proportion of Candida (C.)"
		"krusei, and other non-albicans Candida spp. isolated from surveillance cultures"
		"and from sterile body sites, was analyzed among 13,758 admissions in a National"
		"Cancer Institute. During these admissions a total of 9,042 isolates were"
		"prospectively collected from surveillance cultures, and 126 from blood cultures."
		The proportion of C. krusei among all organisms was 12.7% to 16.5% in 1989
		"through 1991, i.e., before fluconazole was introduced into prophylactic"
		protocols. After the introduction of fluconazole into prophylaxis in acute
		leukemia in 1992 the incidence of C. krusei was 7.9% to 8.6% during 1994 to 1996.
		"After 5 years of using this drug for prophylaxis, the incidence of C. krusei was"
		"lower than before this drug was introduced in our institute. Among yeasts, the"
		most frequently isolated pathogen was still Candida albicans (72.2% of all
		"isolated fungal organisms). Among molds, Aspergillus spp. was the most frequently"
		isolated agent. Analyzing the etiology of proven fungal infections (fungemias)
		"confirmed by positive blood cultures, C. albicans was the most common causative"
		organism in 53.8% of cases. The incidence of fungemia due to Torulopsis (C.)
		glabrata and C. krusei before and after fluconazole introduction did not change.
		"Of 126 organisms isolated from blood cultures, there was no increase in T. (C.)"
		glabrata or C. krusei after introduction of fluconazole for prophylaxis and
		"therapy, and the quoted 6.4% of fungemic episodes remained stable with an"
		incidence of 1 fungemia/year since 1991. The proportion of C. krusei and C.
		glabrata among Candida spp. was decreasing in our center between 1989 and 1996.
		"Also, the proportion of non-albicans Candida spp. among isolates decreased from"
		25.7% in 1990 to 11.9% in 1996.

TI	-	Hematogenous infections due to Candida parapsilosis: changing trends in fungemic
		patients at a comprehensive cancer center during the last four decades.
PG	-	6-Nov
AB	-	This study was performed to evaluate trends in species distribution in patients'
		with hematogenous candidiasis at a comprehensive cancer center. The results of a
		"retrospective analysis from January 1, 1993 to December 31, 1998 were compared"
		with prior reports from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in the last forty
		"years. In 570 total episodes since 1974, 43.9% were due to Candida albicans."
		"During 1990's, C. parapsilosis emerged as the most frequent yeast species in the"
		non-C. albicans group (36.1% during 1993-1998 from 20.9% 1974-1982; p < 0.01). An
		increase in C. krusei from 5.9% (1974-1982) to 10.5% during the recent six years
		(1993-1998) was also noticed. The proportion of C. tropicalis among non-albicans
		"fungemia during 1974-1982 was 42.8%, whereas in 1993 to 1998 a marked decline in"
		"C. tropicalis hematogenous infection was observed (27.8%; p < 0.01). During 1998,"
		the incidence of candidemia declined from 7.1% (1972-1973) and 6.5% (1982) to
		"3.4% (p < 0.01), and improved survival among fungemic patients (33% mortality in"
		1998; 77.3% during 1974-1982; p < 0.001) was encouraging. The increase in C.
		parapsilosis bloodstream invasion during 1990's was associated with a significant
		reduction in the endogenous non-albicans Candida tropicalis infection that
		"probably resulted in part due to the common prophylaxis, and/or preemptive"
		fluconazole given routinely in high-risk patients undergoing treatment for
		cancer. The widespread use of extraneous implantable and/or semi-implantable
		indwelling intra-vascular devices may also have played an important role in
		promoting (exogenous) C. parapsilosis infection. This study emphasizes the
		"importance of periodic evaluation of candidemia, especially at centers caring for"
		patients at risk.

		prevalence of such a contamination needs to be established. From January 2004 to
		"December 2008, we prospectively investigated the potential fungal contamination"
		of all the PSs collected in our institution using a standardised procedure
		consisting in centrifugation of 10 mL PS and incubation of the pellet seeded on
		"fungal-specific medium for 15 days at 30 degrees C. During the study period, 728"
		"transplantations (397 kidneys, 262 livers and 69 hearts) were performed for which"
		"659 PSs (90.5%) were available. The yeast contamination rate was 0% (0/62), 3.1%"
		"(11/356) and 4.1% (10/241) for heart, kidney and liver transplants, respectively."
		"We identified 10 Candida albicans, five C. glabrata, two C. krusei, one C."
		"tropicalis, one C. valida, one Pichia etchelsii and one Rhodorula sp. Routine"
		bacterial analysis identified only five of these 21 fungal contaminations. Twenty
		recipients were alive after at least one year of follow-up and one died from
		meningeal carcinomatosis at seven months. Three patients were found to have the
		same species of Candida from their surgical drains but did not develop any
		infection or abnormalities upon ultrasound investigation. Fourteen patients
		received antifungal drugs. Yeast contamination occurred in 3.4% of all kidney and
		liver PSs tested. Its clinical consequences and therapeutic management remain to
		be defined. Our study also suggests that optimisation/standardisation of
		"microbiological procedures is warranted, including analysis of large PS volume,"
		seeding of fungal-specific medium and prolonged incubation.

PG	-	4745-52
LID	-	10.1002/cncr.24507 [doi]
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: The incidence, epidemiology, Candida species distribution, resistance"
		"patterns, and outcome of candidemia in high-risk hematologic malignancy and/or"
		stem cell transplantation patients have not been extensively described since the
		"introduction of new antifungal agents. METHODS: In this retrospective study, the"
		authors reviewed the medical records and microbiologic data of hematologic
		malignancy patients with candidemia at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson
		Cancer Center from March 2001 to February 2007. RESULTS: The authors analyzed 173
		"episodes of candidemia (170 patients), 125 (72%) of which were breakthrough cases"
		"after prior antifungal agents, mainly fluconazole (28 [22%]), caspofungin (25"
		"[20%]), and voriconazole (18 [14%]). The incidence of candidemia (per 100,000"
		"inpatient days) remained relatively stable, from 13.9 in 2001 to 19.2 in 2006."
		"However, compared with the findings of previous studies at the authors'"
		"institution, the frequency of Candida glabrata and C. krusei infection decreased"
		"(to 5% and 17%, respectively) and C. parapsilosis (24%) and C. tropicalis (21%)"
		increased. C. parapsilosis fungemia was associated with prior caspofungin use
		"(P<.001). The overall 30-day crude mortality rate was 38%, and the attributable"
		"mortality rate was 19%, similar to previous findings at the authors' institution."
		The Candida species associated with the highest mortality rate was C. glabrata.
		CONCLUSIONS: Despite the widespread use of antifungal prophylaxis and the
		"introduction of new antifungal agents, the incidence and associated mortality"
		rates of candidemia remained stable in high-risk hematologic malignancy patients.
		"However, its epidemiological characteristics have shifted, with C. parapsilosis"
		and C. tropicalis becoming more common.

PG	-	110-116
LID	-	10.4103/ijmm.IJMM_20_112 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: Candidaemia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality of hospitalised
		"patients, especially in developing countries. This study was conducted to monitor"
		any change in species distribution and antifungal susceptibility pattern of
		Candida species causing candidaemia over the last 20 years. MATERIALS AND
		METHODS: The candidaemia cases reported during January 1999 and December 2018 at
		our centre were reviewed. The yeasts were identified by phenotypic characters
		(during 1999-2014) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation-time of flight
		mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) (during 2014-2018). Antifungal susceptibility
		testing (AFST) was performed in accordance with the Clinical and Laboratory
		"Standards Institute guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 602,963 blood samples from"
		patients with suspected sepsis were processed. Candidaemia was diagnosed in 7927
		(1.31%) cases. The frequency of cases rose significantly (P = 0.000) in the last
		"quarter of the study. Candida tropicalis (40.1%) was the most common species,"
		"followed by Candida albicans (15.2%), Wickerhamomyces anomalus (13.1%), Candida"
		"krusei (6.6%), Candida parapsilosis (4.7%) and others. Rare species such as"
		"Candida auris, Candida lambica, Candida orthopsilosis, Candida vishwanathii were"
		identified after the introduction of MALDI-TOF. The minimum inhibitory
		concentrations of amphotericin B rose significantly from the first to last
		quarter (0.5%-4.9%). Fluconazole resistance was fairly constant at 7.4%-8.8%.
		CONCLUSION: Local epidemiology of candidaemia at our centre was distinct
		regarding prevalence and change of spectrum of species. The identification of
		rare species was possible after the introduction of MALDI-TOF. With the emergence
		"of multidrug-resistant C. auris and resistance in other species, routine AFST has"
		become imperative.

AB	-	We investigated the species distribution and antifungal susceptibility of Candida
		isolates from tertiary and non-tertiary hospitals in South Korea from 2002-2004.
		"Of the 612 Candida isolates that were collected, Candida albicans, C."
		"parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, and C. glabrata occurred most frequently, accounting"
		"for 97.3% and 96.8% of the isolates in tertiary and non-tertiary hospitals,"
		"respectively. C. albicans was the most common isolate, but the incidence of"
		non-C. albicansCandida species was higher than that of C. albicans in tertiary
		hospitals. The Candida species had much lower MIC(90) to voriconazole (tertiary
		"hospitals: 0.5 microg/ml, non-tertiary hospitals: 0.25 microg/ml) than to"
		"fluconazole (tertiary hospitals: 8 microg/ml, non-tertiary hospitals: 4"
		microg/ml). The MIC(90) of Candida isolates to 5-flucytosine in non-tertiary
		hospitals was two times higher than that observed in tertiary facilities. The C.
		"glabrata isolates showed a tendency toward strong resistance to fluconazole, but"
		C. parapsilosis isolates were susceptible to all of the evaluated antifungal
		"agents. Voriconazole showed strong in vitro activity against Candida species,"
		"especially C. krusei, which is resistant to fluconazole and 5-flucytosine. To our"
		"knowledge, this is the first report of Candida antifungal susceptibility that"
		includes non-tertiary hospitals in South Korea.

		oral candidosis in the course of HIV infection.
PG	-	691-9
AB	-	"The objective of this case-control study, conducted in a large Italian university"
		"hospital over a 12-month period, was to evaluate the risk factors associated with"
		the emergence of azole resistant oral candidosis in 64 Human Immunodeficiency
		Virus (HIV) infected patients. A swab was obtained from each patient by brushing
		"candidal lesions. Candida albicans was isolated in 41 patients (64%), Candida"
		"glabrata in ten (16%), Candida krusei in five (8%), Candida kefyr in two (3%),"
		"Candida tropicalis in two (3%), and Candida lipolytica and Candida guilliermondii"
		"in one case, respectively. Two patients suffered a double infection i.e. C."
		"albicans+C. krusei and C. albicans+C. glabrata, respectively. Candida species"
		"were tested in vitro for their susceptibility to ketoconazole, fluconazole,"
		itraconazole and amphotericin B. MICs of the four antifungal drugs were obtained
		for each yeast using a microdilution broth method developed in our laboratory.
		Twenty four (37%) of the isolated strains were resistant both to itraconazole and
		"fluconazole, five (8%) to fluconazole alone, and two (3%) to ketoconazole alone,"
		while none of the isolated strains was resistant to amphotericin B. Patients with
		oral candidosis caused by a strain resistant to one or more azole drug were
		compared to control patients with azole-susceptible oral candidosis. On
		"univariate analysis, more than five episodes of oral candidosis in the last year"
		"(P = 0.01), previous use of azole therapy (P = 0.001), C2-3 category of HIV"
		infection (P = 0.01) and low number of circulating CD4+ T-cells (P = 0.03) were
		significantly associated with an increased risk for the development of azole
		"resistance. However, previous use of azole therapy was the only factor selected"
		by a stepwise logistic regression analysis which was independently associated
		with the isolation of azole resistant strains (P = 0.003). Our findings indicate
		"that, in view of the potential risk for the emergence and selection of azole"
		"resistant strains of Candida in patients with AIDS, it is important to carefully"
		choose the antifungal drug for the therapy of mild fungal infections after
		evaluation of the in-vitro susceptibility of the isolated strains.

PG	-	839-42
LID	-	10.3109/13693780903580121 [doi]
AB	-	This is a retrospective observational study of clinical and epidemiologic data
		from bloodstream yeast infections over 5 years (2004-2008) in a tertiary-care
		"hospital. During this period, there were 52 such infections, at a rate of 2.4 per"
		"1,000 hospital admissions. Non-C. albicans Candida species and other genera were"
		"responsible for 82% of infections, with C. tropicalis and C. parapsilosis being"
		the most common. In 2008 no C. albicans infections occurred. Several uncommon
		"fungal pathogens were observed, including Trichosporon asahii, Rhodotorula spp."
		"and Candida zeylanoides. Of 16 isolates tested, 3 (19%) were resistant to"
		"fluconazole, including one C. zeylanoides (MIC 8 microg/ml) and one C. tropicalis"
		"(MIC 16 microg/ml) isolate, as well as intrinsically resistant C. krusei. All"
		isolates tested were susceptible to itraconazole (n = 7) and amphotericin B (n =
		"8). Yeast infections were associated with severe underlying diseases, mainly"
		"hematological/solid cancers (71%), hospitalization in the ICU (41%), central"
		"venous catheters (80%), and use of antimicrobials (94%). The overall mortality"
		rate was 50%. Our finding of a predominance of non-C. albicans Candida species
		"infection with uncommon yeasts, and fluconazole resistance, suggests the need for"
		"continuous surveillance of fungemia and of antibiotic susceptibility trends, in"
		order to adopt treatment strategies applicable to particular healthcare
		institutions.

PG	-	117-23
AB	-	Invasive infections due to Candida krusei are often observed in immunocompromised
		"patients who have received prior therapy with fluconazole, although infection has"
		also occurred in patients in the absence of this antifungal agent. From August 25
		"through September 19, 1995, we identified four patients with C. krusei fungemia"
		on our hematology/oncology unit. Molecular typing of all the isolates was
		performed by restriction endonuclease analysis of genomic DNA using HinfI. A
		total of 7 patients found to be colonized or infected with C. krusei were matched
		with 14 controls. There was no difference between the cases and controls with
		"respect to underlying disease, duration of hospitalization, or neutropenia. The"
		"numbers of days of hyperalimentation, corticosteroids, and antibiotics were"
		similar between both groups. The mean number of antibiotics was greater in the
		cases versus controls (5.0 versus 2.5; p = .003). There was no difference with
		respect to total dose or duration of fluconazole administration. Molecular typing
		"of the isolates revealed that four had identical DNA banding patterns, plus"
		another two that differed by one band and were considered related. Three
		"historical strains were unrelated. In conclusion, this report demonstrates that"
		"molecular typing can be used to define clonality and, thereby, support increased"
		infection control practices to eliminate such outbreaks when evidence of clonal
		spread is present.

PG	-	225-30
LID	-	10.3109/13693786.2012.708107 [doi]
AB	-	"From 2006 to 2010, a retrospective study was conducted in a university referral"
		tertiary care hospital to study the frequency and distribution of Candida species
		"in different medical specialties. The use of mechanical ventilation, central"
		"venous catheter, and urinary catheter were recorded per 1,000 patient-days and"
		the use of antifungals was calculated using defined daily dose (DDD). A total of
		313 episodes were identified and the overall incidence was 0.54 (0.41-0.71)
		"episodes per 1,000 patient-days. Candida albicans caused 44% of the overall"
		"episodes, followed by C. tropicalis (21.7%), C. parapsilosis (14.4%), C. glabrata"
		"(11.2%), and C. krusei (3.5%). The incidence of C. glabrata significantly"
		increased from 2006-2010 (range: 4.8-23.5%) (P = 0.024). Candida glabrata was
		associated with malignancies (P = 0.004) and C. krusei with hematologic
		malignancies (P < 0.0001). The use of antifungals was higher in the
		hematology/bone marrow transplant units and represented 40% of all fluconazole
		prescription in the hospital. There was no correlation with the use of
		fluconazole and the increasing ratio of C. glabrata (r = 0.60). The use of
		invasive devices was significantly higher in the intensive care units (ICUs) than
		"the medical and surgical emergencies units (P < 0.001). In contrast, the"
		"emergencies had higher incidence of candidemia (2-2.1 episodes/1,000"
		"patient-days) than the ICUs (1.6 episodes 1,000 patient-days). Candida glabrata"
		candidemia showed a significant increase in contrast to the current national
		literature where C. parapsilosis remained the most important non-C. albicans
		Candida species in Brazilian hospitals. Our findings suggested that the
		increasing incidence of C. glabrata was not associated with use of fluconazole
		and other risk factors might play an important role.

TI	-	Epidemiology and clinical outcome of candidaemia among Jordanian newborns over a
		10-year period.
PG	-	139-44
AB	-	This retrospective study includes all newborn patients with culture proved
		candidaemia who were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of Jordan
		University Hospital through the period January 1995 to June 2006. Among 24
		"patients included, 13 (54.2%) died. The incidence of candidaemia was 0.27%, the"
		mean age at diagnosis 25.9 d and the mean gestational age at birth 34.6 weeks.
		Species most frequently isolated were Candida albicans (50%) and C. krusei (20%).
		Previous gastrointestinal pathology was present in 41.7% of the cases. A
		comparison of cases due to C. albicans with those due to other species of Candida
		"revealed no statistical differences in terms of demographic factors, age at onset"
		"of disease, mortality, clinical manifestations or risk factors. Based on our"
		"results, empirical antifungal therapy should be considered in neonates who have"
		gastrointestinal pathology and other risk factors.

TI	-	Fungal colonization of the esophagus in alcoholic liver disease.
PG	-	821-5
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: Little is known about the fungal colonization of the esophagus. Since
		"alcoholic liver disease (ALD) patients are prone to fungal esophagitis, we have"
		investigated the esophageal fungal colonization of this patient group. METHODS:
		One hundred consecutive ALD patients were enrolled in this prospective study. 22
		patients with dyspeptic symptoms acted as controls. After taking an oropharyngeal
		"swab, patients underwent an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and surface material"
		was obtained from the esophagus for direct smears and culture. RESULTS: In the
		ALD group pseudohyphae were found in 21.5% and yeast forms in 6.4% of the direct
		"smears. The culture was positive in 40.8% of the ALD patients, the isolated"
		"strains were: 30 C. albicans, 2 C. kefyr, 2 C. krusei, 1 C. zeylanoides and in 3"
		cases the species could not be identified. 41.9% of ALD patients and 13.6% of
		control patients (p = 0.013) had fungi in their esophagus. Significantly more ALD
		"patients had fungal esophagitis than in the control group (19.3% vs. 0%, p ="
		"0.021), the rate of fungal colonization was also higher, but the difference was"
		not significant (22.5% vs. 13.6%). A significantly higher rate of fungal
		esophagitis and esophageal colonization was found in patients with fungi in their
		oropharyngeal swabs (p = 0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: Fungal colonization of the
		esophagus is frequent in ALD patients. Its presence might have clinical
		significance in the case of liver transplantation.

		Resistance surveillance study in Venezuelan strains.
PG	-	137-43
LID	-	10.1080/13693780802144339 [doi]
AB	-	The aim of this study was to determine in vitro susceptibility profiles of
		Venezuelan strains of Candida spp. to four antifungal agents. One hundred and
		forty five (145) isolates were recovered during a 1-year period (June 2006 to
		June 2007) from clinical specimens of patients with severe Candida spp.
		"infections in 15 hospitals. In vitro susceptibilities to amphotericin B,"
		"fluconazole, itraconazole and voriconazole were determined by modified Etest. Non"
		Candida albicans Candida spp. were the most frequently isolated yeasts (72.4%) in
		comparison with C. albicans (27.6%). Candida spp. strains showed MIC ranges
		between <0.002 and 0.5 mug/ml to amphotericin B. While none were found to be
		"resistant to voriconazole, 5.5% and 27.6% of the test strains were resistant to"
		"fluconazole and itraconazole, respectively. C. albicans remains the most"
		susceptible of the yeasts studied to fluconazole and itraconazole (P<0.05) when
		compared with non C. albicans Candida spp. C. krusei showed the greater
		"cross-resistance to azoles, followed by C. glabrata, C. tropicalis and C."
		"parapsilosis, while C. albicans isolates did not demonstrate this characteristic."
		It is very important to carry out the correct species identification of clinical
		yeast isolates because they show up variations in both distribution and
		"susceptibility profiles according to the hospital, patient's underlying disease,"
		"clinical specimen analyzed, and the geographical region in which the studies were"
		conducted. The Mycology Department of the INHRR is the national reference center
		"responsible for antifungal resistance surveillance, performing the susceptibility"
		tests with isolates recovered from hospitalized patients in public health centres
		which do not have mycological diagnosis laboratories.

		"from approximately 100 fungi, representing about 50 species of pathogens and"

		and species-specific oligonucleotide probes. Each step in the process of
		detection and identification was standardized to a common set of conditions
		applicable without modification to all fungi of interest and all types of
		clinical specimens. These steps consist of DNA extraction by boiling specimens in
		"an alkaline guanidine-phenol-Tris reagent, amplification of a variable region of"
		"the 28S rRNA gene with universal primers, and amplicon identification by probe"
		hybridization or DNA sequencing performed under conditions identical for all
		fungi. The results obtained by testing a panel of fungal isolates and a variety
		of clinical specimens indicate a high level of specificity.

TI	-	Increased incidence of vulvovaginal candidiasis caused by Candida glabrata in
		Jordan.
PG	-	103-7
AB	-	Due to the rising importance of Candida glabrata and other non-albicans Candida
		"as principle human opportunistic pathogens, 356 women with abnormal vaginal"
		"discharge who attended a private obstetrics and gynecology clinic in Amman,"
		"Jordan, between January 1999 and February 2001 were examined. The isolation rate"
		of Candida spp. from high-vaginal swabs was 44.9%. CHROMagar Candida and
		"conventional mycological methods identified six isolated Candida spp., including"
		"C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, C. krusei, and C."
		"kefyr. The percentages of C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. tropicalis isolates"
		"were 43.1%, 32.5%, and 8.1%, respectively. C. albicans was isolated in"
		combination with C. tropicalis and C. krusei in two patients. Statistical
		analysis of the present results clearly show an increase in the incidence of
		"vulvovaginal candidiasis caused by C. glabrata in the two study periods,"
		"1994-1996 and 1999-2001 (P = 0.0186). In contrast, comparing the proportions of"
		"vulvovaginal candidiasis caused by C. albicans in the two periods, there was no"
		"significant difference. These results may have significant clinical implications,"
		as C. glabrata are innately less susceptible to most antifungal agents than C.
		albicans; these findings support viewing this organism as a major pathogen.

TI	-	The epidemiology of Candida species associated with vulvovaginal candidiasis in
		an Iranian patient population.
PG	-	199-203
LID	-	10.1016/j.ejogrb.2010.11.022 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: Vulvovaginal candidiasis is a common infection among women worldwide.
		"According to previous epidemiological studies, Candida albicans is the most"
		"common species of Candida. The prevalence of non-Candida species, however, is"
		increasing. Identification of Candida species among the population will not only
		"help health professionals to choose suitable antifungal treatments, but also"
		"prevent development of drug resistance. The aim of this study was to identify,"
		"using chromogenic agar medium, the Candida species associated with vulvovaginal"
		candidiasis among a sample of the Iranian population. STUDY DESIGN: In a
		"prospective cohort study during a two year period from March 2006 to March 2008,"
		swab samples of vaginal discharge/secretion were taken from 200 patients admitted
		"to the gynecology clinic of Mahdieh Hospital (Tehran, Iran) with a clinical"
		presentation suggestive of vulvovaginal candidiasis. The isolates obtained were
		cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar and chromogenic agar medium. Candida species
		"were also identified by germ tube formation in serum, chlamydospore production on"
		Corn Meal Agar and carbohydrate absorption using the API 20C-AUX kit.
		Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire investigating the risk
		factors associated with candidiasis. An assessment of the different species of
		"recurrent and non-recurrent candidiasis was also made. Descriptive statistics,"
		"chi-square test, and t-test were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: A total of"
		191 isolates were obtained from 175 vaginal specimens. Candida albicans accounted
		for 67% of the strains including single and mixed infections. The other
		"identified species were Candida glabrata (18.3%), Candida tropicalis (6.8%),"
		"Candida krusei (5.8%), Candida parapsilosis (1.6%), and Candida guilliermondii"
		(0.5%) respectively. Mixed infection with two or more species of Candida was seen
		in 10.3% of patients. The most common mixed cause was the combination of Candida
		albicans and Candida glabrata. Participants who were sexually active and those
		who had orogenital sex were more likely to suffer recurrent vulvovaginal
		candidiasis. CONCLUSIONS: Candida albicans was the most common cause of recurrent
		and non-recurrent vulvovaginitis. The second most common species was Candida
		glabrata. This study suggests CHROMagar method as a convenient and cost effective
		yet reliable method to isolate the species of Candida especially in cases where
		more than one species is present.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: In this study we sought to identify differences in risk factors and
		outcome of critically ill patients with Candida albicans and non-albicans
		"candidemia. METHODS: Nonimmunosuppressed, nonneutropenic patients with candidemia"
		diagnosed after intensive care unit (ICU) admission were included in a
		prospective observational study in a medical-surgical ICU at a tertiary academic
		"hospital in Athens, Greece. RESULTS: During the study period (January 2001 to"
		"December 2005), 56 candidemia episodes in 1037 ICU admissions were included"
		"(5.4%). Of these patients, 36/56 (64.3%) had candidemia due to C. albicans and"
		"20/56 (35.7%) due to non-albicans species (8/56 [14.3%] C. glabrata, 6/56 [10.7%]"
		"C. tropicalis, 3/56 [5.4%] C. parapsilosis, 1/56 [1.8%] C. lusitaniae, 1/56"
		[1.8%] C. krusei and 1/56 [1.8%] C. dubliniensis). Administration of
		"glucocorticosteroids, central venous catheter placement, and preexisting"
		candiduria were independently associated with candidemia due to C. non-albicans
		"species (Odds ratio [OR]: 45.1, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.0-669.9; OR:"
		"26.2, 95% CI: 2.1-334.8; and OR: 16.5, 95% CI: 1.6-173.9, respectively). The"
		treatment response rate differed significantly between patients with C. albicans
		and patients with C. non-albicans bloodstream infections (29/36 [80.6%] vs 9/20
		"[45%], P = 0.006). Overall mortality was higher in patients with non-albicans"
		"species than C. albicans bloodstream infections (18/20 [90%] vs 19/36 [52.8%], P"
		= 0.005). Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that candidemia due
		"to non-albicans species was independently associated with death (OR: 6.7, 95% CI:"
		1.2-37.7). CONCLUSIONS: In the subset of critically ill nonimmunosuppressed
		"patients, candidemia caused by non-albicans species occurred more frequently in"
		those with medical devices or receiving steroids. Candidemia due to non-albicans
		species was also associated with higher mortality.

AB	-	Candida species are among the most common bloodstream pathogens in the United
		"States, where the emergence of azole-resistant Candida glabrata and Candida"
		krusei are major concerns. Recent comprehensive longitudinal data from Europe are
		lacking. We conducted a nationwide survey of candidemia during 1991-2000 in 17
		university and university-affiliated hospitals representing 79% of all tertiary
		care hospital beds in Switzerland. The number of transplantations and bloodstream
		infections increased significantly (P<.001). A total of 1137 episodes of
		candidemia were observed: Candida species ranked seventh among etiologic agents
		(2.9% of all bloodstream isolates). The incidence of candidemia was stable over a
		10-year period. C. albicans remained the predominant Candida species recovered
		"(66%), followed by C. glabrata (15%). Candida tropicalis emerged (9%), the"
		"incidence of Candida parapsilosis decreased (1%), and recovery of C. krusei"
		remained rare (2%). Fluconazole consumption increased significantly (P<.001).
		"Despite increasing high-risk activities, the incidence of candidemia remained"
		"unchanged, and no shift to resistant species occurred."

PG	-	143-50
AB	-	Candida krusei has recently been increasingly recognized as a pathogen in
		immunocompromised patients with malignancies. We report four immunocompromised
		patients with C. krusei fungemia and review the literature. Including our 4
		"cases, 62 cases of C. krusei fungemia were identified in the literature. Detailed"
		information was available for only 25 patients. The clinical features of patients
		with C. krusei fungemia are similar to those reported for Candida tropicalis.
		Most patients were neutropenic and more than one half of the patients had
		received antifungal therapy and had evidence of gastrointestinal mucosal
		breakdown before the development of C. krusei fungemia. The overall mortality was
		48%. Patients treated with regimens containing amphotericin B had improved
		survival over patients who received no therapy. Favorable response rates were
		higher in patients receiving high-dose amphotericin B or high-dose amphotericin B
		plus flucytosine when compared to patients treated with low-dose amphotericin B.

AB	-	Optimal staging and evaluation of residual lesions of invasive fungal infections
		(IFIs) are major challenges in the immunocompromised host. Preliminary data have
		suggested that [¹⁸F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([¹⁸F]FDG) uptake may be observed in the
		course of active invasive fungal infections. The aim of this study was to assess
		the role of positron emission tomography with [¹⁸F]FDG ([¹⁸F]FDG-PET) in the
		diagnosis and staging of IFI. A prospective monocentric study evaluating
		[¹⁸F]FDG-PET in 30 consecutive adults and children with European Organization for
		Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group probable or proven IFI was
		"performed. Twenty males and ten females (median age, 45 years (range 6-7 years))"
		"were enrolled. Twenty-six were immunocompromised, as follows: haematological"
		"malignancy (18) with allogeneic stem cell transplantation (16/18), solid tumour"
		"(three), solid organ transplantation (two), diabetes mellitus (two) and cystic"
		"fibrosis (one). IFIs were acute invasive aspergillosis (ten), chronic"
		"disseminated candidiasis (ten), zygomycosis (two), black grains eumycetoma (two),"
		"pulmonary Histoplasma capsulatum var. capsulatum histoplasmosis (two), and"
		"Phomopsis sp. osteoarthritis, Scedosporium apiospermum and Candida krusei"
		"spondylodiscitis, and acute pulmonary coccidioidomycosis in one case each. An"
		increased uptake of [¹⁸F]FDG was observed in all areas previously identified by
		computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging to be involved by IFI. In
		"4/10 chronic disseminated candidiasis cases, [¹⁸F]FDG-PET revealed small splenic"
		abscesses that were unapparent on the corresponding computed tomography scan.
		[¹⁸F]FDG uptake disappeared after 6 months of antifungal therapy in three
		patients with chronic disseminated candidiasis for whom the [¹⁸F]FDG-PET was
		performed to assess the evolution of the disease. [¹⁸F]FDG-PET could potentially
		be useful for the initial diagnosis and staging of IFI. Whether or not
		[¹⁸F]FDG-PET might be useful for assessing the optimal duration of IFI therapy
		should now be assessed in a specific prospective study.

TI	-	The changing face of candidemia: emergence of non-Candida albicans species and
		antifungal resistance.
PG	-	617-23
AB	-	"OBJECTIVES: To assess the changing epidemiology of candidemia in the 1990s, to"
		evaluate the clinical implications for the presence of non-Candida albicans in
		"blood, and to evaluate the presence of antifungal resistance in relation to prior"
		antifungal administration. DESIGN: Multicenter prospective observational study of
		patients with positive blood cultures for Candida species or Torulopsis glabrata.
		SETTING: Four tertiary care medical centers. RESULTS: Four hundred twenty-seven
		consecutive patients were enrolled. The frequency of candidemia due to non-C.
		albicans species significantly increased in each hospital throughout the 3.5-year
		study period (P = 0.01). Thirteen percent of candidemias occurred in patients who
		were already receiving systemic antifungal agents. Candidemias developing while
		receiving antifungal therapy were more likely caused by non-C. albicans species
		than by C. albicans species (P = 0.0005). C. parapsilosis and C. krusei were more
		"commonly seen with prior fluconazole therapy, whereas T. glabrata was more"
		commonly seen with prior amphotericin B therapy. Candida species isolated during
		episodes of breakthrough candidemia exhibited a significantly higher MIC to the
		antifungal agent being administered (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In this large scale
		"study, the non-C. albicans species, especially T. glabrata, emerged as important"
		and frequent pathogens causing fungemia. This finding has major clinical
		implications given the higher complication and mortality rate associated with the
		non-C. albicans species. The change in the pattern of candidemia might be partly
		attributed to the increase in number of immunocompromised hosts and the
		widespread use of prophylactic or empiric antifungal therapy. This is an ominous
		sign given the in vitro resistance of the non-C. albicans species to currently
		available antifungal agents.

		head and neck area.
PG	-	e52-7
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To investigate oral Candida strain diversity in patients receiving
		radiation therapy for head and neck cancer compared to controls by conventional
		"procedures, including cultivation of imprint samples on chromogenic medium and"
		subsequent identification using Analytical Profile Index testing. METHOD AND
		MATERIALS: Twenty-two irradiated patients aged 18 to 55 years were recruited from
		"the Maxillofacial Prosthetic Service, Mahidol University. Concomitantly, 22"
		healthy individuals whose age and sex matched that of the patient group were
		selected for a control group. RESULTS: All patients studied were Candida carriers
		and were predominantly infected with Candida albicans (86.36%). Besides C
		"albicans, other yeasts colonizing the oral cavity of these patients were C"
		"glabrata, C krusei, and C tropicalis. Candida carriage was found relatively less"
		"frequently (45.45%) in control subjects. However, C albicans was still the"
		predominant species detected. No C dubliniensis was found in either group.
		CONCLUSION: Head and neck cancer patients who had received radiotherapy had a
		"high prevalence of Candida colonization in the oral cavity. Consequently,"
		prophylaxis to reduce Candida infection in these patients is required. This may
		improve the quality of life for patients who receive irradiation treatment for
		malignant cancer.

AB	-	Abstract We conducted a four-year (2003-2006) retrospective study of yeasts
		recovered in a hospital laboratory in the centre of Portugal to evaluate the
		epidemiology of yeast infections. Clinical isolates and data were gathered from
		751 patients corresponding to 906 episodes of yeast infection. The isolates were
		"first identified using classical and commercial methods, routinely employed at"
		the hospital laboratory. We then re-identified the same isolates using RFLP of
		the ITS 5.8S rRNA gene and sequence of the D1/D2 domain of the 26S rRNA gene.
		Candida parapsilosis isolates were re-identified using the Ban I digestion of the
		SADH gene. C. albicans was the most frequently isolated of the yeasts found in
		"the analysed specimens, with an overall incidence of 69.6% and then in decreasing"
		"order, C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis and C. krusei. C. parapsilosis"
		"was most frequently recovered from younger patients, decreasing with age, while"
		C. glabrata occurrence increased with age. We found an increased number of cases
		"of fungemia per 100,000 people per year, reaching a maximum of 4.4 during 2006."

TI	-	Assessment of preemptive treatment to prevent severe candidiasis in critically
		ill surgical patients.
PG	-	2443-9
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of a preemptive antifungal therapy in
		preventing proven candidiasis in critically ill surgical patients. DESIGN:
		"Before/after intervention study, with 2-yr prospective and 2-yr historical"
		control cohorts. SETTING: Surgical intensive care unit (SICU) in a
		"university-affiliated hospital. PATIENTS: Nine hundred and thirty-three patients,"
		"478 in the prospective group and 455 in the control group, with SICU stay > or =5"
		"days. INTERVENTIONS: During the prospective period, systematic mycological"
		"screening was performed on all patients admitted to the SICU, immediately at"
		admittance and then weekly until discharge. A corrected colonization index was
		used to assess intensity of Candida mucosal colonization. Patients with corrected
		colonization index > or =0.4 received early preemptive antifungal therapy
		"(fluconazole intravenously: loading dose 800 mg, then 400 mg/day for 2 wks)."
		MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: End points of this study were the frequency of
		"proven candidiasis, especially SICU-acquired candidiasis. During the"
		"retrospective period, 32 patients of 455 (7%) presented with proven candidiasis:"
		22 (4.8%) were imported and 10 (2.2%) were SICU-acquired cases. During the
		"prospective period, 96 patients with corrected colonization index > or =0.4 of"
		478 received preemptive antifungal treatment and only 18 cases (3.8%) of proven
		candidiasis were diagnosed; all were imported infections. Candida infections
		occurred more frequently in the control cohort (7% vs. 3.8%; p = .03). Incidence
		of SICU-acquired proven candidiasis significantly decreased from 2.2% to 0% (p <
		".001, Fisher test). Incidence of proven imported candidiasis remained unchanged"
		(4.8% vs. 3.8%; p = .42). No emergence of azole-resistant Candida species
		"(especially Candida glabrata, Candida krusei) was noted during the prospective"
		period. CONCLUSIONS: Targeted preemptive strategy may efficiently prevent
		acquisition of proven candidiasis in SICU patients. Further studies are being
		performed to assess cost-effectiveness of this strategy and its impact on
		selection of azole-resistant Candida strains on a long-term basis.

PG	-	259-63

AB	-	Candida krusei has been documented as an emerging pathogen causing nosocomial
		outbreaks. The consecutive isolation of C. krusei strains in three patients
		admitted to the same hospital department within 2 months lead us to consider the
		"possibility of an outbreak. Additionally, C. krusei isolates were collected from"
		"the room surfaces, whereas another isolate had been recovered from the blood of"
		one patient 2 years before. HinfI DNA restriction endonuclease-based analysis of
		all C. krusei isolates was performed and restriction profiles were compared.
		"Surprisingly, isolates from different patients were unrelated, whereas isolates"
		from biological products of the same patient showed indistinguishable HinfI
		restriction patterns and were similar to those obtained from the surrounding
		environment of the respective patients. The study approach revealed the
		endogenous origin of the C. krusei infectious episodes observed and demonstrated
		"that, subsequent to colonizing a patient, C. krusei can be involved in infectious"
		"episodes distant in time. The hypothesis of an outbreak was excluded, although we"
		believe that the methodology employed in the present study represents a valuable
		tool for diagnostic and epidemiological surveys.

TI	-	In vitro susceptibility of yeasts isolated from patients in intensive care units
		to fluconazole and amphotericin B during a 3-year period.
PG	-	278-83
AB	-	Fungal infections have increased dramatically in recent years and candidemia is a
		major risk factor for morbidity and mortality in intensive care units (ICUs).
		Candidemia has been considered to be a nosocomial infection that is strongly
		"associated with neutropenia, recent surgery or presence of intravascular lines,"
		and previous colonization is an independent risk factor. We evaluated the in
		vitro efficacy of fluconazole and amphotericin B against yeasts isolated from
		various clinical specimens of colonized or infected patients treated in the ICUs
		"of the Institute of Cardiology, Istanbul University. A total of 1397 ICU patients"
		were treated at the Institute of Cardiology between January 2000 and December
		2002. A total of 117 yeasts isolated from 97 patients were included in this
		study. These ICU patients were hospitalized for a mean of 29 days. All yeasts
		"were identified by conventional methods and using the API (20C AUX, ID 32C)"
		"system (Bio Meriéux, France). Susceptibility to fluconazole and amphotericin B"
		"was evaluated using the E-test (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden). The most commonly"
		"isolated yeast was Candida albicans (72.6%), followed by Candida tropicalis"
		"(16.2%), Candida kefyr, Candida krusei, Candida parapsilosis, Trichosporon"
		mucoides and Geotrichum spp. Fluconazole and amphotericin B MIC90 values were
		0.75 microg/ml; 0.19 microg/ml and 1 microg/ml; 0.38 microg/ml for C. albicans
		"and C. tropicalis, respectively. All Geotrichum spp. were found to be"
		susceptible-dose dependent (SDD) (MIC=16-32 microg/ml) to fluconazole. Two C.
		"albicans, two C. tropicalis, one C. krusei and one Geotrichum spp. had a MIC"
		value of > or = 0.38 microg/ml for amphotericin B. The rate of colonization was
		3.36% (47/1397). Only 10 (0.71%) patients out of a total of 1397 developed
		"candidemia during the period of the investigation. Of these, 7 (70%) were caused"
		by non-albicans Candida spp.

		species linked with oral candidosis in HIV-infected and AIDS patients.
PG	-	S96-101
AB	-	"The discovery and characterisation of a novel species of Candida, termed Candida"
		"dubliniensis, associated with oral candidosis in HIV-infected individuals is"
		described. These organisms share several phenotypic characteristics in common
		"with Candida albicans and Candida stellatoidea, including the ability to produce"
		"germ tubes and chlamydospores. However, in contrast to these latter two species,"
		"C. dubliniensis isolates produce abundant chlamydospores, which are often"
		"arranged in contiguous pairs, triplets and other multiples suspended from a"
		single suspensor cell. They belong to C. albicans serotype A and exhibit atypical
		substrate assimilation profiles. Genomic DNA fingerprinting analysis with the C.
		albicans-specific probe 27A and five different oligonucleotide probes consisting
		"of short repeat sequence-containing motifs, demonstrated that C. dubliniensis has"
		a distinct genomic organisation relative to C. albicans and C. stellatoidea. This
		was confirmed by karyotype analysis and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)
		analysis. Comparison of 500 bp of the V3 variable region of the large ribosomal
		subunit genes from 14 separate C. dubliniensis isolates and the corresponding
		"sequences from C. albicans, C. stellatoidea, C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, C."
		"parapsilosis, C. kefyr and C. krusei demonstrated that the C. dubliniensis"
		"isolates formed a homogenous cluster (100% similarity), representing a discrete"
		taxon within the genus Candida that was significantly different from the other
		species analysed.

LID	-	10.3290/j.qi.a44630 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To assess the relationship between the development of denture-related
		"stomatitis (DRS) and the identification of commonly isolated yeast species, and"
		to evaluate various predisposing factors in Saudi participants wearing new
		removable dental prostheses. METHOD AND MATERIALS: A total of 75 edentulous male
		"participants were recruited, and 64 patients finished the present case-series."
		All participants received new conventional complete dentures. Colonization of
		"Candida species was assessed, and species were identified by means of the VITEK 2"
		(bioMérieux) laboratory components. RESULTS: The most prevalent type of Candida
		"at baseline was C albicans, followed by non-C albicans species (C glabrata)."
		Counts of Candida species significantly increased from the day of insertion to
		"the first month (P < . 05), but there were no significant changes between the"
		"first and second month (P > . 05). On the day of insertion, C tropicalis, C"
		"dubliniensis, and C krusei were extracted from few subjects only, with no"
		significant changes over the first and second month (P > .05). Patients revealing
		habits of sleeping with their dentures were found to frequently suffer from DRS;
		"development of the latter was rapid, and mixed Candida biofilms (with high CFU/mL"
		"counts), along with inadequate oral and denture hygiene, turned out to be"
		contributing factors (P < .05). CONCLUSION: DRS can develop faster than
		"previously reported, even with new dentures; continued denture wearing and poor"
		cleaning of dentures revealed a considerable impact on DRS onset. In the present
		"cohort, C albicans was the most identified kind of yeast, and was followed by C"
		glabrata infection in cases with DRS.

PG	-	119-25
AB	-	AIM: To know the correlation between CD4 count and intensity of Candida
		"colonizations in the oropharynx of HIV-infected/AIDS patients, to get the"
		"prevalence of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC), and to know what kind of Candida"
		species that causes oropharynx candidiasis of HIV-infected/AIDS patients.
		METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in HIV-infected/AIDS patients who
		came as outpatients and inpatients in Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital. The patients
		"were interviewed, physically examined, their CD4 counts were checked, and their"
		mouth rinse samples were taken to be cultured. Candida species was identified in
		"CHROMagar media, and data were processed. RESULTS: From September 2004 until"
		"January 2005, 60 HIV-infected/AIDS patients were included in this study. There"
		were 86.7% males and 13.3% females. Majority of the patients were from 20-30
		years age group (85%). The most frequent transmission was among drug users (75%)
		"followed by sexual contact (18.3%). The median of CD4 counts was 100 cells/il,"
		ranged from 2 to 842 cells/il. Proportion of the OPC was 63.3% (CI 95% = 51.1 -
		"75.5). From 59 Candida isolates in this study, 74.58% were C. albicans. Candida"
		"non C. albicans species that were found in this trial were C. krusei, C."
		parapsilosis and C. tropicalis. There was significant correlation between low CD4
		counts and high intensity of Candida colonization on the oropharynx of the
		subjects (r = -0.756). CONCLUSION: There was strong negative correlation (r =
		-0.756) between CD4 count and intensity of Candida colonization in the oropharynx
		of HIV-infected/AIDS patients. Proportion of OPC in this study was 63.3%. The
		most frequent species found in the oropharynx of the subjects was C. albicans.

TI	-	Caspofungin-induced severe toxic epidermal necrolysis.
PG	-	1116-8
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To report a case of suspected caspofungin-induced toxic epidermal
		necrolysis (TEN). CASE SUMMARY: An 86-year-old man had a right femur
		intertrochanteric fracture and right proximal humerus fracture due to an
		accidental fall. Disseminated Candida krusei infection complicated the
		postoperative course. Candidemia persisted despite 25 days of treatment with
		parenteral fluconazole. The antifungal agent was changed to intravenous
		caspofungin. Immediately after administration of a caspofungin 70-mg loading
		"dose, a transient skin rash developed, which resolved after discontinuation of"
		the drug and immediate treatment with intravenous diphenhydramine 30 mg and
		"methylprednisolone 40 mg. Six days later, a caspofungin 70-mg loading dose was"
		given again due to increasing sepsis. Erythematous and purpuric macules and
		"plaques developed the next day and rapidly progressed to extensive erythema,"
		"exfoliation, blisters, and skin erosions. A dermatologist was consulted and TEN"
		was diagnosed. The patient was treated with intravenous hydrocortisone 100 mg
		every 8 hours and diphenhydramine 30 mg every 8 hours. The skin lesions
		progressed unrelentingly and the patient died of refractory shock 6 days later.
		DISCUSSION: TEN is a rare but life-threatening systemic and cutaneous disease
		that is most often the result of an adverse drug reaction. It usually manifests
		as fever and influenza-like symptoms 1-3 days before the development of
		"mucocutaneous lesions, namely erythema and erosions of the buccal, ocular, and"
		genital mucosa and characteristic epidermal detachment. The precise pathogenesis
		"is not fully understood. Several models have been described, including"
		"immunopathology, genetic susceptibility, Fas-Fas ligand, perforin/granzyme, and"
		cytokine dysregulation. Use of the Naranjo probability scale indicated a probable
		relationship between caspofungin and the development of TEN in this patient.
		CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of caspofungin-induced TEN. Health-care
		professionals are advised to be aware of the early presentations of TEN in
		patients receiving caspofungin.

PG	-	1134-41
AB	-	We retrospectively analyzed 13 episodes of candidemia observed between July 1990
		and July 1995 in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected adults. Candidemia
		"was nosocomially acquired by 11 patients, among whom nine had a central venous"
		catheter (CVC). Twelve cases were of stage C2/C3 according to the 1993
		classification of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The median CD4+
		"cell count was 10/mm3 (range, 3-400/mm3). Causative species were Candida albicans"
		in nine episodes and Candida glabrata and Candida krusei in two episodes each.
		Eleven episodes occurred in 11 patients who had previously received fluconazole
		"(mean total dose, 7.4 g), including the four episodes caused by non-albicans"
		species. Outcome did not differ according to the administered antifungal therapy.
		CVCs were removed from seven patients (78%). The overall mortality was 38%.
		Candidemia is a potentially lethal nosocomial complication during late-stage AIDS
		and can be due to C. albicans and non-albicans strains.

		"amphotericin B (ten C. albicans, two T. beigelii and three Candida lusitaniae)."
		"The most frequent risk factors for breakthrough fungaemia were neutropenia,"
		previous therapy with multiple antibiotics and recent catheter insertion.
		Comparing these episodes with 38 non-breakthrough fungaemias (appearing at the
		same institute in the same period) differences in certain risk factors were
		noted: breakthrough fungaemias were more frequently observed in patients with
		"acute leukaemia (39.0% vs 5.2%, P < 0.001), mucositis (34.2% vs 13.1%, P < 0.05),"
		"prophylaxis with quinolones (58.5% vs 15.8%, P < 0.0001) and catheter-associated"
		"infections (29.3% vs 2.6%, P < 0.003). In this subgroup overall mortality (36.6%"
		vs 28.8%) or early attributable mortality (22.0% vs 23.6%) were not significantly
		different.

TI	-	Impact of high-dose granulocyte transfusions in patients with cancer with
		candidemia: retrospective case-control analysis of 491 episodes of Candida
		species bloodstream infections.
PG	-	2859-65
AB	-	BACKGROUND: The efficacy and feasibility of donor granulocyte transfusion therapy
		(GTX) have changed considerably over the past four decades. The authors sought to
		determine the impact of high-dose (approximately 5.5 x 10(10) cells) GTX in
		patients with candidemia. METHODS: The authors' case-control retrospective
		analysis comprised 491 consecutive patients treated at The University of Texas M.
		"D. Anderson Cancer Center (Houston,TX) from 1993 to 2000. The cohort included 29"
		patients with Candida species bloodstream infection who had received GTX and 462
		"who had not. RESULTS: Both groups were comparable in age, gender, APACHE II"
		"score, recent chemotherapy received, broad-spectrum antibiotics, systemic"
		"corticosteroids, radiotherapy, intravascular catheter, and concordant antifungal"
		therapy (P > or = 0.1). The patients who received GTX compared with those who did
		"not had a higher incidence of underlying leukemia (86% vs. 29%, P <0.001),"
		"persistent neutropenia (59% vs. 18%, P <0.001), non-Candida albicans candidemia"
		"(Candida glabrata, 35%; Candida krusei, 31%: 90% vs. 67%, P=0.01), and"
		"breakthrough invasive mycosis (62% vs. 23%, P <0.001). Neutropenia was more"
		"prolonged in patients who received GTX (28 vs. 10 days, P <0.001). Also, more of"
		the patients who received GTX had received hematopoietic stem cell
		"transplantations (28% vs. 13%, P = 0.03), exposure (within 4 weeks) to"
		"antifungals (79% vs. 38%, P <0.001), and stays in critical care units (62% vs."
		"40%, P=0.02). The overall attributable mortality rate for 25 evaluable recipients"
		"of GTX was 48% (n=12), compared with 45% (n=115) of 254 evaluable patients in the"
		"control group (P=0.5). Of the 158 patients with leukemia, 25 (16%) had received"
		"GTX. In patients with leukemia, more of those who had received GTX experienced"
		disseminated candidiasis (44% vs. 26%; P <0.07) and persistent neutropenia (68%
		"vs. 43%, P <0.02), had candidemia that was more prolonged (> 72 hours, P <0.02),"
		"and had more stays in critical care units (68% vs. 44%, P <0.03). On the bases of"
		"a reduced multivariate model, a significantly increased risk of death was found"
		for patients with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (odds ratio [OR]=2.51;
		"95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.99-6.31; P <0.05), for patients with"
		"persistent neutropenia (OR=4.57; 95% CI, 1.99-10.47; P <0.0003), and for patients"
		"with leukemia who also had prolonged candidemia (OR=3.59; 95% CI, 1.61-7.98; P"
		"<0.002), disseminated candidiasis (OR=5.19; 95% CI, 2.17-12.42; P <0.0002), or"
		"non-C. albicans candidemia (OR=5.02; 95% CI, 1.07-23.64; P <0.04). In patients"
		"with leukemia, death was attributable to candidemia in 50% of the GTX recipients,"
		compared with 59% of the non-GTX patients who had received antifungal therapy
		alone (P=0.4). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the presence of multiple predictors of
		"increased mortality, high-dose GTX therapy in these high-risk patients with"
		cancer was associated with better than expected survival rates.

TI	-	Prospective evaluation of Candida species colonization in hospitalized cancer
		patients: impact on short-term survival in recipients of marrow transplantation
		and patients with hematological malignancies.
PG	-	931-5
AB	-	Most hematogenous candidiasis originates from endogenous host flora. The impact
		of clinically prominent Candida colonization on short-term mortality (<or=14
		weeks) was prospectively studied in 193 hospitalized patients from 1998 to 1999.
		Clinically prominent colonization included yeasts isolated from all sterile body
		sites and >50 colonies of Candida from non-sterile sites. Fourteen (7.1%)
		patients were granulocytopenic (ANC <or=100/microl). Nineteen (9.8%) had
		"undergone marrow transplantation, 26 (13.5%) had a hematologic malignancy and 129"
		(66.5) had non-hematologic cancer. Candida isolates (216) were collected form 210
		"specimens. Fifty-three (27.5%) patients died; 25 (19.4%) with solid tumors,"
		"compared to 16 (61.5%) with hematological malignancy, and 11 (57.9%) BMT"
		"recipients (P < 0.001). No deaths were seen in patients with AIDS, and one (7.7%)"
		in a patient with a benign condition (P < 0.001). Twenty-six (29.2%) patients
		"with respiratory tract, 13 (23.2%) with gastrointestinal tract, and three (14.3%)"
		with genitourinary tract colonization died. In patients with multiple-site
		"colonization, mortality was significantly higher (45.5%) (P < 0.05). Mortality"
		was higher in patients with C. glabrata (52.9%) and C. krusei (75%) colonization
		than with C. albicans (24.1%) (P < 0.025). This study shows that patients with
		hematologic cancer and recipients of marrow transplant with Candida colonization
		"of multiple body sites, and colonization with C. glabata or C. krusei have poor"
		survival.

AB	-	We describe a case of congenital acquired candidiasis in a preterm female
		delivered through Caesarean section due to the premature rupture of the amniotic
		membrane. The neonate presented with suspected chorioamnionitis and erythematous
		"desquamative skin. Candida albicans was isolated from the placenta, mouth, groin,"
		and periumbilical lesions. The infant developed candidemia due to Candida
		albicans and the same yeast was also isolated from a catheter. Culture inoculated
		with swabs from the mouth and vagina of the mother yielded C. albicans and C.
		krusei. All C. albicans isolates from the mother and the neonate were visually
		indistinguishable by molecular typing techniques which included chromosomal
		karyotyping and restriction endonuclease analysis followed by pulsed-field gel
		electrophoresis. These findings allowed the clinical condition to be confirmed as
		congenital acquisition of candidiasis in this case.

PG	-	679-82
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To determine the various oral Candidal species among healthy Malaysian
		adults. DESIGN: Case-control study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: This study was
		"collaborated between the Department of Medical Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine"
		"and Department of Oral Pathology, Oral Medicine and Periodontology, Faculty of"
		"Dentistry, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, between September 2002"
		till January 2004. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred adults (50 smokers and 50
		"non-smokers), aged between 40 and 70 years were studied. Swabs and carbohydrate"
		"assimilation (Saboraud Dextrose Agar, Corn Meal Agar, API 20C AUX System) were"
		"performed. Specimens were collected from dorsum of the tongue, buccal mucosa and"
		commissures (right and left each). Colony forms were established by positive
		"colony forming units, on SDA medium (24-48 hours). Germ tube test for"
		(true/pseudohyphae) growth was done on Corn Meal Agar Medium. Candida biotypes
		"were evaluated by API 20C AUX system, which had a numerical 7 digit profile,"
		added to evaluate a definite Candida species. RESULTS: Thirty-five percent of
		Malaysian adults harbored Candida intraorally. Candidal species identified among
		"100 subjects had C. albicans (27) 77%, C. glabrata (3) 8%, C. famata, C."
		"tropicalis, C. krusei, C. lusitaniae and C. guilliermondii (1) 3% each."
		Thirty-three positive cases comprised of 35 species i.e. two cases had two
		species each. Fifty seven percent of these were smokers and 43% non-smokers.
		"These included 40% Chinese, 36% Malays and 24% Indians. Species were, however,"
		"not specified according to intra-oral sites i.e. buccal, commissural mucosa and"
		dorsum of tongue. CONCLUSION: On this series C. albicans is the most common
		species found in the oral cavity of Malaysian adults. It is equally frequent in
		"smokers and non-smokers, but showed a predilection for the ethnic Chinese group."

		"lesions and a carcinoid lesion were observed in the transverse colon, and it was"
		thought that the C. krusei had invaded from the ulcerative lesions. Azole
		"antifungal agents, especially fluconazole, have frequently been used for therapy"
		and the prophylaxis of fungal infections. Though infections due to
		"fluconazole-resistant Candida species such as C. krusei are a growing problem, in"
		the hematology division of our hospital there is no evidence of an increasing
		incidence of C. krusei fungemia or an increasing rate of C. krusei in
		"surveillance culture from admitted patients. However, future increases in"
		infections due to fluconazole-resistant Candida species like C. krusei and C.
		"glabrata are entirely possible, making it necessary to identify isolated fungi,"
		"perform susceptibility tests on antifungal agents against isolates, measure the"
		"serum concentrations of antifungal agents, and then to treat patients with the"
		appropriate therapies.

TI	-	Prevention and monitoring of invasive fungal infections in pediatric patients
		with cancer and hematologic disorders.
PG	-	28-34
AB	-	BACKGROUND: The occurrence of invasive fungal infection (IFIs) in a pediatric
		"hematology/oncology unit after renovation of the ventilation system, and"
		"initiating routine azole antifungal prophylaxis was monitored. In addition, the"
		value of serial screening for Aspergillus galactomannan (GM) for diagnosing
		invasive aspergillosis was assessed. PROCEDURE: A total of 98 consecutive
		high-risk pediatric patients were prospectively surveyed for signs of IFI and
		weekly monitored for serum GM. The data was not made available to treating
		physicians. RESULTS: Only 2 patients had proven and 27 possible IFI based on the
		European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group
		definitions. The incidence of proven IFI was 1/31 (3.2%) in the allogeneic stem
		"cell transplant (SCT) (Aspergillus spp), 0/26 in the autologous SCT, and 1/60"
		(1.6%) in the induction therapy group (C. krusei). GM was detected at least in
		"one tested sample in 12/98 patients (12.2%), in five patients in two or more"
		"sequential samples. In the latter group, IFI was proven in one patient and could"
		not be excluded in the others. Four of the five patients belonged to the 31
		allogeneic and one to the 26 autologous SCT patients. In patients with only one
		positive GM test none developed signs of IFI and only one received empirical
		amphotericin B. CONCLUSIONS: With the currently used preventative and
		"prophylactic measures, IFI is uncommon in children with high-risk for infection."
		Regular screening for GM could be useful among allogeneic SCT patients and two
		positive samples should prompt further investigative procedures and pre-emptive
		antifungal therapy.

TI	-	Characterization of Candida species isolated from cases of lower respiratory
		tract infection.
PG	-	290-4
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: (1) To identify and characterize the Candida species isolates from
		lower respiratory tract infection. (2) to determine the rate of isolation of
		Candida species from sputum samples. METHODS: This study was carried out in the
		"Department of Microbiology, Manipal Teaching Hospital, Pokhara, Nepal from June"
		2002 to January 2003. A total of 462 sputum samples were collected from patients
		suspected lower respiratory tract infection. The samples were processed as Gram
		"staining to find out the suitability of the specimen, cultured on Sabouraud's"
		Dextrose Agar (SDA) and also on blood agar and chocolate agar to identify the
		"potential lower respiratory tract pathogens. For the identification of Candida,"
		"sputum samples were processed for Gram stain, culture, germ tube test, production"
		"of chlamydospore, sugar fermentation and assimilation test. For the"
		"identification of bacteria, Gram stain, culture, and biochemical tests were"
		"performed by standardized procedure. RESULT: Out of 462 samples, 246 (53.24%)"
		samples grew potential pathogens of lower respiratory tract. Among them
		Haemophilus influenzae 61(24.79%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae 57 (23.17%) were
		the predominant bacterial pathogens. Candida species were isolated from 30
		samples (12.2%). The majority of Candida species amongst the Candida isolates
		were Candida albicans 21(70%) followed by Candida tropicalis 4(13.33%). Candida
		"krusei 3(10%), Candida parapsilosis 1(3.33%) and Candida stellatoidea 1(3.33%)."
		The highest rate of isolation of Candida was between the age of 71 and 80.
		CONCLUSION: Candida isolation from sputum samples is important as found in the
		present study in which Candida species were the third most common pathogen
		isolated from patients with lower respiratory tract infection.

		with caspofungin: case report and review of literature.
PG	-	559-64
AB	-	Current data indicate that caspofungin has in vitro activity against virtually
		"all Candida species. However, we report herein a case of disseminated candidiasis"
		due to Candida krusei which emerged during caspofungin treatment. Lung and brain
		secondary sites were then successfully treated using a combination of
		"amphotericin B plus flucytosine, amphotericin B lipid complex, and voriconazole,"
		sequentially. Among the total of four well documented cases of refractory
		"invasive candidiasis during caspofungin therapy, the common risk factors appear"
		"to involve prior abdominal surgery, persistent foreign body, and anatomical sites"
		where drug concentrations may be sub-optimal for Candida species with increased
		MICs. Caspofungin failure should be suspected in patients with persistent or
		emergent signs and symptoms of deep-seated invasive candidiasis.

TI	-	Evaluating the effect of soft lining materials on the growth of yeast.
PG	-	404-9
AB	-	STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Soft lining materials continue to have a place in clinical
		"removable prosthodontics. However, there is an increased probability of yeast"
		colonization on soft lining materials. PURPOSE: This study (1) assessed a method
		of evaluating the effect of long-term soft lining materials on the growth of
		yeast and (2) investigated the effect five soft lining materials had on the
		"growth of three species of yeast. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Coe Supersoft, Novus, and"
		three experimental soft lining materials were investigated together with Candida
		"albicans, Candida tropicalis, and Issatchenkia orientalis (formerly Candida"
		krusei) yeasts. Strips of soft lining material incubated on blood agar plates
		were examined for inhibition of the growth of yeast. Soft lining materials soaked
		in sterile trypticase soya broth or water were inoculated with yeast and
		incubated. The change in colony forming units per milliliter from the initial
		load of yeast at 3 days was measured. Statistical analysis was performed with an
		independent paired Student t test. RESULTS: Inhibition of yeast growth occurred
		for two soft lining materials. Despite the presence of sufficient viable
		"organisms, differences between the initial load of yeast and the 3-day results"
		"were mostly small, both for the test and control groups, suggesting that the"
		material does not support the growth of the tested yeast during this period.
		CONCLUSIONS: The often described increased prevalence of yeast associated with
		soft lining materials in the oral environment is likely related to readily
		available nutrients in the mouth and the difficulty in maintaining and cleaning
		these materials.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: The aim of our study was to evaluate the concordance between the
		two antifungal susceptibility testing of Candida sp. isolates using agar
		diffusion method: Neo-Sensitabs(®) tablets and Bio-Rad(®) disks. MATERIALS AND
		METHODS: This is a prospective study conducted in the Laboratory of Parasitology
		and Mycology of the Mohammed V military teaching hospital from February to August
		"2012. Upon receiving blood cultures and peripheral sites samples, the"
		identification of Candida isolates performed using routine phenotypic standard
		tests and the realization of the antifungal susceptibility was carried out on
		Neo-sensitabs(®) tablets and Bio-Rad(®) disks. RESULTS: A total of 38 Candida
		"strains were isolated: 15 C. albicans (39%), 13 C. glabrata (34%), 5 C."
		"tropicalis (13%), 4 C. krusei (11%) and 1 C. dubliniensis (3%). There were no"
		significant difference (P>0.05) in susceptibility rate between both methods for
		all antifungal agents tested except for 5-fluorocytosine. The concordance
		"percentage between two methods was 100% for amphotericin B, 97.4% for"
		"fluconazole, 94.7% for voriconazole and 73% for 5-fluorocytosine. CONCLUSION:"
		"Both methods are easy to perform, rapid and cost effective. Our results showed"
		the best agreement between the two methods for testing the susceptibility of
		"Candida isolates to amphotericin B, fluconazole and voriconazole while for the"
		"5-fluorocytosine, the concordance rate was low."

TI	-	Oral itraconazole in treatment of candidemia in a pediatric intensive care unit.
PG	-	973-7
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To examine efficacy of itraconazole in the treatment of candidemia in
		critically ill children. METHODS: We studied retrospectively cases of candidemia
		seen consecutively in our Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) over three and
		"half years. Candida isolates from those patients included. Candida albicans--19,"
		"C. tropicalis--31, C. guillermondii--9, C.krusei--4 and C. glabrata--1. RESULTS:"
		"Of the 64 patients, 48 (75%) had symptoms suggestive of septicemia and 16 had no"
		symptoms suggestive of septicemia. No antifungal therapy was given to
		asymptomatic patients; they recovered from candidemia without development of any
		sequelae. Of the 48 symptomatic patients 11 died before results of fungal culture
		became available and antifungal therapy could be started. Thirty seven patients
		were treated with itraconazole (10 mg/kg/day orally or through gastric tube).
		"Seven (18.9 %) of 37 patients died, 3 within first week of antifungal therapy."
		Thirty (81%) patients recovered; microbiological cure was noted on average by day
		14 (range 4-30 days). The mean +/- SD duration of therapy in patients who
		responded was 24 +/-7 days (range 21-42 days). None had any major side effect.
		CONCLUSION: We conclude that oral itraconazole may be effective in treatment of
		candidemia in children in a PICU where non-C. albicans candida species
		constituted majority (70%) of all Candida isolates.

		in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia.
LID	-	13030/qt52j7w4g1 [pii]
AB	-	Candida krusei (C. krusei) is a multidrug-resistant opportunistic fungal pathogen
		"that may cause disseminated infections in immunocompromised hosts. However, its"
		clinical and histologic features are not well-characterized. We present a unique
		case to contribute to the growing knowledge base associated with this organism.
		"During hospitalization for neutropenic fever, a 19-year-old man with acute"
		"myeloid leukemia, who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation,"
		developed a generalized folliculocentric eruption following initiation of
		antifungal therapy for newly diagnosed C. krusei fungemia. Despite adequate
		"antifungal coverage and negative blood cultures, the follicular-based"
		erythematous papules persisted. Biopsies demonstrated yeast within ruptured
		"follicles, without angiotropism or involvement of the interfollicular dermis,"
		"subcutaneous tissue, or stratum corneum. Concurrent skin tissue cultures"
		confirmed C. krusei. The patient remained febrile despite aggressive antifungal
		"therapy, with relapse of leukemia and subsequent death. Our case is unusual given"
		"the development of cutaneous lesions following clearance of fungemia, with yeast"
		"limited to ruptured follicular lumina, possibly indicating a primary cutaneous"
		source or early transfollicular/transepidermal elimination. Given the limited
		"available descriptions of cutaneous histopathology for C. krusei, we seek to add"
		to the understanding of its pathophysiology and aid in the diagnosis and
		treatment of this often fatal infection.

		antifungal drugs.
PG	-	79-84
LID	-	10.3109/13693780902725276 [doi]
AB	-	We have previously reported a Candida krusei outbreak during which a number of
		our patients were infected or colonized by several different closely related
		Candida krusei genotypes. The treatment response in many of our patients was at
		best modest and the patients remained positive for Candida krusei. We speculated
		that extended exposure to antifungals in patients with an incomplete treatment
		response might lead to the conditions for selection of drug resistance in the
		"multiple Candida krusei clones. Therefore, we followed the in vitro"
		susceptibility of the Candida krusei isolates taken from our patients before and
		during the antifungal treatment. A total of 28 Candida krusei isolates from 11
		patients with prolonged exposure to antifungal medication were analyzed for their
		in vitro susceptibility to commonly used drugs. We found that MIC(50) values of
		"all Candida krusei isolates was 12 microg/ml for fluconazole, 0.19 microg/ml for"
		"voriconazole, 1.0 microg/ml for amphotericin B, and 1.0 microgt/ml for"
		"caspofungin with the corresponding MIC(90) values being 16 microg/ml, 0.5"
		"microg/ml, 2.0 microg/ml, and 1.0 micro/ml, respectively. Extended antifungal"
		exposure did not change these MIC values. We conclude that resistance development
		in Candida krusei during prolonged antifungal treatment may not be common and the
		treatment failure of our patients was not likely due to the development of drug
		resistance by the etiologic agent.

TI	-	Do clinical features allow for accurate prediction of fungal pathogenesis in
		bloodstream infections? Potential implications of the increasing prevalence of
		non-albicans candidemia.
PG	-	1077-83
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To describe the evolving epidemiology of fungal bloodstream infections
		in critically ill and noncritically ill patients and to identify predictors of
		infection with non-albicans yeast species. DESIGN: Retrospective case series.
		"SETTING: Two academic, tertiary care centers. PARTICIPANTS: All persons during a"
		4-yr period who developed fungemia. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN
		RESULTS: We initially compared subjects with Candida albicans vs. alternative
		"yeast. In a sensitivity analysis, we compared persons with potentially"
		fluconazole-resistant organisms (Candida glabrata and Candida krusei) to those
		with other fungi. We also repeated these analyses in the subgroup of persons in
		the intensive care unit when they developed fungemia. The study cohort included
		"245 patients (60% in the intensive care unit), and C. albicans accounted for 52%"
		"of infections, whereas C. glabrata represented 20% of cases. The distribution of"
		isolates was similar in both intensive care unit patients and those on the wards.
		"In the entire population, no variable, including both previous fluconazole"
		"exposure and severity of illness, correlated with the fungemia due to a"
		"non-albicans species. In our sensitivity analysis, no factor was independently"
		associated with a potentially fluconazole-resistant yeast. For the subgroup of
		"subjects whose fungemia was diagnosed while they were in the intensive care unit,"
		no variable differentiated C. albicans from non-albicans isolates. CONCLUSIONS:
		Non-albicans yeast are common both in the intensive care unit and on the wards.
		Simple clinical factors do not allow the clinician to effectively identify
		patients likely infected with non-albicans pathogens or with possible
		fluconazole-resistant fungi.

		blood: results of a 2-year multicentre study in Spain.
PG	-	23-30
AB	-	"This study, included in the prospective survey of candidaemia in Europe supported"
		"by the European Confederation of Medical Mycology, presents the epidemiological"
		and antifungal susceptibility results of 290 cases of candidaemia (80 in children
		<15 years old) reported from September 1997 to August 1999 by 19 Spanish
		hospitals. Presence of an intravenous catheter and previous antibiotic therapy
		were the most frequent risk factors. The percentages of the four most common
		"species isolated (adults/children) were as follows: Candida albicans (46/36.2),"
		"C. parapsilosis (21.9/50), C. tropicalis (12.8/3.75), and C. glabrata (10.1/5)."
		"As initial therapy, fluconazole was preferred in adults (54%) and liposomal"
		"amphotericin B in children (58%). The 30-day mortality rate was 40.6%, and the"
		species most frequently associated with a fatal outcome was C. krusei (60%). The
		"rates of susceptibility to antifungal agents were as follows: amphotericin B,"
		"91%; flucytosine, 99%; fluconazole, 93.6%; itraconazole, 87.4%; and voriconazole,"
		92%. These results provide baseline data for future epidemiological and
		susceptibility studies and for evaluating the impact of new antifungal agents on
		the distribution of species and the mortality rates associated with candidaemia
		in Spain.

AB	-	"AIM: To determine the clinical characteristics of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC),"
		the Candida species involved and the antifungal susceptibility of Candida species
		isolated from patients with VVC. METHODS: Candida organisms were cultured from
		samples obtained from patients who presented with VVC to the Gynecology
		"Department, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital. Antifungal susceptibility"
		testing was performed using a commercial agar diffusion test. RESULTS: Of the
		"1,070 cases of VVC reported in this study, 36.5% were uncomplicated VVC, and"
		63.5% were complicated VVC. Twenty-four patients were identified as having two
		species of Candida. Candid albicans alone was isolated from 89.5% of cases (n =
		"958). Candida glabrata was isolated from 85 cases (7.9%), Candida tropicalis from"
		"10 (0.9%), Saccharomyces cerevisiae from eight (0.7%), Candida parapsilosis from"
		"six (0.6%), Candida famata from two (0.2%), and Candida krusei from one case"
		(0.1%). All isolates of Candida albicans were susceptible to nystatin. The
		resistant rate of Candida albicans to azole agents was 0-4.9%. CONCLUSION:
		Candida albicans was the predominant Candida species isolated from this series of
		patients with VVC. Resistance of vaginal Candida albicans isolates to antifungal
		agents was infrequent.

TI	-	Candidaemia in allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients: low risk without
		fluconazole prophylaxis.
PG	-	891-5
AB	-	Invasive fungal infections (IFI) are common in allogeneic SCT recipients. We have
		reviewed our experience of IFI with special reference to candidaemia in 685 adult
		patients transplanted in 1983-2002. The donor was a matched sibling in 505
		patients and an unrelated donor in 180 patients. A BM graft was used in 561
		patients and a PB graft in 124 patients. Fluconazole prophylaxis was not used
		during the study period. Definite or probable IFI was observed in 60 patients
		"(8.7%) with a dominance of Aspergillus infections (46 patients, incidence 6.7%)."
		Candidaemia was found only in nine patients (1.3%). The causative agents were
		"Candida albicans (n=8), C. krusei (n=2), and C. glabrata (n=1); in two patients,"
		two causative agents were found. The median time to the diagnosis of candidaemia
		was 53 days (range 6-249 days) post transplant. Seven patients were neutropaenic
		"at diagnosis, and four patients had experienced acute GVHD. All patients received"
		"antifungal therapy, but only one patient was cured. According to this study,"
		"candidaemia was a rare event in allogeneic SCT recipients. Thus, systematic"
		prophylaxis against Candida infections might not be indicated. The prognosis of
		"established infections is still poor due to comorbid conditions, notably GVHD."

TI	-	Endophthalmitis in patients with disseminated fungal disease.
PG	-	67-70; discussion 70-1
AB	-	BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Fungal endophthalmitis caused by dissemination from
		extraocular fungal infections has been reported to vary between 9% and 45%.
		"However, recent clinical experience disagrees with that. This study is an"
		"investigation of patients in an inner city teaching hospital, the risks"
		"associated with endogenous fungal endophthalmitis, and this incidence. METHODS:"
		All ophthalmology consultations between February 1995 and August 2000 that might
		be associated with disseminated fungal infection were examined in a prospective
		manner. Patients were excluded if there was no evidence of a positive fungal
		culture from any site at any time. Visual symptoms were recorded along with
		"ophthalmologic and systemic examination features. Information was gathered,"
		"including the identity of cultured organisms, the sites from which the organisms"
		"were obtained, and the patients' disposition. RESULTS: During this interval, 170"
		"consultation requests contained the words ""endophthalmitis"" or ""retinitis"" and/or"
		indicated concern about disseminated fungal infections. Extraocular fungal
		"infections were found in 114 patients, but only 82 of them had evidence of"
		systemic dissemination. Some patients had more than one organism. The following
		"are listed in decreasing frequency of occurrence: Candida albicans, Torulopsis"
		"glabrata, Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis, Candida krusei, Aspergillus"
		"niger, and others. Only two patients had evidence of chorioretinitis and"
		progressed to fungal endophthalmitis. CONCLUSIONS: Endophthalmitis was rare among
		these patients with known fungal infections. Less than 2% had any related
		"ophthalmic manifestations. Nevertheless, since treatment can save vision,"
		evidence of intraocular infection should be sought as eagerly as before.

TI	-	The epidemiology of non-albicans Candida in oropharyngeal candidiasis in HIV
		patients.
PG	-	178-81
AB	-	Oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) is the most common fungal infection in patients
		with HIV infection. Fluconazole has been proven to be very effective in treating
		"this infection, but decreased susceptibility of Candida to this drug has emerged."
		Certain non-albicans species such as C. glabrata and C. krusei are commonly less
		susceptible to fluconazole than C. albicans and are being isolated with increased
		frequency in HIV patients. The purpose of this study was to determine if the
		presence of non-albicans Candida with OPC in HIV patients had an impact on
		clinical presentation. This study shows that late-stage HIV patients have a high
		"prevalence of Candida with decreased susceptibility to fluconazole, especially"
		non-albicans species. OPC episodes with non-albicans isolates were more likely to
		"require higher doses of fluconazole to achieve clinical cure. Also, the presence"
		of non-albicans Candida was more frequently associated with severe symptoms.

		a tertiary oncology care center in Brazil was undertaken. A total of 229 episodes
		were analyzed. The overall mortality was higher among adults than in children
		"(37.4% vs. 7.7%, respectively). Univariate analysis revealed significant"
		differences in the risk factors associated with death between both groups.
		Mortality was similar following fungemia with Candida albicans and all C.
		"non-albicans species. However, significant differences in the interspecies"
		"distribution and death rates were observed, mainly among C. glabrata, krusei, and"
		tropicalis species. Multivariate analysis showed comorbidities and neutropenia to
		"be independently associated with mortality in adults, while in children, only"
		comorbidities negatively affected the outcome. Comorbidities were the most
		important independent prognostic factor in both groups. The inclusion of detailed
		information about pre-existent illnesses might have a real benefit in studies of
		candidemia outcome.

AB	-	Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is diagnosed almost exclusively in immunocompromised
		"patients. It is located mainly in the lungs or paranasal sinuses, but"
		occasionally other organs and the gastrointestinal tract may also be affected
		either alone or as a part of a disseminated disease. The main risk factors
		"predisposing to IA are neutropenia, immunosuppressive and steroid therapy, as"
		well as severe underlying disease. Despite progress in diagnostics and therapy of
		"IA, it is still characterized by a high mortality rate. In the disseminated"
		"aspergillosis of the gastrointestinal tract, mainly the small or large intestine"
		"are affected, rarely the upper gastrointestinal tract. To our best knowledge only"
		a very few cases of IA of the gastric wall have been reported so far in the
		literature. We describe a unique case of this very rare location of IA in the
		stomach in a patient who underwent orthotopic liver transplantation in the course
		of active IA and Candida krusei infection of the stomach wall. The patient's
		condition improved on combination therapy of voriconazole and caspofungin.

		patients and healthy individuals.
PG	-	169-74
AB	-	The in vitro antifungal susceptibility profile of 589 oral yeast isolates from
		HIV/AIDS patients and healthy South Africans was determined against amphotericin
		"B, nystatin, 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC), clotrimazole, miconazole, ketoconazole,"
		itraconazole and fluconazole. The broth microdilution method of the National
		Committee on Clinical Laboratory Standards was used and MIC(50) and MIC(90)
		determined. A 100% susceptibility to fluconazole was observed among the 466
		"isolates of Candida albicans. Among C. krusei, the second most common isolate,"
		only 2.6% of isolates were susceptible to fluconazole and itraconazole. Despite
		"the lack of previous exposure to antifungal agents, very little difference was"
		observed in the antifungal profile between the South African isolates and
		"isolates from the United States (U.S.), Canada and South America. South Africa"
		has a particularly high incidence of HIV-infection and oral candidiasis is the
		most common oral complication in these patients. This study provides important
		baseline data as the isolates were collected prior to fluconazole being made
		freely available to HIV/AIDS patients attending government health clinics.

AB	-	Mould-active antifungal prophylaxis is increasingly used in patients at risk for
		"invasive fungal disease. Between June 2011 and June 2012, one hundred patients"
		with various haematological malignancies at risk for invasive fungal disease
		received primary antifungal prophylaxis with intravenous micafungin at a daily
		dosage of 50 mg during neutropenia. The median number of days on micafungin
		"prophylaxis was 14 (range, 6-48 d). The incidence of proven and probable"
		"breakthrough invasive fungal diseases (bIFDs) was 6% and 3%, respectively. There"
		were two bloodstream infections caused by yeasts or yeast-like fungi (Candida
		"krusei, Trichosporon asahii) in two patients during the neutropenic phase after"
		allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Four proven bIFDs caused by
		non-Aspergillus moulds and three cases of probable pulmonary bIFDs were
		documented during the neutropenic phase after induction/consolidation
		chemotherapy for acute leukaemia. Colonisation with Candida spp. was documented
		in 51% of the patients with none of the isolates being in vitro micafungin
		"resistant. Compared to a historical control, receiving primary prophylaxis with"
		posaconazole micafungin is at least as effective in preventing IFD. In both
		"cohorts, bIFDs were exclusively caused by emerging pathogens with a highly"
		preserved in vitro sensitivity to amphotericin B.

		"blood cultures from 145 patients, 32% of whom were children (25% of these were"
		"neonates). The most common species isolated was Candida albicans, followed by"
		"Candida parapsilosis, Candida krusei and Candida tropicalis. Risk factors for"
		"candidemia included underlying disease, therapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics"
		and the presence of a central venous catheter. The majority of children were
		"treated with amphotericin B, whereas 52% of adults received fluconazole. Overall"
		"mortality was 44% (30% in children and 50% in adults), and attributable mortality"
		was 30% (24% in children and 33% in adults). Multivariate analysis indicated that
		"neutropenia, corticosteroid therapy, lack of antifungal treatment, and failure to"
		replace the central venous catheter were factors associated with
		"candidemia-related death. Among the adult population, an APACHE II score greater"
		than 15 predicted candidemia-related death.

PG	-	999-1002
AB	-	We conducted a prospective study to address the prevalence and microbiological
		characteristics of yeast isolates colonizing the oral cavities of HIV-infected
		patients undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy. Sixty-eight patients
		(67%) from a total of 102 were found to be colonized with yeasts. Sixty-five
		"patients carried a single species (60 Candida albicans, three Candida glabrata"
		and two Candida krusei) and three patients had mixed colonization of C. albicans
		and C. krusei. The status of yeast carrier was not associated with the number of
		"CD4 cells or the viral load. Similarly, the type of antiretroviral regimen was"
		not associated with the carriage of Candida spp. The only predictor of Candida
		colonization was a previous history of oropharyngeal candidiasis (P = 0.009).
		Although many patients in this series had already been treated with repeated
		courses of fluconazole therapy for previous episodes of oropharyngeal
		"candidiasis, fluconazole susceptibility patterns showed that 93% of yeasts were"
		susceptible to this triazole in vitro (MIC < or = 8.0 mg/L).

TI	-	Cross-sectional study of the susceptibility of Candida isolates to antifungal

PG	-	945-50
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To investigate (1) the frequency of clinical resistance to oral
		"polyenes or azole treatment for oral candidiasis, (2) the frequency of resistant"
		"in vitro Candida strains, (3) the relationship between the susceptibilities of in"
		vitro Candida species and in vivo status in HIV patients. DESIGN: Prospective
		"cross-sectional study. SETTING: Tertiary care clinic at Bocage Hospital, Dijon,"
		France. PATIENTS: HIV-infected patients with and without oral candidiasis.
		"INTERVENTIONS: Clinical examination, oral swab for mycologic investigations. MAIN"
		"OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical diagnosis of oral candidiasis, identification of the"
		"antifungal treatment given within the previous month, identification of Candida"
		"species, antimycogramm and determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration"
		"(MIC) for fluconazole, and measurement of T-helper cell count. RESULTS: Within a"
		"2-month period, 154 HIV-infected patients were studied: 46 heterosexuals, 51"
		"intravenous drug users (IVDU), 52 homosexuals and five blood transfusion"
		"recipients. The percentages of patients with oral candidiasis were: 41, 80, 44"
		"and 20%, respectively (P < 0.05); the mean T-helper cell counts were 200, 135,"
		"210 and 238 x 10(6)/l cells, respectively (P < 0.05). Twenty-two patients (14.3%)"
		had received recent azole treatment and 29 (18.8%) recent oral polyene treatment.
		"Among the 84 patients with and the 70 patients without oral candidiasis, 78 and"
		"28 Candida strains were isolated, respectively. Although Candida albicans"
		"represented the majority of Candida species (88 strains, 83%), the non-albicans"
		strains were isolated more frequently in patients who had received recent
		"antifungal treatment. No strains were resistant to ketoconazole, miconazole or"
		"econazole; however, six (5.6%), 16 (15%) and 10 (9.5%) were intermediately"
		"susceptible to the three drugs, respectively. Twelve (13.6%) of the 88 C."
		"albicans, five of the six C. (Torulopsis) glabrata, one of the five C. tropicalis"
		and all three C. krusei strains were resistant to fluconazole. These resistant
		strains were separated as follows: 41.1% of C. albicans strains resistant to
		"fluconazole were isolated from patients who had received recent azole therapy,"
		"17.6% from patients who received recent oral polyene, and 3.7% from patients who"
		had not received any recent antifungal treatment (P = 0.004). The mean MIC of
		"these three categories of isolates were 3.6, 1.6 and 0.6 mg/l, respectively (P ="
		0.06). CONCLUSIONS: Oral candidiasis and fluconazole-resistant Candida isolates
		are more frequently found in IVDU. Treatments using azoles select non-albicans
		strains and are associated with decreased susceptibilities of C. albicans strains
		to fluconazole in particular. These findings show that prolonged azole treatment
		in severely immunocompromised patients should be avoided.

		"Therefore, a retrospective descriptive study was carried in the ICU of Nimes"
		"University Hospital, France, from 2007 to 2016. As the majority of invasive"
		"fungal infections in ICU are caused by Candida species, the study objectives were"
		"to describe Candida species distribution, to assess candidaemia incidence and to"
		monitor the antifungal drug susceptibility of Candida isolates and the
		consumption of antifungal agents. Among the recorded invasive Candida infections
		"(n=244), 43% were intra-abdominal and 22% bloodstream infections. Candida"
		"albicans was the most frequent species (55.8%), followed by Candida glabrata"
		"(14.1%), Candida tropicalis (10%), Candida parapsilosis (8%) and Candida krusei"
		(5.3%). Candidaemia incidence was 4.49 per 1000 admissions. The mean consumption
		of antifungal agents was of 170.5 defined daily doses (DDD) for 1000 hospital
		"days (HD) per year. Changes in antifungal drug consumption were observed, with an"
		increased use of echinocandins (from 17.96 DDD/1000 HD in 2007 to 48.76 DDD/1000
		"HD in 2016), and the total treatment cost tripled during the study period. No"
		significant change in fungal ecology or in the emergence of resistant species was
		"observed; indeed, only 1.1% of isolates presented an unusual resistance to"
		antifungal agents.

AB	-	A 71year old female Caucasian farmer without any known immunosuppression
		presented with a painful ulcer of her right lower leg after a trauma caused by a
		wood billet. There was no response to empirical antibacterial treatment. An ulcer
		biopsy showed an invasive Candida infection of the soft tissue and
		leucocytoclastic vasculitis. Voriconazole treatment was followed by wound
		healing. Invasive Candida infection and localized Candida vasculitis represent a
		rare cause of persisting leg ulcers. The similar clinical picture of chronic
		venous leg ulcers might blur the true cause and refractory cases should therefore
		promptly be processed by histopathological diagnostics.

AB	-	Candida krusei is an uncommon cause of vaginitis and cystitis but is unique
		because of the management challenge it poses due to intrinsic resistance to
		fluconazole and flucytosine. We report a case of C. krusei vaginitis and cystitis
		successfully managed with topical vaginal and intravesical amphotericin B. The
		challenges in managing C. krusei cystitis and the role of amphotericin B bladder
		irrigation in the management of fungal urinary tract infections are discussed.

		caspofungin/posaconazole therapy.
PG	-	79-83
AB	-	Candidal vertebral osteomyelitis represents an extremely rare invasive mycosis
		and can be difficult to treat due to poor drug penetration into bony tissue. We
		report on a case of vertebral osteomyelitis caused by Candida krusei in a patient
		who had neutropenia as a result of chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukaemia.
		The patient received prophylactic liposomal amphotericin B during chemotherapy
		but became febrile and experienced severe lumbar pain. Magnetic resonance imaging
		revealed vertebral osteochondrosis. C. krusei was recovered from blood cultures
		and voriconazole monotherapy was initiated but proved unsuccessful. The patient
		"was then started on caspofungin monotherapy, which was discontinued after Candida"
		"krusei was no longer recoverable from blood cultures. However, as lumbar pain"
		"increased and spinal biopsy confirmed the presence of Candida krusei, caspofungin"
		therapy was resumed. Oral posaconazole was added to the regimen when the patient
		did not improve after 30 days of caspofungin therapy. Combined antimycotic
		therapy resulted in a successful outcome.

TI	-	Changes in the spectrum of fungal isolates: results from clinical specimens
		gathered in 1987/88 compared with those in 1991/92 in the University Hospital
		"Göttingen, Germany."
PG	-	247-53
AB	-	"In the University Hospital in Göttingen, the spectra of fungal species in"
		"clinical specimens of respiratory secretions, bronchial secretions and urine were"
		compared over periods of 15 months (10/87 to 12/88 and 1/91 to 3/92) before and
		after the introduction of fluconazole. The following changes could be
		demonstrated: 1. In all specimens analysed the number of Candida albicans
		"isolates decreased, while the number of Candida tropicalis isolates remained"
		almost unchanged. 2. During the observation period the number of Candida glabrata
		isolates doubled. In 1991 C. glabrata was second to C. albicans as the most
		"common of all fungal isolates, appearing in 8.6% of all specimens. 3. The total"
		"number of Candida krusei isolates increased only slightly, but the rise in the"
		number of isolates in bronchial secretions was statistically significant. 4. The
		"prevalence of rarely isolated Candida yeasts, such as Candida guilliermondii,"
		"Candida lipolytica and Candida kefyr, and Candida isolates which were not further"
		differentiated increased. 5. During the observation period the number of mixed
		cultures showed a fourfold increase. C. glabrata and C. krusei were associated in
		more than 75% of all isolates with C. albicans or C. tropicalis respectively. 6.
		The number of mould isolates increased. These changes in the spectra of fungal
		isolates are discussed with respect to the broad therapeutic and prophylactic
		usage of fluconazole in the University Hospital of Göttingen.

TI	-	Isolation of Exophiala dermatitidis from endotracheal aspirate of a cancer
		patient.
PG	-	504-9
AB	-	Exophiala (Wangiella) dermatitidis is a melanised (darkly pigmented) yeast-like
		organism that has been reported from the environment and wild animals. The
		organism is a frequent coloniser of lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis and
		causes occasional disseminated phaeohyphomycosis and fungaemia. Exophiala
		"dermatitidis is distributed worldwide, but cerebral cases are restricted to East"
		Asia. We report a case of 54-year-old Qatari female patient with a known history
		"of cancer, suffering from pulmonary disorder. Culture of endotracheal aspirate"
		revealed the growth of E. dermatitidis concomitant with Candida krusei. The final
		diagnosis of E. dermatitidis and attribution to genotype B was achieved by
		sequencing the rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. The present case
		"concerns a pulmonary colonisation by E. dermatitidis, similar to that commonly"
		seen in cystic fibrosis patients. For the detection of E. dermatitidis in
		clinical specimens culturing techniques are required. The patient finally expired
		with persistent cancer and C. krusei fungaemia. Review of literature and listing
		of E. dermatitidis cases published after 1992 show a sharp increase in clinical
		cases during the 1990s.

TI	-	"Triazole cross-resistance among Candida spp.: case report, occurrence among"
		"bloodstream isolates, and implications for antifungal therapy."
PG	-	529-35
AB	-	Candida spp. are common causes of bloodstream infections among hospitalized
		patients. Fluconazole (FLC) remains a first-line therapy for candidemia; and
		"voriconazole (VRC), an expanded-spectrum triazole, was recently approved for the"
		treatment of candidemia in nonneutropenic patients. In vitro studies have
		suggested that VRC has potent activity against Candida spp. with reduced
		susceptibilities to FLC. We present a case report of invasive candidiasis and
		candidemia due to a Candida glabrata isolate that developed resistance to all
		currently available triazole antifungals after a course of FLC treatment. This
		case prompted us to determine the frequency of cross-resistance among bloodstream
		"Candida isolates collected during a recent 12-month period at a large, academic"
		medical center. FLC MICs were determined for 125 of 153 isolates (81.7%). Thirty
		of 125 isolates (24%) were resistant or showed reduced susceptibilites to FLC
		(MICs >/= 16 microg/ml). When 28 of these 30 isolates were tested for their VRC
		"susceptibilities, 9 (32%) had MICs that were >/=2 microg/ml. Five of these nine"
		"isolates were C. glabrata, two isolates were Candida tropicalis, one isolate was"
		"Candida albicans, and one isolate was Candida parapsilosis. All five Candida"
		krusei isolates tested had VRC MICs </=0.5 microg/ml. These data have prompted
		the introduction of reflexive FLC susceptibility testing of first bloodstream
		Candida isolates at our institution. The case report and our data also suggest
		that VRC should be avoided as initial therapy in unstable patients with invasive
		"candidiasis, particularly in the setting of prior azole exposure. Studies are"
		needed to define the clinical significance of in vitro resistance to the newer
		antifungal agents.

TI	-	Breakthrough candidemia in patients with cancer differs from de novo candidemia
		in host factors and Candida species but not intensity.
PG	-	542-5
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the risk factors associated with breakthrough candidemia
		in patients with cancer and to compare them with those of de novo candidemia in
		this patient population. DESIGN: Retrospective case series of 120 episodes of
		"candidemia, 90 de novo and 30 breakthrough candidemias. SETTING:"
		"University-affiliated, tertiary-care cancer center in Houston, Texas. PATIENTS:"
		All patients with cancer who acquired candidemia between January 1993 and
		December 1998 were included if they had non-catheter-related candidemia and
		"information about quantitative blood cultures. RESULTS: Although less frequent,"
		breakthrough candidemia was seen more often in neutropenic patients with
		leukemia. The intensity of breakthrough candidemia was comparable to that of de
		novo candidemia. Most (70%) of the breakthrough candidemias were due to Candida
		"glabrata or C. krusei. CONCLUSIONS: In breakthrough candidemia, the same risk"
		"factors seen in de novo candidemia were encountered, although more frequently. C."
		glabrata and C. krusei are the leading causes of breakthrough candidemia in
		patients with cancer.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Normothermic and hypothermic oxygenated perfusion for donation after
		"circulatory death in kidney transplantation are becoming popular in Italy, with"
		the purpose of reducing the risk of primary non function and delayed graft
		function due to the prolonged warm ischemia time. Potential complications related
		to these procedures are currently under investigation and are continuously
		emerging with the increasing experience. Post-operative infections - in
		particular graft arteritis - are a rare complication but determine high risk of
		mortality and of graft loss. The acute onset of the arterial complications makes
		"it very difficult to find an effective treatment, and early diagnosis is crucial"
		for saving both patient and graft. Prevention of such infections in this
		particular setting are advisable. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a patient with an
		acute arterial rupture after transplantation of a DCD graft treated in-vivo
		hypothermic oxygenated perfusion. The cause was a severe arteritis of the renal
		artery caused by Candida krusei and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We discussed our
		treatment and we compared it to the other reported series. CONCLUSION: Fungal
		infections in DCD transplant may be treacherous and strategies to prevent them
		should be advocated.

TI	-	Candidemia and the susceptibility pattern of Candida isolates in blood.
PG	-	1060-3
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: Candida species has become one of the most common blood isolates as
		well as one of the leading causes of nosocomial bloodstream infections. The
		purpose of our study was to determine the prevalence of Candida species among our
		bloodstream infecting organisms and the susceptibility pattern of the Candida
		isolates to antifungal agents. METHODS: A prospective study was carried out in
		"the Division of Microbiology, King Khalid National Guard Hospital, Jeddah,"
		Kingdom of Saudi Arabia of all positive blood cultures for Candida species. The
		study took place from 1st January 1998 to March 2002. Identification and
		susceptibility pattern of isolates were determined by the Candifast technique to
		"amphotericin B, fluconazole, nystatin, Flucytosine, econazole, ketoconazole and"
		"miconazole. RESULTS: Over a 2-year period, 17,916 blood cultures were performed"
		"in our hospital. There were 2,972 positive cultures, of which 83 (2.8%) patients"
		"had Candida species isolated from their bloodstream. Of these, 38 (46%) were"
		Candida albicans (C.albicans). The remaining 45 strains were made up of Candida
		tropicalis 9 (10.8%); Candida parapsilosis 9 (10.8%); Candida species 9 (10.8%);
		Candida guilliermondi 6 (7.2%); Candida krusei 5 (6%); Candida glabrata 4 (4.8%);
		Candida pseudotropicalis 2 (2.4%) and Trichosporon species 1 (1.2%). All Candida
		"species were susceptible to amphotericin B. However, only 18 (47%) out of 38"
		"C.albicans were susceptible to fluconazole, while only 8 (17.7%) of 45"
		non-C.albicans strains were susceptible to this drug. CONCLUSION: The
		susceptibility of C.albicans to fluconazole in our hospital using the Candifast
		method is very low (47%). These results need to be confirmed by carrying out the
		Etest or the NCCLS M27-A method to confirm the true susceptibilities of Candida
		strains in our locality.

PG	-	E97-101
LID	-	10.1111/j.1399-3062.2012.00776.x [doi]
AB	-	Zygomycetes infection is associated with a high mortality in transplant
		populations. We describe a child with liver allograft Rhizopus oryzae infection
		who was salvaged by liver re-transplantation. A 10-year-old child presented with
		anastomotic bile leak that was repaired. A combined antibiotics and voriconazole
		regimen was introduced for Escherichia coli and Candida krusei growth in the
		"peritoneal fluid. Despite broad antibiotic and antifungal coverage, the patient"
		continued to have an ongoing infection. A follow-up computed tomography scan
		8 weeks later showed 2 liver abscesses infiltrating the stomach and the
		"diaphragm, with splenic infarcts and pericardial effusion. Aspirated samples from"
		the liver abscess and the pericardial fluid revealed R. oryzae. Immunosuppression
		"was discontinued and an antifungal regimen combining amphotericin B,"
		"posaconazole, and caspofungin was introduced. After 3 weeks of treatment with"
		"control of the systemic signs of infection, a positron emission tomography showed"
		the fluorescence stain limited to the liver. With infection confined to the
		"liver, the child underwent liver re-transplantation, splenectomy, and partial"
		gastrectomy. Immunosuppression was reintroduced with recovery of the immune
		response observed by the CD4 cells adenosine triphophate release (Cylex(™)
		ImmuKnow(®) assay) and posaconazole was continued for another year. At 3-year
		"follow-up, the child maintained normal graft function. We conclude that"
		discontinuation of immunosuppression combined with a modern antifungal regimen
		may allow salvage re-transplantation in patients with liver mucormycosis.

TI	-	Intravenous itraconazole for prophylaxis of systemic fungal infections in
		patients with acute myelogenous leukemia and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome
		undergoing induction chemotherapy.
PG	-	568-73
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Systemic fungal infections remain the leading cause of mortality in
		patients with newly diagnosed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and high-risk
		myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The objective of the current study was to
		determine whether intravenous itraconazole (i.v. ITRA) reduced the incidence of
		"probable/proven fungal infections in this group of patients, and compare the"
		results with those of a historic control group treated with fluconazole plus
		itraconazole capsules (F+I). METHODS: Patients with AML and high-risk MDS who
		underwent induction chemotherapy received 200 mg of i.v. itraconazole over 60
		minutes every 12 hours during the first 2 days followed by 200 mg given i.v. once
		"daily. RESULTS: One hundred patients were enrolled, 96 of whom were evaluable."
		Approximately 48% of the patients in the group of patients treated with i.v. ITRA
		as well as in the F+I group completed prophylaxis. Nine patients (9%) in the
		study group developed either proven/probable fungal infections (Candida glabrata
		"in 5 patients, C. tropicalis in 1 patient, C krusei in 1 patient, and Fusarium in"
		2 patients) compared with 3 patients (4%) with proven fungal infection in the
		historic control group (C. tropicalis in 1 patient and Aspergillus in 2
		patients). There were no significant differences noted between the two groups
		with regard to the percentage of patients who developed proven/probable or
		possible fungal infection as well as with regard to survival. These results also
		were obtained after adjusting for relevant prognostic factors (creatinine and
		bilirubin). The most common toxicity encountered with the use of i.v. ITRA was
		NCI Grade 3-4 hyperbilirubinemia (6%). CONCLUSIONS: Despite its theoretic
		"advantages, the authors found no evidence that i.v. ITRA is superior to"
		"itraconazole capsules, at least when the latter is combined with fluconazole."

		"arthritis during admission, after the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics before"
		chemotherapy. The initial synovial fluid sample appeared to be mildly
		inflammatory with a low white cell count. The fungal septic arthritis was not
		"diagnosed until Candida tropicalis, a rare species of Candida, was isolated in"
		the synovial fluid. Although fluconazole is effective in treating the
		"microorganism, the untreated leukemia rendered the infection incurable and led to"
		the growth of fluconazole-resistant Candida krusei. We reported the unusual case
		of fungal arthritis and reviewed the literature.

PG	-	963-5
AB	-	Candida krusei infections are increasing in neutropenic patients. This is the
		first report of a case of C. krusei arthritis in a neutropenic leukemic patient.
		The organism colonized the patient's respiratory tract and most likely seeded the
		right knee by hematogenous spread. Knee swelling and tenderness were minimal.
		Joint fluid Gram stain and fungal smears did not show the organism despite
		"positive results on cultures. With therapy, the joint fluid converted from"
		neutrophilic predominance to lymphocytic predominance. Despite sterilization of
		"knee fluid, clinical relapse occurred after therapy with 256 mg of systemic"
		amphotericin B; the infection was cured after a total dose of 456 mg.

TI	-	Triple antifungal therapy for severe systemic candidiasis allowed performance of
		allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
PG	-	337-40
AB	-	Systemic candidiasis is a rare but life threatening complication in
		immunosuppressed patients undergoing allogeneic SCT. Combination of new
		"antifungal agents may improve outcome in this patient population. Here, triple"
		anti-mycotic therapy is described in an relapsed ALL patient in urgent need of
		allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. The patient with T-cell acute
		lymphoblastic leukemia of thymic differentiation achieved remission after
		treatment according to the German ALL protocol 07/03. Two months after the
		consolidation therapy relapse occurred requiring high dose chemotherapy with
		allogeneic stem cell transplantation. One day after start of the conditioning
		regimen the patient showed skin manifestations typical for septic mycosis and
		blood cultures became positive for Candida krusei while on fluconazole
		prophylaxis. Because of the limited sensibility of fluconazole resistant candida
		species to liposomal amphotericin B and the high mortality rate in patients with
		"systemic candidiasis, voriconazole was added immediately to liposomal"
		amphotericin B. Since fever did not resolve and the conditioning therapy for
		allogeneic transplantation was not yet completed caspofungin was added. Skin
		manifestation responded to this triple anti-mycotic combination and peripheral
		blood stem cells from an unrelated donor were transplanted. With the triple
		"antifungal therapy the patient finally became afebrile, skin manifestations"
		showed complete resolution and blood cultures became negative. Three months after
		the onset of systemic candidiasis the patient was fully active with no signs of
		fungal infection and in haematological and molecular remission. Mycotic sepsis at
		the start of myeloablative conditioning therapy in heavily pretreated acute
		leukemia patients is usually considered as not allowing successful allogeneic
		"transplantation. Thus this case demonstrates, that allogeneic stem cell"
		transplantation is feasible in patients presenting with systemic candidiasis if
		"combined antifungal therapy with liposomal amphotericin B, caspofungin and"
		voriconazole is given.

		from blood.
PG	-	679-82
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To analyse the in vitro antifungal susceptibility of 261 non-albicans
		Candida bloodstream strains isolated during the European Confederation of Medical
		"Mycology survey of candidaemia performed in Lombardia, Italy (September"
		"1997-December 1999). METHODS: In vitro susceptibility to flucytosine,"
		"fluconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole and voriconazole was determined using the"
		broth microdilution method described in the NCCLS M27-A guidelines. Etest strips
		were used to assess susceptibility to amphotericin B. In vitro findings were
		correlated with the patient's underlying condition and previous antifungal
		"treatment. RESULTS: MICs (mg/L) at which 90% of the strains were inhibited were,"
		"respectively, 2 for flucytosine, 8 for fluconazole, 0.5 for itraconazole, 0.25"
		for voriconazole and 0.25 for posaconazole. Amphotericin B MIC endpoints were
		<0.50 mg/L in all the isolates tested. Flucytosine resistance was detected in 19
		"isolates (7%), mainly among Candida tropicalis strains (30%). Innate or secondary"
		fluconazole resistance was detected in 13 strains (5%). Among the 13 patients
		"with fluconazole-resistant Candida bloodstream infection, three were HIV"
		"positive, including one treated with fluconazole for oral candidosis; the four"
		who were HIV negative had received the azole during the 2 weeks preceding the
		candidaemia. Cross-resistance among fluconazole and other azoles was a rare
		event. CONCLUSIONS: Resistance is still uncommon in non-albicans Candida species
		"recovered from blood cultures. However, in fungaemias caused by C. tropicalis,"
		"Candida glabrata and Candida krusei, there is a high prevalence of resistance to"
		fluconazole and flucytosine. Fluconazole resistance should be suspected in
		"patients treated previously with azoles, mainly those with advanced HIV"
		infection.

		krusei infection which was excised surgically. This article reemphasizes the
		importance of stringent aseptic practices in neonatal intensive care units to
		prevent nosocomial infections and the early use of echocardiography in neonates
		presenting with atypical unexplained symptoms to hasten diagnosis and facilitate
		timely intervention.

		"(CML), who was treated for 4.5 years with imatinib and developed pneumonia caused"
		"by two Candida species, i.e., C. krusei and C. glabrata. The patient was in"
		complete hematologic remission and molecular analyses did not display the
		"presence of TLR2-R752Q, TLR4-D299G and TLR4-T399I polymorphisms that may"
		predispose individuals to fungal infections. This case report indicates that in
		"some patients, as previously observed, the long-term administration of targeted"
		therapy might affect immunity and predispose patients to opportunistic and
		life-threatening fungal infections.

		"osteomyelitis, due to Candida krusei and Candida albicans, respectively, with"
		"high doses of triazoles (fluconazole, itraconazole)."
PG	-	422-5
AB	-	"Two female patients, aged 75 and 59 years, respectively, with candidal sternal"
		osteomyelitis were successfully treated by the administration of triazoles. Both
		had developed post-operative wound infection after sternotomy for coronary artery
		by-pass grafting. Sternal osteomyelitis was confirmed by bone scans with
		"technetium 99Tc and gallium 67Ga. The cultures, from the pus draining at the site"
		"of the sternotomy scar, grew Candida krusei in the first case. The fistula closed"
		"after a 9-week course of itraconazole therapy (800 mg daily, followed by 600 mg"
		daily) and the patient completed a 6-month period of therapy. The second patient
		had underlying diabetes mellitus. Post-operatively she developed two fistulae
		draining pus on the sternum. The pus cultures grew C. albicans. Initial treatment
		with oral fluconazole (400 mg daily) failed. Subsequent treatment with liposomal
		amphotericin B also failed. A dramatic improvement was noted when the patient
		received high doses of fluconazole (800 mg daily). The fistulae gradually closed
		after 1 month. Oral fluconazole was continued for 6 months. The cure was
		"confirmed by bone scans. Three years later, both patients remained well."

TI	-	Urine D-arabinitol/L-arabinitol ratio in diagnosing Candida infection in patients
		with haematological malignancy and HIV infection.
PG	-	39-42
AB	-	Adult patients with hematologic malignancies along with HIV infected patients
		were prospectively studied to determine the performance of urine
		D-arabinitol/L-arabinitol (DA/LA) ratio in diagnosing invasive candidiasis. Ten
		evaluable febrile neutropenic patients had proven invasive candidiasis and
		elevated DA/LA ratios were found in 5. Invasive candidiasis with normal DA/LA
		ratios was most frequently due to Candida krusei infection. This Candida species
		is a non-producer of arabinitol. Only 4 of 81 febrile neutropenic patients given
		either antifungal prophylaxis or empiric antifungal treatment had elevated DA/LA
		ratios. Only 1 of 15 HIV positive patients with either oropharyngeal or
		esophageal candidiasis had elevated DA/LA ratios. Widespread use of fluconazole
		prophylaxis in bone marrow transplantation patients at the study hospital has led
		to an increased prevalence of C. krusei infection. This is the likely reason for
		the low sensitivity of the test in proven and suspected invasive Candida
		infections reported here.

		"gastropleural fistula, and esophageal perforation. Case report and review of the"
		literature. A fatal case of a 45-year-old pregnant woman with Candida krusei
		empyema thoracis secondary to spontaneous esophagus perforation associated with
		candida esophagitis is reported. The case is contextualized among similar cases
		found through a PubMed search. CONCLUSIONS: A suspect of esophagus rupture should
		arise in the presence of a fungal empyema. Candida esophagitis should be always
		considered as a possible cause or con-cause of esophagus rupture. An empirical
		systemic antimycotic therapy should always be considered in an ideal
		multidisciplinary approach to the management of patients with esophagus rupture.

TI	-	Concurrent isolation of Candida krusei and Candida tropicalis from multiple blood
		cultures in a patient with acute leukemia.
PG	-	521-3
AB	-	Reports of the concurrent isolation of more than one non-albicans species of
		Candida from blood cultures of immunocompromised patients with disseminated
		candidiasis are extremely infrequent. We report on the isolation of Candida
		krusei and Candida tropicalis from 17 blood cultures that were taken from a
		67-year-old white man with a diagnosis of acute biphenotypic leukemia during a
		2-week period of hospitalization for induction chemotherapy. Despite receiving
		"high-dose amphotericin B throughout this period, the status of the patient"
		"worsened, and he experienced pancytopenia, hypernatremia, azotemia, and"
		"disseminated intravascular coagulation, which led to his death. Candida krusei"
		"and C tropicalis were isolated concurrently from 10 of the 17 blood cultures,"
		while C krusei was the single isolate in three cultures and C tropicalis was
		isolated alone in four cultures. Each species manifested markedly different
		colonial morphological features. This case report serves to emphasize to
		microbiologists that they must exercise extreme suspicion when non-albicans
		species of Candida are isolated singly or concurrently from blood cultures in
		"neutropenic patients, given the increasing clinical significance of these yeasts."

TI	-	Candida krusei renal cyst infection and measurement of amphotericin B levels in
		cystic fluid in a patient receiving AmBisome.
PG	-	163-5
AB	-	Candida krusei is an opportunistic pathogen commonly implicated in urinary tract
		infections in immunocompromised patients. We present the first case of C. krusei
		"renal cyst infection, occurring in a post-liver and kidney transplant patient"
		with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Her persistent candiduria and
		fevers were refractory to prolonged therapy with AmBisome (Fujisawa
		"Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd., Osaka, Japan). She eventually required bilateral"
		nephrectomies of her native kidneys. Cystic fluid was aspirated from six
		hemorrhagic and six nonhemorrhagic cysts. Cystic fluid cultures yielded C.
		krusei. Fluid from the nonhemorrhagic cysts was also analyzed for amphotericin B

PG	-	1176-9
AB	-	"A 62-year-old man, previously healthy but alcoholic, and who was clinically"
		"thought to have bacterial pneumonia, presented with a pulmonary infiltrate in the"
		"right apex, and suddenly died of exsanguinating hemoptysis. Sputum cultures"
		yielded Aspergillus niger and Candida krusei while sputum cytology revealed
		numerous birefringent crystals in a background of acute inflammatory exudate.
		Autopsy findings showed invasive aspergillosis with a large mycetoma-containing
		cavity in the lung that was associated with localized massive oxalosis. This case
		further substantiates the fact that the presence of calcium oxalate crystals in
		pulmonary biopsy and cytology specimens can be regarded as an important
		diagnostic aid in the diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis due to A niger.

PG	-	527-9
AB	-	We present a case of young male treated for a recurrence of Acute Non Lymphoid
		Leukemia who presented a colonization by C. krusei during prophylaxis with
		"Fluconazole. The fever episode, which he developed while neutropenic, was"
		resolved with the addition of Amphotericin B after the failure of empiric
		antibiotic therapy. No isolation was performed in blood cultures. A second cycle
		of antiblastic chemotherapy was needed because of the resistance shown to the
		first. Despite the prophylaxis with Fluconazole a stream of C. krusei grew in all
		the blood cultures collected while febrile. Amphotericin B administered did not
		control the fungemia. We discuss the resistance of C. krusei to Fluconazole.

TI	-	Unusual case of bowel infarction with invasive Aspergillus in an
		immunocompromised patient.
PG	-	122-5
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: We report a patient with bowel infarction due to invasive
		Aspergillus infection as a result of prolonged chemotherapy-induced neutropenia.
		CLINICAL PICTURE: The patient was given neoadjuvant chemotherapy with
		"doxorubicin, docetaxel, and capecitabine for a breast tumour. She developed"
		"prolonged neutropenia, Escherichia coli and Candida krusei sepsis, acute arterial"
		"thrombosis of the left lower limb, and invasive aspergillus infection. TREATMENT:"
		"She underwent a subtotal colectomy, small intestine resection and an above-knee"
		amputation. OUTCOME: The hospitalisation was complicated with
		methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia and short gut syndrome. She
		subsequently underwent simple mastectomy with axillary clearance and received
		adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation without complication. CONCLUSION:
		"Chemotherapy should be protocol-directed. In a non-trial situation, protocol must"
		"have a sound basis, proven safety, and efficacy. Aspergillus infection is"
		uncommon in patients with solid tumours; prompt treatment must be started on high
		suspicion.

LID	-	10.1080/13693780802342552 [doi]
AB	-	Only a handful of cases of human Candida lambica infections have been published
		up to now. We report a Candida lambica fungemia in a young intravenous drug
		"abuser. Using a popular chromogenic agar and a commercial phenotyping gallery,"
		the fungus was initially misidentified as Candida krusei. Key tests to
		distinguish these closely related species are maximum growth temperature and
		assimilation of certain substrates present in more elaborate phenotyping assays.
		Definite confirmation is possible using molecular techniques. Susceptibility
		testing of the isolate demonstrated amphotericin B (MIC 0.125 microg/ml)
		"susceptible, flucytosine (MIC 2 microg/ml) susceptible, itraconazole (MIC 0.064"
		"microg/ml) susceptible, voriconazole (MIC 1 microg/ml) susceptible, and"
		"fluconazole (MIC >64 microg/ml, resistant)."

TI	-	Failure of systemic empirical treatment with amphotericin B to prevent candidemia

PG	-	462-6
AB	-	We undertook a retrospective review of all patients with hematologic malignancies
		in whom candidemia developed during chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in 1989 and
		1990. Candidemia developed in 11 patients; five were receiving therapeutic doses
		of amphotericin B at the time of infection. Disseminated infection occurred in 2
		of 5 patients with breakthrough infection and 3 of 6 patients with candidemia
		before receipt of amphotericin B. Among patients with breakthrough candidemia
		there was a trend toward more-prolonged neutropenia prior to infection (P =
		".069), but otherwise they were indistinguishable from other candidemic patients"
		with regard to risk factors for candidemia. Amphotericin B-susceptible Candida
		albicans was isolated from two patients and Candida krusei from three patients
		with breakthrough infection. All patients were treated with amphotericin B; all
		breakthrough infections responded to treatment. Neutropenic patients with
		breakthrough candidemia were clinically similar to those whose candidemia
		"preceded amphotericin B therapy, and there was no increase in morbidity and"
		mortality among individuals with breakthrough infection.

PG	-	313-6
AB	-	Four patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation were treated with
		liposomal (3 patients) and conventional (one patient) amphotericin-B for
		"disseminated candidosis. Candida krusei was isolated from 3, and C. glabrata from"
		1 patient. The patients were treated with liposomal amphotericin-B in doses from
		3 to 5 mg/kg. The fourth patient received conventional amphotericin-B in a
		reduced dose due to renal impairment. The patients died from multiorgan failure
		"due to disseminated fungal infection. In 1 case, the switch to the conventional"
		"drug resulted in clearance before death. The 3 fungus isolates, together with the"
		fourth strain obtained from patient no. 4 without any exposition to liposomal
		"amphotericin-B were tested for their susceptibility to conventional, liposomal"
		and discoidal amphotericin-B. All strains showed good sensitivity to the
		conventional and discoidal drug. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of
		liposomal amphotericin-B were 1 to 3 titre steps higher indicating a reduced
		sensitivity of the tested strains to this preparation. We conclude that the use
		of liposomal amphotericin-B is recommended mainly on the base of the low
		"incidence of side-effects. Intensive microbial resistance tests, pharmacokinetic"
		investigations and randomized studies are necessary before the conventional drug
		is replaced as the gold standard for systemic antimycotic therapy.

AB	-	A new molecular biology technique was used in 2 subjects with systemic
		"inflammatory response syndrome and negative blood cultures, in which"
		"broad-spectrum antibiotics were administered, without a visible improvement. Case"
		1: A 33-year-old female patient with a diagnosis of septic shock originating in
		"the abdomen was admitted in a bad general state, presenting with systemic"
		inflammatory response. The patient's general condition did not improve. As an
		"alternative, we used molecular biology. Candida krusei was reported and the"
		patient responded well to the treatment. Case 2: A woman in the 36th week of
		"pregnancy, with diabetes mellitus and secondary renal insufficiency, presented"
		with fever and hematological alterations. The patient's progress was slow and
		"accompanied by persistent fever, bandemia and leukopenia, as well as signs of"
		multiple organ dysfunction. The SeptiFast test identified Enterobacter
		"cloacae/aerogenes as the cause of the disorder. However, the patient died 24 h"
		after the antibiotics were changed.

TI	-	Occurrence of yeast bloodstream infections between 1987 and 1995 in five Dutch
		university hospitals.
PG	-	909-12
AB	-	The aim of this study was to identify retrospectively trends in fungal
		bloodstream infections in The Netherlands in the period from 1987 to 1995.
		"Results of over 395,000 blood cultures from five Dutch university hospitals were"
		"evaluated. Overall, there were more than 12 million patient days of care during"
		"the nine-year study period. The rate of candidemia doubled in the study period,"
		"reaching an incidence of 0.71 episodes per 10,000 patient days in 1995. The"
		general increase in candidemia was paralleled by an increase in non-Candida
		"albicans bloodstream infections, mainly due to Candida glabrata. However, more"
		than 60% of the infections were caused by Candida albicans. Fluconazole-resistant
		species such as Candida krusei did not emerge during the study period. The
		increasing rate of candidemia found in Dutch university hospitals is similar to
		"the trend observed in the USA, but the rate is lower and the increase is less"
		pronounced.
