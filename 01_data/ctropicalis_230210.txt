AB	-	BACKGROUND: The oral mucosa is likely to be compromised by acquired systemic
		disease. There are no data available on the prevalence of oral candidiasis and
		"the species distribution among patients with oral mucosal diseases. Therefore, it"
		is necessary to conduct a study assessing the characterization of oral
		candidiasis and the species profiles in such patients. METHODS: Over a period of
		"four consecutive years, patients with oral mucosal diseases were screened for"
		oral candidiasis by a combination of clinical presentation and laboratory
		"findings (smear test and Candida cultures). In addition, Candida species were"
		"isolated and identified for further analysis. RESULTS: In total, 9769 (6.09%) of"
		"the 160,357 patients screened were diagnosed with oral candidiasis on the basis"
		of both clinical manifestations and laboratory testing. The ratio of females to
		"males was 1:0.61, and females had higher overall infection rates than males in"
		"all age subgroups. Patients with HIV infection, anaemia-related stomatitis,"
		"Sjögren's syndrome/xerostomia, pemphigoid, and radiation-induced stomatitis were"
		"highly susceptible to oral candidiasis. Of the 11,161 isolated Candida strains,"
		"C. albicans remained the most common species (75.37%), followed by C. tropicalis"
		"(6.06%), C. krusei (2.79%), and C. glabrata (2.02%). Surprisingly, both the"
		proportion and the number of C. glabrata isolates increased dramatically over the
		"4 consecutive years. CONCLUSIONS: In this large-scale population-based study, the"
		features of oral candidiasis prevalence and the species profile among patients
		with oral mucosal diseases were summarized. The information gleaned will enhance
		the understanding of and improve management strategies for oral candidiasis and
		the underlying systemic and oral conditions.

		antifungal susceptibility pattern.
PG	-	3292-3303
LID	-	10.1111/jog.15442 [doi]
AB	-	"AIM: Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), is a common fungal infection that remains a"
		global concern. The objectives of this study were molecular identification and
		"assessment of the antifungal susceptibility profile of Candida species, causing"
		VVC in southeast Iran. METHODS: A cross-sectional investigation was carried out
		on 119 nonpregnant females suspected of VVC between February 2019 and May 2021.
		Yeast samples were characterized to the species level by conventional and
		molecular methods. All Candida isolates were examined for in vitro susceptibility
		profile to six conventional antifungal drugs using Clinical and Laboratory
		"Standards Institute guidelines. RESULTS: Out of 119 subjects, 52 (43.7%) cases"
		"were affected by VVC, out of whom 11 (21.15%) cases had recurrent vulvovaginal"
		candidiasis (RVVC). The species distribution was as follows; Candida albicans
		"(n = 21; 40.4%), C. glabrata (n = 11; 21.2%), C. tropicalis (n = 9; 17.3%), C."
		"parapsilosis (n = 5; 9.7%), C. africana (n = 3; 5.7%), C. famata (n = 1; 1.9%),"
		"C. lusitaniae (n = 1; 1.9%), and C. dubliniensis (n = 1; 1.9%). The resistance"
		"rate of Candida isolates to fluconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole were"
		"15.38%, 11.5%, and 3.8%, respectively. Resistance to fluconazole was obtained in"
		46% (5/11) of RVVC cases but only in 7% (3/41) of VVC cases. CONCLUSION: This
		study demonstrated that the majority of VVC cases were caused by non-albicans
		"Candida species which also were resistant to some antifungal agents. Hence, our"
		findings revealed the importance of conducting periodical epidemiological studies
		"to determine changes in species distribution. Moreover, for effective management"
		"of treatment and infection, it is imperative to evaluate the susceptibility"
		profiles of Candida species isolated from VVC patients.

TI	-	Candida Score: a Predictor of Mortality in Patients with Candidemia.
PG	-	12-Nov
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candida score has been developed and used for identifying patients at
		"risk for developing Candida infections. However, its usefulness in predicting"
		outcome of patients with candidemia has not been evaluated. We aimed to determine
		the risk factors for mortality in patients with candidemia admitted to an Indian
		medical intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort
		analysis of 56 patients with candidemia presented in 18 months duration. Baseline
		"patient characteristics, ICU course and outcome were noted and Candida score was"
		calculated. We conducted analysis based on the primary outcome measure of ICU
		"mortality. RESULTS: Out of 3,142 ICU admissions, the incidence of candidemia was"
		"17.8/1,000 admissions. The mean interval between ICU admission and candidemia was"
		12.9 ± 14.4 days. C. tropicalis was the commonest species isolated from 28.6%
		"isolates, followed by Candida albicans (21.4%) and C. glabrata (12.5%). The mean"
		length of ICU stay was 22.9 ± 28 days and hospital stay was 30.1 ± 30.2 days.
		Crude ICU mortality was 33.93%. There was no statistically significant difference
		between mortality of patients with albicans and non-albicans candidemia
		"(p=0.732). On multivariate analysis, only two factors, previous antifungal"
		"therapy (p=0.004, OR=101.4, 95% CI=4.52-227.7) and Candida score &gt;3 (p=0.028,"
		"OR=13.2, 95% CI=1.3-125) were found to be independently predicting mortality."
		CONCLUSION: Candida infection is generally late-onset and is associated with a
		"prolonged ICU and hospital stay, and a high mortality. Candida non-albicans"
		infection was more common but there was no difference in mortality among patients
		with C. albicans and non-albicans infection. Previous antifungal therapy and
		Candida score were found to be independently predicting mortality.

		dentition among diabetic patients: A hospital-based study.
PG	-	292-298
LID	-	10.4103/ijdr.IJDR_827_20 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: The study was undertaken to estimate the species-specific prevalence
		"of oral candidiasis in diabetic individuals in India, and further find the"
		relationship of oral carriage of Candida in diabetes with degree of diabetic
		"control, duration of disease, type of diabetes and its effect on the status of"
		"oral hygiene status and decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMFT) score."
		METHODOLOGY: The prospective cross-sectional study involved 900 individuals (470
		diabetic and 430 non-diabetic) visiting a tertiary care hospital. Informed
		consent was obtained from all the individuals participating in the study. The
		"demographic details, medical history and oral cavity examination were recorded in"
		a specially designed proforma. Swabs were taken for microbiological evaluation
		for specific prevalence of Candida. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of Candida in
		"diabetics was 22.1% as compared to 9.7% in non-diabetic individuals. However,"
		"among the type 1 and type 2 diabetics, the prevalence of Candida was equally"
		"distributed as 22.6% and 20.8%, respectively. C. albicans was the most common"
		"species (97.1%), while isolated cases of other species like C. rugosa, C."
		"tropicalis, C. glabrata were also observed. The individuals with higher glycaemic"
		score (HbA1c >7) showed higher prevalence of oral candidiasis. Oral hygiene
		status was observed to be lower among diabetics as compared to non-diabetic
		individuals. CONCLUSION: Oral candidiasis was more prevalent in diabetic
		"patients, and C. albicans was the most common species. The diabetics also showed"
		higher mean DMFT with lower oral hygiene status as compared to non-diabetic
		individuals.

PG	-	184-90
LID	-	10.1111/myc.12141 [doi]
AB	-	Vaginal candidiasis (VC) continues to be a health problem to women worldwide.
		"Although the majority of VC cases are caused by Candida albicans (C. albicans),"
		non-albicans Candida spp. like C. glabrata and C. tropicalis are emerging as
		important and potentially resistant opportunistic agents of VC. The objective of
		this study was to evaluate the prevalence and epidemiology of VC in the UAE
		through retrospective analysis of pertinent data compiled by the microbiology and
		"infection control unit at Latifa Hospital, Dubai between 2005 and 2011. The"
		incidence of VC significantly increased from 10.76% in 2005 to 17.61% in 2011;
		"average prevalence was 13.88%. C. albicans occurred at a frequency of 83.02%, C."
		glabrata at 16.5% and C. tropicalis at 1.2%. A single C. dubliniensis isolate was
		identified in the sample population. The percentage of C. albicans significantly
		decreased from 83.02% in the sample population as a whole to 60.8% in subjects
		"over 45 years of age (P < 0.01) and that of C. glabrata, C. tropicalis and C."
		"krusei significantly increased from 13.88%, 0.9% and 0.03% to 29.7%, 6.7% and"
		1.4% (P < 0.05) respectively. The incidence of VC in the UAE is on the rise and
		the frequency of non-albicans Candida spp. is noticeably increasing especially in
		postmenopausal women.

AB	-	Candidemia is an alarming problem in critically ill patients including those
		"admitted in Internal Medicine Wards (IMWs). Here, we analyzed all cases of"
		candidemia in adult patients hospitalized over nine years (2010-2018) in IMWs of
		"a 980-bedded University Hospital of Ancona, Italy. During the study period,"
		218/505 (43%) episodes of candidemia occurred in IMWs patients. The cumulative
		incidence was 2.5/1000 hospital admission and increased significantly over time
		"(p = 0.013). Patients were predominantly male, with a median age of 68 years."
		Cardiovascular diseases and solid tumors were the most frequent comorbidities.
		"Candida albicans accounted for 51% of the cases, followed by C. parapsilosis"
		"(25%), C. tropicalis (9%) and C. glabrata (7%). Thirty-day mortality was 28% and"
		did not increased significantly over time. By multivariate logistic regression
		"analysis, the presence of neutropenia (OR 7.247 [CI95% 1,368-38,400; p = 0.020]),"
		"pneumonia (OR 2.323 [CI95% 1,105-4,884; p = 0.026]), and being infected with C."
		"albicans (OR 2.642 [95% CI 1,223-5,708; p = 0.013) emerged as independent"
		predictors of mortality. The type of antifungal therapy did not influence the
		"outcome. Overall, these data indicate that patients admitted to IMWs are"
		increasingly at higher risk of developing candidemia. Mortality rate remains high
		and significantly associated with both microbiologic- and host-related factors.

		Rate in a Thai Tertiary Care Hospital.
PG	-	96-102
LID	-	10.1097/INF.0000000000002912 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive candidiasis (IC) is a serious infection among children with
		underlying medical conditions. A shift from C. albicans to non-albicans Candida
		has been observed worldwide. This study aims to identify species of Candida and
		factors associated with the overall 30-day mortality rate. METHODS: A
		retrospective chart review was conducted among children with culture-confirmed IC
		"from birth to 15 years of age at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Thailand."
		Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to determine associated
		"factors with 30-day mortality. RESULTS: From 2003 to 2019, 102 episodes of IC in"
		pediatric group with a median age of 16 months (interquartile range 4-65) and 12
		episodes of IC in neonatal group with a median age of 18 days (interquartile
		"range 12-22). The species distribution were Candida albicans (35%), Candida"
		"parapsilosis (26%), Candida tropicalis (22%), Candida glabrata (6%) and"
		other/unspecified species (11%). Antifungal treatment was given in 88% (67%
		"Amphotericin B deoxycholate, 28% Fluconazole). Overall 30-day mortality rates"
		were 28.5% [95% confidence interval (CI) 20.8%-38.4%] and 8.3% (95% CI
		"1.2%-46.1%) in pediatrics and neonates, respectively. Mortality rate among the"
		neutropenic group was significantly higher than non-neutropenic group (46.4% vs.
		"20.6%, P = 0.005). Factors associated with 30-day mortality in pediatric IC were"
		"shock [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 4.2; 95% CI 1.8-9.4], thrombocytopenia (aHR"
		7.7; 95% CI 1.8-33.9) and no antifungal treatment (aHR 4.6; 95% CI 1.7-12.1).
		CONCLUSIONS: Two-third of children with IC were diagnosed with non-albicans
		"Candida. Children with high mortality rate included those with neutropenia,"
		"presented with shock or thrombocytopenia, such that the proper empiric antifungal"
		treatment is recommended.

AB	-	The risk factors and clinical features of patients with Candida tropicalis
		fungaemia have not been fully defined. We performed a case-control study
		comparing 59 cases of C. tropicalis fungaemia with 177 episodes of fungaemia
		caused by other species of Candida in our hospital over a 24-year period (January
		1985 to December 2008). Patients with C. tropicalis fungaemia were more likely to
		"be older (median age, 67 vs. 56 years; p 0.01), to have cancer (45.5% vs. 31.6%,"
		"p 0.04), and to have the abdomen as the portal of entry (32.2% vs. 11.9%, p"
		"0.001), and had a higher in-hospital mortality rate (61% vs. 44%, p 0.03)."
		Multivariate analysis showed that the independent risk factors for C. tropicalis
		fungaemia were cancer (OR 4.5; 95% CI 1.05-3.83; p 0.03) and the abdomen as the
		portal of entry (OR 13.6; 95% CI 1.9-8.2; p <0.001). When survivors were compared
		"with non-survivors, the risk factors associated with a poor outcome were"
		"neutropenia (19.4% vs. 0; p 0.03), corticosteroid treatment (36% vs. 13%; p"
		"0.07), and septic shock (50% vs. 17.4%; p 0.01). The independent risk factors for"
		mortality in the multivariate analysis were corticosteroid treatment (OR 8.2; 95%
		"CI 0.9-27.7; p 0.04) and septic shock (OR 14.6; 95% CI 2.4-90.2; p 0.004),"
		whereas urinary tract infection (OR 0.07; 95% CI 0.01-0.8; p 0.03) and catheter
		removal (OR 0.06; 95% CI 0.01-0.4; p 0.002) were protective factors. C.
		tropicalis is the fourth most common cause of fungaemia in our hospital. It is
		"associated with underlying malignancy, the abdomen as the portal of entry, and"
		poor outcome.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To assess the current clinical features and determinants of outcome of
		Candida tropicalis bloodstream infection (BSI). METHODS: A population-based
		surveillance on Candida BSI was conducted from May 2010 to April 2011 in 29
		Spanish hospitals. Antifungal susceptibility testing (EUCAST methodology) was
		centrally performed. The characteristics and outcome of C. tropicalis BSI
		episodes were compared with those due to other species. RESULTS: Fifty-nine out
		of 752 episodes (7.8%) were due to C. tropicalis (annual incidence: 0.62 cases
		"per 100,000 population). Resistance to fluconazole and voriconazole was found in"
		23.2% and 26.8% of isolates. Breakthrough BSI occurred in 10.5% of episodes. Risk
		"factors for C. tropicalis BSI were age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.01; P-value = 0.05),"
		underlying leukaemia (OR: 4.77; P-value = 0.001) and chronic lung disease (OR:
		2.62; P-value = 0.002). There were no differences in clinical failure (persistent
		BSI for ≥72 h after initiation of therapy and/or 30-day all-cause mortality)
		between C. tropicalis (39.6%) and non-C. tropicalis groups (45.6%). The
		appropriateness of antifungal therapy or the fluconazole MIC values had no
		"significant impact on outcome, whereas early central venous catheter removal"
		exerted a protective effect. CONCLUSIONS: C. tropicalis BSI was associated with
		"advanced age, haematological malignancy and respiratory comorbidity. We found no"
		correlation between the unexpectedly high resistance rate to azoles observed and
		outcome.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Outbreaks of fungal bloodstream infection (BSI) are uncommon among
		hemodialysis patients. We investigated an outbreak of Candida tropicalis BSIs
		involving patients at 3 of 4 affiliated hemodialysis units. METHODS: An
		"investigation included a review of records of patients with C tropicalis BSI, a"
		"case-control study, and cultures of medications, hands of personnel, dialysis"
		"equipment, and water samples. RESULTS: Eight patients developed C tropicalis BSIs"
		"in a 3-month period. Compared to controls, cases had a higher proportion of"
		preceding dialyses performed on a machine with a contaminated saline prime bucket
		(SPB) (P= .02). Observations revealed that SPBs at units A-C were rinsed with tap
		"water, were not routinely disinfected, and that priming tubing was allowed to"
		contact fluid in SPBs. C tropicalis was recovered from the main compartment and
		hollow handle of SPBs and from other environmental samples. C tropicalis isolates
		"from patients, SPBs and other environmental samples had indistinguishable"
		pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns. Following routine disinfection of
		"SPBs, the outbreak terminated. CONCLUSIONS: This outbreak was likely due to"
		inadequate disinfection of SPBs. The findings emphasize the importance of
		disinfection of SPBs. Current use of identical SPBs warrants further evaluation
		of hollow SPB handles as a potential infection risk.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Pregnant women are more susceptible to vaginal colonization and
		infection by yeast. The role of Candida colonization in the occurrence of preterm
		birth is well established. The knowledge of local epidemiology and identification
		of risk factors for preterm birth is important for the prevention and management
		strategies. The purpose of the study was to determine the prevalence of
		Candida sp. in vaginal swabs of pregnant women. METHODS: Pregnant women attending
		routine antenatal visits in three primary health centres in Bobo-Dioulasso
		(Burkina Faso) were enrolled into a cross-sectional study carried out from
		February to April 2015. Vaginal swabs samples were taken from participants after
		obtaining oral consent. The swabs were inoculated into Sabouraud's glucose agar
		supplemented with chloramphenicol and incubated at 37°C for 24 to 48hours under
		aerobic conditions in order to perform fungal culture. The identification of the
		Candida species was done by culture on HiCrome Candida Differential Agar at 35°C
		for 48h for production of species-specific colors. RESULTS: A total of
		229 pregnant women were included. The prevalence of vulvovaginal candidiasis
		"(VVC) was 22.71%, (95% CI [17.45-28.69]). Candida albicans accounted for 40.39%"
		"and non-Candida albicans species for 59.61% of the isolates, with mainly"
		"C. glabrata (32.69%), C. tropicalis (15.38%) and C. krusei (11.54%). CONCLUSIONS:"
		This study revealed a high prevalence of non-C. albicans species. The syndromic
		management guidelines for VVC in Burkina Faso will be revised to include a
		specific protocol for pregnant women.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Imaging of the urinary tract by ultrasonography (USG) or
		computerized tomography scanning is recommended for detecting structural
		"abnormalities, hydronephrosis, abscesses, emphysematous pyelonephritis, or fungus"
		ball formation. Limited studies on the epidemiology and the imaging results of
		candiduria were present in the children. AIM: This study aimed to evaluate the
		results of renal ultrasonography imaging in hospitalized pediatric patients with
		"candiduria. STUDY DESIGN: In this descriptive study, we reviewed our"
		ultrasonography findings with hospitalized children and infants who with
		candiduria. The study included the period between January 2012 and December 2019.
		"Demographic data, the previous medical history, the clinical features of the"
		"patients, ultrasonographic findings of the urinary tract system, presence of an"
		"indwelling urinary catheter, type of urinary samplings, type of candida species"
		were retrospectively recorded. The study was approved by Institutional Review
		"Board with the registration number 2019/366. RESULTS: During the study period,"
		220 children with nosocomial candiduria were evaluated. The most common isolated
		candida species was Candida albicans (68.2%) and followed by C. tropicalis
		"(9.1%). Among all patients, 2 (0.9%) had renal fungal balls associated with C."
		Albicans. Twenty-five patients (11.4%) had findings including internal
		"echogenicity in the bladder (n = 12), uroepithelial thickening of the kidney"
		"(n = 10), and sediments in the renal pelvis (n = 3). DISCUSSION: Candida albicans"
		was the most prominent candida isolated from the patients. The fungal ball is an
		uncommon infection especially in children and predominantly caused by Candida
		species. Fungal ball in the kidney was reported as case reports especially in
		"neonates, in immunosupressed patients, and in patients who had undergone surgical"
		"procedures. In our study, none of the patients with the fungal ball were in the"
		"neonatal period, however, the patients with fungus ball had underlying disease or"
		"condition. Our study has several limitations including a retrospective study, and"
		"the USG were not performed by a single radiologist. Besides these limitations,"
		our findings are important to give information about the place of USG for
		diagnosis of the renal fungal ball in children adding valuable information to a
		topic in which data came from mainly case reports. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the low
		"incidence of fungal balls reported, considering the high consequences of missing"
		"a fungal ball and elimination of it, a non-invasive method such as the renal"
		bladder USG is still necessary for detection of fungal ball especially. More
		prospective studies are required for high risk groups to establish the diagnostic
		value of renal USG.

		diagnosed with biliary candidiasis by simple morphologic aspects. The fungus was
		mainly differentiated as Candida albicans or Candida glabrata and rarely as
		"Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, or other subspecies. Immunosuppression"
		for various reasons was significantly associated with bile-duct candidiasis (P <
		.02). No significant association was found between positive fungal cultures and
		prior endoscopic sphincterotomy (P = .0824) or prior ERCP (P = .1152). Biliary
		candidiasis was neither associated with positive fungal cultures of buccal smears
		(P = .0722) nor with positive findings in stool samples (P = .0860). LIMITATIONS:
		Highly selected patient population. Buccal smears and stool samples were not
		obtained from all patients. Contamination artifacts cannot totally be excluded
		with the ERCP procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Candida species very frequently can be
		detected in the bile. Positive fungal cultures of bile samples are not just
		contamination artifacts. This has to be taken into account when designing an
		anti-infectious treatment for recurrent cholangitis or even more cholangiosepsis.
		Especially in immunosuppressed patients or recipients of long-term antibiotic
		"therapy, physicians should screen for biliary-tract candidiasis during endoscopic"
		examination.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candidemia and Candida-associated catheter-related bloodstream
		infections (CRBSIs) are the significant cause of mortality and morbidity in
		patients with malignancy. METHODS: A retrospective analysis including all
		pediatric hematologic/oncologic malignancies patients with CRBSIs treated in Dr.
		Behçet Uz Children Diseases and Surgery Training and Research Hospital between
		"the period of 2009 and 2020. RESULTS: During the study period, 53 children with"
		CRBSIs associated with Candida species were included. The most common malignancy
		was acute lymphoblastic leukemia (45.3%) and acute myeloid leukemia (15.1%). A
		total of 56 Candida isolates were present including non-albicans Candida species
		(80.4%) and Candida albicans (19.6%). The most common isolated Candida species
		was Candida parapsilosis (42.9%) and followed by C. albicans (19.6%). The ratio
		of azole prophylaxis was significantly higher in patients with the non-albicans
		Candida group (P=0.031). Candida-related endocarditis (vegetation) was present in
		"2 (3.8%) patients, and the overall rate of hepatosplenic candidiasis was 3.8%."
		Seven days Candida attributable mortality was 7.5% (4 patients) and 30 days
		Candida attributable mortality was 11.3% (6 patients). The Candida species
		responsible for the Candida-related deaths were as following: Candida tropicalis
		"(n=3), C. parapsilosis (n=2), and C. lusitanae (n=1). CONCLUSION: In pediatric"
		"cancer patients with Candida-associated CRBSIs, evaluation of the patient for"
		organ involvement including liver and spleen ultrasonography and cardiac
		involvement with echocardiography are essential regardless of the patients'
		clinical picture.

PG	-	e954-66
LID	-	10.1016/j.ijid.2010.04.006 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candidemia is among the leading causes of nosocomial bloodstream
		infections and is associated with significant mortality. Several centers have
		published data regarding the incidence and relative frequency of Candida spp.
		OBJECTIVE: We performed a systematic review to summarize and evaluate the
		available evidence regarding the distribution of the relative frequency of
		"Candida spp isolated from blood, according to geographic region and study design,"
		during the period 1996 to 2009. METHODS: We searched PubMed and Scopus and
		retrieved 81 relevant articles reporting data on the relative frequency of
		Candida spp. RESULTS: C. albicans was the predominant species in almost all
		studies. The highest proportion of C. albicans was found in North and Central
		"Europe and the USA. Non-albicans species were more common in South America, Asia,"
		and South Europe. C. glabrata was commonly isolated in the USA and North and
		"Central Europe; C. parapsilosis in South America, South Europe, and several parts"
		of Asia; and C. tropicalis in South America and Asia. The relative frequency of
		C. krusei was low in all regions. Significant differences were noted depending on
		"study design (surveillance study, multicenter or single centre, prospective or"
		retrospective) and setting (hospital or intensive care unit). CONCLUSIONS:
		Significant geographic variation is evident among cases of candidemia in
		different parts of the world. Local epidemiological data continue to be of major
		significance.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs) are life-threatening
		surgical emergencies associated with high morbidity and mortality. Fungal NSTIs
		are considered rare and have been largely understudied. The purpose of this study
		was to study the impact of fungal NSTIs and antifungal therapy on mortality after
		NSTIs. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed on patients with NSTIs
		"from 2012 to 2018. Patient baseline characteristics, microbiologic data,"
		"antimicrobial therapy, and clinical outcomes were collected. Patients were"
		excluded if they had comfort care before excision. The primary outcome measured
		was in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: A total of 215 patients met study criteria
		with a fungal species identified in 29 patients (13.5%). The most prevalent
		fungal organism was Candida tropicalis (n = 11). Fungal NSTIs were more prevalent
		"in patients taking immunosuppressive medications (17.2% versus 3.2%, P = 0.01). A"
		"fungal NSTI was significantly associated with in-hospital mortality (odds ratio,"
		"3.13; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-8.40; P = 0.02). Furthermore, fungal NSTI"
		"patients had longer lengths of stay (32 d [interquartile range, 16-53] versus"
		"19 d [interquartile range, 11-31], P < 0.01), more likely to require initiation"
		"of renal replacement therapy (24.1% versus 8.6%, P = 0.02), and more likely to"
		"require mechanical ventilation (64.5% versus 42.0%, P = 0.02). Initiation of"
		antifungals was associated with a significantly lower rate of in-hospital
		"mortality (6.7% versus 57.1%, P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Fungal NSTIs are more"
		common in patients taking immunosuppressive medications and are significantly
		associated with in-hospital mortality. Antifungal therapy is associated with
		decreased in-hospital mortality in those with fungal NSTIs. Consideration should
		"be given to adding antifungals in empiric treatment regimens, especially in those"
		taking immunosuppressive medications.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive candidiasis is an important nosocomial infection associated
		with high mortality among immunosuppressive or critically ill patients. We
		described the incidence of invasive candidiasis in our hospital over 6 years and
		showed the antifungal susceptibility and genotypes of the isolated yeast. METHOD:
		The yeast species were isolated on CHROMagar Candida medium and identified using
		"an yeast identification card, followed by analysis of the D1/D2 domain of 26S"
		"rDNA. The susceptibilities of the isolates to flucytosine, amphotericin B,"
		"fluconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole were tested using the ATB FUNGUS 3"
		"system, and that to caspofungin was tested using E-test strips. C. albicans was"
		genotyped using single-strand conformation polymorphism of CAI (Candida albicans
		I) microsatellite DNA combined with GeneScan data. RESULTS: From January 2006 to
		"December 2011, a total of 259 isolates of invasive Candida spp. were obtained"
		"from 253 patients, among them 6 patients had multiple positive samples."
		"Ninety-one stains were from blood and 168 from sterile fluids, accounting for"
		6.07% of all pathogens isolated in our hospital. Most of these strains were C.
		"albicans (41.29% in blood/59.06% in sterile body fluids), followed by C."
		"tropicalis (18.06%/25.72%), C. parapsilosis (17.42%/5.43%), C. glabrata"
		(11.61%/3.99%) and other Candida spp. (11.61%/5.80%). Most Candida spp. were
		isolated from the ICU. The new species-specific CLSI candida MIC breakpoints were
		applied to these date. Resistance to fluconazole occurred in 6.6% of C. albicans
		"isolates, 10.6% of C. tropicalis isolates and 15.0% of C. glabrata isolates. For"
		"the 136 C. albicans isolates, 54 CAI patterns were recognized. The C. albicans"
		strains from blood or sterile body fluids showed no predominant CAI genotypes. C.
		albicans isolates from different samples from the same patient had the same
		genotype. CONCLUSIONS: Invasive candidiasis has been commonly encountered in our
		"hospital in the past 6 years, with increasing frequency of non-C. albicans."
		Resistance to fluconazole was highly predictive of resistance to voriconazole.
		CAI SSCP genotyping showed that all C. albicans strains were polymorphic.
		Invasive candidiasis were commonly endogenous infection.

TI	-	Candidemia in major burns patients.
PG	-	391-8
LID	-	10.1111/myc.12488 [doi]
AB	-	Major burn patients have characteristics that make them especially susceptible to
		"candidemia, but few studies focused on this have been published. The objectives"
		"were to evaluate the epidemiological, microbiological and clinical aspects of"
		"candidemia in major burn patients, determining factors associated with a poorer"
		prognosis and mortality. We conducted a retrospective observational study of
		candidemia between 1996 and 2012 in major burn patients admitted to the La Fe
		"University Hospital, Valencia, Spain. The study included 36 episodes of"
		"candidemia in the same number of patients, 55.6% men, mean age 37.33 years and"
		low associated comorbidity. The incidence of candidemia varied between 0.26 and
		6.09 episodes/1000 days stay in the different years studied. Candida albicans was
		the most common species (61.1%) followed by Candida parapsilosis (27.8%).
		"Candidemia by C. krusei, C. glabrata or C. tropicalis were all identified after"
		2004. Central vascular catheter (CVC) was established as a potential source of
		"candidemia in 36.1%, followed by skin and soft tissues of thermal injury (22.2%)"
		and urinary tract (8.3%). Fluconazole was used in 19 patients (52.7%) and its in
		"vitro resistance rate was 13.9%. The overall mortality was 47.2%, and mortality"
		related to candidemia was 30.6%. Factors associated with increased mortality were
		those related to severe infection and shock. CVC was the most usual focus of
		candidemia. Fluconazole was the most common antifungal drug administered. The
		management of candidemia in major burn patients is still a challenge.

TI	-	Distribution of candidemia in Malaysian tertiary care hospital revealed
		predominance of Candida parapsilosis.
PG	-	903-910
LID	-	10.47665/tb.37.4.903 [doi]
AB	-	Candida parapsilosis is an important pathogen of healthcare-associated
		bloodstream infections (BSI) causing high mortality and morbidity in
		immunocompromised patients in addition to other Candida species including C.
		"albicans, C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, and C. krusei. Knowledge on recent local"
		species distribution and trend is essential. An increase in the proportion of C.
		parapsilosis candidemia has been recently observed as a result of many risk
		factors. The distribution of candidemia has been changing in the last three
		decades. To determine the proportion of different Candida species causing
		"candidemia in a tertiary-care hospital during January 2001 - December 2018, a"
		retrospective study performed in a 853-bedded tertiary-care hospital in
		north-eastern Malaysia. All cases of candidemia from January-2001 to
		"December-2018 were included, and the review was performed based on patients'"
		medical records and laboratory database. The frequency of different Candida
		species was determined. This study showed that out of 1175 patients with
		"candidemia, C. parapsilosis was the most common species contributing to 29.2%"
		"(343/1175) of candidemia, followed by C. albicans 20.1% (236/1175), C. tropicalis"
		"18.7% (220/1175), C. glabrata 6.0% (71/1175), C. guilliermondii 3.7% (43/1175),"
		"C. rugosa 1.9% (22/1175), C. famata 1.7% (20/1175), C. krusei 1.4% (16/1175), C."
		"dubliniensis 0.8% (9/1175), C. lusitaniae 0.7% (8/1175), C. lipolytica 0.3%"
		"(4/1175), C. pelliculosa 0.3% (4/1175), C. haemulonii, C. kefyr, C. utilis and C."
		"inconspicua (1/1175 each). In addition, 14.9% (175/1175) belonged to Candida spp."
		"which were not identified to species level. In conclusion, a different scenario"
		for the proportion of Candida species with C. parapsilosis predominates over C.
		albicans as a nosocomial pathogen leading to candidemia has been shown in this
		study.

AB	-	Invasive candidiasis (IC) is a life-threatening fungal infection with high
		"morbidity and mortality. In this study, we aimed to investigate the Candida"
		species distribution and antifungal drug susceptibility and to identify the risk
		"factors associated with IC mortality in children. We conducted a retrospective,"
		single-centre study of paediatric IC in patients from a tertiary care hospital in
		Turkey between January 2013 and February 2019. A total of 56 Candida isolates
		underwent antifungal susceptibility testing performed by Sensititre YeastOne YO10
		"panel, and the demographic and clinical data of 65 patients were examined during"
		the study period. The most commonly isolated species was Candida albicans in 30
		"patients (46%), followed by C. parapsilosis in 25 patients (38%) and"
		C. tropicalis in three patients (5%). According to the antifungal drug
		"susceptibility testing, C. albicans was fully susceptible to fluconazole and the"
		other antifungal agents (100%). None of the isolates displayed resistance to
		"anidulafungin, micafungin, flucytosine, posaconazole, voriconazole or"
		"itraconazole. There were low rates of resistance to fluconazole (1.8%),"
		"caspofungin (1.8%) and micafungin (1.8%). In addition, 5.3% of the Candida"
		"isolates were susceptible in a dose-dependent manner to itraconazole, 3.6% were"
		susceptible to voriconazole and fluconazole and 1.8% were susceptible to
		anidulafungin. The mortality rate of IC was 15.4%. Thrombocytopenia after IC
		treatment was significantly associated with mortality in the multivariate
		"analysis. These results, which help determine the species distribution,"
		"antifungal susceptibility patterns and risk factors for mortality, could make a"
		"significant contribution to the management of these challenging infections,"
		including choosing appropriate empirical antifungal therapy.

		study.
PG	-	1387-1395
LID	-	10.1111/myc.13297 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Considering the emergence of fungaemia due to rare yeasts at our
		"centre, we performed a systematic epidemiologic study on fungaemia due to rare"
		yeast. OBJECTIVES: We undertook the present prospective observational study to
		explore the epidemiological features and clinical characteristics of fungaemia
		due to rare yeasts in paediatric ICUs at our centre. METHODS: The successive
		yeasts isolated from blood at our PICUs during December 2017 through March 2019
		were identified by molecular methods. Fungaemia due to yeasts other than
		"C. albicans, C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, C. krusei and C. parapsilosis was"
		categorised as rare yeasts. Antifungal susceptibility testing of the yeast
		isolates was performed as per clinical and laboratory standards institute (CLSI)
		guidelines. We also compared different clinical parameters of fungaemia due to
		"common versus rare yeasts, and rare yeasts in neonates versus non-neonates."
		"RESULTS: During the study period, 212 yeast isolates were obtained from 159"
		"patients at PICUs of our hospital, and 127 isolates from 98 patients (61.6%) were"
		categorised as rare yeasts. Neonates acquired fungaemia significantly earlier
		after ICU admission than non-neonates (median:4 vs 6 days; p = .005). Regarding
		"epidemiology study of rare yeast fungaemia, Wickerhamomyces anomalus (43.8%) and"
		Candida utilis (40.8%) were common isolates; surgical intervention and
		"gastrointestinal disease were significantly associated; overall, azole,"
		"echinocandin and amphotericin B resistance was at 9.1%, 1.02% and 1.02%,"
		respectively; overall mortality was 65.3%. CONCLUSIONS: The emergence of rare
		yeasts especially W. anomalus and C. utilis causing fungaemia in our children
		demands urgent attention to control the spread.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Leprosy represents a chronic progressive debilitating disease. The
		severe morbidity associated with leprosy predisposes the patients to
		opportunistic infections. To assess the oral candida prevalence and species
		specificity in lepromatous leprosy patients. METHODS: The cross-sectional study
		included 70 lepromatous leprosy patients under a multi-drug regimen for less than
		1 year (group 1) and 70 healthy volunteers (group 2). Both group 1 and 2 were
		"matched for potential confounding factors including age, gender, ethnicity,"
		absence of HIV co-infection. Oral swab samples obtained from both groups were
		subjected to a series of conventional and molecular diagnostic modalities.
		RESULTS: Yeast growth was statistically higher (0.0006) in group 1 (45.7%) than
		in group 2 (18.5%). 28 of the 32 yeast growth in group 1 and all 13 yeast growth
		"in group 2 were identified as candida. Among the 28 candida species in group 1,"
		"23 (71.88%) were Candida albicans, 3 (9.37%) were Candida parapsilosis, 1 (3.13%)"
		"was Candida lusitaniae and 1 (3.13%) was Candida nivariensis. Among group 2, 11"
		"(84.6%) were Candida albicans, 1 (7.7%) was Candida parapsilosis and 1 was"
		Candida tropicalis. CONCLUSION: Oral candida prevalence is higher in leprosy
		"patients than in healthy individuals, indicating a predisposition towards"
		opportunistic infections. The increasing prevalence of the non-candida albicans
		species in leprosy is a major concern as they have shown to possess inherent
		resistant towards common anti-fungal agents.

TI	-	Oral Candidiasis in children and adolescents with cancer. Identification of
		Candida spp.
PG	-	E419-23
AB	-	Oral candidiasis represents a serious problem for children with cancer. The
		"mortality rate of this infection has increased due to fungal septicemia,"
		associated with a primary buccal infection. OBJECTIVE: Identify the Candida spp.
		"in buccal lesions of patients with cancer, establish the predominant species and"
		"correlate them to age and sex of the patient, clinical presentation, type of"
		"neoplasic disease and cytostatic therapy received. STUDY DESIGN: 62 patients,"
		"between 0-16 years, were investigated in a cross sectional study. SAMPLE"
		INCLUSION CRITERIA: Patients with malignant neoplasic disease that were receiving
		cytostatic treatment and had suspicious lesions of oral candidiasis. Patients
		"with antifungal therapy, active caries, calculus or intraoral appliances were"
		excluded. A clinical evaluation was carried out. The lesion sample was taken and
		studied by direct exam and culture in CHROMagar-Candida and Sabouraud-Dextrose
		Agar with chloramphenicol. The identification of the isolated yeast was done by
		"the filamentation test, carbohydrate fermentation and assimilation. RESULTS: Most"
		"of the cases (69.35%) were positive to oral candidiasis, C. albicans was the most"
		"frequent species found, followed by C. parapsilosis (14.89%), C. tropicalis"
		"(12.77%), C. krusei (4.26%), C. glabrata (2.13%) and C. lusitaniae (2.13%). In"
		some cases more than one specie were isolated (9.30%). The most frequent location
		of the lesion was in the tongue (72.70%). The pseudomembranous candidiasis was
		the most frequent clinical presentation found (78.71%). There were not
		"significant statistically differences with regard to sex and age of the patient,"
		type of neoplasic disease and cytostatic agent received. CONCLUSION: The results
		suggest that oral candidiasis is a frequent complication in the pediatric
		"oncological population, being C. albicans the main etiological agent, however,"
		there is an important participation of other Candida species.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at providing original data on fungemia in the Centre
		"Hospitalier de Mayotte in terms of prevalence, epidemiological characteristics of"
		"infected patients, yeast species distribution and profile of in vitro antifungals"
		susceptibility. METHODS: A total of 223 positive blood cultures for yeasts were
		retrospectively reported during the period April 2010-April 2020. RESULTS:
		Ninety-five episodes were identified corresponding to an incidence rate of 3.7
		"cases/100,000 inhabitants. The average age of patients was 33.5 years, and 63.3%"
		patients were hospitalized in intensive care unit. The main co-morbidities were
		"surgery in the 30 days prior to fungemia (27.8%), neoplasia (22.8%), parenteral"
		"nutrition (17.7%), diabetes (16.5%) and immunosuppressive medications (31.6%)."
		Candida spp accounted for the majority of isolates (92.4%) with a predominance of
		"non-albicans species (55.8% vs 33.7%), including C. albicans (33.7%),"
		C. tropicalis (30.5%) and C. parapsilosis (20%). The antifungal susceptibility
		profiles did not differ from expected results for each species and did not change
		significantly over time. DISCUSSION: Fungemia remain frequent hospital infections
		associated with high mortality in Mayotte. The vast majority of fungemia was due
		to Candida spp. Non-albicansCandida species reach half of the Candida isolates
		"with a high percentage of C. tropicalis. Surprisingly, no case of candidemia due"
		to C. glabrata were identified. The management of candidemia remains satisfactory
		and the treatment was adapted according to the international recommendations.
		"However, the high susceptibility of Candida spp. isolates to fluconazole may"
		invite to reconsider the use of this molecule as empirical and first-line
		treatment of candidemia in Mayotte.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Candidemia is a nosocomial infection of increasing importance,"
		associated with high morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study is to
		"describe the species distribution, risk factors, management and outcomes of"
		patients with candidemia. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study at Centro
		"Hospitalar Universitário de São João, Portugal, between January 2016 and December"
		2017. RESULTS: A total of 117 candidemia episodes (n=114 patients) were included.
		"Median age was 65 years, with an increased prevalence of older ages. Candida"
		"albicans (51.3%) was the most prevalent species, followed by C. glabrata (22.2%),"
		"C. parapsilosis (15.4%), C. tropicalis (4.3%) and C. lusitaniae (2.6%). Forty-two"
		patients (35.9%) did not receive antifungal drugs after diagnosis of candidemia.
		Echinocandins were used as first-line drug therapy in half of the treated
		patients (50.7%). The median EQUAL Candida Score was 6/17 (IQR 6-9) for patients
		without central venous catheter (CVC) and 11/20 (IQR 6-14) for patients with CVC.
		"The 30 days-mortality was 31,6% and was not significantly associated with the"
		timing of antifungal therapy and the EQUAL Candida Score. CONCLUSION: The
		"distribution of Candida species has changed in recent years, with an increase in"
		"the proportion of C. albicans and C. glabrata. Rapid diagnostic tests, empiric"
		antifungal therapy and source control are essential to improve the prognosis of
		patients with candidemia. More multicentric prospective studies are needed to
		evaluate the association of mortality with the timing of antifungal therapy or
		the EQUAL Candida Score.

AB	-	PURPOSE: To analyze trends in incidence and mortality of candidemia in intensive
		care units (ICUs) vs. non-ICU hospitalized patients and to determine risk factors
		for infection by specific species and for death. METHODS: Active hospital-based
		surveillance program of incident episodes of candidemia due to common species in
		"24 tertiary care hospitals in the Paris area, France between October 2002 and"
		"September 2010. RESULTS: Among 2,507 adult cases included, 2,571 Candida isolates"
		"were collected and species were C. albicans (56 %), C. glabrata (18.6 %), C."
		"parapsilosis (11.5 %), C. tropicalis (9.3 %), C. krusei (2.9 %), and C. kefyr"
		"(1.8 %). Candidemia occurred in ICU in 1,206 patients (48.1 %). When comparing"
		"ICU vs. non-ICU patients, the former had significantly more frequent surgery"
		"during the past 30 days, were more often preexposed to fluconazole and treated"
		"with echinocandin, and were less frequently infected with C. parapsilosis. Risk"
		factors and age remained unchanged during the study period. A significant
		increased incidence in the overall population and ICU was found. The odds of
		being infected with a given species in ICU was influenced by risk factors and
		preexposure to fluconazole and caspofungin. Echinocandins initial therapy
		"increased over time in ICU (4.6 % first year of study, to 48.5 % last year of"
		"study, p < 0.0001). ICU patients had a higher day-30 death rate than non-ICU"
		patients (odds ratio [OR] 2.12; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.66-2.72; p <
		0.0001). The day-30 and early (<day 8) death rates increased over time in ICU
		(from 41.5 % the first to 56.9 % the last year of study (p = 0.001) and 28.7-38.8
		"% (p = 0.0292), respectively). Independent risk factors for day-30 death in ICU"
		"were age, arterial catheter, Candida species, preexposure to caspofungin, and"
		lack of antifungal therapy at the time of blood cultures results (p < 0.05).
		CONCLUSIONS: The availability of new antifungals and the publication of numerous
		guidelines did not prevent an increase of candidemia and death in ICU patients in
		the Paris area.

AB	-	"OBJECTIVES: To determine the epidemiology of Candida bloodstream infections,"
		"variables influencing mortality, and antifungal resistance rates in ICUs in"
		"Spain. DESIGN: Prospective, observational, multicenter population-based study."
		SETTING: Medical and surgical ICUs in 29 hospitals distributed throughout five
		metropolitan areas of Spain. PATIENTS: Adult patients (≥ 18 yr) with an episode
		of Candida bloodstream infection during admission to any surveillance area ICU
		from May 2010 to April 2011. INTERVENTIONS: Candida isolates were sent to a
		reference laboratory for species identification by DNA sequencing and
		susceptibility testing using the methods and breakpoint criteria promulgated by
		the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing. Prognostic
		factors associated with early (0-7 d) and late (8-30 d) mortality were analyzed
		using logistic regression modeling. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We detected
		"773 cases of candidemia, 752 of which were included in the overall cohort. Among"
		"these, 168 (22.3%) occurred in adult ICU patients. The rank order of Candida"
		"isolates was as follows: Candida albicans (52%), Candida parapsilosis (23.7%),"
		"Candida glabrata (12.7%), Candida tropicalis (5.8%), Candida krusei (4%), and"
		others (1.8%). Overall susceptibility to fluconazole was 79.2%. Cumulative
		mortality at 7 and 30 days after the first episode of candidemia was 16.5% and
		"47%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that early appropriate antifungal"
		"treatment and catheter removal (odds ratio, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.08-0.91), Acute"
		"Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (odds ratio, 1.11; 95% CI,"
		"1.04-1.19), and abdominal source (odds ratio, 8.15; 95% CI, 1.75-37.93) were"
		independently associated with early mortality. Determinants of late mortality
		"were age (odds ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.07), intubation (odds ratio, 7.24; 95%"
		"CI, 2.24-23.40), renal replacement therapy (odds ratio, 6.12; 95% CI,"
		"2.24-16.73), and primary source (odds ratio, 2.51; 95% CI, 1.06-5.95)."
		CONCLUSIONS: Candidemia in ICU patients is caused by non-albicans species in 48%
		"of cases, C. parapsilosis being the most common among these. Overall mortality"
		remains high and mainly related with host factors. Prompt adequate antifungal
		treatment and catheter removal could be critical to decrease early mortality.

PG	-	649-655
LID	-	10.1007/s10096-016-2841-3 [doi]
AB	-	The primary aim of this study was to collect national epidemiological data on
		candidaemia and to determine the reporting time of species identification and
		antifungal susceptibility in clinical practice. During a 1-year period (March
		"2013 until February 2014), every first Candida isolate from each episode of"
		candidaemia was included prospectively from 30 Belgian hospitals. Identification
		and susceptibility testing were performed according to local procedures and
		isolates were sent to the National Reference Center for Mycosis. Species
		identification was checked by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation
		time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and internal transcribed spacer
		(ITS) sequencing in case no reliable identification was obtained by MALDI-TOF MS.
		Antifungal susceptibility testing was performed according to the European
		Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) methodology. A total
		of 355 isolates were retrieved from 338 patients. The mean incidence rate of
		candidaemia was 0.44 (range: 0.07 to 1.43) per 1000 admissions or 0.65 (range:
		"0.11 to 2.00) per 10,000 patient days. Candida albicans was most frequently found"
		"(50.4 %), followed by C. glabrata (27.3 %) and C. parapsilosis sensu lato"
		"(9.8 %). The overall resistance to fluconazole was 7.6 %, ranging from 3.9 % in"
		C. albicans to 20.0 % in C. tropicalis. Only one C. glabrata isolate was
		"resistant to the echinocandins. Four days after blood culture positivity, 99.7 %"
		of the identifications and 90.3 % of the antifungal profiles were reported to the
		treating clinician. Candidaemia incidence rates differed up to 20-fold among
		Belgian hospitals; no clear factors explaining this difference were identified.
		The overall antifungal resistance rates were low but high azole resistance rates
		were recorded in C. tropicalis.

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To identify the epidemiology and antifungal susceptibilities of
		Candida spp. among blood culture isolates to identify the epidemiology and
		antifungal susceptibilities of Candida spp. among blood culture isolates in
		"Sweden. METHODS: The study was a retrospective, observational nationwide"
		laboratory-based surveillance for fungaemia and fungal meningitis and was
		"conducted from September 2015 to August 2016. RESULTS: In total, 488 Candida"
		blood culture isolates were obtained from 471 patients (58% males). Compared to
		"our previous study, the incidence of candidaemia has increased from 4.2/100 000"
		(2005-2006) to 4.7/100 000 population/year (2015-2016). The three most common
		"Candida spp. isolated from blood cultures were Candida albicans (54.7%), Candida"
		glabrata (19.7%) and species in the Candida parapsilosis complex (9.4%). Candida
		"resistance to fluconazole was 2% in C. albicans and between 0% and 100%, in"
		non-albicans species other than C. glabrata and C. krusei. Resistance to
		"voriconazole was rare, except for C. glabrata, C. krusei and C. tropicalis."
		Resistance to anidulafungin was 3.8% while no Candida isolate was resistant to
		amphotericin B. CONCLUSIONS: We report an overall increase in candidaemia but a
		minor decrease of C. albicans while C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis remain
		constant over this 10-year period.

TI	-	Prevalence and antifungal resistance profile of Candida spp. oral isolates from
		patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG	-	549-55

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: The goal of the study was to measure the prevalence of Candida spp. in
		the oral cavity of patients with diabetes types 1 and 2 when compared to healthy
		individuals and to study antifungal resistance profile of the isolates. DESIGN:
		There were 162 subjects in the study: diabetes type 1 (n=39); control group 1
		"(n=50): healthy individuals matched in gender, age, and oral conditions to"
		diabetes type 1 patients; diabetes type 2 (n=37); control group 2 (n=36) who were
		matched to each patient of the diabetes type 2 group. Stimulated saliva was
		collected and isolates were identified with phenotypic tests. The presence of C.
		dubliniensis was determined by multiplex PCR. RESULTS: There were no
		statistically significant differences in Candida spp. frequency between the
		diabetes 1 group and its control (p=0.443) nor between the diabetes 2 group and
		its control (p=0.429). C. albicans was the most frequently isolated yeast in all
		"groups. In the diabetes groups, C. stellatoidea, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis,"
		"C. lipolytica, C. glabrata, and C. krusei were also identified. Additionally, in"
		"control groups, C. kefyr was also detected. None of the isolates were resistant"
		to amphotericin B and flucytosine. A low percentage of the isolates were
		resistant to ketoconazole. CONCLUSIONS: No differences were detected in
		colonization of Candida spp. oral isolates from type 1 and type 2 diabetes when
		compared to matched controls. The antifungal resistance of Candida spp. isolates
		for ketoconazole from type 1 diabetes patients was significantly higher than that
		of its matched control.

LID	-	10.1016/j.jmii.2013.11.002 [doi]
AB	-	"PURPOSE: Candidemia is an important issue of nosocomial bloodstream infections,"
		"and is associated with a high mortality rate. However, little information is"
		"available before final species identification, which takes days after the episode"
		of candidemia. This study tried to determine whether time to positivity (TTP) for
		yeast helps in predicting the species of candidemia. METHODS: A retrospective
		"cohort study was conducted in Taiwan, which included 434 episodes of"
		nonduplicated candidemia during the period between 2006 and 2009. The demographic
		"features, clinical characteristics, TTP for yeast, and acute illness scores were"
		included for analysis. RESULTS: The mean age of patients with candidemia was 70.4
		"± 15.2 years, and the 30-day crude mortality rate was 48.2%. Forty-five percent"
		of patients suffered from shock status with a mean Acute Physiological and
		Chronic Health Evaluation II score of 27.0 ± 8.7 and a mean Sequential Organ
		"Failure Assessment score of 9.7 ± 4.5, whereas 50% were admitted to the intensive"
		care units. Candida albicans was still the most commonly identified pathogen
		"(58.1%), followed by C. tropicalis (14.7%), C. parapsilosis (13.1%), and C."
		glabrata (8.3%). Results of multivariate logistic regression showed that TTP for
		"yeast within 48 hours would more favor C. tropicalis (p = 0.044), and less favor"
		C. glabrata (p = 0.025) and C. parapsilosis (p < 0.001). Patients with parenteral
		nutrition usage were more frequently associated with a TTP for yeast within 48
		"hours, whereas those with previous exposure to an antifungal agent had a longer"
		TTP for yeast. CONCLUSION: The TTP for yeast might provide a hint of the
		responsible Candida species before final identification among critical patients
		with candidemia. The association between antifungal agents and TTP would need
		more evidence for elucidation.

TI	-	Intra-abdominal candidiasis in surgical intensive care unit - epidemiology
		characteristics and trends.
PG	-	57-63
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: Intra-abdominal candidiasis (IAC) is an invasive fungal infection
		representing the most common type of invasive Candida infection in surgical
		"intensive care units (ICUs). Recently, decreased antifungal susceptibility and"
		progressive shift in the aetiology of invasive candidiasis has been observed
		worldwide. We explored IAC epidemiology in surgical ICU. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We
		retrospectively reviewed the records of 64 patients with IAC admitted at our
		"surgical ICU over a 4-year period (2013-2016). IAC incidence, microbiological"
		"results, antifungal therapy, and mortality were analysed. RESULTS: The cumulative"
		IAC incidence was 18.4 cases per 1000 admissions (2013: 12.6; 2014: 17.7; 2015:
		"16.8; 2016: 24.5), including hospital-acquired IAC incidence (2013: 9.8; 2014:"
		13.3; 2015 10.1; 2016: 13.3) and community-acquired IAC incidence (2013: 2.8;
		2014: 4.4; 2015: 6.7; 2016: 11.2). Candida albicans represented the most common
		"species (n = 35, 50.0%) followed by Candida glabrata (n = 15, 21.4%), Candida"
		"tropicalis (n = 6, 8.6%) and other yeasts (each &lt; 5.0%). Incidence rate of C."
		albicans (2013: 7(78%); 2014: 10(59%); 2015: 6(35%); 2016: 12(44%)) and incidence
		rate of C. non-albicans (2013: 2(22%); 2014: 7(41%); 2015: 9(53%); 2016: 14(52%))
		"were different in trend. All fungal isolates were susceptible to echinocandins,"
		"amphotericin B and voriconazole. Regarding fluconazole susceptibility, C. krusei"
		(n = 3) was resistant and C. glabrata (n = 9) was susceptible-dose dependent
		(SDD). The ratio of SDD C. glabrata isolates to all isolated C. glabrata strains
		was 9/15 (60%) (2013: 0/2; 2014: 0/2; 2015: 1/3; 2016: 8/8). Decreased
		fluconazole susceptibility for C. glabrata isolates was reported in both
		community-acquired IAC (n = 3) and hospital-acquired IAC (n = 6). Overall 30-day
		mortality rate was 25.0% (16/64). CONCLUSIONS: We have revealed slowly raising of
		"overall IAC incidence, more increasing trend in incidence of community-acquired"
		IAC compared to rather steady incidence of hospital-acquired IAC. During period
		2013-2016 we have observed a significant shift in the aetiology of IAC towards an
		"increased proportion of non-albicans Candida species, particularly C. glabrata."
		Acquired decreased fluconazole susceptibility was related to C. glabrata isolates
		exclusively. Emergence of decreased antifungal susceptibility has been preceded
		by increase of non-albicans Candida isolates.

TI	-	Etiology of invasive candidosis agents in Russia: a multicenter epidemiological
		survey.
PG	-	84-91
LID	-	10.1007/s11684-017-0612-x [doi]
AB	-	A multicenter prospective epidemiological survey on the etiologic agents of
		invasive candidosis was conducted in Russia in the period of 2012-2014. Samples
		were collected from 284 patients with invasive candidosis and Candida species
		isolated by culture. The species were identified by DNA sequencing and MALDI-TOF
		"massspectrometry. A total of 322 isolates were recovered, in which 96% of Сandida"
		"species belonged to six major species, namely, C. albicans (43.2%), C."
		"parapsilosis (20.2%), C. glabrata (11.5%), C. tropicalis (9.6%), C. krusei"
		"(6.2%), and C. guilliermondii (5.3%). Most Candida species were isolated from"
		"blood samples (83.23%). Notably, the prevalence rate of C. albicans reduced from"
		52.38% to 32.79% (2012 vs. 2014) (P = 0.01) whereas that of non-C. albicans
		increased from 47.62% (2012) to 67.21% (2014) (P < 0.01). Species distribution
		"differed among geographical regions; specifically, the prevalence rate of C."
		albicans as an etiologic agent of invasive candidosis in Siberian Federal region
		was significantly higher than that in other Federal regions. Results indicated a
		"shift from C. albicans to non-C. albicans. Therefore, a detailed investigation on"
		the contributing factors and appropriate treatment of invasive candidosis is
		needed.

TI	-	Prolonged Outbreak of Candida krusei Candidemia in Paediatric Ward of Tertiary
		Care Hospital.
PG	-	257-268
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-020-00427-y [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: A sudden rise of Candida krusei candidemia cases was noticed in our
		hospital within 1 year with maximum cases from paediatric unit. The present study
		reports the results of epidemiological investigation of possible outbreak of
		candidemia by C. krusei in paediatric unit at our tertiary care centre. METHODS:
		Clinical characteristics and risk factors associated with C. krusei candidemia
		were evaluated. Yeast identification and antifungal susceptibility testing was
		performed according to standard protocol. To find the potential source of C.
		"krusei in hospital environment and hand colonization, swabs were collected from"
		"different fomites (n = 40) and hand washings from 24 health care workers (HCW),"
		respectively. Infection control and prevention practices were intensified
		following the recognition of outbreak. Genetic typing was done by fluorescent
		amplified fragment length polymorphism (FAFLP) technique. Case-control comparison
		was performed with C. tropicalis and C. pelliculosa cases. RESULTS: Candida
		"krusei fungaemia significantly affected paediatric group (82/186, 44%) as"
		"compared to adults (14/130, 10.8%; p < 0.001). Among paediatric group, maximum"
		isolation was reported from neonatal unit of paediatric emergency (NUPE). C.
		krusei was isolated from hands of one HCW and washbasin in NUPE. FAFLP revealed
		clonality between blood and environmental isolates indicating cross-transmission
		"of C. krusei. Gastrointestinal disease (p = 0.018), previous antibiotics"
		"(p = 0.021) especially to carbapenems (p = 0.039), was significant among C."
		krusei candidemia cases compared to C. pelliculosa cases. CONCLUSION: We report
		the largest outbreak of C. krusei candidemia in paediatric unit within 1 year
		with isolation of related strains from environment and hands of HCW. Routine
		screening of hand hygiene practices revealed non-compliance to standard practices
		leading to the increase in C. krusei candidemia cases.

		tropicalis candidaemia: A retrospective cohort study.
PG	-	473-480
LID	-	10.1111/myc.13429 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candida tropicalis is the most common non-albicans Candida species
		"found in Asia-Pacific countries, including Thailand. The pathogen is known for"
		"its great virulence, which causes a high case-fatality rate. Associations between"
		"case fatality and patient characteristics, infectious disease unit consultation"
		and EQUAL Candida score were investigated. METHODS: This retrospective cohort
		study was conducted with 160 cases of C. tropicalis bloodstream infection between
		"2015 and 2019 at a single, large, tertiary centre in Thailand. Clinical"
		"characteristics, clinical presentations, patient outcomes (30-day case-fatality"
		rate) and independent predictive factors were analysed. RESULTS: The 30-day
		case-fatality rate was 68.1%. The median of the EQUAL Candida score was 8.
		Independent factors for the prediction of case fatality were septic shock (hazard
		"ratio, 1.84), the use of mechanical ventilation (hazard ratio, 2.03) and the"
		"EQUAL Candida score (hazard ratio, 0.75). CONCLUSIONS: The predictive factors for"
		"30-day case fatality were septic shock, mechanical ventilation use and the EQUAL"
		Candida score. It is recommended that the EQUAL score be considered for patients
		infected with C. tropicalis candidaemia to reduce the case-fatality rate.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Different yeast species have different susceptibilities to commonly
		"prescribed antifungal drugs. Thus, it is important to accurately determine the"
		"species of pathogenic yeasts, especially when more than one species are in a"
		specimen. METHODS: Clinically significant yeast isolates were collected via the
		Taiwan Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance of Yeasts from July to September
		in 2010. The identifications of isolates were assessed in the core laboratory at
		"the National Health Research Institutes. RESULTS: Of the 1127 isolates recovered,"
		"1088 were of Candida genus, accounting for 96.53% of the total isolates, followed"
		"by Cryptococcus (15, 1.33%), Trichosporon (12, 1.06%), Kodamaea (4, 0.35%),"
		"Pichia (4, 0.35%), and three others. In all, 38 out of 1116 (3.4%) specimens had"
		"mixed yeast cultures. One ascites specimen had three species, Candida albicans,"
		"Candida glabrata, and Candida tropicalis. In the remaining 37 specimens, 16 had a"
		"combination of C. albicans and C. glabrata, eight C. albicans and C. tropicalis,"
		"five C. glabrata and C. tropicalis, three Candida krusei and C. tropicalis, and"
		five with different combinations. CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of cultures
		"with mixed yeasts may be an emerging issue. Thus, to determine mixed yeast"
		"cultures in the same specimen, we highly recommend CHROMagar Candida medium to"
		culture yeast isolates directly from the specimen.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: The outcomes of deep-seated abscesses attributed to chronic
		disseminated candidiasis (CDC) in patients with hematological malignancies have
		rarely been reported in recent years. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed and
		analyzed the data of patients with hematological malignancies who received a
		diagnosis of CDC at a medical center in Taiwan between 2008 and 2013. RESULTS:
		Sixty-one patients (32 men and 29 women) were diagnosed with CDC. The median age
		was 51 years (range: 18-83). The overall incidence of CDC was 1.53 per 100
		patient-years in patients with hematological malignancies between 2008 and 2013.
		The highest incidence of CDC was 4.3 per 100 patient-years for acute
		"lymphoblastic leukemia, followed by 3.6 for acute myeloid leukemia. We detected 3"
		"(4.9%) proven, 13 (21.3%) probable, and 45 (73.8%) possible cases of CDC. A total"
		of 13 patients had positive blood cultures for Candida species: C. tropicalis
		"(8), C. albicans (2), C. glabrata (2), and C. famata (1). The median duration of"
		antifungal treatment was 96 days (range: 7-796 days). Serial imaging studies
		revealed that the resolution rate of CDC was 30.0% at 3 months and 54.3% at
		6 months. Five patients (8.2%) had residual lesions that persisted beyond one
		year. A multivariate analysis of the 90-day outcome revealed that shock was the
		only independent prognostic factor of 90-day survival in patients with CDC.
		CONCLUSION: The incidence of CDC did not decrease between 2008 and 2013. Patients
		with acute leukemia had a higher risk of CDC than those with other hematological
		malignancies. Imaging studies conducted at 6 months after diagnosis revealed that
		only half of the patients showed complete resolution. CDC requires prolonged
		"treatment, and serial imaging at 6 months interval is suggested. Shock is the"
		only independent prognostic factor of 90-day survival in patients with CDC.

AB	-	"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the epidemiological, clinical and"
		mycological characteristics of invasive candidiasis (IC) in China. METHODS: A
		ten-year retrospective study including 183 IC episodes was conducted in a
		"tertiary hospital in Beijing, China. RESULTS: The overall incidence of IC from"
		"2010-2019 was 0.261 episodes per 1,000 discharges. Candidemia (71.0%) was the"
		major infective pattern; 70.3% of the patients tested positive for Candida spp.
		colonization before IC and the median time to develop an invasive infection after
		colonization was 13.5 days (interquartile range: 4.5-37.0 days). Candida albicans
		"(45.8%) was the most prevalent species, followed by Candida parapsilosis (19.5%),"
		Candida glabrata (14.2%) and Candida tropicalis (13.7%). C. non- albicans IC was
		"more common in patients with severe anemia ( P = 0.018), long-term"
		"hospitalization ( P = 0.015), hematologic malignancies ( P = 0.002), continuous"
		administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics ( P < 0.001) and mechanical
		ventilation ( P = 0.012). In vitro resistance testing showed that 11.0% of the
		"Candida isolates were resistant/non-wild type (non-WT) to fluconazole, followed"
		"by voriconazole (9.6%), micafungin (3.8%), and caspofungin (2.9%). Fluconazole"
		was the most commonly used drug to initiate antifungal therapy both before and
		"after the proven diagnosis (52.6% and 54.6%, respectively). The 30-day and 90-day"
		"all-cause mortality rates were 24.5% and 32.7%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The"
		incidence of IC has declined in the recent five years. C. non- albicans
		contributed to more than half of the IC cases. Fluconazole can be used as
		"first-line therapy if resistant strains are not prevalent. Prospective,"
		multi-center surveillance of the clinical and mycological characteristics of IC
		is required.

AB	-	Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC) is a major health problem for sexually
		active women because of its severe effect on their quality of life. A thorough
		"knowledge of their epidemiology leads to their efficient management. Therefore, a"
		cross-sectional study was conducted in 2014 in women with leucorrhoea associated
		or not with other clinical signs. Recurrence was based on the occurrence of at
		least four annual episodes of Candida vulvo-vaginitis. An individual interview
		based on a questionnaire was conducted to identify the socio-demographic
		parameters that could be associated with the RVVC. Vaginal samples were collected
		at the obstetrical gynaecology department of the University Hospital of Cocody
		"and at the Pasteur Institute of Côte d'Ivoire. On each sample, a direct"
		examination and culture on Sabouraud-chloramphenicol medium with or without
		actidione were performed. Yeast identification was performed using chromogenic
		media (CandiSelect(®)4 [Bio-Rad]) and the study of sugar assimilation using the
		Auxacolor(®) 2 gallery (Bio-Rad). A total of 400 patients were included. The
		"average age was 29.2 years (SD=7.2 years). Of these, 94 had recurrent"
		"vulvovaginal candidiasis, with a prevalence of 23.5% (CI(95%): 19.49-28.02). Five"
		"species of the genus Candida have been identified: Candida albicans (59.6%),"
		"Candida glabrata (19.1%), Candida tropicalis (16%), Candida krusei (4.2%) and"
		"Candida inconspicua (1.1%). Some factors such as education level, history of"
		"sexually transmitted infection, type of underwear used, frequency of personal"
		hygiene and type of product used for these hygiene have been associated with the
		occurrence of RVVCs. The occurrence of RVVCs is relatively high in our study
		population. Non-albicansCandida species occupy a significant place in this
		disease epidemiology. By addressing the factors associated with the occurrence
		"and/or persistence of RVVCs, it will be possible to reduce their incidence in"
		sexually active women.

		"centers of Shiraz, the largest city in southern Iran. Yeast isolates from blood"
		and other sterile body fluids were identified by matrix-assisted laser

		antifungal susceptibility testing (AFST) using the broth microdilution method.
		"Clinical data were retrieved from patients' medical records. In total, 113 yeast"
		"isolates were recovered from 109 patients, over 60% of whom received fluconazole."
		Antifungal drugs were prescribed without considering species identification or
		AFST. The all-cause mortality rate was 28%. Almost 30% of the patients were from
		intensive care units (ICUs). Candida albicans (56/113; 49.5%) was the most
		"prevalent species followed by C. glabrata (26/113; 23%), C. parapsilosis (13/113;"
		"11.5%), C. tropicalis (7/113; 6.2%), and C. dubliniensis (5/113; 4.4%). Only five"
		isolates showed antifungal resistance or decreased susceptibility to fluconazole:
		"one C. orthopsilosis isolate from an azole-naïve patient and two C. glabrata, one"
		"C. albicans, and one C. dubliniensis isolates from patients treated with azoles,"
		who developed therapeutic failure against azoles later. Our results revealed a
		low level of antifungal resistance but a notable rate of azole therapeutic
		"failure among patients with candidemia due to non-albicans Candida species, which"
		"threaten the efficacy of fluconazole, the most widely used antifungal in southern"
		regions of Iran. Candidemia studies should not be confined to ICUs and treatment
		should be administered based on species identification and AFST results.

		"extensively explored the epidemiology of candidemia. However, candidemia data"
		"from the other regions are notoriously scarce, which precludes from reaching a"
		"consensus regarding species distribution, the burden of antifungal resistance,"
		"and the clinical features of infected patients. Therefore, we conducted the"
		"current prospective candidemia study in Shiraz, one of the largest cities located"
		"in the south of Iran, from April 2016 to April 2018. More than 63% of the"
		candidemia infections were treated by fluconazole and species identification and
		antifungal susceptibility testing were not used for decision making regarding the
		choice of antifungal treatment. Approximately 70% of the candidemia cases
		"occurred in the wards outside of the ICUs. Candida albicans, C. glabrata, C."
		"parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, and C. dubliniensis were the five leading causative"
		agents of candidemia. Antifungal resistance was rare and fluconazole resistance
		"and/or non-wild type phenotypes were noticed in five isolates, only one was C."
		"albicans and the rest were non-albicans Candida (NAC) species, including C."
		"glabrata, C. dubliniensis, and C. orthopsilosis. Except for C. orthopsilosis,"
		"which was isolated from an azole-naïve patient, the rest of isolates were"
		recovered from patients treated with azoles and all showed therapeutic failure to
		"azoles. Collectively, our data will complete the candidemia picture in Iran and"
		"show that, although the level of resistance was rare, the therapeutic failure was"
		"notable among NAC species, which threatens the efficacy of fluconazole, the most"
		"widely used antifungal in Southern regions of Iran. Moreover, we showed that"
		candidemia is poorly managed in Iran since species identification tools along
		with antifungal susceptibility testing were not used to select appropriate
		antifungal treatment.

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: Due to the increase in isolation of Candida spp. in critically ill
		"patients, and the high mortality and economic costs which this infection entails,"
		a study was made of the risk factors associated to candidemia in critically ill
		patients from 7 intensive care units in Colombia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A
		multicenter matched case-control study was conducted in 7 intensive care units of
		3 university hospitals. Data on overall length of hospital stay (including both
		general wards and the intensive care unit) were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 243
		subjects (81 cases and 162 controls) between January 2008 and December 2012 were
		"included. In order of frequency, C. albicans, C. tropicalis and C. parapsilosis"
		were isolated. The main identified risk factors were: overall length of hospital
		"stay>25 days (OR 5.33, 95% CI 2.6-10.9), use of meropenem (OR 3.75, 95% CI"
		"1.86-7.5), abdominal surgery (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.39-6.06) and hemodialysis (OR"
		"3.35, 95% CI 1.5-7.7). No differences in mortality between patients with"
		"candidemia and controls were found (39.5 vs. 36.5%, respectively, P=.66) were"
		"found. CONCLUSIONS: In Colombia, a long hospital stay, abdominal surgery, the use"
		of meropenem and hemodialysis were identified as risk factors for candidemia.

PG	-	561-4
LID	-	10.1016/j.burns.2008.05.028 [doi]
AB	-	AIM: To evaluate the diversity and antifungal susceptibilities of Candida
		"isolates from wounds and blood of burn victims, and the associated mortality"
		rates compared with those of controls without candidaemia. METHODS: We performed
		a nested case-control study within a database of clinical data for all patients
		admitted to our burn unit from January 2001 to December 2005. Each candidaemic
		patient was compared with two matched controls. Bloodstream cultures were
		"performed if the core temperature was >39 degrees C, and three sites were"
		"cultured weekly for fungal identification (burn wound, pharynx, urinary tract)."
		RESULTS: At least one episode of candidaemia was diagnosed among 20 of 851
		persons admitted during the study period. Isolates in bloodstream infection were
		"Candida albicans (65%), C. parapsilosis (25%) and C. tropicalis (10%). The median"
		time between admission and onset of candidaemia was greater with C. albicans
		infection (42.6+/-31 days) than with infection by other yeasts (18+/-12 days).
		Candidaemia was associated with more extensive burn and longer duration of
		"hospital stay but with similar mortality, compared with controls. CONCLUSION:"
		Candidaemia in burn cases is mostly due to fluconazole-susceptible C. albicans
		and is not associated with increased mortality.

LID	-	10.1111/1469-0691.12380 [doi]
AB	-	"A prospective, multicentre, population-based surveillance programme for Candida"
		bloodstream infections was implemented in five metropolitan areas of Spain to
		"determine its incidence and the prevalence of antifungal resistance, and to"
		"identify predictors of death. Between May 2010 and April 2011, Candida isolates"
		were centralized to a reference laboratory for species identification by DNA
		sequencing and for susceptibility testing by EUCAST reference procedure.
		Prognostic factors associated with early (0-7 days) and late (8-30 days) death
		were analysed using logistic regression modelling. We detected 773 episodes:
		"annual incidence of 8.1 cases/100 000 inhabitants, 0.89/1000 admissions and"
		1.36/10 000 patient-days. Highest incidence was found in infants younger than 1
		year (96.4/100 000 inhabitants). Candida albicans was the predominant species
		"(45.4%), followed by Candida parapsilosis (24.9%), Candida glabrata (13.4%) and"
		"Candida tropicalis (7.7%). Overall, 79% of Candida isolates were susceptible to"
		fluconazole. Cumulative mortality at 7 and 30 days after the first episode of
		"candidaemia was 12.8% and 30.6%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that"
		therapeutic measures within the first 48 h may improve early mortality:
		"antifungal treatment (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27-0.95) and central venous catheter"
		"removal (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.21-0.87). Predictors of late death included host"
		"factors (e.g. patients' comorbid status and signs of organ dysfunction), primary"
		"source (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.03-2.61), and severe sepsis or septic shock (OR 1.77,"
		"95% CI 1.05-3.00). In Spain, the proportion of Candida isolates non-susceptible"
		to fluconazole is higher than in previous reports. Early mortality may be
		improved with strict adherence to guidelines.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Bloodstream infections due to Candida species cause significant
		"morbidity and mortality, and the epidemiology of Candida infection is changing."
		Surveillance for candidemia is necessary to detect trends in species distribution
		and antifungal resistance. METHODS: The medical and electronic records of all
		patients who had candidemia at the authors' hospital from 2009 to 2011 were
		"reviewed for demographic data and clinical information, including the infecting"
		"Candida species, resistance to antifungals and survival, and the presence of risk"
		factors associated with candidemia. RESULTS: A total of 133 distinct episodes of
		candidemia were identified over the study period. The annual incidence of
		candidemia ranged between 0.71 and 0.85 cases/1000 hospital discharges. The most
		"frequent Candida species were C. tropicalis (28.6%), followed by C. albicans"
		(23.3%) and C. parapsilosis (19.5%). The rates of susceptibility to antifungal
		"agents were as followed: voriconazole (97.8%), itraconazole (69.5%), fluconazole"
		"(46.1%), ketoconazole (38.9%). Out of 131 evaluable patients, 34 (26.0%) died"
		within 30 days from the onset of candidemia. C. tropicalis candidemia was
		associated with the highest mortality rate (44.7%). Regarding the crude mortality
		"in the different units, patients in Hemato-Oncology ward had the highest"
		"mortality rate (66.7%), followed by patients in cardiovascular wards and ICU"
		"(57.1% and 25.6%, respectively). Predictors of 30-day mortality were identified"
		"by uni- and multivariate analyses. Complicated abdominal surgery, presence of"
		"central venous catheter (CVC), neutropenia, candidemia due to C. tropicalis and"
		poor treatment with fluconazole were significantly associated with the 30-day
		mortality. Presence of CVC (odds ratio[OR] = 4.177; 95% confidence interval
		[CI] = 1.698 to 10.278; P = 0.002) was the only independent predictor for
		mortality in the multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: This report provides baseline
		data for future epidemiological and susceptibility studies and for the mortality
		rates associated with candidemia in our hospital. The knowledge of the local
		epidemiological trends in Candida species isolated in blood cultures is important
		to guide therapeutic choices.

AB	-	PURPOSE: To assess the risk factors and outcomes associated with fungemia caused
		by the six most commonly occurring Candida species in patients with and without
		malignancies. METHODS: Analysis of the episodes of fungemia due to common Candida
		"species in adults, based on an active hospital-based surveillance program (Paris"
		"area, France, 2002 to 2014). RESULTS: Of the 3417 patients (3666 isolates), 1164"
		(34.1%) had a solid tumor (45.7% digestive tract) and 586 (17.1%) a hematological
		"malignancy (41.8% lymphoma, 33.5% acute leukemia). The hematology patients were"
		"significantly younger, more often pre-exposed to antifungals, more often infected"
		"by C. tropicalis, C. krusei, or C. kefyr, and more often treated in the first"
		instance with an echinocandin. Compared with inpatients who were not in ICU at
		"the time of fungemia, those in ICU were less frequently infected by"
		"C. parapsilosis (p < 0.02), had more recent surgery (p < 0.03), and died more"
		frequently before day 8 and day 30 (p < 0.0001). An increase in crude mortality
		over time in ICU was observed only in oncology patients (p < 0.04). For all
		"patients, lack of prescription of antifungals despite knowledge of positive blood"
		culture increased the risk of death. The odds of being infected by a given
		"Candida species compared with C. albicans were uneven regarding age, gender, type"
		"of malignancy, hospitalization in ICU, central venous catheter, HIV status,"
		"intravenous drug addiction, and previous exposure to antifungal drugs. Compared"
		"with C. albicans, C. glabrata (OR = 0.69 [0.54-0.89]) and C. parapsilosis"
		(OR = 0.49 [0.35-0.67]) were associated with a decreased risk of death by day 8
		and day 30. CONCLUSION: The clinical context of underlying malignancy and
		hospitalization in ICU may be relevant to the initial management of candidemia.

		Asia-Pacific region.
PG	-	471-7
LID	-	10.1093/mmy/myv114 [doi]
AB	-	Bloodstream infections caused by Candida species are of increasing importance and
		associated with significant mortality. We performed a multi-centre prospective
		observational study to identify the species and antifungal susceptibilities of
		invasive bloodstream isolates of Candida species in the Asia-Pacific region. The
		"study was carried out over a two year period, involving 13 centers from Brunei,"
		"Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam."
		"Identification of Candida species was performed at each study center, and"
		reconfirmed at a central laboratory. Susceptibility testing was performed using a
		"commercial broth dilution panel (Sensititre YeastOne YST-010, Thermofisher,"
		"United Kingdom) with susceptibility categorisation (S = susceptible, S-DD ="
		susceptible dose-dependent) applied using breakpoints from the Clinical
		Laboratory Standards Institute. Eight hundred and sixty-one Candida isolates were
		"included in the study. The most common species were C. albicans (35.9%),"
		"C. tropicalis (30.7%), C. parapsilosis (15.7%), and C. glabrata (13.6%)."
		Non-albicans species exceeded C. albicans species in centers from all countries
		except Taiwan. Fluconazole susceptibility was almost universal for C. albicans
		"(S = 99.7%) but lower for C. tropicalis (S = 75.8%, S-DD = 6.1%), C. glabrata"
		"(S-DD = 94.9%), and C. parapsilosis (S = 94.8%). Echinocandins demonstrated high"
		"rates of in vitro susceptibility (S>99%) against C. albicans, C. tropicalis, and"
		C. parapsilosis This study demonstrates that non-albicans species are the most
		common isolates from bloodstream infections in most countries in the Asia-Pacific
		"region, with C. tropicalis as the predominant species. Because of the prevalence"
		"of reduced susceptibility to fluconazole in non-albicans species, the study"
		indicates that echinocandins should be the antifungal of choice in clinically
		unstable or high-risk patients with documented candidemia.

AB	-	"OBJECTIVES: To determine the oral candidal carriage (OCC), activity of virulent"
		factors and fluconazole susceptibility in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus
		(T2DM) and investigate their association with HbA1c measurements. MATERIALS AND
		METHODS: A cross sectional study was conducted on 100 diabetics and 100 healthy
		volunteers. The virulence was assessed by measuring the phospholipase activity
		and proteolysis index. Fluconazole susceptibility was performed using the
		"gradient diffusion method. The OCC, virulence factors and antifungal"
		susceptibility were correlated with patients' HbA1c measurements. RESULTS: The
		OCC and candidal density carriage was significantly higher in diabetics. Candida
		albicans (C. albicans) was the most frequently isolated species followed by
		"Candida tropicalis (C. tropicalis). Relatively uncommon species, Candida"
		lusitaniae (C. lusitaniae) and Candida lipolytica (C. lipolytica) were isolated
		"from the diabetics. Prevalence of virulence factor, proteinase, was greater in"
		diabetic group (p<0.05). Reduced fluconazole susceptibility was noted among the
		isolates from diabetics; however it was not statistically significant (p=0.593).
		"Except one, all the susceptible-dose dependent and resistant isolates were"
		Candida no-albicans (C. non-albicans). CONCLUSION: C. albicans remains the
		"predominant pathogen in diabetics, although other species are on the rise."
		"Compared to control group, the isolated species from T2DM group had higher"
		proteinase activity. Resistance to fluconazole was considerably greater among the
		C. non-albicans isolates from T2DM group. These findings warrant effective

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive candidiasis (IC) is the most common invasive fungal
		infection. The epidemiology of IC in hospitalized patients has been widely
		"investigated in many metropolitan cities; however, little information from medium"
		and small cities is known. METHODS: A 5-year retrospective study was carried out
		"to analyze the prevalence, species distribution, antifungal susceptibility, risk"
		factors and mortality of inpatients with invasive Candida infection in a regional
		tertiary teaching hospital in Southwest China. RESULTS: A total of 243 inpatients
		with invasive Candida infection during the five-year study period were
		"identified, with a mean annual incidence of 0.41 cases per 1000 admissions and a"
		"30-day mortality rate of 12.3%. The species distributions of Candida albicans,"
		"Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, Candida krusei, Candida parapsilosis and"
		"other Candida species was 45.3, 30.0, 15.2, 4.9, 2.1 and 2.5%, respectively. The"
		"total resistance rates of fluconazole (FCA), itraconazole (ITR) and voriconazole"
		"(VRC) were 18.6, 23.1 and 18.5%, respectively. Respiratory dysfunction, pulmonary"
		"infection, cardiovascular disease, chronic/acute renal failure, mechanical"
		"ventilation, abdominal surgery, intensive care in adults, septic shock and IC due"
		to C. albicans were associated with 30-day mortality (P < 0.05) according to the
		"univariate analyses. Respiratory dysfunction [odds ratio (OR), 9.80; 95%"
		"confidence interval (CI), 3.24-29.63; P < 0.001] and IC due to C. albicans (OR,"
		"3.35; 95% CI, 1.13-9.92; P = 0.029) were the independent predictors of 30-day"
		mortality. CONCLUSIONS: This report shows that the incidence and mortality rates
		are lower and that the resistance rates to azoles are higher in medium and small
		cities than in large cities and that the species distributions and risk factors
		in medium and small cities are different from those in large cities in China. It
		is necessary to conduct epidemiological surveillance in medium and small cities
		to provide reference data for the surveillance of inpatients with IC infections.

		exclusively identified in FLZ-resistant isolates. AFLP fingerprinting revealed
		five major and seven minor genotypes; genotype G4 was predominant in all centers.
		The increasing number of FLZ-R C. tropicalis blood isolates and acquiring FLZ-R

AB	-	BACKGROUND: We investigated the clinical characteristics and risk factors for
		mortality in adults with persistent candidemia. METHODS: All patients ≥18 years
		old with candidemia in two Korean tertiary hospitals from 2007 to 2014 were
		investigated. Persistent candidemia was defined as isolation of the same Candida
		species ≥5 days after initiation of antifungal therapy. Non-persistent candidemia
		was defined as candidemia persisting for ≤3 days after initiation of antifungal
		therapy. RESULTS: Candida tropicalis (29.2%) was the most common pathogen in
		"persistent candidemia, and Candida albicans (35.9%) was the most common in"
		"non-persistent candidemia. Central venous catheter (CVC) (OR, 1.99; 95% CI,"
		"1.05-3.78; P = 0.034), longer hospital stay (OR 1.01; 95% CI, 1.01-1.02;"
		"P = 0.025), and severe sepsis (OR 2.25; 95% CI, 1.11-4.56; P = 0.024) were"
		independent risk factors for persistent candidemia. C. tropicalis was
		"independently related to 30-day mortality (OR, 4.12; 95% CI, 1.27-13.36;"
		"P = 0.018), together with septic shock (OR, 5.81; 95% CI, 1.32-24.70; P = 0.017)"
		"and use of a corticosteroids (OR, 5.31; 95% CI, 1.07-26.29; P = 0.041) in"
		persistent candidemia. CONCLUSION: C. tropicalis is the predominant pathogen and
		cause of death in patients with persistent candidemia.

TI	-	Species-specific prevalence of vaginal candidiasis among patients with diabetes
		mellitus and its relation to their glycaemic status.
PG	-	162-6
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: Non- C. albicans Candida species are increasingly being recognized as
		the cause of vulvo-vaginal candidiasis. These species are often less susceptible
		to antifungal agents. Patients with diabetes mellitus are at risk for
		vulvo-vaginal candidasis. We assessed the species-specific prevalence rate and
		risk of candidiasis in patients with diabetes mellitus and healthy controls.
		"METHODS: Genital tract examination, direct microscopy and fungal cultures of"
		discharge collected by high vaginal swab were undertaken among 78 consecutive
		patients with diabetes mellitus (mean (+/-sd) age 32+/-12 years and body mass
		index (BMI) 22.3+/-5.5kg/m(2)) and 88 age- and BMI-matched healthy females.
		Glycaemic control in the diabetic cohort was assessed by measuring total
		glycosylated haemoglobin. RESULTS: Candida species were isolated in 36 of 78
		(46%) subjects with diabetes mellitus and in 21 of 88 (23%) healthy subjects
		"(Chi-squared 9.11, P=0.0025). The predominant Candida species isolated in"
		"diabetics with vulvo-vaginal candidiasis were Candida glabrata (39%), C. albicans"
		"(26%) and C. tropicalis (17%). In contrast, in the control group, C. albicans, C."
		"glabrata and C. hemulonii comprised 30% each, with none having C. tropicalis"
		"infection (for C. tropicalis: diabetic vs. control; 17% vs. nil, P=0. 05). Among"
		"the diabetic group, subjects with vulvo-vaginal candidiasis had significantly"
		higher mean HbA1 when compared to those who had no such infection (12.8+/-2.6%
		"vs. 9.7+/-1.7% respectively, P=0.001). The overall accuracy of direct microscopy"
		and clinical examination for predicting vulvo-vaginal candidiasis was only 77%
		"and 51%, respectively, in the diabetic group, and 83% and 65% in the control"
		group. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with diabetes mellitus had a high prevalence rate
		(46%) of vulvo-vaginal candidiasis with relative risk of 2.45. The non- C.
		albicans species such as C. glabrata and C. tropicalis were the predominant
		species isolated among them. There seems to be a significant link between
		hyperglycaemia and vulvo-vaginal candidiasis.

PG	-	983-991
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-020-00486-1 [doi]
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating
		autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system. Since immune system
		"plays a key role in this disease, patients with MS can present higher risk of"
		infections. PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of Candida
		spp. in the oral cavity of MS patients in relation to a control group METHODS: In
		"total, 100 individuals were selected: 55 diagnosed with MS and 45 healthy"
		individuals (control group). Saliva samples were collected and seeded in culture
		"media selecting for Candida. Following an incubation period of 48 h,"
		colony-forming units (CFU mL(-1)) were counted and colonies were isolated for
		Candida species identification by multiplex PCR. The results were analysed by
		chi-squared and Mann-Whitney U statistical tests considering a significance level
		of 5%. RESULTS: Candida spp. were confirmed in the oral cavity of 50.09% patients
		in the MS group and 35.55% individuals in the control group. In individuals
		"positive for the growth of Candida spp., the median values of Candida colonies"
		were 220 CFU mL(-1) for the MS group and 120 CFU mL(-1) for the control group.
		"However, no statistically significant differences were observed between groups"
		"for both prevalence and CFU mL(-1) count. Of the Candida species identified,"
		"73.91% were C. albicans, 21.73% C. glabrata, 2.17% C. tropicalis, and 2.17% C."
		krusei. CONCLUSIONS: The colonization of Candida spp. in the oral cavity of
		individuals with multiple sclerosis was higher than in the control group; however
		these findings were not proven to be statistically significant.

PG	-	814-820
LID	-	10.1097/INF.0000000000003161 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Neonatal candidemia leads to high morbidity and mortality in
		"developing countries. We studied the trends, spectrum and antifungal resistance"
		in neonatal candidemia isolates from the year 2014 to 2019. METHODS: This was a
		"cross-sectional study conducted at the Aga Khan University, Pakistan. Neonates"
		with positive blood cultures with Candida species were retrospectively identified
		from the laboratory database (2014-2018) and prospectively in 2019 where clinical
		information was also collected as part of routine laboratory reporting. RESULTS:
		We identified 669 neonates with Candida species in blood cultures. Three hundred
		forty-six neonates had early-onset disease (EOD age ≤7 days) and 323 had
		late-onset disease (LOD age >7 days). Non-albicans Candida species (86.7%) were
		predominant versus C. albicans (13.3%; P-value 0.024) with Candida tropicalis
		being most common in both EOD and LOD. Candida pelliculosa and Candida
		guilliermondii were associated with EOD and C. albicans with LOD. Isolation of
		fluconazole nonsusceptible non-albicans Candida species was significantly higher
		in early-onset (5.9%) versus late-onset (2%) neonatal candidemia (P-value 0.005;
		"crude odds ratio [COR] 2.73, 95% CI: 1.34-5.53). LOD in neonates was more likely"
		"associated with the use of vancomycin (COR 3.89, 95% CI: 1.39-10.89). EOD was"
		"more likely seen in patients with vaginal delivery (COR 4.16, 95% CI: 1.42-12.23)"
		and in neonates with respiratory distress leading to intensive care unit
		"admission (COR 3.31, 95% CI: 1.05-10.42). CONCLUSIONS: Non-albicans Candida"
		species were increasingly isolated from neonates with candidemia during recent
		years from Pakistan. Amphotericin remains first-line option for neonatal
		candidemia in our setting as fluconazole nonsusceptible Candida species are
		commonly isolated.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Vaginitis, an infection of the lower genital tract in women, is known"
		to be triggered by the overgrowth of the vagina's naturally occurring
		microorganisms. OBJECTIVE: This study looked at the prevalence of Candida spp.
		and age-related disparities amongst women presenting with vaginitis at the
		"Obstetrics and Gynaecology (O&G) clinic in a tertiary hospital in Port Harcourt,"
		Nigeria. METHODS: One hundred high vaginal swabs were collected from pregnant and
		non-pregnant women and examined microscopically and microbiologically. RESULTS:
		Age-group 20-29 years had the highest incidence of candidal vaginitis. There was
		a higher occurrence of yeast cells in pregnant than in non-pregnant participants
		while the non-pregnant women had a greater level of bacterial cells. Forty (40)
		of the samples contained yeasts of Candida species representing a 40% prevalence.
		Three species of Candida were identified with C. albicans dominating. Of the 40
		"samples positive for Candida spp., 30 (75.0%) were confirmed to be C. albicans."
		The remaining isolates were C. tropicalis (15.0%) and C. parapsilosis (10.0%).
		CONCLUSION: The findings in this study would play a role in the future management
		of Candida-induced vaginitis.

TI	-	Factors Influencing Non-albicans Candidemia: A Case-Case-Control Study.
PG	-	665-672
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-017-0146-4 [doi]
AB	-	The study identified factors predisposing to non-albicans candidemia with special
		"interest to prior antimicrobial treatment. A retrospective, case-case-control"
		"study was performed at the University Hospital of Heraklion, Greece, from"
		November 2007 through September 2011 including adult patients. The study had
		"three groups. The first included 58 patients with non-albicans candidemia, the"
		"second 48 with C. albicans candidemia, while the third (control) 104 without"
		candidemia. Each of the two candidemia groups was compared with the control using
		"multivariate logistic regression model. The mean (SD) age of the non-albicans,"
		"the albicans and the control patients was 67 (12), 67 (18) and 59 (19) years,"
		respectively. The most common non-albicans Candida spp. isolated were C.
		"parapsilosis in 19 patients (33%), C. glabrata in 17 (29%) and C. tropicalis in"
		15 (26%). Independent risk factors for non-albicans candidemia were prior
		"treatment with quinolones (p < 0.001), b-lactam-b-lactamase inhibitors"
		"(p = 0.011) and presence of central venous catheter (p = 0.05), while for C."
		"albicans candidemia were prior treatment with quinolones (p < 0.001), carbapenems"
		(p = 0.003) along with cardiac disease (p < 0.001). Neither duration of
		hospitalization nor in-hospital mortality [41% for the non-albicans vs 29% for C.
		albicans group (p = 0.192)] was significantly different between the two
		candidemia groups. The study reveals the role of antimicrobial exposure as a risk
		factor for candidemia caused by different species. Prior treatment with
		"b-lactam-b-lactamase inhibitors was associated with non-albicans, while with"
		carbapenems with C. albicans candidemia. Prior use of quinolones was associated
		with candidemia in general.

AB	-	Candidemia is one of the significant causes of mortality amongst critically ill
		patients in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). This study aimed to assess the
		"incidence, risk factors and antifungal susceptibility pattern in candidemia cases"
		"admitted in ICU in a tertiary care hospital in Jaipur, Rajasthan from June 2021"
		to November 2021. Candida species isolated from blood culture of clinically
		suspected patients of sepsis were defined as candidemia cases. Blood culture and
		antifungal susceptibility testing were performed as per standard laboratory
		protocol. Analyses of risk factors was done between candidemia cases and matched
		controls in a ratio of 1 : 3. Forty-six candidemic cases and 150 matched controls
		were included in the study. C. tropicalis was the most prevalent species (22/46;
		48%) followed by C. auris (8/46; 17%) and C. albicans (7/46; 15%). Candida
		species showed good sensitivity to echinocandins (97%) followed by amphotericin B
		"(87%) and voriconazole (80%). In multivariate analysis, longer stay in ICU,"
		"presence of an indwelling device, use of immunosuppressive drugs and positive"
		SARS-CoV-2 infection were associated with increased risk of candidemia. The
		constant evaluation of risk factors is required as prediction of risks associated
		with candidemia may help to guide targeted preventive measures with reduced
		morbidity and mortality.

LID	-	8453
AB	-	The invasion of pathogenic fungi poses nonnegligible threats to the human health
		and agricultural industry. This work exploited a family of hydroxyethyl
		naphthalimides as novel antifungal species with synergistic potential of chemical
		and dynamic treatment to combat the fungal resistance. These prepared
		naphthalimides showed better antifungal potency than fluconazole towards some
		"tested fungi including Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida tropicalis and Candida"
		"parapsilosis 22019. Especially, thioether benzimidazole derivative 7f with"
		excellent anti-Candida tropicalis efficacy (MIC = 4 μg/mL) possessed low
		"cytotoxicity, safe hemolysis level and less susceptibility to induce resistance."
		Biochemical interactions displayed that 7f could form a supramolecular complex
		"with DNA to block DNA replication, and constitute a biosupermolecule with"
		cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) from Candida tropicalis to hinder CPR biological
		"function. Additionally, 7f presented strong lipase affinity, which facilitated"
		"its permeation into cell membrane. Moreover, 7f with dynamic antifungal potency"
		promoted the production and accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in
		"cells, which destroyed the antioxidant defence system, led to oxidative stress"
		"with lipid peroxidation, loss of glutathione, membrane dysfunction and metabolic"
		"inactivation, and eventually caused cell death. The chemical and dynamic"
		antifungal synergistic effect initiated by hydroxyethyl naphthalimides was a
		reasonable treatment window for prospective development.

LID	-	e59373
AB	-	BACKGROUND: The epidemiology of candidemia varies depending on the geographic
		region. Little is known about the epidemiology of candidemia in Latin America.
		METHODS: We conducted a 24-month laboratory-based survey of candidemia in 20
		centers of seven Latin American countries. Incidence rates were calculated and
		the epidemiology of candidemia was characterized. RESULTS: Among 672 episodes of
		"candidemia, 297 (44.2%) occurred in children (23.7% younger than 1 year), 36.2%"
		in adults between 19 and 60 years old and 19.6% in elderly patients. The overall
		"incidence was 1.18 cases per 1,000 admissions, and varied across countries, with"
		the highest incidence in Colombia and the lowest in Chile. Candida albicans
		"(37.6%), C. parapsilosis (26.5%) and C. tropicalis (17.6%) were the leading"
		"agents, with great variability in species distribution in the different"
		"countries. Most isolates were highly susceptible to fluconazole, voriconazole,"
		amphotericin B and anidulafungin. Fluconazole was the most frequent agent used as
		"primary treatment (65.8%), and the overall 30-day survival was 59.3%."
		CONCLUSIONS: This first large epidemiologic study of candidemia in Latin America
		"showed a high incidence of candidemia, high percentage of children, typical"
		"species distribution, with C. albicans, C. parapsilosis and C. tropicalis"
		"accounting for the majority of episodes, and low resistance rates."

TI	-	Prevalence of candiduria in diabetic patients attending Gondar University
		"Hospital, Gondar, Ethiopia."
PG	-	102-7
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: About 10% to 15% of in-hospital urinary tract infections (UTIs) are
		"due to Candida species, and the prevalence is still increasing. A cross-sectional"
		study was conducted to determine fungal causative agents of UTI in asymptomatic
		and symptomatic diabetic patients and associated risk factors. MATERIALS AND
		"METHODS: Between May and June 2010, a total of 422 diabetic patients with"
		asymptomatic UTI (n = 387) and symptomatic UTI (n = 35) were investigated for UTI
		at Gondar University Hospital. Clean-catch midstream urine specimens were
		collected from each participant. Fungal urine culture and identification were
		done using standard microbiologic procedure. RESULTS: The age range of the
		"participants was 20 to 84 years (mean, 42.3 years). Significant candiduria was"
		"detected in 7.5% and 17.1% of asymptomatic and symptomatic diabetic patients,"
		respectively. The overall prevalence of significant candiduria in both groups was
		"8.3%. Candida species were isolated in 38 urine samples. Of these, 84.2% were"
		from the asymptomatic diabetic patients and the remaining 15.8% were from the
		"symptomatic patients. The most common species were C albicans (42.0%), C glabrata"
		"(34.2%), and C tropicalis (15.8%). Significant candiduria was strongly associated"
		with being female. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of candiduria in diabetic patients
		should not be neglected. Although C albicans is the organism most often
		"associated with serious fungal infection, other Candida species are also isolated"
		as clinically important opportunistic pathogens in type 2 diabetic patients.

TI	-	Ten-year review of invasive Candida infections in a tertiary care center in Saudi
		Arabia.
PG	-	821-6
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To review the epidemiology of invasive Candida infections in a single
		center in Saudi Arabia over a subsequent 10-year period. METHODS: This
		retrospective study was carried out in a single center in Saudi Arabia over a
		10-year period. Records of all patients with invasive Candida infections (ICI)
		over the period from January 2003 to December 2012 were reviewed. Mann-Whitney U
		test was used for comparison of Candida albicans (C. albicans) versus
		"non-albicans Candida species, and fluconazole resistance versus fluconazole"
		susceptible in relation to crude mortality at 30 days and 90 days. RESULTS: Eight
		"hundred positive sterile site cultures, associated with 652 ICI were identified."
		Median age was 52 years and 53% of patients were males. Candida albicans were the
		"most common species (38.7%), followed by Candida tropicalis (18.9%), and Candida"
		glabrata (C. glabrata) (16.3%). The proportion of ICI caused by C. albicans
		"remained stable over time (p=0.07), but C. glabrata increased significantly"
		"(p<0.001). The median rate of ICI per 1,000 hospital discharges per year was"
		"1.65, with a significant trend towards higher rates over time (p=0.01). Most"
		"isolates were susceptible to fluconazole, voriconazole, and amphotericin B. Only"
		66.7% of Candida krusei were susceptible to caspofungin. Overall 30-day crude
		mortality was 40.6%. There was no significant difference in crude mortality in
		"association with C. albicans compared with non-albicans species, nor in"
		association with fluconazole resistance. CONCLUSION: The rate of ICI increased
		significantly in the proportion of ICI caused by C. glabrata. Most isolates
		"remain susceptible to caspofungin, voriconazole, and amphotericin B. The crude"
		mortality remains high.

LID	-	e0252165
AB	-	PURPOSE: Candidemia is an alarming problem in critically ill patients including
		those admitted in intensive care units (ICUs). We aimed to describe the clinical
		and microbiological characteristics of bloodstream infections (BSIs) due to
		Candida spp. in patients admitted to ICUs of an italian tertiary referral
		university hospital over nine years. METHODS: A retrospective observational study
		"of all cases of candidemia in adult patients was carried out from January 1, 2010"
		"to December 31, 2018 at a 980-bedded University Hospital in Ancona, Italy,"
		"counting five ICUs. The incidence, demographics, clinical and microbiologic"
		"characteristics, therapeutic approaches and outcomes of ICU-patients with"
		candidemia were collected. Non-ICU patients with candidemia hospitalized during
		the same time period were considered for comparison purposes. Early (7 days from
		the occurrence of the episode of Candida BSI) and late (30 days) mortality rates
		"were calculated. RESULTS: During the study period, 188/505 (36%) episodes of"
		candidemia occurred in ICU patients. Cumulative incidence was 9.9/1000 ICU
		admission and it showed to be stable over time. Candida albicans accounted for
		"52% of the cases, followed by C. parapsilosis (24%), and C. glabrata (14%). There"
		was not a significant difference in species distribution between ICU and non-ICU
		patients. With the exception of isolates of C. tropicalis which showed to be
		"fluconazole resistant in 25% of the cases, resistance to antifungals was not of"
		"concern in our patients. Early and late mortality rates, were 19% and 41%"
		"respectively, the latter being significantly higher than that observed in non-ICU"
		"patients. At multivariate analysis, factors associated with increased risk of"
		"death were septic shock, acute kidney failure, pulmonary embolism and lack of"
		antifungal therapy. The type of antifungal therapy did not influence the outcome.
		Mortality did not increased significantly over time. CONCLUSION: Neither
		cumulative incidence nor crude mortality of candidemia in ICU patients increased
		"over time at our institution. However, mortality rate remained high and"
		significantly associated with specific host-related factors in the majority of
		cases.

		"had candidemia at Barnes Hospital, St. Louis, between 1 September 1988 and 1"
		September 1989 were retrospectively reviewed. One hundred six candidemic patients
		"were identified, representing 0.5% of all medical and surgical discharges and"
		0.33% of total patient discharges. These percentages represent a 20-fold increase
		in the incidence of candidemia at our hospital in comparison with that during
		"1976-1979. Candida albicans was the most frequently isolated species (63%),"
		"followed by Candida tropicalis (17%), Candida glabrata (13%), Candida"
		"parapsilosis (6.5%), and Candida krusei (0.9%). Overall mortality was 57%, and 14"
		(23%) of 60 deaths occurred within 48 hours of the detection of candidemia.
		Mortality was associated with higher APACHE II scores (25 for nonsurvivors vs. 16
		"for survivors; P = .0001), the presence of a rapidly fatal underlying illness (P"
		"= .0009), and sustained positivity of blood cultures (P = .02). In cases of"
		"sustained candidemia, the isolation of non-albicans Candida species also"
		correlated with increased mortality (8 of 8 vs. 10 of 21; P = .005). Thirty
		"candidemic patients (28%) did not receive any antifungal therapy, and 19 (63%) of"
		these untreated patients died. Eleven untreated patients (37%) survived without
		sequelae. There has been a marked increase in the incidence of candidemia in our
		institution that is associated with a high overall mortality. Candidemia lasting
		less than 24 hours was associated with a lower mortality than was that of longer
		duration. Severity of illness and duration of candidemia should be used as
		stratifying factors in prospective studies to determine optimum therapy.

PG	-	1375-9
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To determine the proportion of albicans and non-albicans candiduria in
		a hospital setting and to ascertain if fluconazole is still suitable as empirical
		antifungal therapy based on antifungal susceptibility patterns of Candida
		species. METHODS: The cross-sectional study was conducted between December 2010
		"and December 2011 at UKM Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and comprised 64"
		urine samples from patients who were either suspected or confirmed to have
		urinary tract infections. Yeasts were speciated using ID 32 C and subjected to
		antifungal susceptibility testing using Sensititre® YeastOne YO8. RESULTS:
		"Candida albicans accounted for 38(59.4%) of the isolates, Candida tropicalis"
		"18(28.1%), Candida glabrata 6(9.4%) and Candida parapsilosis 2(3.1%). Overall,"
		the isolates were susceptible to both amphotericin B (MIC90 1 μg/ml) and to
		"5-flucytosine (MIC90 0.25 μg/ml), but susceptible-dose dependent towards"
		"fluconazole (MIC90 16 μg/ml). Individually, Candida albicans was susceptible to"
		"fluconazole (MIC90 2 μg/ml), amphotericin B (MIC90 0.5 μg/ml) and 5-flucytosine"
		(MIC90 0.25 μg/ml). Candida tropicalis was also susceptible to fluconazole (MIC90
		"4 μg/ml), amphotericin B (MIC90 1 μg/ml) and 5-flucytosine (MIC90 0.125 μg/ml)."
		"Candida glabrata was resistant to fluconazole (MIC90 64 μg/ml), but susceptible"
		"to amphotericin B (MIC90 1 μg/ml) and 5-flucytosine (MIC90 0.125 μg/ml). Lastly,"
		"Candida parapsilosis was resistant to fluconazole (MIC90 256 μg/ml), but"
		susceptible to amphotericin B (MIC90 0.5 μg/ml) and 5-flucytosine (MIC90 0.5

AB	-	The surveillance and analysis of candidemia risk factors are necessary to reduce
		treatment failures in cancer patients. By understanding the geographic
		distribution of Candida spp. and their in vitro minimal antifungal inhibitory
		"concentrations in cancer patients, optimal treatment protocols may be developed."
		On reviewing the candidemia data of cancer patients in Tianjin Medical University
		"Cancer Institute and Hospital (TMUCIH), we found that the incidence rate was"
		"0.34-0.53 cases per 1,000 admissions from 2008-2010, and the crude mortality was"
		"31.7% during 2006-2010. Candida albicans was the most common species (48.8%),"
		"followed by C. parapsilosis (24.4%), C. glabrata (9.8%), C. tropicalis (9.8%), C."
		"lusitaniae (4.9%), and C. famata (2.3%). All species were susceptible to azoles"
		and showed low MICs to amphotericin B. Surgery was an independent risk factor in
		"candidemia caused by C. albicans. Furthermore, among all cancer patients, those"
		with digestive system neoplasms were most likely to develop candidemia. In
		"addition, cancer patients with metastasis to distant organs were significantly"
		more prone to non-C. albicans Candida infection. This study provided data on the
		epidemiology of candidemia in cancer patients in North China which may be of
		value in such individuals with yeast infections.

AB	-	This study reviews data on patients with fungemia and confirms the high
		prevalence (50%) of infections caused by non-albicans species of Candida.
		Fungemia due to C. albicans or Torulopsis glabrata occurred significantly more
		"often in patients with a solid tumor, while fungemia due to Candida tropicalis or"
		Candida krusei was significantly more common in patients with hematologic
		"malignancy (P = .001). For 31% of patients, only a single blood culture was"
		"positive for yeasts, and the prognosis for these patients was not significantly"
		different than that for patients with three or more positive blood cultures (P =
		"1), including those who had C. albicans fungemia. The overall mortality rate was"
		"41.8%, which is much lower than that previously reported in studies of patients"
		with cancer. No significant difference was observed between patients treated with
		amphotericin B and those treated with fluconazole in this retrospective analysis.
		Although no significant difference was observed in the mortality rate among
		"patients who had fungemia with or without neutropenia, the incidence of"
		disseminated candidiasis was significantly higher among neutropenic patients (P =
		.03).

PG	-	S394-S399

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Antifungal prophylaxis may result in breakthrough infections in
		"hematology patients with severe agranulocytosis, with few studies assessing risk"
		factors and clinical outcomes of breakthrough candidemia. We described the
		"distribution of Candida species, assessed risk factors for mortality in such"
		"patients, and determined differences in the incidence and mortality of"
		breakthrough candidemia between patients who did or did not receive an allogeneic
		hematopoietic stem cell transplant. METHODS: We collected clinical and
		microbiological data of patients with hematologic malignancies and breakthrough
		candidemia from a single center. Seven-day and 30-day follow-up outcomes were
		recorded; the incidence and mortality of breakthrough candidemia between patients
		who did or did not undergo an allogeneic transplant were compared. Kaplan-Meier
		"survival estimates were used to generate survival curves, and predictors were"
		"identified using Cox regression analyses. RESULTS: Of 71 enrolled patients, 17"
		received allogeneic transplants. Incidences of breakthrough candidemia were 17 of
		"2924 (0.58%) and 54 of 12 015 (0.45%) in the transplant and nontransplant groups,"
		"respectively (P = .35). The most common isolate was Candida tropicalis, and"
		antifungal agent combinations were the most common first-line treatment.
		"Cumulative mortality rates of patients were 21.1% and 31.0% at days 7 and 30,"
		"respectively, and they significantly differed between both groups. Septic shock,"
		"central venous catheter removal, and granulocyte recovery were significantly"
		associated with 7-day mortality; the latter 2 remained independent predictors of
		30-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Breakthrough candidemia-related mortality was
		"higher in the allogeneic transplant group, although the incidence was not"
		significantly different between the groups. Prompt and adequate antifungal
		treatment with catheter removal may reduce mortality.

AB	-	PURPOSE: This study examined the prevalence of Candida species in the saliva of
		oral squamous cell carcinoma patients and its effect on the mortality rate.
		MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred patients with oral cavity squamous cell
		carcinoma undergoing protocol treatment at Helsinki University Hospital were
		"recruited into the study from March 2011 through 2014. For comparison, 75"
		age-matched controls with no current or previously treated oral cancer were
		recruited. Paraffin-stimulated whole saliva samples were collected and cultivated
		"on CHROMagar Candida medium (CHROMagar, Paris, France) to establish possible"
		"Candida growth. The API ID 32C yeast identification kit (bioMérieux, Lyon,"
		"France) and Bichro-Dubli Fumouze latex agglutination test (Fumouze Diagnostics,"
		"Levallois-Perret, France) were used for further identification of different"
		Candida species. Patients' medical records were studied for information on their
		"health habits and general health status, as well as tumor-related data. The"
		patients' status regarding being alive and cancer free was checked at a follow-up
		point in December 2017. Descriptive statistics and cross tabulation were carried
		"out, and the P value was set at .05. RESULTS: Candida species were detected in"
		"74% of the oral cancer patients' samples, with C. albicans being the most common"
		"species (84%). Other species identified were C. dubliniensis (8%), C. tropicalis"
		"(4%), C. glabrata (3%), C. parapsilosis (3%), C. sake (3%), C. krusei (1%), and"
		"C. guilliermondii (1%). After the follow-up period, 63% of the patients were"
		alive and 86% of them were cancer free. Harboring Candida species in the saliva
		was not associated with any increase in the mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS: C.
		albicans was common in the oral cavity of the oral squamous cell carcinoma
		"patients. However, in this patient population, we did not observe a statistically"
		significant effect of the yeast on the mortality rate.

AB	-	AIM: The present retrospective study was carried out to investigate the
		epidemiological characteristics and the prognostic factors of candidemia among
		"elderly patients. METHODS: From 2009 to 2012, elderly patients with candidemia"
		"were identified at the Chi Mei medical center, a 900-bed regional hospital in"
		"southern Taiwan, and their medical records retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS:"
		"During the 4-year period, a total of 175 episodes of candidemia among elderly"
		patients were identified. The patients ranged in age from 65 to 98 years (mean
		76.4 years) and the mean (±standard deviation) Charlson Comorbidity Index score
		"was 7.6 (±2.7). Cancer was the most common underlying disease (n = 127, 72.6%),"
		"followed by diabetes mellitus (n = 69, 39.4%). Candida albicans (n = 96, 54.9%)"
		"was the most common pathogen, followed by C. tropicalis (n = 39, 22.3%),"
		"C. parapsilosis (n = 24, 13.7%), C. glabrata (n = 22, 12.6%), C. guilliermondii"
		"(n = 2, 1.1%) and Candida species (n = 3, 1.7%). The ratio of C. albicans causing"
		candidemia was significantly higher in young-old than old-old patients (64.1% vs
		"47.4%, P = 0.027). The overall in-hospital mortality was 50.3%. Multivariate"
		analysis showed that the in-hospital mortality was only significantly associated
		"with jaundice (P = 0.004), no use of antifungal agent (P = 0.021) and intensive"
		care unit admission (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Candidemia can develop in elderly
		"patients, especially patients with cancer or other risk factors. C. albicans is"
		"the most common Candida species causing candidemia among elderly patients,"
		followed by C. tropicalis. The mortality of candidemia among elderly patients
		remains high.

TI	-	Impact of Nutritional Assessment on the Clinical Outcomes of Patients with
		Non-albicans Candidemia: A Multicenter Study.
LID	-	10.3390/nu13093218 [doi]
LID	-	3218
AB	-	Several studies have demonstrated that malnutrition is a negative prognostic
		"factor for clinical outcomes. However, there is limited evidence for the effect"
		of malnutrition on clinical outcomes in patients with candidemia. We investigated
		the relationship between malnutrition and all-cause 28-day mortality among
		"patients with non-albicans candidemia. Between July 2011 and June 2014, all adult"
		"patients with non-albicans candidemia, including C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, C."
		"parapsilosis and so on, were enrolled. The Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool"
		(MUST) scores were used to determine the patients' nutritional status before the
		onset of candidemia. A total of 378 patients were enrolled; 43.4% developed
		septic shock and 57.1% had a high risk of malnutrition (MUST ≥ 2). The all-cause
		28-day mortality rate was 40.7%. The Cox proportional hazards model revealed that
		"C. tropicalis (HR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.24-3.26; p = 0.005), Charlson comorbidity"
		"index (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.03-1.18; p = 0.007), Foley catheter use (HR, 1.68; 95%"
		"CI, 1.21-1.35; p = 0.002), concomitant bacterial infections (HR, 1.55; 95% CI,"
		"1.11-2.17; p = 0.010), low platelet count (HR, 3.81; 95% CI, 2.45-5.91; p <"
		"0.001), not receiving antifungals initially (HR, 4.73; 95% CI, 3.07-7.29; p <"
		"0.001), and MUST ≥ 2 (HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.09-2.17; p = 0.014) were independently"
		associated with all-cause 28-day mortality. A simple screening tool for
		nutritional assessment should be used for patients with non-albicans candidemia
		"to detect early clinical deterioration, and a tailored nutritional care plan"
		"should be established for malnourished individuals, to improve their clinical"
		outcomes.

AB	-	PURPOSE: A systematic epidemiological study on intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired
		"candidemia across India. METHOD: A prospective, nationwide, multicentric,"
		observational study was conducted at 27 Indian ICUs. Consecutive patients who
		acquired candidemia after ICU admission were enrolled during April 2011 through
		September 2012. Clinical and laboratory variables of these patients were
		recorded. The present study is an analysis of data specific for adult patients.
		"RESULTS: Among 1,400 ICU-acquired candidemia cases (overall incidence of 6.51"
		"cases/1,000 ICU admission), 65.2 % were adult. Though the study confirmed the"
		"already known risk factors for candidemia, the acquisition occurred early after"
		"admission to ICU (median 8 days; interquartile range 4-15 days), even infecting"
		patients with lower APACHE II score at admission (median 17.0; mean ± SD 17.2 ±
		5.9; interquartile range 14-20). The important finding of the study was the vast
		spectrum of agents (31 Candida species) causing candidemia and a high rate of
		isolation of Candida tropicalis (41.6 %). Azole and multidrug resistance were
		seen in 11.8 and 1.9 % of isolates. Public sector hospitals reported a
		significantly higher presence of the relatively resistant C. auris (8.2 vs. 3.9
		%; p = 0.008) and C. rugosa (5.6 vs. 1.5 %; p = 0.001). The 30-day crude and
		"attributable mortality rates of candidemia patients were 44.7 and 19.6 %,"
		respectively. Logistic regression analysis revealed significant independent
		"predictors of mortality including admission to public sector hospital, APACHE II"
		"score at admission, underlying renal failure, central venous catheterization and"
		steroid therapy. CONCLUSION: The study highlighted a high burden of candidemia in
		"Indian ICUs, early onset after ICU admission, higher risk despite less severe"
		physiology score at admission and a vast spectrum of agents causing the disease
		with predominance of C. tropicalis.

PG	-	53-62
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-014-9830-9 [doi]
AB	-	Candida parapsilosis complex (CPC) is the third Candida species isolated in blood
		"cultures of patients from our Hospital, following C. albicans and C. tropicalis."
		"From 2006 to 2010, the median annual distribution of CPC was 8 cases/year."
		Records of 36 patients were reviewed. CPC were 31 (86.1%) C. parapsilosis; 4
		(11.1%) C. orthopsilosis; and 1 (2.8%) C. metapsilosis. Clinical characteristics
		"were central venous catheter, 34 (94.4%); parental nutrition, 25 (70%); surgery,"
		"27 (57.9%); prior bacteremia, 20 (51.3%); malignancy, 18 (50%). General mortality"
		was 47.2%. Death was higher in immunosuppressed patients (17 vs. 11; p = 0.003).
		Three out four (75%) patients with C. orthopsilosis and 14 out 31 (45.2%) with C.
		parapsilosis died (p = 0.558). Thirty-nine individual isolates were tested for
		"susceptibility to seven antifungal drugs, with MICs values showing susceptibility"
		"to all of them. Two isolates, one C. orthopsilosis and one C. parapsilosis, had"
		fluconazole MIC = 4 μg/mL. Differentiation among CPC has implication in caring
		"for patients with invasive candidiasis since there are differences in virulence,"
		pathogenicity and drug susceptibility. A method targeting the topoisomerase II
		gene based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) was developed. LAMP
		emerges as a promising tool for the identification of fungal species due to the
		"high sensitivity and specificity. LAMP can be performed at the point-of-care,"
		"being no necessary the use of expensive equipment. In our study, the method was"
		successful comparing to the DNA sequencing and proved to be a reliable and fast
		assay to distinguish the three species of CPC.

LID	-	10.1007/s11046-021-00569-7 [doi]
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Candida species is the most common cause of invasive fungal
		infection. With the wide variation in species distribution and antifungal
		"susceptibility of causative agents, local epidemiological profiles are needed to"
		provide effective guidelines for the treatment of invasive candidiasis.
		OBJECTIVE: To find out the species distribution and antifungal susceptibilities
		of Candida strains isolated from patients in an intensive care unit (ICU) of
		Vietnam. METHODS: All patients in ICU of Vietnam National Hospital of Burn with
		Candida isolation reported from January 2017 to December 2019 were
		retrospectively studied. Species identification and antifungal susceptibility
		testing were performed using VITEK 2 Compact. The identification was reconfirmed
		by sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer regions when needed. RESULTS: A
		total of 186 yeasts belonging to ten species were collected. The most common
		"agent was C. tropicalis (45.7%), followed by C. albicans (42.4%), and C."
		parapsilosis (7.53%). The isolated yeasts showed less susceptibility to
		"fluconazole (resistant rate R 10.7%) than to micafungin, caspofungin, flucytosine"
		"and amphotericin B (R 0%, 0.6%, 2.3% and 3.4%, respectively, p < 0.05). C."
		albicans isolates were more susceptible to fluconazole (R 5.2%) than C.
		tropicalis (R 15.7%). Resistance to voriconazole was seen only among C. albicans
		(3.9%) and C. tropicalis isolates (9.9%). CONCLUSION: Non-albicans species
		"(especially C. tropicalis) is the predominant species, and there is a significant"
		proportion of isolates with reduced susceptibility to azole but not to
		echinocandin.

TI	-	Candidaemia in polish hospitals - a multicentre survey.
PG	-	576-81
LID	-	10.1111/myc.12077 [doi]
AB	-	Significant changes in the frequency of candidaemia and the distribution of
		causative species have been noted worldwide in the last two decades. In this
		"study, we present the results of the first multicentre survey of fungaemia in"
		Polish hospitals. A total of 302 candidaemia episodes in 294 patients were
		identified in 20 hospitals during a 2-year period. The highest number of
		"infections was found in intensive care (30.8%) and surgical (29.5%) units,"
		"followed by haematological (15.9%), 'others' (19.2%) and neonatological (4.6%)"
		units. Candida albicans was isolated from 50.96% of episodes; its prevalence was
		"higher in intensive care unit and neonatology (61.22% and 73.33%, respectively),"
		and significantly lower in haematology (22%; P < 0.001). The frequency of C.
		krusei and C. tropicalis was significantly higher (24% and 18%) in haematology
		"(P < 0.02); whereas, the distribution of C. glabrata (14.1%) and C. parapsilosis"
		(13.1%) did not possess statistically significant differences between compared
		departments. Obtained data indicates that species distribution of Candida blood
		"isolates in Polish hospitals reflects worldwide trends, particularly a decrease"
		in the prevalence of infections due to C. albicans.

TI	-	Epidemiology and predictors of mortality in cases of Candida bloodstream
		"infection: results from population-based surveillance, barcelona, Spain, from"
		2002 to 2003.
PG	-	1829-35
AB	-	We conducted population-based surveillance for Candida bloodstream infections in
		"Spain to determine its incidence, the extent of antifungal resistance, and risk"
		factors for mortality. A case was defined as the first positive blood culture for
		"any Candida spp. in a resident of Barcelona, from 1 January 2002 to 31 December"
		2003. We defined early mortality as occurring between days 3 to 7 after
		candidemia and late mortality as occurring between days 8 to 30. We detected 345
		"cases of candidemia, for an average annual incidence of 4.3 cases/100,000"
		"population, 0.53 cases/1,000 hospital discharges, and 0.73 cases/10,000"
		"patient-days. Outpatients comprised 11% of the cases, and 89% had a central"
		venous catheter (CVC) at diagnosis. Overall mortality was 44%. Candida albicans
		"was the most frequent species (51% of cases), followed by Candida parapsilosis"
		"(23%), Candida tropicalis (10%), Candida glabrata (8%), Candida krusei (4%), and"
		other species (3%). Twenty-four isolates (7%) had decreased susceptibility to
		"fluconazole (MIC > or = 16 microg/ml). On multivariable analysis, early death was"
		"independently associated with hematological malignancy (odds ratio [OR], 3.5; 95%"
		"confidence interval [CI], 1.1 to 10.4). Treatment with antifungals (OR, 0.05; 95%"
		"CI, 0.01 to 0.2) and removal of CVCs (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1 to 0.9) were"
		"protective factors for early death. Receiving adequate treatment, defined as"
		"having CVCs removed and administration of an antifungal medication (OR, 0.2; 95%"
		"CI, 0.08 to 0.8), was associated with lower odds of late mortality; intubation"
		"(OR, 7.5; 95% CI, 2.6 to 21.1) was associated with higher odds. The incidence of"
		candidemia and prevalence of fluconazole resistance are similar to other European
		"countries, indicating that routine antifungal susceptibility testing is not"
		warranted. Antifungal medication and catheter removal are critical in preventing
		mortality.

LID	-	e99103
AB	-	AIM: The study of candidemia in cancer patients has been limited. This
		retrospective study aims to investigate the epidemiologic characteristics and
		prognostic factors of candidemia among cancer patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
		"From 2009 to 2012, cancer patients with candidemia were identified at a hospital"
		in Taiwan. The medical records of all patients with bloodstream infections due to
		Candida species were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: During the four-year
		"period, a total of 242 episodes of candidemia were identified among cancer"
		"patients. Half of these patients were classified as elderly (≥65 years old), and"
		more than 95% of the candidemia episodes were classified as healthcare-associated
		"infections. Among the 242 cancer patients with candidemia, head and neck cancer"
		"was the most common, followed by gastrointestinal tract and lung cancer."
		"Additionally, most of the patients had variable underlying conditions, such as"
		the presence of CVC (99%) or prior exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics (93%)
		"and were receiving an immunosuppressant (86%). Overall, C. albicans (n = 132,"
		"54.5%) was the most common pathogen, followed by C. tropicalis (n = 52, 21.5%),"
		"C. parapsilosis (n = 38, 15.7%), and C. glabrata (n = 29, 12.0%). Seventeen"
		"patients had polycandidal candidemia, and 77 patients had concomitant bacteremia."
		Approximately one-third of the patients required admission to the intensive care
		"unit (ICU) or mechanical ventilation, and the overall in-hospital mortality was"
		50.8%. Multivariable analysis showed that the in-hospital mortality was
		significantly associated with only the non-use of antifungal agents and acute
		respiratory failure (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Candidemia can develop in patients
		"with both solid cancer and hematological malignancy, especially for patients with"
		"underlying conditions. Overall, the associated morbidity and mortality due to"
		Candidemia remain high. It was also determined that the non-use of antifungal
		agents and acute respiratory failure conditions were associated with in-hospital
		mortality.

AB	-	Candida blood steam infection is a life-threatening disease that seems to be
		under estimated. Understanding epidemiology of such disease is crucial for
		"improved diagnosis, optimized treatment, and better outcome. Through this"
		"retrospective study, we aimed to determine the incidence of candidemia in a"
		"secondary care hospital, and to describe the epidemiology and outcome of"
		candidemia among adult patients. The incidence of candidemia for all age groups
		"was 0.24, 0.16 and 0.15 cases/1000 patient-days in 2014, 2015 and 2016"
		"respectively. Among adult patients, 82 cases were identified. The patients had"
		"the following clinical characteristics with varying proportions: old age,"
		"diabetes, antibiotic exposure, use of vascular catheter, abdominal surgery, ICU"
		"hospitalization, haemodialysis, and total parenteral nutrition. All-cause 30-day"
		mortality was 54% and ICU hospitalization was a recognized risk factor for death.
		"The leading causative agents were Candida albicans (32%), and Candida"
		"parapsilosis (32%), followed by Candida tropicalis (20%), Candida glabrata (13%)"
		"and one each by Candida dubliniensis, Candida famata, and Candida auris. Almost"
		all tested isolates were susceptible to caspofungin and amphotericin B. With
		"regard to fluconazole, C. glabrata showed variable susceptibility. Other species"
		"were susceptible except one isolate, each of C. parapsilosis and C. auris. The"
		study highlights the growing importance of non-C. albicans Candida species in the
		etiology of candidemia. Emergence of C. auris is a warning sign and needs to be
		closely monitored.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Yeasts, mostly Candida, are important causes of bloodstream"
		"infections (BSI), responsible for significant mortality and morbidity among"
		hospitalized patients. The epidemiology and species distribution vary from
		different regions. The goals of this study were to report the current
		epidemiology of Candida BSI in a Shanghai Teaching Hospital and estimate the
		impact of appropriate antifungal therapy on the outcome. METHODS: From January
		"2008 to December 2012, all consecutive patients who developed Candida BSI at"
		"Ruijin University Hospital were enrolled. Underlying diseases, clinical severity,"
		"species distribution, antifungal therapy and its impact on the outcome were"
		"analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 121 episodes of Candida BSI were identified, with"
		"an incidence of 0.32 episodes/1,000 admissions (0.21 in 2008 and 0.42 in 2012)"
		"The proportion of candidemia caused by non-albicans species (62.8%), including C."
		"parapsilosis (19.8%), C. tropicalis (14.9%), C. glabrata (7.4%), C."
		"guilliermondii (5.8%), C. sake (5.0%) was higher than that of candidemia caused"
		by C. albicans (37.2%). The overall crude 28-day mortality was 28.1% and
		significantly reduced with appropriate empiric antifungal therapy administered
		"within 5 days (P = 0.006). Advanced age (OR 1.04; P = 0.014),"
		neutropenia < 500/mm3 (OR 17.44; P < 0.001) were independent risk factors for
		"28-day mortality, while appropriate empiric antifungal therapy (OR 0.369;"
		P = 0.035) was protective against 28-day mortality. CONCLUSION: The epidemiology
		of candidemia in Shanghai differed from that observed in Western countries.
		Appropriate empiric antifungal therapy influenced the short-term survival.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Infection with and antifungal resistance of Candida species have
		been on the rise globally. Relevant data on these pathogens are relatively few in
		"our region, including Lebanon, thus warranting this study. METHODOLOGY: This"
		retrospective study of Candida spp. profiles and their in vitro antifungal
		susceptibility was based on analysis requests for 186 Candida non-albicans and 61
		"C. albicans during three periods (2005-2007, 2009-2011, and 2012-2014) over the"
		span of the last 10 years at the American University of Beirut Medical Center
		"(AUBMC), a major tertiary care center in Lebanon. Identification of Candida was"
		"done using the API 20C AUX system, and the E-test was used to determine the"
		minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of antifungal agents. RESULTS: Among the
		"1,300-1,500 Candida isolates recovered yearly, C. albicans rates decreased from"
		"86% in 2005 to around 60% in 2014. Simultaneously, the non-albicans rates"
		"increased from 14% in 2005 to around 40% in 2014, revealing 11 species, the most"
		"frequent of which were C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, and C. parapsilosis. All these"
		"demonstrated high resistance (35%-79%) against itraconazole, but remained"
		uniformly susceptible (100%) to amphotericin B. Though C. albicans and the other
		"species maintained high susceptibility against fluconazole and voriconazole,"
		"their MIC90 showed an elevated trend over time, and C. glabrata had the highest"
		resistance rates. CONCLUSIONS: The observed rise in resistance among Candida spp.
		in Lebanon mandates the need for close surveillance and monitoring of antifungal
		drug resistance for both epidemiologic and treatment purposes.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: We evaluated the epidemiology, clinical characteristics,"
		"microbiology, outcomes, and risk factors for mortality of candidemia in adult"
		surgical patients in Shenyang from 2012 to 2018. METHODS: We designed a
		retrospective observational study of adult patients with candidemia in a teaching
		hospital including three hospital campuses. Data regarding clinical and
		demographic characteristics were collected from the patient's medical records.
		"RESULTS: Of the 236 cases of candidemia, 172 (72.9%) were identified in surgical"
		"patients, including 146 (84.9%) general surgeries, 11 (6.4%) urologic surgeries,"
		"6 (3.5%) thoracic surgeries, and others. Higher proportions of solid tumors,"
		"total parenteral nutrition, the presence of a urinary catheter, and the presence"
		of a gastric tube were observed in surgical patients with candidemia versus
		"non-surgical ones, whereas the percentages of hematological malignancy, diabetes"
		"mellitus, and renal replacement therapy were relatively lower in surgical"
		"patients. Renal failure, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia were less common"
		laboratory findings in surgical patients with candidemia than compared to
		"non-surgical ones. Among surgical patients with candidemia, Candida parapsilosis"
		"was the predominant species (43%), followed by C. albicans (33.7%), C. glabrata"
		"(11%), C. tropicalis (8.1%), and others (4.1%). Overall susceptibility,"
		"susceptible dose dependent or intermediate susceptibility, and resistance to"
		"fluconazole were detected in 73.3, 19.8, and 3.5% Candida isolates from surgical"
		"patients, respectively, but no resistance to amphotericin B was observed."
		"Overall, the 30-day mortality in surgical patients was 19.2%. At multivariable"
		"analysis, independent risk factors for death in surgical patients with candidemia"
		"were ICU stay, thrombocytopenia, and C. albicans infection. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical"
		patients account for the majority of candidemia cases. Among patients with recent
		"surgery, risk factors for species distribution, antifungal sensitivity patterns"
		"of Candida isolates causing candidemia, and independent risk factors for"
		mortality should be evaluated and considered for a better outcome in the
		antifungal treatment.

AB	-	The aims of this study were to establish the incidence of invasive candidiasis
		"(IC) in a Beijing hospital, to identify risk factors associated with IC caused by"
		"non-C. albicans Candida (NAC), and to determine risk factors for infection caused"
		by NAC species not susceptible to fluconazole. Clinical data from 141 patients
		admitted to Beijing Chaoyang Hospital (from 2001-2010) diagnosed with IC were
		retrospectively analyzed. The incidence of IC increased during the 10-year
		"period, but the proportion due to NAC did not change significantly in that of 141"
		"cases, 55 (39%) were due to NAC and 86 (61%) to C. albicans (CA). The NAC species"
		"isolated included C. tropicalis (25 of 141, 18%), C. glabrata (14 of 141, 9.9%),"
		"C. parapsilosis (eight of 141, 5.7%), C. krusei (three of 141, 2.1%) and C."
		"lusitaniae (one of 141, 0.71%); other Candida species accounted for four of the"
		141 cases (2.8%). Twenty-one isolates (38%) of NAC were not susceptible to
		fluconazole. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) (OR 4.2; 95% CI 3.5-58; P < 0.001)
		and previous fluconazole therapy (OR 7.7; 95% CI 2.2-27; P = 0.001) were risk
		"factors for invasive NAC candidiasis, whereas patient age ≥65 years (OR 0.37; CI"
		0.16-0.88; P = 0.025) and invasive mechanical ventilation (OR 0.22; CI
		0.069-0.70; P =0.010) were connected with invasive CA candidiasis. Prior
		fluconazole therapy was a risk factor (P = 0.007) for infections caused by NAC
		"not susceptible to fluconazole. In conclusion, TPN and prior fluconazole therapy"
		"are independent risk factors for NAC infection, while prior fluconazole therapy"
		is a risk factor for infection due to NAC not susceptible to fluconazole.

AB	-	AIM OF THE STUDY: In order to update the data and contribute to optimizing the
		"management of vulvovaginal candidiasis, we conducted this study to determine"
		their etiology (and hence the sensitivity of the isolated fungal organisms) and
		the factors contributing to their occurrence in Abidjan (Cote d'Ivoire). PATIENTS
		AND METHODS: This cross-sectional survey involving 400 women with clinically
		vulvovaginitis was conducted from May to July 2011. It was carried out at the
		health centre for venereal diseases located at the National Institute of Public
		"Hygiene in Abidjan. After a swab collecting, direct examination and culture on"
		Sabouraud Chloramphenicol and Sabouraud Chloramphenicol Actidione media were
		implemented to research yeasts. After identifying yeast species through blastesis
		"tests and auxanogram, its in vitro susceptibility to amphotericin B,"
		"5-fluorocytosine, clotrimazole, miconazole, econazole and ketoconazole was"
		"assessed. RESULTS: As a whole, 172 patients suffered from vulvovaginal"
		candidiasis i.e. an overall prevalence of 43%. Candida albicans was most
		frequently isolated (82.5%) followed by C. glabrata (10.5%). C. albicans and
		C. tropicalis were resistant to the 5-fluorocytosine (respectively 24.65 and
		33.33%). Other molecules have shown excellent activity on all yeasts isolated.
		"Type of housing, type of underwear and patients personal history were"
		statistically associated with the presence of vulvovaginal candidiasis
		(respectively P=0.003; 0.010; 0.022). CONCLUSION: Vulvovaginal candidiasis is
		relatively frequent in Abidjan and antifungal compounds are in general still
		effective for treatment. Being knowledgeable of risk factors for this
		vulvovaginitis will ensure better prevention of their occurrence.

		as a guide for implementation of T2MR (T2CANDIDA®) for rapid diagnosis of
		candidemia.
PG	-	350-354
LID	-	10.1093/mmy/myaa056 [doi]
AB	-	The aim of this work was to study the epidemiology of candidemia in our hospital
		in order to determine whether the T2MR system might be a useful tool for early
		diagnosis of candidemia in selected units. We perform a retrospective review of
		all candidemia episodes registered in the last 12 years in selected units of our
		hospital in adult and pediatric patients. Candida species and antifungal
		"susceptibility patterns were registered. A total of 686 isolates were registered,"
		of which 625 were infections due to the five most common species of Candida. C.
		albicans (45.6%) and C. parapsilosis (33.1%) were the predominant species found
		in our institution. In adults these species were closely followed by C. glabrata
		(12-21%) in all units. While in pediatric medical and intensive care units
		"(PICU), these species were followed by other uncommon yeasts. Resistance rates to"
		triazoles were low in C. albicans and C. parapsilosis. In C. glabrata and C.
		tropicalis the resistance rates to fluconazole ranged from 10.86 to 6.67%.
		Resistance rates for echinocandins were very low and all strains were susceptible
		to amphotericin B. T2Candida® might be useful to guide antifungal targeted
		treatment and discontinuation of antifungal empirical treatment in those units
		where the five most common Candida species represent more than the ninety percent
		of the isolates. The selection of medical and surgical units should be based on
		local epidemiology and antifungal susceptibility patterns. Incidence should be
		taken into account in order to make clinical decisions based on negative results.
		LAY ABSTRACT: T2Candida® might be useful selectively in clinical units according
		"to their local epidemiology, antifungal resistance patterns, and incidence of"
		candidemia. It optimizes the clinical value of positive results supporting
		decisions about targeted therapies or discontinuations based on negative results.

TI	-	Fungemia in a Spanish hospital: the role of Candida parapsilosis over a 15-year
		period.
PG	-	454-61
LID	-	10.3109/00365548.2014.900190 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candida parapsilosis is one of the main causes of fungemia in
		tertiary-care hospitals. Few studies have analysed the changes in its
		distribution over a long period. We compared the distribution of C. parapsilosis
		with that of other fungi over a 15-y period in a tertiary hospital. METHODS: The
		susceptibility of C. parapsilosis was analysed using the new species-specific
		clinical breakpoints. The C. parapsilosis complex species were differentiated
		"molecularly. RESULTS: From January 1997 to December 2011, 360 isolates causing"
		350 episodes of fungemia were isolated. C. parapsilosis was the second most
		frequently isolated species (20%); only 1 C. orthopsilosis was identified and
		there were no C. metapsilosis. The remaining episodes were caused by C. albicans
		"(43.1%), C. tropicalis (14.4%), C. glabrata (11.7%), and other fungal species"
		(10.8%). The incidence of candidemia increased more than two-fold between 2009
		"and 2011 (from 3.3 to 7.4 cases/100,000 population), and C. parapsilosis and C."
		glabrata fungemia increased throughout the period. C. parapsilosis was the most
		frequent species in children under 15 y (57.1%). All C. parapsilosis isolates
		"were susceptible to anidulafungin, micafungin, flucytosine, amphotericin B, and"
		"posaconazole, while 98.5% were susceptible to caspofungin, 97.1% to voriconazole,"
		"95.6% to fluconazole, and 76.5% to itraconazole. CONCLUSIONS: This long-term"
		study showed a slight increase in the incidence of candidemia during the years of
		the study and a trend towards an increase in C. parapsilosis. Because of its high
		"frequency and intrinsic low susceptibility to echinocandins, the prevalence and"
		"susceptibility of C. parapsilosis should be monitored, especially in children."

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To compare serum β-D-glucan (BDG) levels in candidaemia with
		"different Candida species, especially C. auris. METHODS: Aga Khan University"
		clinical laboratory database was retrospectively reviewed from January 2015 to
		December 2019. Blood culture positive cases with any Candida species and
		concomitant BDG level were included. RESULTS: Among the 192 cases included in our
		"study, 48 were C. albicans, 54 C. auris, eight C. glabrata, 32 C. parapsilosis,"
		43 C. tropicalis and seven other Candida species. The level of BDG was
		"significantly lower in C. auris (median 62.43, interquartile range (IQR)"
		"12.80-182.94 pg/mL) compared to C. albicans (median 266.83, IQR 66.29-523.43"
		"pg/mL) and C. tropicalis (median 324.41, IQR 105.20-523.44 pg/mL). The"
		"sensitivity of serum BDG was significantly lower for C. auris (43.75%, 95% CI"
		"29.5-58.8%) than C. tropicalis (79.07%, 95% CI 64.0-90.0%). DISCUSSION: Serum BDG"
		has lower sensitivity in patients with suspected C. auris candidaemia in our
		setting. Considering that C. auris has higher morbidity and mortality than other
		"species, a more sensitive test is required."

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Oral candidiasis is one of the most common opportunistic infection
		in HIV/AIDS patient and it is caused by Candida species. The low absolute
		CD4+T-lymphocyte count has traditionally been cited as the greatest risk factor
		for the development of Oral Candidiasis. The aim of this study was to identify
		"Candida species isolated from the oral cavity of HIV/AIDS patients, to determine"
		their in vitro antifungal susceptibility and to investigate the possible risk
		factors associated with oral candidiasis. METHODS: This was a hospital based
		cross sectional study that was carried out for a period of 3 months amongst
		"HIV/AIDS patients in Kumba District Hospital, whether on HAART or not. Mouth"
		swabs were collected from 378 participants using sterile cotton wool swabs and
		5ml venous blood were collected for determination of CD4 cell. Candida species
		were isolated and identified. Antifungal sensitivity testing was performed using
		modified kirby-bauer susceptibility testing technique. RESULTS: Candida species
		were present in 42.86% of the samples and Candida albicans was the most prevalent
		"(60.2%) amongst the six Candida isolates identified, followed by Candida glabrata"
		"(16.9%), Candida krusei (12.3%), Candida tropicalis (6.4%), Candida parapsilosis"
		"(2.3%) and Candida pseudotropicalis (1.8%). Pregnancy, oral hygiene and"
		antibiotic usage were significantly associated with oral candidiasis in HIV/AIDS
		patients (P<0.05). Oral candidiasis was mostly frequent in HIV/AIDS patients
		between 21-40 years. A CD4 cell count less than 200 cells/μl was a significant
		risk factor for acquiring oral candidiasis in HIV/AIDS patients (P<0.001).
		Nystatin was the most sensitive drug (83.6%) meanwhile ketonazole was the most
		"resistant drug (29.2%), followed by fluconazole (24.6%) to all oral Candida"
		isolates. CONCLUSION: Oral Candida colonization occurs more frequently in
		HIV/AIDS patients and the is a need for the government to implement regular
		"checks for opportunistic infections in HIV/AIDS patients, including oral"
		candidiasis in HIV/AIDS patients to monitor disease progression and prevent
		subsequent complications such as candidemia and diarrhea.

LID	-	10.1089/sur.2013.033 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: We conducted a study of the clinical manifestations and outcomes of
		empyema thoracis caused by Candida spp. in hospitalized patients. METHODS: We
		"identified patients who from January 2010 to June 2012 had signs of inflammation,"
		"such as fever and leukocytosis, and concomitant positive cultures of Candida spp."
		from specimens of pleural fluid. We reviewed retrospectively the medical records
		of all such patients. RESULTS: Eight of the patients in whom we identified fever
		and leukocytosis with concomitant positive pleural fluid cultures of Candida spp.
		were found to have Candida empyema thoracis. Candida albicans was the most common
		"species causing empyema (n=4), followed by C. glabrata (n=3) and C. tropicalis"
		"(n=1). Among the eight patients with Candida empyema thoracis, malignant disease"
		was the most common underlying disease. Seven of the eight patients' episodes of
		Candida empyema thoracis (87.5%) were classified as health care-associated
		infections. One patient had a mixed infection with Candida spp. and Pseudomonas
		aeruginosa. None of the patients had concomitant candidemia. Fluconazole was the
		"antifungal agent used most commonly in treating the patients, and all of the"
		"patients had drainage of pleural effusions, including tube thoracostomy in five"
		patients and drainage through a pigtail catheter in three patients. One patient
		"underwent video-assisted thoracic surgery for the management of empyema thoracis,"
		and the patients' overall in-hospital mortality was 62.5%. CONCLUSION: Although
		"Candida empyema thoracis is encountered rarely, it can develop in"
		immunocompromised patients and can be associated with a high mortality rate.

AB	-	"INTRODUCTION: In the last years, the incidence of Candida infections in liver"
		transplant recipients has increased with still higher morbidity and mortality.
		"Anidulafungin, a new echinocandin that does not interfere with cytochrome p450,"
		shows no need for dosage adjustment based upon renal or hepatic function or
		weight. AIM: To analyze tolerance to and microbiologic and clinical efficacy of
		Anidulafungin to treat Candida infections in liver transplant patients. MATERIALS
		"AND METHODS: This phase 3b, prospective, open-label, single-center study focused"
		on liver transplant patients with a suspected and/or diagnosed Candida infection.
		"The patients received Anidulafungin intravenously, optionally followed by oral"
		therapy with azoles. The primary endpoint was the global response at the end of
		"therapy; secondary endpoints were the efficacy of intravenous therapy, 90-day"
		"survival, as well as tolerance for and interaction with immunosuppresants."
		RESULTS: We considered 42 consecutive liver recipients transplanted between 2009
		and 2010 among whom 13 (31%) were recruited for the study and four patients were
		"treated with Anidulafungin as empirical therapy, six as preemptive therapy, and"
		three as targeted treatment for documented candidemia (7.1%). The
		immunosuppressive regimen consisted of tacrolimus and low dose of steroids. The
		"Candida species were: C albicans (50%), C glabrata (12.5%), C parapsilosis"
		"(12.5%), C krusei (12.5%), C lusitaniae (6.2%), C tropicalis (6.2%), and multiple"
		"others (25%). The principle site of isolation was the bile (53.8%), followed by"
		"the bloodstream (23.1%), central venous catheters (15.4%), bronchoalveolar lavage"
		"(15.4%), peritoneum (7.7%), and other locations (7.7%). Two patients (15.4%) died"
		of severe sepsis with multiple organ failure. There was no alteration of hepatic
		"enzymes, indices of cholestasis or changes in immunosuppressant drug levels."
		"CONCLUSION: Anidulafungin was an effective, safe, and well-tolerated drug. There"
		were neither toxic effects to the grafts or adverse interactions with
		immunosuppresants.

TI	-	Characteristics and outcomes of patients with postoperative Candida versus
		bacterial mediastinitis: a case-matched comparative study.
PG	-	523-530
LID	-	10.1093/ejcts/ezab437 [doi]
AB	-	"OBJECTIVES: Postoperative mediastinitis, a feared complication after cardiac"
		"surgery, is associated with high mortality, especially of critically ill"
		"patients. Candida species infections are rare and severe, with poorly known"
		"outcomes. We conducted a case-control study to describe the characteristics,"
		management and outcomes of patients with postoperative Candida mediastinitis.
		"METHODS: This French, monocentre, retrospective study included all patients with"
		postoperative Candida mediastinitis (January 2003-February 2020) requiring
		intensive care unit admission. Candida mediastinitis patients (henceforth cases)
		"were matched 1:1 with postoperative bacterial mediastinitis (henceforth control),"
		"based on 3 factors during mediastinitis management: age >40 years, cardiac"
		transplantation and invasive circulatory device used. The primary end point was
		the probability of survival within 1 year after intensive care unit (ICU)
		admission. RESULTS: Forty cases were matched to 40 controls. The global
		"male/female ratio was 2.1, with mean age at admission 47.9 ± 13.8 years. Candida"
		"species were: 67.5% albicans, 17.5% glabrata, 15% parapsilosis, 5.0% tropicalis,"
		2.5% krusei and 2.5% lusitaniae. The median duration of mechanical ventilation
		"was 23, 68.8% of patients received renal replacement therapy and 62.5%"
		extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. The probability of survival within
		the first year after ICU admission was 40 ± 5.5% and was significantly lower for
		"cases than for controls (43 ± 8% vs 80 ± 6.3%, respectively; Log-rank test: P <"
		0.0001). The multivariable Cox proportional hazards model retained only renal
		"replacement therapy [hazard ratio (HR) 3.7, 95% confidence interval (CI)"
		"1.1-13.1; P = 0.04] and Candida mediastinitis (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.1-5.6; P = 0.04)"
		as independently associated with 1-year mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Candida
		mediastinitis is a serious event after cardiac surgery and independently
		associated with 1-year mortality. Further studies are needed to determine whether
		deaths are directly attributable to Candida mediastinitis.

TI	-	Change in species distribution and antifungal susceptibility of candidemias in an
		intensive care unit of a university hospital (10-year experience).
PG	-	325-333
LID	-	10.1007/s10096-020-03994-6 [doi]
AB	-	Candidemia is a nosocomial infection mostly found in critically ill patients. Our
		objectives were to evaluate the change in distribution and resistance profile of
		Candida spp. isolated from candidemic patients in our intensive care unit over
		two 5-year periods spanning 15 years and to evaluate the risk factors. Records
		"from the microbiology laboratory were obtained, from January 2004 to December"
		"2008 and from January 2013 to December 2017, retrospectively. Antifungal"
		susceptibility was performed by E-test and evaluated according to EUCAST
		breakpoints. A total of 210 candidemia cases occurred; 238 Candida spp. were
		"isolated in 197 patients (58.8% male; mean age, 59.2 ± 19.6 years). The most"
		predominant risk factor was central venous catheter use. Species distribution
		"rates were 32%, 28%, 17%, and 11% for C. albicans (n = 76), C. parapsilosis"
		"(n = 67), C. glabrata (n = 40), and C. tropicalis (n = 27), respectively."
		Resistance rate to anidulafungin was high in C. parapsilosis over both periods
		and increased to 73% in the second period. Fluconazole showed a remarkable
		decrease for susceptibility in C. parapsilosis (94 to 49%). The prevalence of MDR
		C. parapsilosis (6%/33%) and C. glabrata (0%/44%) increased in the second period.
		"We observed a predominance of non-albicans Candida spp., with C. parapsilosis"
		being the most frequent and C. glabrata infections presenting with the highest
		mortality. High level of echinocandin resistance in C. parapsilosis and
		increasing prevalences of MDR C. parapsilosis and C. glabrata seem emerging
		challenges in our institution.

TI	-	Type 2 diabetes mellitus and oral Candida colonization: Analysis of risk factors
		in a Sri Lankan cohort.
PG	-	508-516
LID	-	10.1080/00016357.2019.1607547 [doi]
AB	-	Aims: Oral candidiasis is a major oral manifestation of uncontrolled diabetes
		"mellitus, and a number of cofactors are associated with the pathogenesis of this"
		"infection. Here, we describe the prevalence of oral Candida in a Sri Lankan"
		cohort of type 2 diabetes mellitus and risk factors that predispose them to this
		common fungal infection. Methods: A case-control study was conducted in 250
		diabetics with type 2 diabetes and 81 nondiabetic controls. Clinical and
		"demographic data were collected using an interviewer administered questionnaire,"
		and patient records. Oral rinse samples were collected to determine the candidal
		"carriage, and the resultant yeast growth was quantified and speciated using"
		multiplex-PCR and phenotypic analyses. Chi-square test (χ(2) test) and Fisher
		exact test were used for the determination of the significant relationships
		between risk factors and oral candidiasis. Results: The oral prevalence of
		Candida species among both groups was similar (81%) although a significantly
		higher proportion of diabetics (32.8%) yielded >2000 CFU/mL of yeasts compared
		with only 12.3% of the healthy controls (p < .05). Significant associations were
		"noted between oral candidal carriage amongst diabetics, and (i) denture wearing,"
		"(ii) female gender and (iii) cigarette smoking (all, p < .05). Amongst both"
		"groups, C.albicans was the most common Candida species isolated followed by C."
		"parapsilosis, C. tropicalis and C. glabrata. Conclusions: The oral infestation of"
		Candida in our Sri Lankan cohort of diabetics is significantly higher than their
		"healthy counterparts, and co-carriage of multiple yeast species is a common"
		finding in the study population. As there are no previous such reports of the
		"latter phenomenon particularly from the Asian region it is noteworthy, mainly in"
		view of the recent data on the emergence of drug-resistant yeast species the
		world over.

		susceptibility testing with conducted treatment in period from 2011 to the end of
		March 2015. Out of 761 patients who were underwent clinical and mycological
		"examinations, 137 had Candida species isolated from nails. The dominant species"
		"was Candida albicans (C. albicans) (36.59%) followed by C. parapsilosis (23.78%),"
		"C. krusei (9.76%), and C. guilliermondii (6.71%). Antifungal susceptibility in"
		"vitro testing showed good susceptibility to antimycotics, except C. krusei, which"
		was resistance to fluconazole (FCZ) and isolates of C. tropicalis and C. glabrata
		which were dose dependent to itraconazole (ITZ) and fluconazole. Evaluation of
		"medical histories determined that combined therapy, which included pulsed"
		"systemic regimen of ITZ with topical application of clotrimazole, had better"
		clinical outcomes regarding the proscribed only topical application of
		clotrimazole. Multidisciplinary approach of dermatologists and mycologists is
		"required in solving the problem of onychomycosis, which is the dominant nail"
		disease.

TI	-	Fungemia in patients with leukemia.
PG	-	225-32
AB	-	A nine-year retrospective study on fungemia in patients with leukemia was
		conducted. A total of 79 episodes of fungemia in 77 patients with leukemia were
		documented. Candida parapsilosis fungemia was associated more frequently with the
		presence of a central venous line and to the use of parenteral nutrition than the
		"other fungal species (p = 0.00026 and p = 0.01, respectively). The same fungus"
		was isolated from both blood and surveillance cultures in 95% of Candida albicans
		"and in 89% of Candida tropicalis fungemia (p < 0.01 and p = 0.02, respectively)."
		The neutropenia and fungus colonization that resulted was associated
		"significantly with the presence of invasive disease (p = 0.0024 and p = 0.0028,"
		"respectively). Conversely, central venous catheterization and parenteral"
		nutrition appeared to be associated with episodes without deep tissue invasion (p
		"= 0.000037 and p = 0.001, respectively). Invasive mycosis due to the fungus"
		"isolated from blood was documented in 51 patients with a mortality rate of 69%,"
		"whereas in 20 patients without invasive mycosis, mortality rate was 21% (p ="
		"0.000059). In patients with fungemia, related or unrelated to the presence of a"
		"central venous catheter, mortality was 24% and 64%, respectively (p = 0.00042)."
		Mortality was highest with C. tropicalis (p = 0.0017) and lowest with C.
		parapsilosis (p = 0.057). Severe neutropenia (polymorphonuclears < 100/mmc)
		"appeared associated with a higher mortality rate (p = 0.012), whereas the"
		recovery of neutropenia was related adversely to a fatal outcome (p < 0.01). With
		"antifungal therapy, there was no statistically significant difference whether"
		antifungal therapy was given or not.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

		Two Tertiary Care Centers.
PG	-	542-553
LID	-	10.1177/0885066618767835 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive candidiasis is not uncommon in critically ill patients but
		has variable epidemiology and outcomes between intensive care units (ICUs). This
		"study evaluated the epidemiology, characteristics, management, and outcomes of"
		patients with invasive candidiasis at 6 ICUs of 2 tertiary care centers. METHODS:
		This was a prospective observational study of all adults admitted to 6 ICUs in 2
		different hospitals between August 2012 and May 2016 and diagnosed to have
		invasive candidiasis by 2 intensivists according to predefined criteria. The
		"epidemiology of isolated Candida and the characteristics, management, and"
		outcomes of affected patients were studied. Multivariable logistic regression
		analyses were performed to identify the predictors of non-albicans versus
		albicans infection and hospital mortality. RESULTS: Invasive candidiasis was
		"diagnosed in 162 (age 58.4 ± 18.9 years, 52.2% males, 82.1% medical admissions,"
		and admission Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score 24.1 ± 8.4)
		"patients at a rate of 2.6 cases per 100 ICU admissions. On the diagnosis day, the"
		Candida score was 2.4 ± 0.9 in invasive candidiasis compared with 1.6 ± 0.9 in
		"Candida colonization (P < .01). The most frequent species were albicans (38.3%),"
		"tropicalis (16.7%), glabrata (16%), and parapsilosis (13.6%). In patients with"
		"candidemia, antifungal therapy was started on average 1 hour before knowing the"
		"culture result (59.6% of therapy initiated after). Resistance to fluconazole,"
		"caspofungin, and amphotericin B occurred in 27.9%, 2.9%, and 3.1%, respectively."
		The hospital mortality was 58.6% with no difference between albicans and
		"non-albicans infections (61.3% and 54.9%, respectively; P = .44). The independent"
		predictors of mortality were renal replacement therapy after invasive candidiasis
		diagnosis (odds ratio: 5.42; 95% confidence interval: 2.16-13.56) and invasive
		candidiasis leading/contributing to ICU admission versus occurring during
		critical illness (odds ratio: 2.87; 95% confidence interval: 1.22-6.74).
		"CONCLUSIONS: In critically ill patients with invasive candidiasis, non-albicans"
		"was responsible for most cases, and mortality was high (58.6%). Antifungal"
		therapy was initiated after culture results in 60% suggesting low preclinical
		suspicion. Study registration: NCT01490684; registered in ClinicalTrials.gov on
		"February 11, 2012."

PG	-	406-415
LID	-	10.1093/mmy/myx077 [doi]
AB	-	Candidemia is the main invasive fungal disease among hospitalized patients.
		"Several breakthrough candidemia (BrC) cases have been reported, but few studies"
		"evaluate the epidemiology, risk factors, molecular characterization, antifungal"
		"susceptibility profile and outcome of those patients, especially in developing"
		countries and including patients using broad spectrum antifungals. We conducted a
		"retrospective study from 2011 to 2016, including patients aged 12 years or older"
		with candidemia. Epidemiological characteristics and risk factors for candidemia
		were evaluated and compared with patients with BrC using univariate and
		multivariate analysis. Sequential Candida isolates from BrC were identified by
		"internal transcribed spacer sequencing, genotyped with amplified fragment length"
		"polymorphism fingerprinting (AFLP), and tested for antifungal susceptibility."
		"From 148 candidemia episodes, 27 breakthrough episodes (18%) were identified,"
		with neutropenia and mucositis being independent risk factors for BrC. Candida
		non-albicans was more frequent in the BrC group (P < .001). AFLP showed high
		correlation with conventional methods of identification among breakthrough
		isolates and a high genetic similarity among isolates from the same patient was
		observed. C. albicans was the most susceptible species with low MIC values for
		"all antifungal agents tested. In contrast, we found isolates of C. glabrata, C."
		parapsilosis and C. tropicalis resistant to triazoles and echinocandins. In
		"conclusion, BrC occurred mainly in severely immunosuppressed patients, with"
		neutropenia and mucositis. Mortality did not differ between the groups. Candida
		"non-albicans species were more recovered from BrC, with C. albicans being the"
		most susceptible to antifungals.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the prevalence of Candida spp. in
		diabetics and nondiabetics with and without denture stomatitis (DS). STUDY
		DESIGN: Mycologic samples were taken from the dentures of 90 healthy subjects
		"(control group [CG]), 80 denture stomatitis nondiabetics (DSND), and 40 denture"
		stomatitis diabetics (DSD; well controlled type 2) for identification of Candida
		"spp. Results were analyzed by Fisher exact test, Bonferroni-corrected confidence"
		"interval, and χ(2) test (α = .05). RESULTS: Candida albicans was the predominant"
		"species isolated (81.9%; P < .016), with C. tropicalis and C. glabrata"
		"demonstrating similar prevalence (15.71% and 15.24%, respectively). The"
		prevalence of C. albicans and C. tropicalis in the DS groups were significantly
		higher (P < .01) than in the CG. The prevalence of C. tropicalis significantly
		increased with the highest degree of inflammation (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The
		prevalence of Candida spp. was similar between diabetic and nondiabetic patients
		with DS. Candida tropicalis may play a role in the progression of DS.

		other normally sterile sites: results of a 2-year (1996 to 1998) multicenter
		"surveillance study in Quebec, Canada."
PG	-	949-53
AB	-	"During a 2-year surveillance program (1996 to 1998) in Quebec, Canada, 442"
		strains of Candida species were isolated from 415 patients in 51 hospitals. The
		"distribution of species was as follows: Candida albicans, 54%; C. glabrata, 15%;"
		"C. parapsilosis, 12%; C. tropicalis, 9%; C. lusitaniae, 3%; C. krusei, 3%; and"
		"Candida spp., 3%. These data, compared to those of a 1985 survey, indicate"
		"variations in species distribution, with the proportions of C. glabrata and C."
		"parapsilosis increasing by 9 and 4%, respectively, and those of C. albicans and"
		"C. tropicalis decreasing by 10 and 7%, respectively. However, these differences"
		are statistically significant for C. glabrata and C. tropicalis only. MICs of
		"amphotericin B were > or =4 microg/ml for 3% of isolates, all of which were"
		non-C. albicans species. Three percent of C. albicans isolates were resistant to
		flucytosine (> or =32 microg/ml). Resistance to itraconazole (> or =1 microg/ml)
		"and fluconazole (> or =64 microg/ml) was observed, respectively, in 1 and 1% of"
		"C. albicans, 14 and 9% of C. glabrata, 5 and 0% of C. tropicalis, and 0% of C."
		parapsilosis and C. lusitaniae isolates. Clinical data were obtained for 343
		"patients. The overall crude mortality rate was 38%, reflecting the multiple"
		serious underlying illnesses found in these patients. Bloodstream infections were
		"documented for 249 patients (73%). Overall, systemic triazoles had been"
		administered to 10% of patients before the onset of candidiasis. The frequency of
		isolation of non-C. albicans species was significantly higher in this group of
		"patients. Overall, only two C. albicans isolates were found to be resistant to"
		"fluconazole. These were obtained from an AIDS patient and a leukemia patient,"
		"both of whom had a history of previous exposure to fluconazole. At present, it"
		appears that resistance to fluconazole in Quebec is rare and is restricted to
		patients with prior prolonged azole treatment.

AB	-	"Invasive candidiasis has emerged as an important nosocomial infection, causing"
		significant morbidity and mortality especially among critically ill patients. The
		aim of our study was to determine specie distribution and resistance profiles of
		Candida species isolated from blood cultures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted
		a retrospective study of all episodes of candidemia diagnosed in our laboratory
		from January 2006 to May 2009. The susceptibility to antifungal agents of all
		Candida isolates was tested by using a Sensititre(®) YeastOne panel. RESULTS: A
		total of 130 Candida isolates were recovered from blood cultures. Candida
		"tropicalis was the most frequent specie (37.7%), followed by C. albicans (22.3%),"
		"C. glabrata (19.2%), and C. parapsilosis (12.2%). All the isolates were inhibited"
		"by ≤1 μg/ml of amphotericin B and ≤2 μg/ml of caspofungin. For fluconazole, 7.3%"
		of clinical isolates were resistant. It was most active against C. parapsilosis
		"(100% susceptible), C. albicans (95.8% susceptible), and C. tropicalis (94%"
		susceptible). All of the fluconazole-susceptible isolates were susceptible to
		"voriconazole, as were 83.3% of the fluconazole-susceptible-dose-dependent"
		"isolates. Among fluconazole-resistant isolates, 85.7% were susceptible to"
		"voriconazole. CONCLUSIONS: In our institution, C. tropicalis was the most"
		frequent specie isolated from the bloodstream. Caspofungin had an excellent in
		vitro activity against Candida isolates and was the drug of choice among
		fluconazole-resistant isolates.

AB	-	Candidemia is a growing problem in hospitals all over the world. Despite advances
		"in the medical support of critically ill patients, candidiasis leads to prolonged"
		"hospitalization, and has a crude mortality rate around 50%. We conducted a"
		multicenter surveillance study in 16 hospitals distributed across five regions of
		"Brazil to assess the incidence, species distribution, antifungal susceptibility,"
		and risk factors for bloodstream infections due to Candida species. From June
		"2007 to March 2010, we studied a total of 2,563 nosocomial bloodstream infection"
		(nBSI) episodes. Candida spp. was the 7th most prevalent agent. Most of the
		"patients were male, with a median age of 56 years. A total of 64 patients (46.7%)"
		were in the ICU when candidemia occurred. Malignancies were the most common
		underlying condition (32%). The crude mortality rate of candidemia during the
		hospital admission was 72.2%. Non-albicans species of Candida accounted for 65.7%
		"of the 137 yeast isolates. C. albicans (34.3%), Candida parapsilosis (24.1%),"
		Candida tropicalis (15.3%) and Candida glabrata (10.2%) were the most prevalent
		species. Only 47 out of 137 Candida isolates were sent to the reference
		"laboratory for antifungal susceptibility testing. All C. albicans, C. tropicalis"
		and C. parapsilosis isolates were susceptible to the 5 antifungal drugs tested.
		"Among 11 C. glabrata isolates, 36% were resistant to fluconazole, and 64% SDD."
		All of them were susceptible to anidulafungin and amphotericin B. We observed
		that C. glabrata is emerging as a major player among non-albicans Candida spp.
		and fluconazole resistance was primarily confined to C. glabrata and C. krusei
		strains. Candida resistance to echinocandins and amphotericin B remains rare in
		Brazil. Mortality rates remain increasingly higher than that observed in the
		"Northern Hemisphere countries, emphasizing the need for improving local practices"
		"of clinical management of candidemia, including early diagnosis, source control"
		and precise antifungal therapy.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: This paper aimed to identify and quantify Candida on head and neck
		irradiated patients with two comparative elderly populations. MATERIALS AND
		METHODS: Saliva was sampled from 29 head and neck irradiated patients (group 1)
		34 non-institutionalized elderly patients (group 2) and 29 institutionalized
		"elders (group 3) and matched by age. For quantification, the obtained saliva was"
		"sewed on CHROMagar Candida(®), which was used also for presumptive identification"
		"of Candida, API 20C AUX(®), microculture and RAPD (OPE-18) were used for the"
		"final identification. RESULTS: Among the 92 patients surveyed, 51 (55.4%) had"
		"scores classified as positive for Candida, and among individuals of groups 1 and"
		"3, 58.6% had Candida. There was higher positive/carrier conditions (CFU/sample)"
		"in groups 1 and 3, comparing with group 2 (P=0.011). Gender was not associated"
		with Candida portability (P=0.334). Candida portability was significantly
		associated with the presence of candidosis (P=0.031) and xerostomic state
		"(P=0.007). The isolates and definitive confirmed colonies were Candida albicans,"
		"Candida dubliniensis, Candida tropicalis, Candida krusei, Candida glabrata,"
		"Candida parapsilosis, Candida guilliermondii, Candida lusitaniae, and Candida"
		"kefyr. Among the species identified, C. albicans was the most frequent, followed"
		"by C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis and C. glabrata. C. albicans was more prevalent"
		"in group 2 and 3, 45% and 41.2%, respectively, whereas, the most prevalent"
		"species in group 1 were C. tropicalis (27%), C. albicans and C. parapsilosis"
		"(16.2% for both). On multiple statistical models, only radiotherapic treatment"
		was associated with positiveness to Candida. CONCLUSIONS: Diversification and
		major prevalence of non-albicans species were observed in irradiated patients on
		head and neck and this treatment is straightly associated with fungus
		positiveness.

		"During a period of 12 months (2004), all yeasts isolated from the blood cultures"
		of patients with fungaemia admitted at a university hospital of Porto were
		"collected. Demographic and clinical data, as well as haematological and"
		"biochemical profiles, were registered. Antifungal susceptibility was evaluated."
		"The incidence of fungaemia and nosocomial fungaemia were 2.7 and 2 per 1,000"

		"identified. Thirty-five percent of yeast isolates were Candida albicans, followed"
		by C. parapsilosis (25.6%). The mortality rate associated with fungaemia was
		39.3%; the highest values were found in patients with C. glabrata and C.
		tropicalis infection. Seventy-five percent of the fungaemia episodes were
		"nosocomial, with 48% mortality; the main predisposing factors were parenteral"
		"nutrition, gastric protection with omeprazole, surgical drainage and the presence"
		"of central venous catheters (CVCs). Thrombocytopaenia, urinary catheter,"
		gastrointestinal pathology and nosocomial fungaemia were independently associated

		nosocomial fungaemia with high mortality rates. Important predisposing factors
		"were identified, deserving further investigation. Local surveillance is warranted"
		to monitor the incidence of in vitro antifungal resistance.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: There is no data available on the prevalence of oral mucosal lesion
		and candida infection among DM patients which necessitate conducting a local or
		nation-wide study to assess the oral mucosa lesions and candida prevalent in
		"diabetic patients in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. OBJECTIVES: The objective of the"
		"present study was to characterize oral mucosa lesions, and the prevalence of"
		yeasts in diabetic patients and their association with the risk factors in
		comparison with a group of non-diabetic controls. METHODS: Study design: A
		cross-sectional comparative study was conducted assuming 50% of the diabetic
		patients have oral lesions compared to nondiabetic patients and a power of 80%
		"with 5% level of significance, the minimum required sample size was estimated to"
		be 115 in each group. The buccal swabs were collected to isolate Candida species
		from the individual patient with a current and former history of diabetes. The
		laboratory findings were collected and the clinical examination of the oral
		mucosa was processed at the department of microbiology. RESULTS: The results
		inferred a significant presence of oral mucosa alterations in the diabetic group.
		A majority of the patients were suffering from type 2 diabetes for the past 10
		"years. C. albicans was the predominant yeast, followed by. C. tropicalis and C."
		krusei nonalbicans species that were most frequently isolated. Diabetes and
		smoking habit were the two risk factors for oral mucosa alterations. CONCLUSIONS:
		The study found a significant presence of oral mucosa alterations in the diabetic
		group and the fungal infection tended to be more in the diabetic group with a
		high incidence of C. albicans. The presence of diabetes and smoking habit were
		two risk factors identified as significant for oral mucosa alterations. The
		significant variation in education level in groups indicates that education would
		help to enhance the prognosis in diabetic patients and healthcare behavior.

		active surveillance program.
PG	-	1519-27
AB	-	To determine the incidence of Candida bloodstream infections (BSI) and antifungal
		"drug resistance, population-based active laboratory surveillance was conducted"
		from October 1998 through September 2000 in two areas of the United States
		"(Baltimore, Md., and the state of Connecticut; combined population, 4.7 million)."
		"A total of 1,143 cases were detected, for an average adjusted annual incidence of"
		"10 per 100,000 population or 1.5 per 10,000 hospital days. In 28% of patients,"
		Candida BSI developed prior to or on the day of admission; only 36% of patients
		were in an intensive care unit at the time of diagnosis. No fewer than 78% of
		"patients had a central catheter in place at the time of diagnosis, and 50% had"
		undergone surgery within the previous 3 months. Candida albicans comprised 45% of
		"the isolates, followed by C. glabrata (24%), C. parapsilosis (13%), and C."
		tropicalis (12%). Only 1.2% of C. albicans isolates were resistant to fluconazole
		"(MIC, > or = 64 microg/ml), compared to 7% of C. glabrata isolates and 6% of C."
		tropicalis isolates. Only 0.9% of C. albicans isolates were resistant to
		"itraconazole (MIC, > or = 1 micro g/ml), compared to 19.5% of C. glabrata"
		isolates and 6% of C. tropicalis isolates. Only 4.3% of C. albicans isolates were
		"resistant to flucytosine (MIC, > or = 32 microg/ml), compared to < 1% of C."
		parapsilosis and C. tropicalis isolates and no C. glabrata isolates. As
		"determined by E-test, the MICs of amphotericin B were > or = 0.38 microg/ml for"
		"10% of Candida isolates, > or =1 microg/ml for 1.7% of isolates, and > or = 2"
		microg/ml for 0.4% of isolates. Our findings highlight changes in the
		epidemiology of Candida BSI in the 1990s and provide a basis upon which to
		conduct further studies of selected high-risk subpopulations.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of oral candidiasis and multiple oral
		"Candida infections in patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome (SS), and the"
		clinical and drug susceptibility profile. METHODS: Thirty patients with primary
		SS were enrolled in our study. The diagnosis of oral candidiasis was based on the
		"clinical manifestation, and confirmed by a concentrated rinse culture. Candida"
		spp. assessment was accomplished using standard methods: Sabouraud dextrose agar
		with 50 mg/l chloramphenicol and CHROMagar were used for the rapid screening of
		"clinical species, followed by the API 20C system for further species"
		identification. In vitro antifungal drug susceptibility of Candida isolates was
		"determined by the minimal inhibitory concentrations. RESULTS: In our study, 87%"
		"(26/30) of subjects had oral candidiasis, in which 42% (11/26) had multiple"
		"Candida spp. infection. Although C. albicans remains the predominant isolate,"
		"other rare species such as C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, and C."
		"krusei were present, alone or in combination. Chronic atrophic candidiasis is the"
		most common clinical type of oral candidiasis in patients with SS. The
		susceptibilities of the 44 Candida isolates to 7 antifungal agents varied
		"dramatically. The resistance to azoles was remarkable, and the phenomenon of"
		cross-resistance between itraconazole and fluconazole was observed. CONCLUSION:
		Patients with primary SS carry a high risk of oral candidiasis and a high
		frequency of multiple Candida infections. The azole resistance patterns of
		Candida spp. support the necessity for drug susceptibility testing as a routine
		procedure for patients with oral Candida infections.

LID	-	10.1017/S0950268809991531 [doi]
AB	-	The incidence of nosocomial candidaemia was evaluated in a retrospective study in
		"a Turkish tertiary-care hospital. Over a 12-year period (1996-2007), a total of"
		"743 episodes of candidaemia occurred in 743 patients, accounting for an average"
		incidence of 1.9 episodes/1000 admissions and 2.9 episodes/10 000 patient-days
		per year. The annual incidence was almost constant during the study period except
		for 1996 when it was significantly higher in comparison with other years
		"(P<0.05). The most common species isolated was Candida albicans (45%), followed"
		"by C. parapsilosis (26%), C. tropicalis (7%), C. krusei (7%), and C. glabrata"
		(3.5%). A significant increase in C. albicans isolates causing candidaemia linked
		to a decrease in C. parapsilosis isolates in adult patients and C. krusei
		isolates in children was found between the two 6-year study periods. This trend
		reflects improved infection control at Uludağ University Hospital. Ninety percent
		of isolates were susceptible to fluconazole (8 microg/ml) and resistance was
		found only in C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis isolates. Regular local
		surveillance of Candida spp. is important in order to develop empirical treatment
		protocols to reduce the incidence and mortality of candidaemia.

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of
		Candida in the buccal cavity of diabetic and non-diabetic individuals in and
		"around Pondicherry, India and to analyse the antifungal susceptibility profile of"
		"the selected isolates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 400 buccal samples, 200"
		each from diabetic and non-diabetic healthy individuals were included in the
		study. Sabouraud's dextrose agar was used for isolation of Candida species.
		"Identification was performed through microscopy, germ tube test, sugar"
		"fermentation test, sugar assimilation test and by using Hichrome agar. Distinct"
		and phenotypically representative colonies were selected and subjected to ITS
		analysis. In vitro antifungal susceptibility testing for the isolated Candida
		species was performed using E-test. RESULTS: Results revealed that the prevalence
		of Candida species in diabetic individuals was higher when compared with
		non-diabetic healthy individuals. The most predominantly isolated species in
		diabetic and non-diabetic individuals from buccal cavity was Candida albicans.
		C. tropicalis was predominant among the non-albicans Candida isolated from both
		diabetic and non-diabetic individuals. Among denture wearers C. glabrata was
		"predominant. In vitro antifungal susceptibility testing shows that ketoconazole,"
		fluconazole and itraconazole were effective against the isolated Candida species.
		CONCLUSIONS: The rate of candidal carriage in diabetic individuals is higher.
		Different species of Candida are present in the oral cavity of diabetic
		individuals. There may be a positive correlation between glycemic control and
		candidal colonization. In vitro antifungal susceptibility testing of Candia
		species are required for proper management and treatment of candidal infections.

AB	-	Chronic renal disease patients under chronic dialysis (CRDD) have a
		multifactorial immunological deterioration with an increased risk of Candida
		infections. Incidence of Candida infections is increasing. Choice of suitable
		antifungal agents is limited due to the resistance of some species to several
		antifungals. Aim of the present study was to identify the distribution and
		antifungal susceptibility patterns of oral isolated Candida species from infected
		"and colonized patients, as well as to investigate the risk factors for oral"
		"infection in patients on dialysis. Cross-sectional study, approved by the"
		"institutional bioethics committees was performed in CRDD patients. Demographic,"
		"clinic data, and oral mucosa samples were obtained. Infection diagnosis was"
		"established clinically and confirmed with exfoliative cytology, each sample was"
		plated on CHROMagar Candida and incubated at 36°C for 2 days. Yeast species were
		identified by carbohydrate assimilation ID 32C AUX system and the apiweb
		"database. For the antifungal susceptibility test, the M44 A-3 method (CLSI) using"
		"fluconazole (FCZ), miconazole (MCZ), nystatin (NYS), and voriconazole (VCZ)."
		"Study included 119 participants, the main cause of CRD was nephropathy due to DM2"
		"(58%), and three-fourths of the patients were under hemodialysis. Candida"
		"prevalence was 56.3% of 67 colonized or infected patients, 88 isolates were"
		"obtained. Principal identified species were C. albicans (51.1%), C. glabrata"
		"(25%), and C. tropicalis (14.8%). C. glabrata showed a reduced response to FCZ in"
		50% of isolates and C. albicans had a reduced response in 16% of the isolates.
		Antifungal agent with the least efficacious response or with the lowest
		"susceptibility in the isolates of these patients was MCZ, followed by VCZ and"
		"FCZ, whereas NYS induced the best antifungal response."

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Clinical and experimental data suggest an association between the
		presence of bacterial and/or fungal infection and the development of different
		"types of cancer, independently of chemotherapy-induced leukopenia. This has also"
		"been postulated for the development of lung cancer, however the prevalence and"
		"the exact species of the bacteria and fungi implicated, have not yet been"
		described. AIM: To determine the presence of bacterial and fungal microflora in
		surgically extracted samples of patients with lung cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
		"In this single-center prospective, observational study, tissue samples were"
		"surgically extracted from 32 consecutive patients with lung cancer, and"
		reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to identify the
		presence of bacteria and fungi strains. RESULTS: The analysis of the
		electrophoresis data pointed out diversity between the samples and the strains
		that were identified. Mycoplasma strains were identified in all samples. Strains
		"that appeared more often were Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mitis and"
		"Bacillus strains, followed in descending frequency by Chlamydia, Candida,"
		"Listeria, and Haemophilus influenza. In individual patients Legionella"
		pneumophila and Candida tropicalis were detected. CONCLUSIONS: A diversity of
		pathogens could be identified in surgically extracted tissue samples of patients
		"with lung cancer, with mycoplasma strains being present in all samples. These"
		results point to an etiologic role for chronic infection in lung carcinogenesis.
		Confirmation of these observations and additional studies are needed to further
		characterize the etiologic role of inflammation in lung carcinogenesis.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: The frequency of Candida isolates as a cause of hospital infections
		"has risen in recent years, leading to high rates of morbidity and mortality. The"
		knowledge of the epidemiology of those hospital acquired fungal infections is
		essential to implement an adequate antifungal therapy. AIMS: To describe the
		epidemiology of Candida infections in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) from a
		surveillance network in Colombia. METHODS: Information was collected from the
		microbiology laboratories of 20 tertiary healthcare institutions from 10
		Colombian cities using the Whonet® software version 5.6. A general descriptive
		analysis of Candida species and susceptibility profiles focusing on fluconazole
		"and voriconazole was completed between 2010 and 2013, including a sub-analysis of"
		healthcare associated infections (HAIs) during the last year. RESULTS: Candida
		"isolates made up 94.5% of the 2680 fungal isolates considered, with similar"
		proportions for Candida albicans and non-C. albicans Candida species (48.3% and
		"51.7%, respectively). Among the latter, Candida tropicalis (38.6%) and Candida"
		"parapsilosis (28.5%) were the most frequent species. Of note, among the blood"
		isolates C. albicans was not the main species. Most of the species isolated were
		"susceptible to fluconazole and voriconazole. From the HAIs reported, 25.5% were"
		caused by Candida; central line-associated bloodstream infection was the most
		common HAI (58.8%). There were no statistically significant differences regarding
		length of hospital stay and device days among HAIs. CONCLUSIONS: In ICUs of
		"Colombia, non-C. albicans Candida species are as frequent as C. albicans, except"
		in blood samples where non-C. albicans Candida isolates predominate. Further
		studies are needed to evaluate Candida associated risk factors and to determine
		its clinical impact.

AB	-	To investigate the risk factors and outcomes associated with Candida parapsilosis
		"candidemia, a retrospective study was conducted at a tertiary medical center in"
		northern Taiwan. Patients with C. parapsilosis candidemia and corresponding
		"controls with C. albicans candidemia were chosen and their demographics,"
		"comorbidities, risk factors, and clinical outcomes were reviewed. Antifungal"
		susceptibility tests were performed using the Sensititre YeastOne colorimetric
		system. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass
		spectrometry was used to classify the genomic species. Of the 270 candidemias
		"found in 253 patients, C. albicans was the most common Candida species isolated"
		"(43.0%), followed by C. parapsilosis (22.6%), C. tropicalis (17.4%), and C."
		glabrata (10.0%). The 30-day mortality of C. parapsilosis candidemia was
		"significantly lower than that of C. albicans candidemia (21.7% vs. 53.9%,"
		P<0.001). C. parapsilosis was positively associated with antifungal agent
		"exposure [OR 7.261 (95% CI, 1.603-32.879), P=0.010], but negatively associated"
		"with Candida colonization [OR 0.303 (95% CI, 0.123-0.745), P=0.009], and"
		"immunosuppressant use [OR 0.264 (95% CI, 0.099-0.705), P=0.008]. In-hospital"
		mortality was associated with the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score [OR
		"1.255 (95% CI, 1.002-1.573), P=0.048]. The clinical outcomes did not differ"
		across genomic species and in the minimum inhibitory concentrations of
		fluconazole.

AB	-	The incidence of mixed candida/bacterial blood infections (BSIs) has been
		"reported to account for 20% of all cases of candidaemia. However, its clinical"
		characteristics and implications in patients with hematological diseases are not
		clear. We conducted a retrospective case-control study of hematological patients
		complicated with candidaemia over the past 5-year period to identify the risk
		factors and clinical implications of mixed candidia/bacterial BSIs (case group)
		vs. monobacterial candidiasis (control group). Of all 65 enrolled patients with
		"candidaemia, 20 cases (30.8%) met the diagnostic criteria for mixed"
		candida/bacterial BSIs. Candida tropicalis was the most common candida species in
		all patients. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most detected bacteria (35%) in case
		"group. Previous hospital stay ≥ 28 days, organic damage during candidaemia, and"
		positive procalcitonin (PCT) test were the risk factors of mixed
		candida/bacterial BSIs. Cumulative mortality of all patients enrolled was 26.2%
		"at day 30, with significant differences between case and control group. In"
		"multivariate analysis, organic damage and granulocyte recovery were the two"
		predictive factors for 30-day mortality. Mixed candida/bacterial BSIs are fatal
		complications of infection which account for a considerable part of candidaemia;
		multicenter and large-scale clinical studies are required in the future.

PG	-	e17-24
LID	-	10.1086/589298 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive fungal infections pose a serious threat to hospitalized
		"patients worldwide. In particular, the prevalence of clusters of nosocomial"
		infection among patients with candidemia remains unknown. The aim of this study
		was to investigate the molecular epidemiology of candidemia in a nationwide
		setting in Iceland during a 16-year period. METHODS: The genotypes of all
		available fungal bloodstream isolates during 1991-2006 (n = 219) were determined
		by polymerase chain reaction fingerprinting with use of 4 separate primers.
		Clusters were defined as isolation of > or =2 strains with genotypes that had >
		or =90% relatedness in the same hospital within a period of 90 days. RESULTS:
		"Candida albicans represented 61.6% of isolates, followed by Candida glabrata"
		"(13.7%), Candida tropicalis (9.1%), and Candida parapsilosis (8.7%). Polymerase"
		"chain reaction fingerprinting revealed 35 clones of C. albicans, 10 clones of C."
		"glabrata, 7 clones of C. tropicalis, 4 clones of C. parapsilosis, and 5 clones of"
		"Candida dubliniensis. Overall, 18.7%-39.9% of all infections were part of"
		"nosocomial clusters, most commonly caused by C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, and C."
		tropicalis. Most clusters involved 2 cases and disproportionately affected
		patients in adult and neonatal intensive care units (P = .045). The 7-day (16%)
		and 30-day (32%) case-fatality rates among cluster-associated cases did not
		differ statistically significantly from those for sporadic nosocomial infections.
		None of the clusters were identified by the hospital surveillance team.
		"CONCLUSIONS: In an unselected patient population, as many as one-third of all"
		cases of candidemia may be attributable to nosocomial clusters. The risk is
		dependent on hospital wards and patient populations; it is highest in intensive
		care units. Small clusters are not identified by routine hospital surveillance.

AB	-	Vaginal swab samples were collected both from women with signs of acute
		vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC; n=270) and from healthy controls (n=100). The
		microscopic examination revealed a significant difference in the proportion of
		positive cultures of Candida between the VVC (33%) and control (21%) groups. To
		"determine the frequency of different species, positive cultures were analyzed"
		"using the germ tube test, CHROMagar medium, API 20 AUX System and DNA analysis."
		CHROMagar and API 20 AUX System tests identified 67% of samples as C. albicans.
		"Out of these, 42% appeared to be C. dubliniensis when the specific primers in the"
		polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used. We observed the prevalence of Candida
		species isolated from the vagina in descending order as follows: C. albicans
		"(38-39%), C. glabrata (32-33%), C. dubliniensis (28-29%) and C. tropicalis (0-1%)"
		for both the VVC and the control group.

TI	-	Fungal bloodstream infections in tertiary care hospitals in Colombia.
PG	-	74-8
LID	-	10.1016/j.riam.2010.12.002 [doi]
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Fungal infections have increased in critical care patients, causing"
		high morbidity and mortality. AIMS: Describe the frequency and responsible fungal
		species involved in bloodstream fungal infection from 2001 to 2007 in tertiary
		care level hospitals belonging to a surveillance network in Colombian cities.
		METHODS: Data were collected from a microbiology surveillance network based on 27
		hospital laboratories in five Colombian cities. Data were entered into a Whonet®
		version 5.4 database. Fungemia data were analyzed according to location
		(Intensive care unit -ICU- vs. non-ICU services). Frequency over time was also
		described. RESULTS: Fungal infections corresponded to 4.1% of all bloodstream
		infections. Candidemia represented 3.7% and 5.2% of all isolates in non-ICU and
		"ICU services, respectively. Over 99% of the isolates were yeasts, and Candida"
		"albicans was the most frequently isolated organism in and out of the ICU, showing"
		"a decreasing trend in the last few years. In the adult ICU and non-ICU services,"
		"the second organism most frequently isolated was C. tropicalis, while C."
		"parapsilopsis was the most frequent in the pediatric and neonatal ICU, also"
		showing an overall decreasing trend. Cryptococcus neoformans was the fourth
		"mycotic organism most frequently identified. CONCLUSIONS: In Colombia,"
		epidemiology of fungal infections seems to be changing. C. albicans is the
		"principal agent causing bloodstream fungal infection, but an increase of"
		non-albicans species has been observed as well as high frequency of C.
		neoformans.

LID	-	10.1016/j.ijid.2008.04.009 [doi]
AB	-	"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the incidence, risk factors, causative fungi, and"
		"outcomes of fungemia in adult, non-HIV-infected patients. DESIGN: We studied 147"
		episodes of fungemia due to Candida spp and Trichosporon spp in adult patients
		admitted to a university hospital in Northeast Thailand between 1999 and 2003.
		"RESULTS: The overall incidence of fungemia was 14.1 per 10,000 hospital"
		"admissions. Candida was the most common isolate (138 episodes, 93.9%) with"
		non-albicans Candida accounting for 68.7%. The major non-albicans Candida
		isolates were Candida parapsilosis and Candida tropicalis. Fungemia caused by
		"Trichosporon accounted for 6.1% of the cases, but their clinical features could"
		not be distinguished from fungemia due to Candida. The overall in-hospital
		mortality rate was 56.1%. The independent factors related to mortality were high
		"APACHE II score (odds ratio (OR) 1.12 per 1-point increments, 95% confidence"
		"interval (CI) 1.03-1.23), assisted ventilation (OR 3.49, 95% CI 1.04-11.64), and"
		"neutropenia (OR 7.47, 95% CI 1.25-44.74). CONCLUSIONS: Candidemia, especially"
		"that caused by non-albicans Candida, was an important nosocomial infection in"
		"this tertiary care hospital in Northeast Thailand. The mortality rate was high,"
		particularly in patients who were critically ill. Rapid diagnosis and early
		treatment are therefore important challenges for improving clinical outcomes.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To report a case of Candida glabrata and tropicalis pneumonia in an
		immunocompetent patient. CASE SUMMARY: A 72-year-old male was transferred from an
		"outside institution due to worsening respiratory status, acute kidney injury"
		"secondary to intravenous contrast media, sepsis, and pneumonia with fever and"
		"leukocytosis. Upon admission, he was initiated on treatment for hospital-acquired"
		"pneumonia, but was also concomitantly tested for many other opportunistic"
		infections due to his recent month-long trip to Ecuador where he participated in
		a tribal treatment for neuropathy that involved direct exposure to dead guinea
		"pigs. With completion of cultures and bronchoalveolar lavage, C. glabrata was"
		identified in the blood culture and C. glabrata and C. tropicalis in the
		"bronchoalveolar lavage specimen. One month later, he was admitted due to"
		recurrent pneumonia. The patient unfortunately expired during the second
		"admission, due to complications from chronic respiratory pulmonary disease and"
		"pneumonia. DISCUSSION: Initially, this patient was treated for hospital-acquired"
		"pneumonia, but due to a recent trip to Ecuador, it was soon discovered that this"
		patient had developed an invasive Candida pneumonia. His pulmonary biopsies
		"showed growth of invasive C. glabrata and C. tropicalis, while his blood culture"
		showed C. glabrata. Candida-related lower respiratory tract infections are
		exceptionally rare in immunocompetent patients and require histopathologic
		evidence to confirm the diagnosis. A second blood culture showed that the C.
		"glabrata was still present and the patient had worsening leukocytosis, so"
		micafungin was added to his antimicrobial therapy. CONCLUSION: It is understood
		that pneumonia is rarely caused by Candida species in patients who are admitted
		"to the hospital. However, health care professionals should be aware that Candida"
		pneumonia should be suspected as part of the differential diagnosis even in
		"immunocompetent patients, particularly if they have recently traveled outside the"
		United States.

AB	-	Candida tropicalis is the second most common Candida species causing fungaemia in
		"Taiwan, and decreased susceptibility to fluconazole has been reported. This study"
		analysed the clinical characteristics of adult patients with C. tropicalis
		fungaemia and the antifungal susceptibilities of isolates at five tertiary
		hospitals in Taiwan (1 July 2011 to 30 June 2014). A standardised case record
		"form was used retrospectively to collect demographic, clinical and"
		"microbiological characteristics, antifungal treatment and outcomes. MICs of"
		non-duplicate isolates were determined using Sensititre(TM) YeastOne(TM) and were
		interpreted using cut-off values recommended by the CLSI. A total 248 patients
		were diagnosed over the study period; 30-day crude mortality was 52.0%.
		"Multivariate analysis showed that high Charlson comorbidity index ≥4 (OR = 2.09,"
		"95% CI 1.22-3.59; P = 0.008), neutropenia (OR = 4.61, 95% CI 1.42-15.00;"
		"P = 0.011) and treatment with an azole-based regimen (OR = 0.39, 95% CI"
		0.17-0.90; P = 0.028) were significantly associated with 30-day mortality. A
		"total of 33.9% of isolates were non-susceptible to fluconazole (MIC(50), 2 mg/L;"
		"MIC(90), 16 mg/L; MIC range, 0.25 to >256 mg/L), whilst 56.9% to voriconazole"
		"(MIC(50), 0.25 mg/L; MIC(90), 1 mg/L; MIC range, 0.015 to >8 mg/L) according to"
		CLSI clinical breakpoints. There was no significant correlation between overall
		mortality and MICs of fluconazole or voriconazole. This study showed high
		"mortality in patients with C. tropicalis fungaemia, and azole-based antifungal"
		treatment could improve outcomes regardless of fluconazole MICs of infecting
		isolates compared with patients without any treatment within 48 h.

		retrospective study was conducted to describe predisposing factors and outcomes
		of community-onset candidemias. METHODS: Medical records of patients who were
		"admitted to the National Taiwan University Hospital between January 1, 1995 and"
		"May 31, 2005 and had Candida isolated from their blood in the outpatient setting"
		and/or within 48 h of hospitalization (community-onset) were reviewed. RESULTS: A
		"total of 56 episodes of candidemia were reviewed, which included 8 episodes"
		(14.3%) of true community-acquired candidemia occurring in patients with no
		record of hospitalization within the previous 30 days and without histories of
		"invasive procedures either just before or at the time of admission, and 48"
		episodes (85.7%) that were health care-associated. The latter included 24
		episodes (42.9%) in patients recently discharged from hospitals (within 2-30 days
		"of current admission), 23 episodes (41.1%) associated with invasive procedures"
		"and/or central intravascular lines placed for outpatient therapy, and 1 episode"
		(1.8%) in patients admitted from nursing homes. Gastrointestinal bleeding
		"(46.4%), immunosuppressive therapy (42.9%) and previous antibiotics use (37.5%)"
		were the most common predisposing factors. Diabetes was the single most important
		predisposing factor in true community-acquired candidemia (62.5%) and had a
		significantly higher prevalence among these patients than in those with health
		care-associated candidemias (p=0.035). Candida albicans was the most common
		"isolate (39.7%), followed by Candida tropicalis (22.4%) and Candida glabrata"
		"(17.2%). The overall case fatality rate was 55.4% (31/56), and 58.1% (18/31) of"
		this was attributable to candidemia. Multivariate analysis identified higher
		severity score and lack of antifungal therapy as having an independent and
		adverse influence on outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Up to 85.7% of community-onset
		candidemias are health care-associated. There is a conceptual and practical need
		"for a new classification for the spectrum of acquisition of infection, wherein"
		the new category of health care-associated infection will have implications for
		the selection of empirical therapy.

		"rate, epidemiology, and predictors of mortality."
PG	-	570-6
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Studies conducted in tertiary care hospitals of different European
		countries and the United States have shown incidence rates of candidemia ranging
		"from 0.17 to 0.76 and 0.28 to 0.96 per 1,000 admissions, respectively. So far,"
		only 1 study has evaluated the incidence rates of candidemia in tertiary care
		hospitals in Latin American countries. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the epidemiology of
		"candidemia in 4 tertiary care hospitals in São Paulo, Brazil. DESIGN:"
		"Multicenter, laboratory-based surveillance of candidemia. RESULTS: A total of"
		"7,038 episodes of bloodstream infection were identified, and Candida species"
		accounted for 282 cases (4%). The incidence rate of candidemia was 1.66
		"candidemic episodes per 1,000 hospital admissions. Candida albicans was the most"
		"frequently isolated Candida species in all hospitals, but Candida species other"
		"than C. albicans accounted for 62% of isolates, including predominantly Candida"
		parapsilosis and Candida tropicalis. Azole resistance was restricted to only 2%
		of all Candida isolates (1 isolate of Candida glabrata and 4 isolates of Candida
		rugosa). Candidemia was mostly documented in surgical patients with long
		"durations of hospital stay. The crude mortality rate was 61%, and advanced age"
		and high Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score were both
		conditions independently associated with risk of death. CONCLUSIONS: We observed
		in our series a higher incidence rate of candidemia than that reported in
		European countries and the United States. Advanced age and a high Acute
		Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score were factors associated with a
		higher probability of death in candidemic patients. Fluconazole-resistant Candida
		strains are still a rare finding in our case-based study of candidemia.

TI	-	Causative pathogens of fever in neutropenic patients at King Chulalongkorn
		Memorial Hospital.
PG	-	776-83
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Infections cause substantial morbidity and morbidity in neutropenic
		"patients. In King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Gram-negative bacteria"
		remained the most common causative pathogen of febrile neutropenia in all three
		"studies conducted before 2002. However, Gram-positive bacteria have become more"
		"commonly isolated etiologic pathogens, and the incidence of fungal infection has"
		been increasing since 2005. OBJECTIVE: Determine the infectious etiology of fever
		"in neutropenic patients at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok,"
		Thailand. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A retrospective chart review of all medical
		records of febrile neutropenic patients hospitalized at Department of Medicine
		"between January 1 and December 31, 2006 in accompanying with microbiologic,"
		"radiologic, and serologic results was analyzed. RESULTS: There were 125 patients"
		(61 males and 64 females) and 172 episodes of febrile neutropenia with a mean age
		of 46.5 +/- 18.5 years (range: 15-81 years). The three most common primary
		"diseases associated with neutropenia were acute myeloid leukemia, non-Hodgkin's"
		"lymphoma, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (36.6%, 33.1%, and 10.5%). Infections"
		"could be documented microbiologically and clinically in 84 episodes (48.8%), and"
		primary bacteremia or fungemia was the most common cause of infection (40.5%).
		"Gram-negative bacteria were the most frequently isolated pathogens (63.9%),"
		followed by Gram-positive bacteria (29.9%) and fungi (6.2%). Escherichia coli
		(46.8%) and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (27.6%) were the most common
		"isolates among Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, respectively. Among 53"
		"episodes (30.8%) of bloodstream infections, Gram-negative bacteria were the most"
		"commonly isolated pathogens (38 episodes, 71.7%), followed by Gram-positive"
		"bacteria (19 episodes, 35.8%) and Candida tropicalis (1 episode, 1.9%)."
		"Surprisingly, invasive mold infections were noted in eight episodes (5, 1, and 2"
		"episodes of proven, probable, and possible infections, respectively). The overall"
		mortality was 19.2%. CONCLUSIONS: Although Gram-negative bacteria are the most
		"common etiology of fever in neutropenic patients, the occurrence of infections"
		caused by coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and molds has been increasing in
		comparison with the observations from previous studies in King Chulalongkorn
		"Memorial Hospital. To authors knowledge, the present study is the first in"
		Thailand to determine the occurrence of invasive fungal infections using the
		standard criteria recommended by EORTC/MSG.

		care hospitals in Spain.
PG	-	4200-6
LID	-	10.1128/JCM.00920-10 [doi]
AB	-	Candidemia studies have documented geographic differences in rates and
		"epidemiology, underscoring the need for surveillance to monitor trends. We"
		"conducted prospective candidemia surveillance in Spain to assess the incidence,"
		"species distribution, frequency of antifungal resistance, and risk factors for"
		acquiring a Candida infection. Prospective laboratory-based surveillance was
		conducted from June 2008 to June 2009 in 40 medical centers located around the
		country. A case of candidemia was defined as the isolation of a Candida species
		"from a blood culture. Incidence rates were calculated per 1,000 admissions."
		Antifungal susceptibility tests were performed by using broth microdilution assay
		according to the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute.
		"We detected 984 cases, for an overall incidence of 1.09 cases per 1,000"
		admissions. The crude mortality was 20.20%. Candida albicans was the most common
		"species (49.08%), followed by C. parapsilosis (20.73%), C. glabrata (13.61%), and"
		"C. tropicalis (10.77%). Overall, decreased susceptibility to fluconazole occurred"
		"in 69 (7.01%) incident isolates. Antifungal resistance was rare, and a moderate"
		linear correlation between fluconazole and voriconazole MICs was observed. This
		is the largest multicenter candidemia study conducted to date and shows the
		substantial morbidity and mortality of candidemia in Spain.

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to determine the frequency of Candida species in
		women of different age groups as well as to suggest the criteria for the
		diagnosis of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC). STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study of
		"vulvovaginal candidiasis was carried out using laboratory diagnosis, with the"
		estimation of vaginal pH and the direct microscopic and biochemical examination
		of vaginal discharge/secretions. Vaginal cultures for Candida species were
		"collected from 1050 women with vulvovaginal symptoms. RESULTS: Out of 1050 women,"
		"215 (20.47%) were positive for Candida species. Of 215 women, 172 (80%) had pH"
		within the normal range and 167 (77.67%) were showing yeast cells and mycelia on
		"direct microscopic examination. Candida albicans accounted for 46.9% of cases,"
		"Candida glabrata 36.7%, Candida parapsilosis 10.2%, Candida tropicalis 2.8%,"
		"Candida krusei 1.4%, and Candida kiefer 1.9%. The frequency of culture positivity"
		"was related to pregnancy (P<0.001), an increase in parity (P<0.001), and use of"
		oral contraceptives (P<0.001) and antibiotics (P<0.001). The most common signs
		and symptoms in 215 women with positive cultures were pruritus with or without
		vaginal discharge and vaginal erythema. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that
		vulvovaginal candidiasis can only be diagnosed by using clinical criteria in
		correlation with vulvovaginal symptoms and Candida cultures.

AB	-	This pilot study aimed to evaluate the influence of smoking on clinical and
		microbiological parameters after nonsurgical periodontal therapy. Forty-eight
		"subjects were grouped into smokers (SM, n = 24) and nonsmokers (NS, n = 24) and"
		"paired according to gender, age, ethnicity, and periodontal status. Both groups"
		received oral hygiene education and scaling and root planing. Clinical evaluation
		"was performed using plaque index (PI), bleeding on probing (BOP), pocket probing"
		"depth (PPD), gingival recession (GR), and clinical attachment level (CAL) before"
		instrumentation (baseline) and at 3 and 6 months. The prevalence of
		"Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella"
		"forsythia, Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, and Candida"
		dubliniensis in subgingival biofilm was determined by polymerase chain reaction.
		The data were statistically analyzed considering p < 0.05. Clinical conditions
		"improved between baseline and 3 months after periodontal treatment. However, NS"
		"had a better clinical response, presenting greater PPD reduction and CAL increase"
		"in comparison to SM. Periodontal treatment reduced the levels of P. gingivalis,"
		"A. actinomycetemcomitans, and T. forsythia individually after 3 months for the NS"
		group and after 6 months for both groups. The prevalence of Candida species was
		markedly higher in SM than in NS at all time points evaluated.
		Periodontopathogens associated or not with C. albicans or C. dubliniensis were
		more prevalent in SM than in NS at baseline and after 3 months. It was concluded
		that smoking impairs clinical and microbiological responses to periodontal
		therapy. Periodontopathogens combined or not with some Candida species are
		resistant to short-term periodontal therapy in SM.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: The virulence of isolates among different Candida species causing
		"candidemia may play a role in the prognosis of the patients. Furthermore, the"
		potential relationship between genotype and virulence is still unclear and need
		to be further studied. AIMS: We aim to assess the relationship between genotype
		and virulence in Candida species using a Galleria mellonella larvae infection
		model. METHODS: One hundred and ninety-four isolates from 68 clusters (Candida
		"albicans, 114/41; Candida parapsilosis, 74/24; Candida tropicalis, 6/3) were"
		compared against the same number of each species singleton genotypes in terms of
		survival of G. mellonella larvae. RESULTS: The median of survival and the IQR
		"ranges of clusters and singleton were as follows: C. albicans (2 days, IQR 1.5-2"
		"vs. 2 days, IQR 1-2.25), C. parapsilosis (2 days, IQR 1.5-2.6 vs. 2 days, IQR"
		"2-3.3), and C. tropicalis (1 day, IQR 1-3.5 vs. 2 days, IQR 2-3.5; p<0.05). High"
		intra-cluster variability in terms of median of survival was found regardless the
		species. CONCLUSIONS: No relationship between genotype and virulence in Candida
		was observed with the G. mellonella model.

		a 10-year study in a cancer center of North China.
PG	-	76
LID	-	10.1186/s12879-021-05780-x [doi]
LID	-	76
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive candidiasis is the most common fungal disease among
		hospitalized patients and continues to be a major cause of mortality. Risk
		factors for mortality have been studied previously but rarely developed into a
		"predictive nomogram, especially for cancer patients. We constructed a nomogram"
		for mortality prediction based on a retrospective review of 10 years of data for
		cancer patients with invasive candidiasis. METHODS: Clinical data for cancer
		patients with invasive candidiasis during the period of 2010-2019 were studied;
		the cases were randomly divided into training and validation cohorts. Variables
		in the training cohort were subjected to a predictive nomogram based on
		multivariate logistic regression analysis and a stepwise algorithm. We assessed
		the performance of the nomogram through the area under the receiver operating
		characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and decision curve analysis (DCA) in both the
		training and validation cohorts. RESULTS: A total of 207 cases of invasive
		"candidiasis were examined, and the crude 30-day mortality was 28.0%. Candida"
		"albicans (48.3%) was the predominant species responsible for infection, followed"
		by the Candida glabrata complex (24.2%) and Candida tropicalis (10.1%). The
		"training and validation cohorts contained 147 and 60 cases, respectively. The"
		"predictive nomogram consisted of bloodstream infections, intensive care unit"
		"(ICU) admitted > 3 days, no prior surgery, metastasis and no source control. The"
		AUCs of the training and validation cohorts were 0.895 (95% confidence interval
		"[CI], 0.846-0.945) and 0.862 (95% CI, 0.770-0.955), respectively. The net benefit"
		"of the model performed better than ""treatment for all"" in DCA and was also better"
		"for opting low-risk patients out of treatment than ""treatment for none"" in"
		opt-out DCA. CONCLUSION: Cancer patients with invasive candidiasis exhibit high
		crude mortality. The predictive nomogram established in this study can provide a
		"probability of mortality for a given patient, which will be beneficial for"
		therapeutic strategies and outcome improvement.

PG	-	20322
LID	-	10.3402/ljm.v8i0.20322 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candidiasis is the commonest opportunistic fungal infection in
		patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). CD4+ lymphocyte counts
		have been found to be a marker of HIV disease progression. AIM: This study
		"focused on determining the spectrum of Candida isolates in urine, stool, and oral"
		specimens among HIV patients in a tertiary hospital. METHODS: A total of 300
		subjects comprising of 200 HIV patients and 100 non-HIV subjects were used for
		"this study. Three samples (urine, stool, and oral swab) were collected from each"
		subject. Each specimen was processed using standard microbiological techniques
		and emergent Candida isolates were identified with CHROMagar™ Candida and sugar
		fermentation tests. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of Candida colonisation among
		HIV patients was 52.5%. HAART-naive patients had a significantly higher
		prevalence (OR = 3.65; 95% CI = 2.03-6.56; p<0.0001) than their counterpart on
		highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) (OR = 1.99; 95% CI = 1.13-3.50;
		p=0.0232). Female gender was a significant risk factor for acquiring Candida
		infection (OR = 3.40; 95% CI = 1.14-10.13; p=0.0289). The effect of age on
		prevalence of candidiasis was observed among HIV patients on HAART (p=0.0161). A
		CD4+ count <200 cells/µl was a significant risk factor for acquiring candidal
		infection only among HAART-naive patients (OR = 4.37; 95% CI = 1.60-11.95;
		p=0.0042). The five species of Candida recovered from this study were C.
		"albicans, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, and C. glabrata. CONCLUSION:"
		"There is a significant relationship between antiretroviral therapy, CD4+ counts,"
		and the prevalence of candidiasis.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: More than one-third of candidemia episodes occur in Internal Medicine
		Wards (IMWs) but only few studies have focused on this setting and specific data
		"about epidemiology, clinical characteristics and risk factors for mortality are"
		scant. OBJECTIVE: To describe epidemiology and to assess risk factors for
		in-hospital mortality among patients with candidemia in IMWs. METHODS:
		Multicenter retrospective cohort study on patients with candidemia cared for in
		IMWs of an Italian region (Emilia Romagna) from January 2012 to December 2013.
		Non survivors were compared with survivors; variables with p≤0.1 at univariate
		analysis were entered into a multivariate Cox regression model. RESULTS: 232
		patients were included. Overall candidemia incidence was 2.2 cases/1000
		admissions. Candida albicans accounted for 59% of cases. Antifungal treatment was
		"started <24h, 24-72h, and >72h from blood cultures in 47%, 27% and 12% of"
		"patients, respectively; 13.8% of patients received no antifungal treatment."
		"In-hospital mortality was 40%. At multivariate analysis,"
		"chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease (HR 2.72, 95%CI 1.66-4.45, p<0.001) and"
		"isolation of C. tropicalis (HR 2.18, 95%CI 1.19-3.99, p=0.01) were the"
		independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality; central-venous-catheter
		"removal (HR 0.59, 95%CI 0.36-0.96, p=0.03) and adequate and timely (within 72h"
		"from blood drawing) empirical therapy (HR 0.42, 95%CI 0.25-0.69, p=0.001) were"
		protective factors. CONCLUSIONS: The present study conducted in a relatively
		large geographic area confirms high incidence and mortality of candidemia in
		"IMWs, with a worrisome rate of inappropriateness in patient management. Specific"
		interventions aimed to increase awareness of IMWs about candidemia are needed.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Blood cultures are approximately 50% sensitive for diagnosing
		invasive candidiasis. The T2Candida nanodiagnostic panel uses T2 magnetic
		resonance and a dedicated instrument to detect Candida directly within whole
		"blood samples. METHODS: Patients with Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida"
		"parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, or Candida krusei candidemia were identified at"
		14 centers using diagnostic blood cultures (dBCs). Follow-up blood samples were
		collected concurrently for testing by T2Candida and companion cultures (cBCs).
		"T2Candida results are reported qualitatively for C. albicans/C. tropicalis, C."
		"glabrata/C. krusei, and C. parapsilosis. T2Candida and cBCs were positive if they"
		detected a species present in the dBC. RESULTS: Median time between collection of
		"dBC and T2Candida/cBC samples in 152 patients was 55.5 hours (range, 16.4-148.4)."
		"T2Candida and cBCs were positive in 45% (69/152) and 24% (36/152) of patients,"
		"respectively (P < .0001). T2Candida clinical sensitivity was 89%, as positive"
		results were obtained in 32/36 patients with positive cBCs. Combined test results
		"were both positive (T2+/cBC+), 21% (32/152); T2+/cBC-, 24% (37/152); T2-/cBC+, 3%"
		"(4/152); and T2-/cBC-, 52% (79/152). Prior antifungal therapy, neutropenia, and"
		C. albicans candidemia were independently associated with T2Candida positivity
		and T2+/cBC- results (P values < .05). CONCLUSIONS: T2Candida was sensitive for
		diagnosing candidemia at the time of positive blood cultures. In patients
		"receiving antifungal therapy, T2Candida identified bloodstream infections that"
		were missed by cBCs. T2Candida may improve care by shortening times to Candida
		"detection and species identification compared to blood cultures, retaining"
		sensitivity during antifungal therapy and rendering active candidemia unlikely if
		results are negative. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: NCT01525095.

TI	-	Candidaemia in haematological malignancy patients from a SEIFEM study:
		Epidemiological patterns according to antifungal prophylaxis.
PG	-	900-910
LID	-	10.1111/myc.13130 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candidaemia is an important infectious complication for
		haematological malignancy patients. Antifungal prophylaxis reduces the incidence
		of candidaemia but may be associated with breakthrough candidaemia. OBJECTIVE: To
		analyse the Candida species' distribution and relative antifungal susceptibility
		profiles of candidaemia episodes in relation to the use of antifungal prophylaxis
		among Italian SEIFEM haematology centres. METHODOLOGY: This multicentre
		retrospective observational SEIFEM study included 133 single-species candidaemia
		episodes of haematological malignancy patients for whom antifungal susceptibility
		testing results of blood Candida isolates were available between 2011 and 2015.
		Each participating centre provided both clinical and microbiological data.
		RESULTS: Non-Candida albicans Candida (NCAC) species were the mostly isolated
		"species (89, 66.9%), which accounted for C parapsilosis (35, 26.3%), C glabrata"
		"(16, 12.0%), C krusei (14, 10.5%), C tropicalis (13, 9.8%) and uncommon species"
		"(11, 8.3%). C albicans caused the remaining 44 (33.1%) episodes. Excluding 2"
		"C albicans isolates, 23 of 25 fluconazole-resistant isolates were NCAC species"
		"(14 C krusei, 6 C glabrata, 2 C parapsilosis and 1 C tropicalis). Fifty-six"
		(42.1%) of 133 patients developed breakthrough candidaemia. Systemic antifungal
		"prophylaxis consisted of azoles, especially fluconazole and posaconazole, in 50"
		(89.3%) of 56 patients in whom a breakthrough candidaemia occurred.
		"Interestingly, all these patients tended to develop a C krusei infection (10/56,"
		"P = .02) or a fluconazole-resistant isolate's infection (14/50, P = .04) compared"
		"to patients (4/77 and 10/77, respectively) who did not have a breakthrough"
		candidaemia. CONCLUSIONS: Optimisation of prophylactic strategies is necessary to
		"limit the occurrence of breakthrough candidaemia and, importantly, the emergence"
		of fluconazole-resistant NCAC isolates' infections in haematological malignancy
		patients.

TI	-	Identification of Candida strains isolated from Tanzanian pregnant women with
		vaginal candidiasis.
PG	-	226-34
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To identify Candida strains isolated from Tanzanian women (13 to 45
		years) with vaginal candidiasis. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. SETTING:
		"Antenatal clinic in Ilala district hospital in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania from March"
		1998 to December 2000. RESULTS: The identities of the 272 isolates tested with
		"API Candida were: Candida albicans 180(66.2%), Candida tropicalis 13(4.7%),"
		"Candida glabrata 20(7.35%), Candida famata 6(2.2%), Candida parapsilosis 6 (2.2%)"
		and Candida lusitaniae one (0.37%). API Candida could not speciate 43 (15.8%)
		"isolates of these; two (0.7%) fell between C. albicans and C. tropicalis,"
		"17(6.25%) C. lusitaniael, C. guilliermondii/C. famata, 14(5.15%) C. krusei, C."
		"inconspicua, and C. norvegensis and nine (3.3%) either C. parapsilosis, C."
		"krusei, C. incospicua or Geotrichum spp. Four (1.5%) isolates had an assimilation"
		"pattern of Trichosporo spp, but were all germ tube positive and had morphological"
		features on cornemeal agar that were consistent with C. albicans. API 20C AUX was
		"used for testing 29 isolates and results showed: 11/29 (37.9%) C. albicans, 1/29"
		"(3.4%) C. tropicalis, 4/29 (13.8%) C. glabrata, 1/29 (3.4%) C. parapsilosis, 1/29"
		"(3.4%) C. famata, 1/29 (3.4%) C. lusitaniae, 1/29 (3.4%) C. colliculosa/C."
		"magnoliae, 5/29(17.2%) C. albicans/ C. tropicals 2/29 (6.8%) C. norvegensis/C."
		"parapsilosis, and 2/29(6.8%) C. kruseil/C. inconspicua. Results of 20 isolates"
		identified by Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPID) technique showed a 95%
		agreement with API Candida and a 100% agreement with API 20C AUX. CONCLUSION:
		Although most (66.3%) of the species isolated from Dar es Salaam women with
		"vaginal candidiasis were C. albicans, a considerable percentage (33.7%) were"
		"non-albicans, mainly C. glabrata, C. krusei and C. tropicalis. The high"
		prevalence of non-albicans Candida spp observed in this population may have
		therapeutic implications.

AB	-	"OBJECTIVE: Candidaemia is a life-threatening infectious disease, associated with"
		"septic shock, multiple organ failure, and a high mortality rate. In France,"
		reported data on the incidence of ICU-acquired candidaemia and the causative
		Candida species are scarce. The objective of this study was to determine temporal
		trends in epidemiology and risk factors of intensive care unit-acquired
		candidaemia (ICU-Cand) and ICU mortality among a very large population of ICU
		"patients. METHOD: Demographics, patient risk factors, invasive device exposure"
		and nosocomial infection in ICU patient were collected from 2004 to 2013 in a
		national network of 213 ICUs: REA-RAISIN. Incidence and risk factors for
		"candidaemia and ICU mortality were assessed. RESULTS: Out of 246,459 ICU"
		"patients, 851 developed an ICU-cand, representing 0.3 per 1000 patients-days. The"
		incidence rose sharply over time. Candida albicans was the main species. The
		overall and ICU mortality was 52.4% in ICU-cand patients. The main risk factors
		"of ICU-cand were length of stay, severity of illness and antimicrobial therapy at"
		"ICU admission, immune status and use of invasive procedure. ICU-cand was an"
		independent risk factor of mortality (OR: 1.53; 95%CI [1.40-1.70]); in a
		"sub-group analysis, independent effects on mortality were observed with C."
		"albicans (OR: 1.45 [1.23-1.71]), Candida tropicalis (OR: 2.11 [1.31-3.39]) and"
		"""other"" Candida species (OR: 1.64 [1.09-2.45]). CONCLUSION: ICU candidaemia"
		"ranked sixth among bloodstream infections, and its average annual incidence was"
		0.3 per 1000 patients days. Despite of new therapy and international
		"recommendation, the incidence rose sharply during the study period, and ICU"
		mortality remained high.

AB	-	"Many uncommon Candida spp. (species other than C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, C."
		"glabrata, C. tropicalis, and C. krusei) have been shown to emerge in tertiary"
		care facilities. We aimed to investigate these uncommon candidemia in children.
		Forty-six cases of candidemia caused by uncommon Candida spp. were identified
		during 2003-2015 from a medical center in Taiwan. The most common specie was C.
		"guilliermondii (31.2%), followed by C. lusitaniae (18.8%) and C. metapsilosis"
		(18.8%). These cases were analyzed and compared with 148 episodes of C. albicans
		candidemia. The incidence density of uncommon Candida spp. candidemia and the
		proportion to all candidemia episodes increased substantively during the study
		"period. Prior exposure to azoles was uncommon in the 30 days prior to infection,"
		"but fluconazole resistant strains were significantly more common (n = 19, 41.3%)."
		The increased incidence density of uncommon Candida spp. candidemia was
		associated with increasing use of antifungal agents. No differences in
		"demographics, underlying comorbidities, risk factors, clinical features,"
		"dissemination, and 30-day mortality were found between uncommon Candida spp. and"
		C. albicans candidemia. Patients with uncommon Candida spp. candidemia were more
		likely to require modifications in antifungal treatment and receive echinocandin
		"drugs (43.5% vs 21.6%, p = 0.007). Candidemia caused by uncommon Candida spp. had"
		"poorer response to antifungal treatment, led to longer duration of candidemia"
		"(median 4.0 versus 2.5 days, p = 0.008), and had a higher treatment failure rate"
		"(56.5% vs 38.5%, p = 0.040)."

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Studies on candidemia occurring among adults in Southern African are
		limited. We aimed to document the epidemiology of candidemia among adults in
		Soweto. METHODS: This was a retrospective hospital-based study in three discrete
		"periods, involving 9 years, from 1990 to 2007. RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty-six"
		patients were identified. Case rates were 2.8 cases/10 000 admissions in
		"1998-2002 and 3.6 episodes/10 000 hospitalizations in 2005-2007. In 1990, Candida"
		"albicans caused 62% and Candida tropicalis caused 23% of episodes. In 2005-2007,"
		"major species were C. albicans (46%), Candida parapsilosis (25%), and Candida"
		"glabrata (23%), with little change compared to 1998-2002. Major predisposing"
		"conditions were abdominal surgery (43%), HIV infection (19% in 2005-2007), trauma"
		"(16%), diabetes mellitus (12%), and cancer (8%). General wards superseded"
		intensive care as the major diagnostic setting in 2005-2007. The crude mortality
		"was 60%. Among 22 HIV-infected patients with a median CD4 cell count of 68/μl,"
		three were of community-onset. C. albicans caused 73% of cases. Five patients had
		another predisposing condition and five had central venous catheters. The
		mortality was 73%. CONCLUSIONS: Soweto has a pattern of Candida species different
		from other continents. HIV infection and trauma were important predisposing
		conditions.

PG	-	157-61
AB	-	Polymicrobial endocarditis is more frequent in intravenous drug user (IVDU).
		"Combined therapy--medical and surgical--represents the standard of care, but"
		long-term suppressive therapy duration in fungal endocarditis is still debated.
		The polymicrobial endocarditis is rare: 1-3%. It is being observed with
		increasing frequency among drug users; a predominance of tricuspid valve
		involvement exists. We report a case of dual etiology infective endocarditis (IE)
		- Candida tropicalis and Staphylococcus aureus - in a IVDU; the treatment was
		"combined, medical and surgical, and was followed by a suppressive antifungal"
		therapy. We review the other published Candida tropicalis endocarditis cases and
		discuss their optimal management.

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of Candida
		spp. in periodontitis patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS: This
		cross-sectional study included 42 diabetic patients with periodontitis (aged
		21-70 years; 18 males and 24 females). Clinical measurements included probing
		"pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)"
		levels. Sub-gingival samples were collected from the mesio-buccal aspect of 3
		"teeth for fungal analysis. Candida species, including Candida albicans, Candida"
		"dubliniensis, Candida tropicalis and Candida glabrata, were identified using Gram"
		"staining, the germ tube test, CHROMagar, Staib agar and API 20C AUX. RESULTS: The"
		overall prevalence of Candida in diabetic patients with periodontitis observed in
		our study was 52%. The most common spp. of Candida identified were C. albicans
		"(38%), followed by C. dubliniensis (9.5%), C. tropicalis (4.7%) and C. glabrata"
		"(4.7%). Compared to females, male patients were characterized by increased levels"
		of Candida infections. Our results also indicate that individuals over the age of
		40 had increased levels of Candida infections compared to patients younger than
		40. Candida infections were higher among subjects with elevated blood sugar
		levels (HbA1c>9) compared to individuals with well-controlled blood sugar levels
		(HbA1c<6). Patients with PPDs≥5 had an increased risk of Candida infection
		compared to patients with PPDs between 3 and 4. CONCLUSION: This study indicates
		that the frequency of C. albicans is higher than the frequencies of C.
		"dubliniensis, C. tropicalis and C. glabrata in diabetic patients with"
		periodontitis. Candida infections were observed at increased frequencies among
		subjects with high blood sugar levels and PPDs≥5.

AB	-	"The infection rate of arteriovenous (AV) grafts is high, but fungal etiology is"
		rare. Only five cases of graft infection due to Candida albicans (C. albicans) or
		"C. tropicalis have been described in the literature. Herein, we report the first"
		case of AV graft infection caused by C. glabrata. A 60-year-old woman on
		maintenance hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease was admitted because of
		"intermittent fever, for 10 days. Upon physical examination, tenderness over the"
		AV graft site was noticed. Blood culture yielded C. glabrata and her clinical
		"symptoms improved after she was treated with micafungin for 1 month. However, C."
		glabrata candidemia reoccurred 5 weeks later. Cure was achieved after removal of
		"the AV graft and anidulafungin treatment. Pus was observed in the removed graft,"
		from which C. glabrata was isolated. The outcome of our case and patients from
		the literature review suggest that removal of the infected graft is important for
		treatment success of AV graft Candida infection.

AB	-	This study presents data on the incidence of candidemia in a Portuguese oncology
		hospital during a 6-year period. The species distribution and their antifungal
		"susceptibility, as well as the clinical outcomes associated with candidemia were"
		"evaluated. A total of 119 episodes were reported, with the majority occurring"
		among patients older than 56 years. The most common underlying medical conditions
		were solid tumors (64.5%) and hematological disease (28.2%). The most frequent
		"species found was Candida albicans (48.7%), followed by C. parapsilosis (20.2%),"
		"C. tropicalis (8.4%), C. krusei (6.7%) and C. glabrata (5.0%), but Saccharomyces"
		cerevisiae and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa were also isolated. Candida albicans was
		more frequently associated with solid tumors of the gastrointestinal and
		"genitourinary tracts and breast (P=0.005), while non-C. albicans Candida species"
		were most frequently recovered from hematological patients (P=0.007). The
		mortality rate associated with candidemia was 31.9% (P=0.016). All C. albicans
		"and C. parapsilosis isolates were susceptible to fluconazole, voriconazole and"
		itraconazole. Resistance to caspofungin was only observed in C. albicans and in
		the R. mucilaginosa isolates. Posaconazole was active against all C. parapsilosis
		"isolates tested but resistant strains were found among C. albicans (4.9%), C."
		"tropicalis (12.5%), C. krusei (25%) and C. glabrata (50%). This study provides"
		useful information regarding the local epidemiology of candidemia in cancer

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: It was aimed to investigate the frequency of Candida infections
		"(CI) in the intensive care units (ICU), to determine typing of candida to"
		"evaluate risk factors associated with CI and mortality, and to evaluate influence"
		of CI on mortality. METHODS: The prospective cohort study was carried out between
		"Jan 1, 2009 and Dec 31, 2010 in ICUs, and the patients were observed with active"
		"surveillance. VITEK 2 Compact System (BioMerieux, France) kits were used for the"
		identification of isolates from various clinical samples. RESULTS: A total of
		2362 patients had enrolled for 16135 patients-days into the study. During the
		"study, 63 (27,5%) of patients developed 77 episodes of CI were observed. Of the"
		"patients; 54% were male, 46% were female. Duration of hospitalization (OR = 1,03,"
		"p = 0,007), hyperglycemia (OR = 17,93, p = 0,009), and co-infections (OR = 3,98,"
		"p = 0,001) were identified as independent risk factors for CI. The most common"
		infections were bloodstream (53%). 77 of 135 candida strains was isolated as
		"causative pathogens. C. albicans (63,6%) was the most frequent species. Overall"
		mortality rate was 78%. The rates of mortality attributable to CI and candidemia
		"were 27%, and 18,3% respectively. Species- specific mortality rates of C.albicans"
		"and C.tropicalis were determined as 12%. High APACHE II scores (OR = 1,37; p ="
		"0,002), and the use of central venous catheter (OR = 9,01; p = 0,049) were"
		assigned as independent risk factors for mortality. CONCLUSION: CI is an
		important problem in our hospital. CI and associated mortality can be prevented
		by controlling of risk factors. Updating of epidemiological data is required for
		successful antifungal treatment.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate role of Candida colonization in development of candidemia
		and to identify risk factors associated with Candida colonization and candidemia
		in children treated for severe sepsis or septic shock in a pediatric intensive
		care unit (PICU) for >5 days. DESIGN: Prospective observational. SETTING: PICU of
		"a tertiary care teaching hospital. SUBJECTS: Of 186 children, aged 1 month to 14"
		"yrs, consecutively admitted to PICU for severe sepsis or septic shock, 65"
		patients having a stay of >5 days. INTERVENTIONS: Clinical and demographic data
		at admission and variables likely to influence Candida colonization were
		"recorded. Oropharyngeal, rectal, and skin (groin) swabs were taken on days 0, 2,"
		"5, and 7 of admission. Blood for fungal culture (two samples 48 hrs apart) was"
		obtained if a patient developed signs of sepsis. The yeast growth was identified
		by conventional methods. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
		"were calculated, and multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted."
		MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Colonization by Candida species occurred in 45
		(69%) patients. Oropharyngeal (52%) and rectal (43%) colonization was more common
		"than skin (34%) colonization. The colonizing species were C. tropicalis (34.2%),"
		"C. parapsilosis (28.8%), C. albicans (14.4%), and others. Use of central venous"
		catheters was the only independent predictor of colonization on multivariate
		logistic regression (OR 4.1; 95% CI 1.01-17.1). Twenty (30.2%) patients developed
		"candidemia; 18 (90%) of them were colonized, 15 (75%) with the same Candida"
		species. Independent predictors of candidemia on multivariate stepwise logistic
		"regression analysis were presence of colonization (OR 5.1; 95% CI 1.01-25.6, p ="
		".048) and Pediatric Risk of Mortality score (OR 1.3; 95% CI 1.02-1.6, p = .034)."
		CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring for colonization with Candida species in children
		undergoing treatment for severe sepsis or sepsis shock in PICU for >5 days may
		offer opportunity for early intervention for prevention of candidemia.

TI	-	Candidemia in HIV-infected subjects.
PG	-	478-83
AB	-	The epidemiological features of 37 episodes of candidemia in HIV-infected
		subjects were analysed in a retrospective matched case-control study conducted
		over an 8-year period (1990-1997). Univariate analysis identified eight risk
		factors that were significantly associated with candidemia (P<0.05): i) use of
		central venous catheters; ii) administration of total parenteral nutrition; iii)
		previous antifungal therapy; iv) previous therapy with glycopeptides; v) presence
		of oral/ esophageal candidiasis; vi) concomitant bacterial infections; vii)
		neutropenia; and viii) concomitant AIDS dementia complex. Stepwise logistic
		regression analysis revealed that the only independent risk factor for developing
		candidemia was the use of central venous catheters (P = 0.0001). Candida albicans
		"was the most frequently isolated pathogen, accounting for 18 (48%) episodes of"
		"candidemia, followed by Candida tropicalis (19%) and Candida glabrata (11%). The"
		crude mortality rate was 62%. On univariate analysis concomitant opportunistic
		"infections, presence of non-Candida albicans species of Candida and neutropenia"
		were shown to be predictive of death. Multivariate analysis revealed that the
		presence of non-Candida albicans strains of Candida was the only significant
		"factor associated with a worse prognosis (P = 0.001). In conclusion, candidemia"
		appears to be more common in patients with advanced HIV disease. Of the factors
		"which influenced the onset of candidemia, use of central venous catheters seemed"
		to be the most important one.

TI	-	Fungal eye disease at a tertiary care center: the utility of routine inpatient
		consultation.
PG	-	1671-6
LID	-	10.1016/j.ophtha.2011.01.038 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: Hematogenous dissemination of fungus of the eyes can manifest as
		chorioretinitis or endophthalmitis. Early reports of this condition describe the
		"prevalence to range from 10% to 40%; however, more recent studies have suggested"
		"a declining prevalence, presumably because of widespread use of prophylactic"
		antifungal therapy and earlier diagnosis and treatment of systemic illness before
		ocular symptoms become apparent. This study estimates the current prevalence and
		microbial profile of fungal chorioretinitis and endophthalmitis among patients
		with positive fungal cultures at a tertiary care medical center. DESIGN:
		Retrospective case series. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 211 adult and pediatric
		inpatients with fungemia. METHODS: All inpatient consultations at our institution
		"to evaluate for ocular involvement by fungal organisms from June 3, 2006, to"
		"September 3, 2009, were reviewed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The presence or absence"
		of ocular lesions consistent with disseminated fungus. RESULTS: A total of 211
		"patients (83 pediatric, 128 adult) had consult requests indicating concern for"
		ocular fungal infection. More than 97% of these patients had at least 1 positive
		"fungal culture. In decreasing order of frequency, the organisms identified were"
		"Candida albicans, C. parapsilosis, C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, and others. More"
		than 98% of all patients were receiving systemic antifungal therapy (average
		duration 6.5 days) at the time of examination. No pediatric patients and only 2
		"adult patients had positive findings (i.e., chorioretinitis or endophthalmitis);"
		1 of these 2 patients was able to verbalize symptoms and reported floaters and
		"blurring, whereas the other patient was unable to verbalize. Visual symptoms were"
		rare (3.5%) among patients with negative findings who could verbalize visual
		symptoms. Three adults had nonspecific fundus lesions that were considered
		inconsistent with chorioretinitis. CONCLUSIONS: Disseminated ocular fungal
		infection is rare in the current era of widespread prophylactic antifungal
		therapy. Less than 1% of patients in our study had ocular involvement from
		"fungus, and no patients who were asymptomatic had involvement. We suggest that"
		routine ophthalmic consultation on fungemic inpatients is not an efficient use of
		"clinical resources; however, validation of these findings via a prospective study"
		is desired. FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE(S): The author(s) have no proprietary or
		commercial interest in any materials discussed in this article.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candida yeasts are considered the main agents of nosocomial fungal
		infections. AIMS: This study aimed to establish the epidemiological profile of
		"patients with candiduria hospitalized in the capital of the State of Mato Grosso,"
		in the Central-Western region of Brazil. METHODS: Patients from three private
		hospitals and a public hospital participated in the study. This was an
		observational and cross-sectional study including analysis of patients mortality.
		It was carried out from March to August 2015. RESULTS: A total of 93 patients
		with candiduria were evaluated. Candida tropicalis was found most commonly
		"(37.6%; n=35), followed by Candida albicans (36.6%; n=34), Candida glabrata"
		"(19.3%; n=18), psilosis complex (4.3%; n=4), Candida lusitaniae (1.1%; n=1) and"
		Candida krusei (1.1%; n=1). Antibiotic therapy (100%) and the use of an
		indwelling urinary catheter (89.2%; n=83) were the most frequent predisposing
		"factors. Antifungal treatment was given to 65.6% of the patients, and"
		anidulafungin was the most used antifungal. Mortality rates were 48% higher among
		patients with candiduria who had renal failure. Micafungin was the antifungal
		most prescribed among the patients who died. Candidemia concomitant with
		candiduria occurred in eight (8.6%; n=8) cases. Considering the species recovered
		"in the blood and urine, only one patient had genetically distinct clinical"
		"isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Non-C. albicans Candida species were predominant, with C."
		tropicalis being the most responsible for most cases of candiduria.

AB	-	To describe the incidence and susceptibility profile of Candida bloodstream
		"infections in a tertiary-care hospital, we performed a retrospective"
		observational study from 1998 to 2007. Comorbidities and risk factors were
		"compiled from all cases. In vitro susceptibility testing to fluconazole,"
		"itraconazole, voriconazole, and amphotericin B was performed for 100 isolates,"
		and caspofungin was tested for C. parapsilosis complex. In a ten-year evaluation
		"of candidemias, 44 % were caused by C. albicans, and species of the C."
		parapsilosis complex were the second most frequent agents (37 %). Other species
		"presented lower incidences (C. tropicalis, 13 %, C. glabrata, 5 %, and C. krusei,"
		1 %). Neither C. dubliniensis nor C. metapsilosis were observed in this study. C.
		orthopsilosis (3 %) and C. parapsilosis stricto sensu (34 %) were also found.
		"Species distribution was independent of catheterization, mechanical ventilation,"
		or previous use of antifungals or corticoids. Parenteral nutrition administration
		"was strongly related to C. glabrata infection, and the highest mortality (80 %)"
		was observed in patients infected by this species. All C. albicans isolates
		"showed high susceptibility to all tested drugs. However, two C. parapsilosis"
		stricto sensu isolates presented high minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) (4
		"mg/L each) to fluconazole, and one exhibited voriconazole MIC of 0.25 mg/L,"
		highlighting the cross-resistance to these azoles. All isolates of C. tropicalis
		and C. glabrata showed no resistance to any drug tested. No difference was noted
		between C. parapsilosis and C. orthopsilosis susceptibilities to caspofungin. Our
		"results suggest that resistance to amphotericin B, fluconazole, voriconazole,"
		"itraconazole, and caspofungin in Brazilian Candida bloodstream isolates is still"
		uncommon.

		candidemia were identified. The Candida species isolated were Candida tropicalis
		"(48.4%), C. albicans (29.7%), C. guillermondii (14.1%), C. krusei (6.3%), and C."
		glabrata (1.6%). Thirty-three patients were detected by a high-risk surveillance
		"blood culture, whereas 31 patients were detected while undergoing septic workup."
		Sixteen (25%) patients were asymptomatic; they recovered without any antifungal
		"therapy and without any sequelae. Of 48 symptomatic patients, 11 died before"
		institution of antifungal therapy; 37 received oral itraconazole (10
		mg.kg(-1).day(-1)). Seven (19%) of these 37 patients died. Those who recovered
		"had sterile culture on average by day 14 (range, 4-30) and received the"
		"antifungal therapy on average for 24 days (range, 9-42 days). Overall mortality"
		"rate was 28.1%, and bivariate analysis showed significant association with"
		"Pediatric Risk of Mortality score (p =.0001), presence of symptoms (p =.003),"
		isolation of nonalbicans Candida in general (p =.04) and C. tropicalis
		"specifically (p =.001), and failure to give presumptive antifungal therapy (p"
		"=.055). On multivariate analysis, Pediatric Risk of Mortality score and isolation"
		of C. tropicalis were the only significant predictors of mortality. CONCLUSIONS:
		Nonalbicans Candida accounted for 70% of candidemia in a pediatric intensive care
		unit. High-risk surveillance blood cultures aided diagnosis in about half the
		patients. Severity of illness and isolation of C. tropicalis were significant
		predictors of mortality.

TI	-	Factors associated with candiduria and related mortality.
PG	-	450-5
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Although candiduria and bacteriuria have many attributes in common,"
		little data is available regarding factors associated specifically with
		"candiduria. Despite the high mortality in subjects with candiduria, factors"
		associated with such mortality have not been studied. METHODS: We undertook a
		single-center case-control study to evaluate factors associated with candiduria
		over a 10.5 month period. Cases and controls were prospectively recruited from
		"hospitalized subjects with candiduria and bacteriuria, respectively. A subgroup"
		analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mortality following
		"candiduria. RESULTS: Among 145 subjects with candiduria, Candida tropicalis"
		"(30.5%) and other non-albicans species accounted for 71% of isolates. Among them,"
		clinical characteristics and associations were studied among 80 hospitalized
		"subjects. Prior antimicrobial use was documented in 92% with candiduria, with"
		cephalosporins used most commonly. Independent associations with candiduria were
		demonstrated for use of antimicrobial agents in the preceding 30 days (odds ratio
		(OR) 8.1; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1-31.9) and plasma glucose > 180 mg/dL
		(OR 3.1; 95% CI 1.1-9.1). Death occurred among 21 (26.2%) subjects with
		candiduria. Factors associated with death included use of urinary diversion
		"devices (OR 8.8; 95% CI 1.1-70.5), > or = 2 classes of antimicrobials (OR 4.1;"
		"95% CI 1.2-13.9), intensive care (OR 3.3; 95% CI 1.1-9.3), and renal failure (OR"
		2.9; 95% CI 1.1-8.2). CONCLUSIONS: Many risk factors traditionally linked to
		candiduria may be associated with urinary tract infections in general. Factors
		"which predicted occurrence of candiduria, as opposed to bacteriuria, included"
		prior use of antimicrobial agents and elevated plasma glucose. Since factors
		found to have associations with death in candiduria were those expected in
		"seriously ill patients, the high mortality may be a function of the severity of"
		underlying diseases.

AB	-	Fungal peritonitis (FP) is a rare complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD).
		Candida tropicalis infections are rarely reported in literature. The authors
		present the first case of FP with peritoneal abscess due to C. tropicalis in a
		22-year-old woman admitted to our hospital with septic shock. Abdominal
		tomography demonstrated an abscess in peritoneal space and intraluminal bubble
		appearance in femoral venous and arterial circulation. PD fluid specimens and
		matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry
		(MALDI-TOF MS) analysis revealed fungus growth of C. tropicalis. Fluconazole
		therapy was administered accompanied by catheter removal and mechanical
		ventilation with vasopressor support. The patient recovered after 23 days of
		hospitalization and was discharged. FP represents high mobility and mortality
		unless infection source control and appropriate antimicrobial therapy are
		implemented accompanied by PD catheter removal. The use of MALDI-TOF MS for
		PD-related peritonitis pathogen identification can promote early identification
		"and appropriate antibiotic therapy, especially in C. tropicalis infection."

PG	-	e40-4
LID	-	10.1097/INF.0000000000000039 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Active surveillance is necessary for improving the management and
		outcomes of patients with candidemia. The aim of this study was to describe the
		epidemiologic and clinical features of candidemia in pediatric patients in Latin
		"America. METHOD: Prospective, multicenter, surveillance study of candidemia in a"
		pediatric population from 23 hospitals in 8 Latin America countries between
		November 2008 and October 2010. RESULTS: Three hundred and two cases of
		candidemia were reported with a median incidence of 0.81/1000 admissions. Eighty
		"nine (29%) were neonates. The main risk factors were prematurity, intensive care"
		"unit (ICU) admission, parenteral nutrition, respiratory disease and mechanical"
		"ventilation in neonates and malignancy, neutropenia, neurological disease and"
		previous use of corticosteroids in children. The main species isolated in
		"neonates and children were Candida albicans (43.8% and 35.7%), Candida"
		"parapsilosis (27.0% and 26.3%) and Candida tropicalis (14.6% and 14.6%),"
		respectively. The most frequent antifungal therapy used in neonates and children
		was deoxycholate-amphotericin-B (43.8% and 29.1%) and fluconazole (28.1% and
		53.1%). Seventeen neonates (19.1%) and 20 children (9.4%) did not receive
		antifungal therapy. The 30-day survival rate was 60% in neonates and 72% in
		children (P = 0.02). Survival was significantly higher in treated than in
		nontreated neonates (72% vs. 24%; P < 0.001). A multivariate analysis showed that
		independent predictors for 30-day mortality in children were renal disease (odds
		"ratio: 4.38, 95% confidence interval: 1.92-10.1, P < 0.001) and receipt of"
		"corticosteroids (odds ratio: 2.08, 95% confidence interval: 1.04-4.17, P = 0.04)."
		"CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first prospective, multicenter"
		surveillance study of candidemia in children in Latin America. This epidemiologic
		"information may provide us with methods to improve preventive, diagnostic and"
		therapeutic strategies in our continent.

AB	-	"Candida osteomyelitis is associated with significant morbidity; however, data on"
		the management of Candida osteomyelitis are limited. The Prospective Antifungal
		"Therapy (PATH) Alliance® registry is a comprehensive, multicenter, prospective,"
		observational registry that collected data on patients with invasive fungal
		infections between 2004 and 2008. The aim of this descriptive analysis was to
		"evaluate the clinical characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of patients with"
		"Candida osteomyelitis. Using the PATH Alliance® registry, we performed a review"
		of all patients with a proven diagnosis of Candida osteomyelitis who received a
		minimum of 14 days of antifungal treatment and/or a therapeutic surgical
		"intervention (n = 53). The epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes of"
		these patients were assessed at 12 weeks. C. albicans (56.6 %) was the most
		"commonly identified organism, followed by C. parapsilosis (18.9 %), C. glabrata"
		"(9.4 %), and C. tropicalis (9.4 %). The mean treatment duration was 54.9 days."
		Multiple different treatment regimens were administered to patients. These
		"included fluconazole (56.0 %), echinocandins (29.3 %), amphotericin B"
		"formulations (10.7 %), and voriconazole (4.0 %). Twenty-eight patients (52.8 %)"

		"(20.8 %), and worse in one (1.9 %); three (5.7 %) patients had unknown response."
		"The 12-week survival rate was 93.8 %. In summary, C. albicans was the predominant"
		"pathogen, and fluconazole was the most commonly administered agent. However,"
		treatment patterns vary and remain non-standardized. Concurrent candidemia was
		"infrequent, and 12-week survival was notably good in this series of 53 patients"
		with Candida osteomyelitis.

AB	-	Candida species are common in the human oral microbiota and may cause oral
		candidiasis (OC) when the microbiota equilibrium is disturbed. Immunosuppressed
		individuals are susceptible to oral infections as individuals with Down syndrome
		"(IDS) due to particularities of their mouth morphoanatomy, saliva and"
		comorbidities. This study aimed to analyze the molecular epidemiology of Candida
		spp. from the oral cavity of IDS and their relatives. A case-control study with
		80 IDS and 80 non-syndromic (non-DS) was evaluated by oral swab collection for
		"culture on Sabouraud dextrose agar, selection of yeast colonies to Gram staining"
		and culturing on chromogenic media. DNA extraction was performed with the
		phenol/chloroform method for screening of 6 Candida species medically important
		"in PCR, applying SPSS for statistics. We confirmed four species in 46 IDS without"
		"use of antimicrobials (57.54%), with a high prevalence of C. albicans/Ca"

		"colonized by species other than C. albicans: Ca + Cg (16), Ca + C. tropicalis/Ct"
		(7) and Ca + C. krusei/Ck (2). Only 10 non-DS were colonized by one species
		"(11.25%): 6 C. albicans, 2 C. glabrata, 1 C. tropicalis and 1 C. krusei. Previous"
		"OC was reported by 39 IDS (48.75%), being 33 positives for Candida spp. (84.61%)"
		and 17 with active OC (21.25%). Five non-DS reported OC previously and had no

PG	-	587-90
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To describe an outbreak of Candida tropicalis fungemia in a neonatal
		"intensive care unit (NICU), to evaluate the risk factors associated with this"
		infection and the possible mode of nosocomial transmission. DESIGN: Descriptive
		and case-control study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Surveillance cultures were taken
		"from hospitalized patients, personnel, and inanimate objects in the NICU. Six"
		patients with C tropicalis fungemia (cases) were compared with C tropicalis
		culture-negative patients matched for duration of exposure to the NICU
		"(controls). RESULTS: During a five-month period, C tropicalis was isolated from"
		29 blood cultures of six premature infants. The same organism also was isolated
		"from fingernail samples taken from the ward housekeeper, who had a mild"
		"onychomycosis, and an asymptomatic nurse. Other potential reservoirs of C"
		tropicalis were not identified among all the other infants or in the hospital
		environment. The six patients with C tropicalis fungemia were more likely to have
		"received a larger number of antibiotics (4.0 versus 1.8, P < 0.001) and to have"
		been subjected to a longer duration of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) therapy
		"(8.5 versus 2.67 days, P = 0.004) than the controls. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of"
		fungemia in this outbreak can be attributed to a larger number of antibiotics and
		a longer period of TPN administered to the patients. Analysis of events suggests
		that the outbreak may have been the result of cross-infection between staff and
		patients.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candida is the commonest opportunistic fungi in human. Candida
		species cause diverse types of diseases. Vaginal candidiasis has been reported as
		one of the most common type of fungal diseases among pregnant women. However; In
		"Ethiopia, due to scarcity of data, much has not been documented regarding the"
		prevalence of Candida among pregnant women. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to
		"determine the prevalence, possible risk factors and antifungal susceptibility"
		profile of Candida species among pregnant women attending Debre Markos Referral
		"Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was conducted from"
		February to May 2017. A total of 384 pregnant women were included using a
		"systematic random sampling technique. Vaginal specimens were collected,"
		inoculated on Candida HiV eg culture Medium and incubated at 37 °C for
		24 h.Colonies were identified using standard microbiological methods and selected
		for further Candida Species identification using Hi Chrome agar and germ tube
		test. Fungal suspensions were made and adjusted at 0.5% MacFarland standard.
		Modified Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion technique was used for antifungal
		"susceptibility. Data was entered, cleaned using Ep info version 7.1and"
		transported to Statistical Packages for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21 for
		analysis. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were performed. P. value
		< 0.05 at 95% confidence interval was considered as statistically significant.
		"RESULT: From a total of 384 study participants, 96 (25%) were positive for"
		Candida species. The predominant Candida species was Candida albicans 54(56.25%)
		"followed by Candida krusei 21(21.9%), Candida glabrata 17(17.7%), Candida"
		tropicalis 1(1%) and 3(3.1%) were other Candida species. Contraceptive use (AOR:
		0.394; 95% CI = 0.20-0.74) and prolonged antibiotic uses (AOR: 0.393; 95%
		CI = 0.21-0.72) were risk factors. All isolates except Candida krusei were 100%
		susceptible to amphotericin-B. Resistance rate was high against itraconazole and
		Ketoconazole 55(57.3%). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of Candida species among
		symptomatic pregnant women was significantly higher than asymptomatic pregnant
		women. Age group between 26 and 40 years was significantly associated with
		Candida infection. Amphotericin B was the most sensitive antifungal drug. High
		rate of multiple drugs resistant Candida species was detected. Therefore
		Symptomatic women should be routinely screened and treated.

TI	-	Risk factors for candidemia-related mortality at a medical center in central
		Taiwan.
PG	-	155-61
AB	-	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Bloodstream infections due to Candida spp. are associated
		with significant mortality and morbidity. This study analysed the epidemiology
		and outcome of candidemia cases in a teaching hospital in central Taiwan.
		METHODS: We retrospectively studied the clinical characteristics and antifungal
		susceptibility of isolates and risk factors for mortality in 91 cases of
		"candidemia treated from January 1, 2001 to June 30, 2003. RESULTS: The mean age"
		"of the patients was 67 years (range, 30-90 years). Three episodes (3%) were"
		community acquired. Adequate antifungal therapy was given to 78 patients (78%).
		Cancer (38.5%) and diabetes mellitus (36.3%) were the 2 most common underlying
		diseases. The most frequent risk factors identified for candidemia were prior
		"broad-spectrum antibiotic use (84.6%), central venous catheterization (83.5%) and"
		Candida colonization (79.5%). The most frequent isolates were Candida albicans
		(64.8%) and Candida tropicalis (19.8%). All of the C. albicans and C. tropicalis
		isolates were sensitive to fluconazole (minimal inhibitory concentration <or=8
		microg/mL). Susceptibility to amphotericin B and fluconazole was found in 96.7%
		"(88/91) and 95.6% (87/91) of Candida spp., respectively. Risk factors for"
		mortality due to candidemia in the univariate analysis included central venous
		"catheterization, shock, and high Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation"
		II (APACHE II) score. APACHE II score was the only independent prognostic factor
		in the multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Candidemia has a high mortality rate
		and C. albicans remains the most common isolate. Fluconazole and amphotericin B
		maintained good in vitro antifungal activity against Candida spp. APACHE II score
		was the only independent factor for mortality in patients with candidemia.

PG	-	2023-9
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: This study determines whether the spectrum, risk factors, and outcome"
		of invasive candidiasis in liver transplant recipients have changed. METHODS:
		Thirty-five consecutive liver transplant recipients with invasive candidiasis
		"were prospectively studied in a case-controlled, multicenter study. One control"
		was matched with the case for duration of hospitalization and the other for
		antibiotic use so that risk factors unique in liver transplantation could be
		"elicited. RESULTS: In matched-pair analysis, antibiotic prophylaxis for"
		"spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (odds ratio [OR] 8.3, P=0.002), posttransplant"
		"dialysis (OR 7.6, P=0.0009), and retransplantation (OR 16.4, P=0.0018) were"
		independently significant predictors of invasive candidiasis. Candida spp.
		"included C. albicans in 65% of patients, C. glabrata in 21%, C. tropicalis in 9%,"
		"C. parapsilosis in 3%, and C. guilliermondii in 3%. Patients with C. albicans"
		infections were less likely to have received antifungal prophylaxis than those
		"with non-albicans Candida infections (13.6% vs. 50%, P=0.04). The mortality rate"
		"was 36.1% for the cases and 2.8% for the controls (OR 25.0, 95% confidence"
		"interval, 6.2-100.5, P=0.0002). Non-albicans Candida infections (P=0.04) and"
		prior antifungal prophylaxis (P=0.05) correlated with poorer outcome in the
		cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our study has identified predictors for Candida infections in
		the current era that have implications relevant for targeting the prophylaxis
		toward the high-risk patients. Routine use of antifungal prophylaxis warrants
		concern given the emergence of non-albicans Candida spp. as significant pathogens
		after liver transplantation and higher mortality in patients with these
		infections.

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To review the epidemiology of candidemia in a UK tertiary referral
		center. METHODS: Clinical and laboratory data from patients with candidemia were
		"collected prospectively from October 1, 2005 to June 30, 2008 (a 33-month"
		period). RESULTS: A total of 107 episodes were identified. The incidence was 10.9
		episodes/100 000 bed-days. The most common predisposing factors were the use of
		"broad-spectrum antibiotics (92%), the presence of an intravascular device (IVD)"
		"(82%), admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) (51%), and recent surgery (50%)."
		"Non-Candida albicans species accounted for 58% of the episodes, which is higher"
		than the percentage reported from other UK centers. C. albicans was the most
		"common species, accounting for 43% of episodes, followed by C. glabrata (31%) and"
		"C. parapsilosis (20%). Overall C. tropicalis, C. krusei, C. norvegensis, and C."
		lusitaniae caused 7% of episodes. The crude 30-day mortality rate was 37%.
		Advanced age (p = 0.003) and the presence of septic shock (p = 0.038) were
		associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Candidemia continues to be associated
		with a high mortality. Preventative measures should be targeted against high-risk
		"hospitalized patients, especially those in ICUs, the elderly, and those"
		undergoing major surgery. Local surveillance of candidemia is important to
		optimize management.

AB	-	Candidaemia still continues to be a serious medical concern and the epidemiology
		of candidaemia varies according to geographical areas. We aim to determine the
		"incidence, local epidemiology, Candida species distribution and crude mortality"
		rates of candidaemia. We retrospectively evaluated candidaemia episodes in
		"between January 2007 and August 2014. We compared demographic, clinical,"
		microbiological findings and mortality rates of episodes caused by Candida
		albicans and non-albicans Candida species. Overall the candidaemia incidences
		were 1.23 episodes/1000 admissions. A significant negative slope among
		candidaemia episodes and years was determined. Overall C. albicans (54.6%) was
		"the most common species followed by Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis and"
		Candida parapsilosis respectively. Preinfection hospital stay and length of
		hospital stay were statistically longer in patients with non-albicans Candida
		candidaemia than in patients with C. albicans candidaemia. The source of
		candidaemia was unknown in 52.5% of all episodes. Central venous catheters among
		non-albicans Candida candidaemia episodes and urinary system among C. albicans
		candidaemia episodes were common source of candidaemia compared to each other.
		Previous antifungal therapy preceding candidaemia and concomitant bacteraemia
		were significantly associated with non-albicans Candida candidaemia. Continuous
		local surveillance will preserve its pivotal importance in formulating empirical
		antifungal therapy and improving management of candidaemia.

		subgingival occurrence of aggressive periodontopathogens and Candida species.
PG	-	1010-8
LID	-	10.1902/jop.2010.090575 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the influence of oral
		contraceptive (OC) use on the subgingival occurrence of specific
		periodontopathogens and the host's periodontal status. METHODS: Ninety-two
		females aged 19 to 40 years were included in the study. They were divided into
		"two groups, OC users and non-users, and subgrouped according to the most severe"
		periodontal condition and duration of OC usage. A pooled subgingival sample from
		"each subject was cultured to investigate the presence of Candida species,"
		"Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously"
		"Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), and Prevotella intermedia. RESULTS: OC"
		"users, particularly smokers, show a statistically significant increase in the"
		prevalence of severe periodontitis. OC users had deeper probing depths (>or=5 mm)
		"than non-users. Moreover, OC users had higher gingival index scores and clinical"
		"attachment loss, >or=2 and >or=5 mm, respectively, than non-users (P <0.01)."
		Patients taking OCs had significantly higher numbers of cultures positive for
		Candida. Seven Candida species were isolated. Subgingival Candida was associated
		"with P. gingivalis and P. intermedia in 82.9% and 85.4%, respectively, in"
		patients taking OCs. A. actinomycetemcomitans was isolated in patients with
		moderate and severe periodontitis and was associated with subgingival P.
		"gingivalis, P. intermedia, and Candida. CONCLUSIONS: OC use may increase the risk"
		of severe periodontitis and seems to cause a selection of certain Candida species
		"in periodontal pockets. OC users showed a higher prevalence of P. gingivalis, P."
		"intermedia, and A. actinomycetemcomitans compared to non-users. C. albicans, C."
		"parapsilosis, C. krusei, C. tropicalis, and C. glabrata were the species with the"
		ability to survive in the conditions created by the sex hormones after 3 years.

LID	-	10.1093/jac/dks019 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To update the knowledge of the epidemiology of fungaemia episodes in
		"Spain, the species implicated and their in vitro antifungal susceptibilities."
		METHODS: Episodes were identified prospectively over 13 months at 44 hospitals.
		Molecular methods were used to determine the cryptic species inside the Candida
		"parapsilosis and Candida glabrata complexes. Susceptibility to amphotericin B,"
		"anidulafungin, caspofungin, fluconazole, flucytosine, itraconazole, micafungin,"
		posaconazole and voriconazole was determined by a microdilution colorimetric
		"method. New species-specific clinical breakpoints (SSCBPs) for echinocandins,"
		fluconazole and voriconazole were applied. RESULTS: The incidence of the 1357
		fungaemia episodes evaluated was 0.92 per 1000 admissions. The incidence of
		"Candida albicans fungaemia was the highest (0.41 episodes/1000 admissions),"
		followed by Candida parapsilosis sensu stricto (0.22). Candida orthopsilosis was
		"the fifth cause of fungaemia (0.02), outnumbered by Candida glabrata and Candida"
		"tropicalis. Interestingly, the incidence of fungaemia by C. parapsilosis was 11"
		"and 74 times higher than that by C. orthopsilosis and Candida metapsilosis,"
		respectively. Neither Candida nivariensis nor Candida bracarensis was isolated.
		Fungaemia was more common in non-intensive care unit settings (65.2%) and among
		"elderly patients (46.4%), mixed fungaemia being incidental (1.5%). Overall"
		"susceptibility rates were 77.6% for itraconazole, 91.9% for fluconazole and"
		96.5%-99.8% for the other agents. Important resistance rates were only observed
		"in C. glabrata for itraconazole (24.1%) and posaconazole (14.5%), and in Candida"
		krusei for itraconazole (81.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Fungaemia is more common in
		"non-critical patients. C. albicans is the most common species, followed by C."
		parapsilosis and C. glabrata. Nearly 90% of yeasts are susceptible to all
		antifungal agents tested. Resistance rates change moderately when applying the
		new SSCBPs.

AB	-	This analysis describes the epidemiology and outcomes of invasive candidiasis
		caused by non-albicans species of Candida in patients enrolled in the Prospective
		Antifungal Therapy Alliance (PATH Alliance) registry from 2004 to 2008. A total
		"of 2,496 patients with non-albicans species of Candida isolates were identified."
		"The identified species were C. glabrata (46.4%), C. parapsilosis (24.7%), C."
		"tropicalis (13.9%), C. krusei (5.5%), C. lusitaniae (1.6%), C. dubliniensis"
		(1.5%) and C. guilliermondii (0.4%); 111 infections involved two or more species
		of Candida (4.4%). Non-albicans species accounted for more than 50% of all cases
		of invasive candidiasis in 15 of the 24 sites (62.5%) that contributed more than
		"one case to the survey. Among solid organ transplant recipients, patients with"
		"non-transplant surgery, and patients with solid tumors, the most prevalent"
		"non-albicans species was C. glabrata at 63.7%, 48.0%, and 53.8%, respectively. In"
		"1,883 patients receiving antifungal therapy on day 3, fluconazole (30.5%) and"
		echinocandins (47.5%) were the most frequently administered monotherapies. Among
		"the 15 reported species, 90-day survival was highest for patients infected with"
		either C. parapsilosis (70.7%) or C. lusitaniae (74.5%) and lowest for patients
		infected with an unknown species (46.7%) or two or more species (53.2%). In
		"conclusion, this study expands the current knowledge of the epidemiology and"
		outcomes of invasive candidiasis caused by non-albicans species of Candida in
		North America. The variability in species distribution in these centers
		underscores the importance of local epidemiology in guiding the selection of
		antifungal therapy.

TI	-	Study of nosocomial primary bloodstream infections in a pediatric intensive care
		unit.
PG	-	87-92
AB	-	Bloodstream infections (BSI) are the commonest cause of nosocomial infections
		"(NI) in PICU. Knowledge about their magnitude, risk factors and outcome are"
		important in devising appropriate prevention and control measures. Our objective
		"was to study the incidence, etiology, risk factors and outcome of primary BSI in"
		PICU. A prospective cohort of 285 patients consecutively admitted to PICU from
		"July 2003-04, having a stay of >48 h, were enrolled and monitored for BSI till"
		discharge from ICU or death. Primary BSI was defined as per CDC criteria 1988.
		Data of patients with BSI was compared with those without BSI with respect to
		"demographic details, PRISM III, primary diagnosis, nutritional status, device"
		utilization and invasive procedures to identify risk factors for BSI. Variables
		significant on univariate analysis were subjected to multiple logistic regression
		analysis. Outcome was measured as length of PICU stay (LOS) and survival or
		death. There were 116 episodes of primary BSI in 86 (30%) patients; the incidence
		being 31.2 episodes/1000 patient days. The mean age of the patients with BSI was
		3.7 +/- 3.5 years. Predominant isolates were Gram-negative (53.5%); Klebsiella
		pneumoniae (n = 21) being the commonest. Staphylococcus aureus (n = 18) was the
		most common Gram-positive organism. Seven of the 9 (77.8%) yeast isolates were
		"Candida tropicalis. Younger age, higher PRISM III, lower hemoglobin, pre-existing"
		"infection, higher frequency and duration of device utilization (CVC, urinary"
		"catheter, endotracheal tube, mechanical ventilation) were significant risk"
		"factors on univariate analysis. On multiple logistic regressions, hemoglobin (OR"
		"1.24, 95% CI 1.1-1.4, p = 0.002) duration of urinary catheter (OR 0.91, 95% CI"
		"0.84-0.98, p = 0.015) and pre-existing infection (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.23-0.93, p ="
		0.03) were independent risk factors for primary BSI. The median LOS was
		significantly longer in patients with BSI compared to those without (16 vs. 7
		"days, p = 0.0001) 47% of patients with BSI died as compared to 26% deaths in the"
		whole cohort (p = 0.002). Just over half the cases of BSI in our PICU were caused
		"by Gram-negative bacteria. Lower hemoglobin, pre-existing infection and prolonged"
		duration of urinary catheter were independent risk factors identified on
		multivariate analysis. BSI was associated with significantly higher mortality and
		longer stay in our PICU.

PG	-	e87
LID	-	10.1038/emi.2017.74 [doi]
AB	-	"Candidemia is a growing concern worldwide, and its species distribution has"
		"shifted toward non-albicans Candida in recent decades, especially in patients"
		with malignancy. This study aimed to update the epidemiology and antifungal
		susceptibility of non-albicans candidemia isolates from the cancer patients.
		"Adult cancer patients with non-albicans candidemia were recruited, and clinical"
		data were retrospectively collected from five medical centers in Taiwan from 1
		July 2011 to 30 June 2014. In vitro susceptibility was determined by the broth
		dilution method using a Sensititre YeastOne system and interpreted according to
		the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. A total of 346
		episodes of non-albicans candidemia were identified in cancer patients. Candida
		"tropicalis was the most common species (n=145, 41.9%) and had the highest"
		"resistance rate to fluconazole (n=17, 13.9%) among all the preserved isolates,"
		"including C. tropicalis, Candida glabrata and Candida parapsilosis. A higher"
		"Charlson comorbidity index, non-albicans candidemia due to C. tropicalis,"
		neutropenia and septic shock were independent predictors of 28-day mortality. In
		"conclusion, the species distribution and antifungal susceptibility of"
		non-albicans candidemia isolates in our study differed from those in Western
		"countries, providing useful information about local epidemiology for the"
		selection of empirical antifungal agents for cancer patients.

AB	-	"This study was planned to determine the risk factors of candidemia, and the most"
		common Candida species causing bloodstream infections. A case-control study which
		included adult patients was conducted over a 1-year period at tertiary-care
		educational hospitals in Turkey. A total of 83 candidemia episodes were
		identified during the study period. Candida albicans was the most common species
		recovered (45.8%) followed by Candida tropicalis (24.1%) Candida parapsilosis
		(14.5%) and Candida glabrata which was isolated from only four (4.8%) patients.
		Presence of a urethral catheter (odds ratio [OR] 2.38; 95% confidence interval
		"[CI] 1.09-5.19; P = 0.02), previous use of antibiotics (OR 2.61; 95% CI"
		"1.05-6.46; P = 0.03), RBC transfusions (OR 2.14; 95% CI 1.16-3.94; P = 0.01) and"
		parenteral nutrition (OR 4.44; 95% CI 2.43-8.11; P < 0.01) were found as
		independent risk factors for candidemia. TPN (Total Parenteral Nutrition) was an
		independent risk factor for both C. albicans and non-Candida albicans Candida
		species (P < 0.001). Most of the risk factors were invasive procedures and former
		medications. We conclude that a great number of candidemia cases are preventable
		by means of reduction of unnecessary invasive procedures and the use of
		antimicrobials.

AB	-	All consecutive patients with positive blood culture for Candida species over a
		6-year period were evaluated to define recent epidemiologic characteristics of
		"candidemia, and to assess the prevalence of late complications. We encountered"
		106 cases; medical records were available for 99 of them. The rate of candidemia
		"was increasing until 1990, after which it declined. C. albicans was the most"
		"common species, but in the last 2 years, C. tropicalis and C. parapsilosis were"
		emerging. Overall mortality rate was 54.5% without significant variation during
		the study period. Antifungal therapy was withheld in 24/99 cases (24.2%).
		Decision to withhold treatment was taken in 19/59 cases (32.2%) before the
		"availability of fluconazole in 1990, compared with 5/40 cases (12.5%) afterward"
		(p < 0.05). Follow-up was possible in 35 instances for an average period of 17.1
		"months (range: 1-48 months); 7 of these individuals, all with transient"
		"candidemia, were untreated. None of the survivors developed late complications."
		"These findings demonstrate that candidemia appears to be declining since 1990,"
		with a noticeable decrease in the prevalence of C. albicans but an increase in
		"that of C. tropicalis and C. parapsilosis, that fewer patients are left untreated"
		"since fluconazole became available, and that the risk of late complications among"
		the survivors is low.

PG	-	19-28
AB	-	The incidence of nosocomial candidemia increased 27-fold over the past 13 years
		at National Taiwan University Hospital. In order to investigate its predisposing
		"factors, clinical manifestations and prognostic determinants, a prospective"
		observational study of nosocomial candidemia was undertaken at the hospital. From
		"1 May 1994 to 30 April 1995, 118 consecutive adult patients with 120 Candida spp"
		blood isolates were analyzed. Clinical presentations included fever (100%) with a
		"median duration of 3 days, diarrhea within 7 days of candidemia (27.9%) and"
		macronodular skin emboli (7.6%). Laboratory studies showed worsening azotemia
		"(35.6%), elevation of aminotransferase (28.3%), leukocytosis (27.1%) and"
		"thrombocytopenia (23.3%). Use of multiple antibiotics, retained vascular"
		catheters and parenteral nutritional support were the three most common
		predisposing factors for candidemia. C. albicans was the most common isolate
		"(50%), followed by C. tropicalis (20%), C. glabrata (14%), C. parapsilosis"
		"(9.2%). C. guilliermondii (2.5%), and C. Krusei (1.7%). C. tropicalis was more"
		"frequently the cause of candidemia in patients with leukemia and neutropenia,"
		while C. glabrata was more commonly seen in patients receiving fluconazole
		prophylaxis. A severity scoring system adopted from prospective bacteremia
		studies proved to be highly predictive of mortality in candidemic patients. The
		"overall case fatality rate was 70/118 (59.3%), and 51/70 (72.9%) were"
		"attributable to candidemia. In a multivariate analysis, the prognostic factors"
		"adversely influencing outcome were: higher severity scores, no removal of the"
		"catheter, persistent candidemia and lack of antifungal therapy."

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candidemia is still a common life-threatening disease and causes
		"significant morbidity and mortality, especially in critically ill patients. We"
		"conducted this study to analyze the epidemiology, clinical characteristics,"
		"species distribution, antifungal susceptibility and mortality risk factors of"
		candidemia in an intensive care unit. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed
		patients with candidemia in the intensive care unit of our hospital from 2011 to
		"2017. The clinical characteristics, including clinical and laboratory data,"
		"antibiotic therapies, underlying conditions, and invasive procedures and"
		"outcomes, were analyzed. We also performed a logistic regression analysis to"
		identify the independent risk factors for mortality. RESULTS: In this six-year
		"retrospective study, we identified 82 patients with candidemia. The median age of"
		"the patients was 76 years (range, 26 years to 91 years), and 50 of the patients"
		"(61%) were male. Candida albicans was the most common fungal species (38/82,"
		"46.3%), followed by Candida parapsilosis (16/82, 19.5%), Candida glabrata (13/82,"
		"15.9%), and Candida tropicalis (12/82, 14.6%). Most isolates were susceptible to"
		the antifungal agents. The all-cause mortality rate was 51.2%. In binary logistic
		"regression analysis, the worst Glasgow coma score (GCS), PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio (P/F"
		"ratio), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) within three days after admission were"
		independent risk factors for mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Candida albicans was the
		most frequently isolated fungal species. Most isolates were susceptible to the
		"antifungal agents. The worst GCS score, P/F ratio, and MAP within three days"
		after admission were independent risk factors for mortality due to candidemia in
		critically ill patients.

		9/45 (20%) patients and modified in 30 patients (fluconazole was replaced by
		caspofungin (n = 14) or voriconazole (n = 4)). Mortality in ICU was 38% (35/93)
		"and was not influenced by type of Candida species, fluconazole susceptibility,"
		"time to treatment, candidaemia, nosocomial acquisition, or concomitant bacterial"
		"infection. No specific factors for death were identified. In summary, a high"
		proportion of fluconazole-resistant or susceptible dose-dependent strains was
		cultured. These results confirm the high mortality rates of Candida peritonitis
		and plead for additional investigation in this population. Antifungal treatment
		for severe cases of Candida peritonitis in ICU patients remains the standard
		care.

TI	-	Neonatal invasive candidiasis: a prospective multicenter study of 118 cases.
PG	-	153-63
AB	-	A prospective multicenter study was conducted to assess the epidemiology of
		"neonatal invasive candidiasis in Spain. In a total of 20,565 admissions to the 27"
		"participating neonatal units over an 18-month period, systemic candidiasis was"
		diagnosed in 118 (0.57%) neonates. Candida species were isolated from the blood
		"in 79 infants, from the urine in 33, and from the cerebrospinal fluid in 4; in 2"
		"cases, histologic evidence of deep tissue candidiasis was found at autopsy."
		Very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants (< or = 1500 g) showed a significantly
		higher incidence of systemic candidiasis (4.8%) than infants weighing > 1500 g
		(0.2%) ( p < 0.001). Candida albicans was the most frequent species (52.5%)
		"followed by C. parapsilosis (23.7%), and C. tropicalis (7.6%). Only seven infants"
		"were treated with amphotericin B (initial dose 0.18 +/- 0.3 mg/kg, maximal daily"
		dose 1.7 +/- 0.9 mg/kg) but treatment was stopped in three of them (43%) due to
		nephrotoxicity. Liposomal amphotericin B was given to 81 neonates and
		amphotericin B lipid complex to 29. There were no differences in mortality rate
		and in the incidence of adverse effects in relation to treatment with liposomal
		amphotericin B or amphotericin B lipid complex. The mortality rate was 10.2% and
		all deaths occurred in the VLBW cohort with candidemia.

TI	-	Distribution and epidemiology of Candida species causing fungemia at a Saudi
		"Arabian hospital, 1996-2004."
PG	-	239-44
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate the Candida species and
		the change over time in the organisms causing candidemia at Saudi Aramco Medical
		Services Organization in Saudi Arabia. We also describe the risk factors
		associated with mortality. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of candidemia
		over nine years (1996-2004). RESULTS: A total of 98 distinct episodes of
		candidemia were identified over the study period. The annual incidence of
		candidemia ranged between 0.2 and 0.76 cases/1000 hospital discharges with an
		incidence per 10 000 patient-days per year of 0.45 to 1.6. The most frequent
		"Candida species were Candida albicans (53%), Candida tropicalis (19%), Candida"
		"parapsilosis (16%), and Candida glabrata (7%). In relation to predisposing"
		"factors, 83% of candidemia occurred in patients with central venous catheters and"
		96% had received broad-spectrum antibiotics. Other predisposing factors included
		"complicated abdominal surgeries (22%), total parenteral nutrition (52%),"
		"neutropenia (9%), acute renal failure (24%), malignancy (26%) and burns (15%)."
		"However, prior fluconazole use was low (8%). The overall crude mortality rate was"
		43% for all candidemia. Logistic regression analysis identified two independent
		"determinants of death, C. albicans (OR 5.91, 95% CI 1.50, 23.24, p=0.01) and"
		"acute renal failure (OR 5.15, 95% CI 1.18, 22.55, p=0.03). CONCLUSION: The study"
		showed that the rate of candidemia was low in our hospital and that C. albicans
		was the major species followed by C. tropicalis and C. parapsilosis. Future
		studies are needed to evaluate the antifungal susceptibility pattern in our
		hospital.

PG	-	140-8
LID	-	10.1111/myc.12288 [doi]
AB	-	The aim of this study is to identify differences in distribution of Candida
		"species, resistance to antifungals and clinical outcome, as well as the"
		identification of potential risk factors associated with candidaemia in children.
		We conducted a retrospective analysis in children ≤18 years with blood culture
		proven candidaemia identified between 2004 and 2012. Patients were divided into
		"two groups (Group 1, <3 months, n = 51; Group 2, ≥3 months, n = 197) to identify"
		any potential difference between the neonatal and early infantile periods in
		terms of risk factors and distribution of Candida species. A total of 248
		distinct episodes of candidaemia were identified over the study period. The most
		"frequently isolated Candida species were C. albicans (53.2%), followed by C."
		"parapsilosis (26.2%), C. tropicalis (8.1%). Of the 248 episodes, 71 episodes"
		(28.6%) resulted in death within 30 days from the onset of candidaemia. In Group
		"1, failure of central venous catheter (CVC) removal was found to be associated"
		"with a 20.5-fold increase in mortality [95% CI (3.9, 106.5); P < 0.001], compared"
		"to a 5.9-fold increased risk with hypoalbuminaemia [95% CI (1.03, 34.1); P ="
		"0.046]. For Group 2, the increased risk was 23-fold for failure of CVC removal"
		"[95% CI (7.48, 70.77); P < 0.001], 7.4-fold for mechanical ventilation [95% CI"
		"(2.64, 21.08); P < 0.001], 4.4-fold for hypoalbuminaemia [95% CI (1.56, 12.56); P"
		"= 0.005], 3.1-fold for neutropaenia [95% CI (1.31, 7.69); P = 0.010] and 2.2-fold"
		"for male gender [95% CI (1.02, 4.71); P = 0.043]. Therapeutic choices should be"
		guided by sound knowledge of local epidemiological trends in candidaemia. Removal
		of CVC significantly reduces mortality and is an essential step in the management
		of candidaemia.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Oral candidiasis (OC) is a common opportunistic infection in
		immunocompromised patients. Species identification is sometimes important for
		treatment. objective: to determine the prevalence of different Candida species
		colonising or infecting the oral mucosa (OM) of diabetic (DM) and non-diabetic
		"(non-DM) chronic kidney disease patients, comparing both groups and exploring"
		potential risk factors. METHODS: 56 DM and 80 non-DM patients on chronic dialysis
		were examined. OM swabs were cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar plates. Candida
		species were identified with API® galleries. OC was confirmed by exfoliative
		"cytology. Statistical associations were analysed using χ2, Fisher's exact test"
		"(ET), and multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: Candida prevalence was 43.4%:"
		"53.6% DM and 36.3% non-DM, (p=.045). The species identified were C. albicans"
		"74.6%, C. glabrata 22.0%, C. tropicalis 15.2%, C. parapsilosis 3.4 %, C. kefyr"
		3.4% and C. famata 1.7% without difference between groups. DM patients had a
		higher xerostomia prevalence (p=.002) and lower salivary flow (p=.008) and lower
		"serum albumin (p=.018). 16.9% of patients had OC, 23.2% DM compared with 12.5%"
		"non-DM, (p=.101). The following were associated with the presence of Candida in"
		"the OM: the use of dental prostheses (odds ratio [OR] 25.6, 95% confidence"
		"interval [CI] 2.5 to 253, P=.001), xerostomia (OR 9.6, 95% CI 2.4 to 38.1,"
		"P=.001) and low serum albumin values (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.98, P=.044)."
		CONCLUSIONS: The presence of Candida sp. in the OM was associated with dental
		"prostheses, xerostomia and low serum albumin."

TI	-	Fungal esophagitis associated with tuberculous pericarditis in an human
		immunodeficiency virus-positive patient: a case report.
PG	-	429
LID	-	10.1186/s13256-022-03561-x [doi]

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Opportunistic infections are frequent in people living with the human
		immunodeficiency virus who either do not have access to antiretroviral therapy
		(ART) or use it irregularly. Tuberculosis is the most frequent infectious disease
		in PLHIV and can predispose patients to severe fungal infections with dire
		consequences. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the case of a 35-year-old Brazilian
		man living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 10 years. He reported no
		adherence to ART and a history of histoplasmosis with hospitalization for 1 month
		"in a public hospital in Natal, Brazil. The diagnosis was disseminated"
		Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. He was transferred to the health service in
		"Recife, Brazil, with a worsening condition characterized by daily fevers,"
		"dyspnea, pain in the upper and lower limbs, cough, dysphagia, and painful oral"
		lesions suggestive of candidiasis. Lymphocytopenia and high viral loads were
		"found. After screening for infections, the patient was diagnosed with tuberculous"
		pericarditis and esophageal candidiasis caused by Candida tropicalis. The
		isolated yeasts were identified using the VITEK 2 automated system and
		matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight-mass spectrometry.
		"Antifungal microdilution broth tests showed sensitivity to fluconazole,"
		"voriconazole, anidulafungin, caspofungin, micafungin, and amphotericin B, with"
		resistance to fluconazole and voriconazole. The patient was treated with COXCIP-4
		"and amphotericin deoxycholate. At 12 days after admission, the patient developed"
		sepsis of a pulmonary focus with worsening of his respiratory status. Combined
		"therapy with meropenem, vancomycin, and itraconazole was started, with fever"
		"recurrence, and he changed to ART and tuberculostatic therapy. The patient"
		remained clinically stable and was discharged with clinical improvement after
		30 days of hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Fungal infections should be considered in
		patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome as they contribute to worsening
		health status. When mycoses are diagnosed early and treated with the appropriate
		"drugs, favorable therapeutic outcomes can be achieved."

TI	-	Evaluation of Candida colonization and use of the Candida Colonization Index in a
		paediatric Intensive Care Unit: a prospective observational study.
PG	-	159-167
AB	-	"Invasive candidiasis is an important cause of morbidity and mortality, which"
		primarily occurs in intensive care units. The Candida colonization index is an
		accepted score as an early warning tool for invasive candidiasis. This study was
		performed in a medical PICU with patients prone to contracting invasive
		"candidiasis, to determine the usefulness of the Candida colonization index in"
		forecasting invasive candidiasis in children. This prospective study including 87
		patients (children 1 month to 16 years old with several illnesses and requiring
		"ICU care) was conducted in a 22-bed medical PICU, Health Science University of"
		"Kayseri Training and Research Hospital, between January 2015 and September 2016."
		"Those patients not on antifungal therapy, who were expected to stay more than"
		seven days in PICU and had no history of a PICU stay within the previous two
		"months were included in the study. In all patients, rectal, cervical, throat,"
		"axillary, perineal and nasal swab cultures, urine culture and blood culture tests"
		"were performed at admission and every week throughout their stay. Overall, 2639"
		swab and urine cultures (mean: 30.3) and 325 blood cultures (mean: 3.73) were
		obtained from 87 patients and a total of 576 grew Candida spp. In patients' swab
		"and urine cultures C. albicans was detected in 64.5%, C. parapsilosis in 12.1%,"
		"C. glabrata in 7.5%, Saccharomyces spp in 3.0 %, C. tropicalis in 2.4%, C. krusei"
		in 2.1% and C. kefyr in 1.2%. Three patients had C. albicans and one had C.
		"parapsilosis growth in blood culture. Sensitivity, specificity, positive"
		"predictive value and negative predictive value for CI were found to be 33.73%,"
		"100%, 6.7%, and 100%, respectively. Patients are at risk of fungal infection in"
		paediatric intensive care units. Specificity and the negative predictive value of
		100 % indicate that CI is a useful score to rule out the presence of invasive
		"fungal disease. On the other hand, the low rate of sensitivity (33.3 %) and"
		"positive predictive value (6,7%) make this score less reliable in forecasting"
		invasive candidiasis in children.

		Reference Center: Epidemiology and associated factors.
PG	-	812-822
LID	-	10.1111/myc.13106 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive fungal disease is a significant cause of morbidity and
		mortality in immunosuppressed children. The recognition of patients at risk for
		candidaemia is paramount to a better prognosis. OBJECTIVES: To characterize
		Candida spp bloodstream infections (BSI) in a reference centre for paediatric
		oncology and to describe the most prevalent risk factors associated with candida
		infections. PATIENTS/METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study carried out
		"with paediatric patients followed up with at the Institute of Pediatric Oncology,"
		"Brazil, who presented positive blood culture for Candida spp from January 2004 to"
		December 2016. RESULTS: Ninety episodes of candidaemia were analysed; patients
		"had a median age of 4.5 years, and 57.8% were males, with a diagnosis of solid"
		tumours in 54.5% of cases. The most common Candida species were C albicans
		"(35.6%), C parapsilosis (30.0%) and C tropicalis (16.7%). C tropicalis BSI was"
		associated with neutropenia and skin lesions. Therapy was successful in 67.1% of
		the episodes. Older age and thrombocytopenia were associated with therapeutic
		failure. Death within 30 days occurred in 24.4% of patients; predictive factors
		were older age and admission to an ICU C parapsilosis candidaemia was a
		protective factor for death when compared to C albicans. CONCLUSION: The main
		"species isolated were C albicans, C parapsilosis and C tropicalis. C tropicalis"
		BSI was associated with neutropenia and skin lesions. The death rate was
		"significant, and a worse prognosis was associated with older age,"
		thrombocytopenia and admission to an ICU C parapsilosis infection proved to be a
		protective factor against mortality.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Few studies exist on prevalence of fungemia by Candida orthopsilosis,"
		"with variable results. AIMS: To study the incidence, epidemiology and antifungal"
		susceptibility of C. orthopsilosis strains isolated from fungemias over two years
		at a tertiary hospital. METHODS: Candidemia episodes between June 2007 and June
		"2009 in a university hospital (Puerta del Mar, Cádiz, Spain) were studied. The"
		strains initially identified as Candida parapsilosis were genotypically screened
		"for C. parapsilosis sensu stricto, C. orthopsilosis and Candida metapsilosis, and"
		their antifungal susceptibility was evaluated. RESULTS: In this period 52 cases
		of candidemia were documented. Of the 19 strains originally identified as C.
		"parapsilosis, 13 were confirmed as C. parapsilosis sensu stricto and 6 as C."
		"orthopsilosis. Of the 52 isolates, the most frequent species were Candida"
		"albicans (30.8%), C. parapsilosis sensu stricto (25%), C. orthopsilosis, Candida"
		tropicalis and Candida glabrata in equal numbers (11.5%). C. orthopsilosis
		"isolates were susceptible to amphotericin B, caspofungin, voriconazole and"
		"fluconazole, with no significant differences in MIC values with C. parapsilosis"
		sensu stricto. The source of isolates of C. orthopsilosis were neonates (50%) and
		"surgery (50%), and 100% were receiving parenteral nutrition; however C."
		parapsilosis sensu stricto was recovered primarily from patients over 50 years
		(69.2%) and 46.1% were receiving parenteral nutrition. CONCLUSIONS: These
		findings show that C. orthopsilosis should be considered as human pathogenic
		yeast and therefore its accurate identification is important. Despite our small
		sample size our study suggests that a displacement of some epidemiological
		characteristics previously attributed to C. parapsilosis to C. orthopsilosis may
		be possible.

AB	-	"Community-onset (CO) candidemia, defined as a positive blood culture taken at or"
		"within 2 days of hospital admission, represents a distinct clinical entity"
		associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Reference MIC results from
		the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (2008-2009) were analyzed to
		compare the antifungal resistance patterns and species distributions from
		patients with CO and nosocomial bloodstream infections (BSI) in 79 medical
		"centers. Among 1,354 episodes of BSI, 494 (36.5%) were classified as CO and 860"
		(63.5%) as nosocomial in origin. More than 95% of the isolates from both BSI
		"types were contributed by Candida albicans (48.4%), C. glabrata (18.2%), C."
		"parapsilosis (17.1%), C. tropicalis (10.6%), and C. krusei (2.0%). C. albicans"
		"was more common in CO BSI (51.0%) than nosocomial BSI (46.9%), whereas C."
		"parapsilosis and C. krusei were more common in nosocomial BSIs (18.1 and 2.7%,"
		"respectively) than in CO BSIs (15.4 and 0.8%, respectively). C. glabrata and C."
		"tropicalis were comparable in both CO (18.4 and 10.5%, respectively) and"
		"nosocomial (18.1 and 10.6%, respectively) episodes. Resistance to azoles"
		"(fluconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole) and echinocandins (anidulafungin,"
		"caspofungin, and micafungin) was uncommon (<5%) in CO BSI using recently"
		established Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoint criteria.
		"Resistance to echinocandins (anidulafungin [3.8%], caspofungin [5.1%], and"
		"micafungin [3.2%]) and azoles (fluconazole [7.7%], posaconazole [5.1%], and"
		voriconazole [6.4%]) was most prevalent among nosocomial BSI isolates of C.
		glabrata. CO candidemia is not uncommon and appears to be increasing worldwide
		due to changing health care practices. Although resistance to the azoles and
		"echinocandins remains uncommon among CO isolates, we demonstrate the emergence of"
		nosocomial occurrences of C. glabrata expressing resistance to both monitored
		classes of antifungal agents.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Despite being associated with a high mortality and economic burden,"
		data regarding candidemia are scant in Algeria. The aim of this study was to
		"unveil the epidemiology of candidemia in Algeria, evaluate the antifungal"
		susceptibility pattern of causative agents and understand the molecular
		"mechanisms of antifungal resistance where applicable. Furthermore, by performing"
		environmental screening and microsatellite typing we sought to identify the
		source of infection. METHODS: We performed a retrospective epidemiological-based
		surveillance study and collected available blood yeast isolates recovered from
		"the seven hospitals in Algiers. To identify the source of infection, we performed"
		environmental screening from the hands of healthcare workers (HCWs) and high
		touch areas. Species identification was performed by API Auxa-Color and MALDI-TOF
		MS and ITS sequencing was performed for species not reliably identified by
		MALDI-TOF MS. Antifungal susceptibility testing followed CLSI M27-A3/S4 and
		included all blood and environmental yeast isolates. ERG11 sequencing was
		performed for azole-resistant Candida isolates. Microsatellite typing was
		"performed for blood and environmental Candida species, where applicable. RESULTS:"
		Candida tropicalis (19/66) was the main cause of candidemia in these seven
		"hospitals, followed by Candida parapsilosis (18/66), Candida albicans (18/66),"
		and Candida glabrata (7/66). The overall mortality rate was 68.6% (35/51) and was
		81.2% for C. tropicalis-infected patients (13/16). Fluconazole was the main
		antifungal drug used (12/51); 41% of the patients (21/51) did not receive any
		systemic treatment. Candida parapsilosis was isolated mainly from the hands of
		"HCWs (7/28), and various yeasts were collected from high-touch areas (11/47),"
		"including Naganishia albida, C. parapsilosis and C. glabrata. Typing data"
		revealed interhospital transmission on two occasions for C. parapsilosis and C.
		"glabrata, and the same clone of C. parapsilosis infected two patients within the"
		same hospital. Resistance was only noted for C. tropicalis against azoles (6/19)
		and fluconazole-resistant C. tropicalis isolates (≥8 μg/ml) (6/19) contained a
		novel P56S (5/6) amino acid substitution and a previously reported one (V234F;
		"1/6) in Erg11p. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our data suggest an urgent need for"
		antifungal stewardship and infection control strategies to improve the clinical
		outcome of Algerian patients with candidemia. The high prevalence of C.
		tropicalis joined by fluconazole-resistance may hamper the therapeutic efficacy
		"of fluconazole, the frontline antifungal drug used in Algeria."

PG	-	33-40
LID	-	10.29063/ajrh2020/v24i3.4 [doi]
AB	-	Vaginal Candida infection is one of the most common genital tract infections
		reported in pregnant women. This study was designed to determine the prevalence
		of vaginal Candida infection and pattern of Candida species isolates in the
		genital tract of pregnant women during antenatal period and in early labour; and
		the associated fetal outcome. The study was conducted at the antenatal clinic and
		"labor ward of Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital Sagamu, Ogun State,"
		Nigeria. High vaginal swabs were collected from 408 pregnant women at the
		antenatal clinic and repeated in early labour. The samples were processed to
		isolate Candida species. Data were analysed using Statistical Package for Social
		"Science (SPSS) windows version 21.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Prevalence of"
		Candida infection was significantly higher in early labour (46%) than during
		"antenatal period (38%) (P=0.02). Candida albicans was the predominant isolate,"
		followed by Candida glabrata and Candida tropicalis. Candida infection was
		"associated with increased likelihood of low birth weight babies (AOR 2.8, CI:"
		1.1-6.8; P= 0.03). However there was no statistically significant effect of
		"Candida infection on the likelihood of preterm delivery (AOR 1.4, CI: 0.7-2.6; P="
		0.35). Routine screening and prompt treatment of women at risk of delivering low
		birth weight babies is advocated.

TI	-	One-year follow-up of the effect of fixed orthodontic treatment on colonization
		by oral Candida.
PG	-	26-9
AB	-	The aim of this study was to assess quantitative and qualitative alterations in
		"the carrier rate of Candida spp. in south-eastern Turkey among adolescents, and"
		to investigate the effect of fixed orthodontic appliances on the Candida count in
		"a 1-year follow-up study. In the first phase of the study, the oral Candida"
		carriage rate of 72 patients was evaluated. Samples were collected from the
		"dorsal surface of the tongue, the mid-palate and saliva. In the second phase of"
		"the study, 42 patients who were determined to be carriers of oral Candida were"
		"treated with fixed orthodontic appliances, and from these patients a second set"
		of samples were collected from the saliva and the orthodontic brace surfaces of
		eight teeth adjacent to the enamel surfaces. The saliva samples were collected
		"before and during orthodontic treatment at 1st, 6th and 12th month, and samples"
		"from the braces were collected during the 1st, 6th and 12th month of treatment."
		Forty-two of the 72 patients (58.5%) were oral Candida carriers. The distribution
		of Candida spp. in these patients was as follows: (i) Candida albicans was
		"identified in 31 patients (73.8%), (ii) C. tropicalis, C. krusei and C. kefyr"
		were found in three patients each (7.14%) and (iii) C. parapsilosis occurred in
		"two patients (4.76%). During orthodontic treatment, the micro-organism count"

AB	-	BACKGROUND: The clinical characteristics of internal medicine ward (IMW) patients
		with candidemia are unclear. The aim of this study was to define the clinical
		"characteristics of candidemic IMW patients and to study the incidence, species"
		"distribution, and outcomes of these patients compared to surgical and intensive"
		care unit (ICU) candidemic patients. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of
		"candidemic patients in IMWs, general surgery wards, and an ICU at Beilinson"
		Hospital during the period 2007-2014 was analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 118
		"patients with candidemia were identified in six IMWs, two general surgery wards,"
		and one ICU in the hospital. Candida albicans was the leading causative agent
		(41.1%). Higher proportions of Candida parapsilosis and Candida tropicalis
		isolates were observed in the IMW patients. IMW patients were significantly
		"older, with poorer functional capacity, and had more frequently been exposed to"
		"antibiotic therapy within 90 days, in particular β-lactam-β-lactamase inhibitor"
		"combinations and cephalosporins. At onset of candidemia, a significantly lower"
		number of IMW patients were mechanically ventilated (p<0.01); these patients did
		not have central line catheters comparable to ICU and surgical patients
		(p<0.001). They were less likely to receive adequate antifungal therapy within
		"48h, and this was the only significant predictor of survival in these patients"
		(p=0.028): hazard ratio 3.7 (95% confidence interval 1.14-12.5) for therapy
		delayed to >48h. CONCLUSIONS: IMW candidemic patients account for a substantial
		proportion of candidemia cases and have unique characteristics and high mortality
		rates.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive candidiasis (IC) is the most common cause of invasive fungal
		infections. Identification of risk factors for such infection may help in the
		empirical therapeutic decision-making process. We conducted this study to
		characterize the clinical epidemiology of such infection and to differentiate
		risk factors between Candida albicans and Candida non-albicans species. METHODS:
		"We retrospectively evaluated patients with IC from 2011 to 2013. Clinical data,"
		"antibiotic therapy, underlying condition, and invasive procedures were analyzed"
		and compared between C. albicans and C. non-albicans species. RESULTS: C.
		albicans was the most frequently isolated Candida species (48.6% of all IC
		"patients), although C. non-albicans spp. were more commonly isolated overall. C."
		"albicans, Candida tropicalis, and Candida parapsilosis have a high susceptibility"
		"rate to all antifungal agents (>90%), whereas Candida glabrata showed decreased"
		susceptibility to fluconazole and itraconazole. Amphotericin B demonstrated
		excellent antifungal activity against all Candida species. Univariate analyses
		showed that IC patients with C. albicans had a higher ratio of older age
		"(p = 0.008), solid tumor (p = 0.029), and hypoproteinemia (p = 0.019), whereas"
		those with C. non-albicans spp. had a higher ratio of hospital length of stay
		"(p = 0.005), usage of corticosteroids (p = 0.011), duration on corticosteroids"
		"(p = 0.005), chemotherapy (p = 0.022), hematologic malignancy (p = 0.039),"
		"neutropenia (p = 0.030), and usage of glycopeptides (p = 0.002). Multivariate"
		analyses showed that a significant predictor of IC due to C. albicans was
		"hypoproteinemia [odds ratio (95% confidence interval) = 2.133 (1.164-3.908),"
		p = 0.014]. CONCLUSION: C. albicans was the most frequently isolated Candida
		species. The risk factors between C. albicans and C. non-albicans species are
		different.

		"intestine, potentially leading to bowel obstruction, gangrene and perforation. It"
		"is a rare condition, especially in adults. CASE PRESENTATION: A 30-year-old man"
		was retrieved from the jungle with severe weight loss and abdominal symptoms. He
		succumbed to death despite 22 days of intensive medical treatment. An autopsy
		revealed a ruptured gangrenous ileal volvulus with peritonitis and
		subdiaphragmatic abscess. Further laboratory analysis detected systemic Candida
		"tropicalis and intestinal gramnegative bacterial sepsis, systemic Zika virus"
		"viremia, leptospirosis complicating rhabdomyolysis and disseminated intravascular"
		"coagulopathy, Type I Herpes Simplex virus infection of the tongue and upper"
		"gastrointestinal tract. The cause of death was the ruptured ileal volvulus,"
		complicated with upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to Herpes simplex virus
		esophagitis in a malnourished patient with resolving leptospirosis and underlying
		Zika virus co-infection. CONCLUSION: Rare clinical scenarios of adult-onset
		intestinal volvulus with concomitant multiple infections precludes clinical
		"diagnosis and early treatment, leading to devastating consequences of clinical"
		outcome. The positive clinical and postmortem correlation is a good learning
		lesson in many disciplines of medicine and science.

AB	-	"INTRODUCTION: Larger populations at risk, broader use of antibiotics and longer"
		hospital stays have impacted on the incidence of Candida sp. bloodstream
		infections (CBSI). OBJECTIVE: To determine clinical and epidemiologic
		characteristics of patients with CBSI in two tertiary care reference medical
		institutions in Mexico City. DESIGN: Prospective and observational
		laboratory-based surveillance study conducted from 07/2008 to 06/2010. METHODS:
		All patients with CBSI were included. Identification and antifungal
		"susceptibility were performed using CLSI M27-A3 standard procedures. Frequencies,"
		Mann-Whitney U test or T test were used as needed. Risk factors were determined
		with multivariable analysis and binary logistic regression analysis. RESULTS:
		CBSI represented 3.8% of nosocomial bloodstream infections. Cumulative incidence
		was 2.8 per 1000 discharges (incidence rate: 0.38 per 1000 patient-days). C.
		"albicans was the predominant species (46%), followed by C. tropicalis (26%). C."
		"glabrata was isolated from patients with diabetes (50%), and elderly patients."
		Sixty-four patients (86%) received antifungals. Amphotericin-B deoxycholate
		(AmBD) was the most commonly used agent (66%). Overall mortality rate reached
		"46%, and risk factors for death were APACHE II score ≥ 16 (OR = 6.94, CI95% ="
		"2.34-20.58, p<0.0001), and liver disease (OR = 186.11, CI95% = 7.61-4550.20, p ="
		"0.001). Full susceptibility to fluconazole, AmBD and echinocandins among C."
		"albicans, C. tropicalis, and C. parapsilosis was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The"
		cumulative incidence rate in these centers was higher than other reports from
		tertiary care hospitals from Latin America. Knowledge of local epidemiologic
		patterns permits the design of more specific strategies for prevention and
		preemptive therapy of CBSI.

		"hospital laboratory submitted all blood isolates of yeasts for identification,"
		"strain typing and susceptibility testing, provided 300 isolates from 242"

		Candida parapsilosis (12 %). Seven cases of candidaemia were caused by Candida
		"dubliniensis, which was more prevalent even than Candida lusitaniae and Candida"
		"tropicalis (six cases each). Among C. glabrata isolates, 55 % showed reduced"

		"exceptions for each species. The high prevalence of candidaemia in Scotland,"
		"relative to other population-based European studies, and the high level of"

TI	-	Epidemiology of candidemia--a nationwide survey in Israel.
PG	-	26-9
AB	-	Bloodstream infections with Candida are often lethal and have been reported to be
		increasing in frequency. The current retrospective study describes the magnitude
		and epidemiological characteristics of candidemia in all western-type hospital
		facilities in Israel in 1994. Comprehensiveness of the data from the reporting
		hospitals was checked by cross-study of the data from the infectious diseases
		records and from the hospitalization records. Vital status of all reported cases
		was evaluated 1 year after the diagnosis. Data on 298 newly diagnosed cases of
		candidemia were received from 14 of the 18 general hospitals in Israel. The
		proportion of candidemia in the Israeli hospitals ranged from 0.1 to 0.01% of all
		"admissions, with a mean of 0.05%. The incidence of candidemia differed"
		"significantly between the wards from 4-5/10,000 in general surgery and internal"
		"medicine wards to about 60/10,000 and 80/10,000 in intensive care and preterm"
		"units, respectively. Of all detected cases 53.6% were Candida albicans. Another"
		"nine specific species of Candida (mainly Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis"
		"and Candida glabrata) were detected, with major differences between the various"
		hospitals. The species of Candida differed significantly by sex and age. Of the
		cases of candidemia 21.5% died within 30 days of the isolation of the pathogen.
		The one-year mortality rate was 31.9%. Species-specific 30-day mortality rate was
		"highest for C. glabrata. Throughout the analysis, C. glabrata emerged as a unique"
		"cause of candidemia, producing higher mortality, appearing at a younger age and"
		predominating among females.

TI	-	Epidemiology of community-onset candidemia in Connecticut and Maryland.
PG	-	32-9
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Almost one-third of patients with bloodstream infections with Candida
		species (candidemia) have onset of disease that occurs outside of the hospital or
		"< or = 2 days after hospital admission (i.e., community-onset candidemia). We"
		compared the characteristics of patients who developed candidemia by the timing
		of onset of infection. METHODS: Incident episodes of candidemia were identified
		"through active, population-based surveillance in Connecticut and in Baltimore and"
		"Baltimore County, Maryland, during 1 October 1998-30 September 2000. The"
		molecular subtypes of a sample of 45 Candida parapsilosis isolates were evaluated
		"using Southern blots hybridized with the complex probe Cp3-13. RESULTS: Overall,"
		356 (31%) of the 1143 incident episodes of candidemia were classified as
		"community-onset disease (occurring < or = 2 days after hospital admission), and"
		"132 (37%) were caused by Candida albicans, 89 (25%) were caused by Candida"
		"glabrata, 57 (16%) were caused by C. parapsilosis, and 53 (15%) were caused by"
		Candida tropicalis. Community-onset disease was less likely to be associated with
		"concurrent immunosuppressive therapy, recent surgery, or use of a central venous"
		"catheter, compared with inpatient disease. Among patients with community-onset"
		"disease, the median time from blood culture to initiation of antifungal treatment"
		"was 2.7 days, the 30-day case-fatality rate was 26%, and 262 patients (75%) had"
		been hospitalized at least once in the previous 3 months. Although there were few
		differences between patients with very recent hospitalization (in the previous 1
		"month), less recent hospitalization (previous 1-3 months), and no documented past"
		"hospitalization, C. parapsilosis was more frequently associated with"
		community-onset disease as hospitalization became more distant. C. parapsilosis
		"strains tended to be unique to the patient, with little similarity found between"
		"strain types, on the basis of epidemiologic classification of patients."
		CONCLUSION: We report that community-onset candidemia is common and occurs in
		patients with extensive contact with the health care system. Disease caused by C.
		parapsilosis tends to involve unique strains.

LID	-	e0210527
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: The aim of this cross-sectional observational study was to compare
		the prevalence of different oral Candida spp. in patients with Type 2 Diabetes
		and chronic periodontitis in two oral sites: dorsal surface of the tongue and
		subgingival area. In order to determine subgingival areas as potential reservoirs
		"of yeasts, this study aimed to find differences in the yeasts' detection between"
		"the dorsum of the tongue, as the oral site most commonly inhabited with"
		"microorganisms, and subgingival samples. Additionally, potential predictors for"
		the yeasts prevalence were determined. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Subjects (N = 146)
		were divided into four groups: group A- healthy individuals without
		"periodontitis, group B- healthy individuals with chronic periodontitis, group C-"
		Type 2 Diabetes patients with good glycoregulation and Chronic periodontitis and
		group D- Type 2 Diabetes patients with poor glycoregulation and Chronic
		periodontitis. Samples were obtained from the tongue by swabbing. Subgingival
		plaque samples were taken by paper points and periodontal curette. Isolation and
		identification of different Candida spp. was done using ChromAgar medium. In
		"addition, germ-tube production and carbohydrate assimilation tests were"
		performed. RESULTS: The prevalence of Candida spp. was higher in diabetics with
		poor glycoregulation. The most frequently isolated species was Candida albicans
		"followed by Candida glabrata and Candida tropicalis. In 15.6% of cases, Candida"
		spp. was present in the subgingival area while absent on the tongue. Multivariate
		regression model showed that HbA1c was Candida spp. predictor for both locations.
		CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirmed that there are Candida spp. carriers among
		"subjects with clinically healthy oral mucosa. Also, this study identified"
		subgingival areas as potential reservoirs of these pathogenic species.
		Glycoregulation has been recognized as a positive predictor factor of Candida
		spp.

TI	-	Epidemiological trends in nosocomial candidemia in intensive care.
PG	-	21
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Infection represents a frequent complication among patients in
		"Intensive Care Units (ICUs) and mortality is high. In particular, the incidence"
		"of fungal infections, especially due to Candida spp., has been increasing during"
		the last years. METHODS: In a retrospective study we studied the etiology of
		candidemia in critically ill patients over a five-year period (1999-2003) in the
		"ICU of the San Martino University Hospital in Genoa, Italy. RESULTS: In total,"
		"182 episodes of candidaemia were identified, with an average incidence of 2.22"
		"episodes/10,000 patient-days/year (range 1.25-3.06 episodes). Incidence of"
		"candidemia increased during the study period from 1.25 in 1999 to 3.06/10,000"
		"patient-days/year in 2003. Overall, 40% of the fungemia episodes (74/182) were"
		"due to C.albicans, followed by C. parapsilosis (23%), C.glabrata (15%),"
		C.tropicalis (9%) and other species (13%). Candidemia due to non-albicans species
		increased and this was apparently correlated with an increasing use of azoles for
		prophylaxis or empirical treatment. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates a shift in
		the species of Candida causing fungemia in a medical and surgical ICU population
		during a 5 year period. The knowledge of the local epidemiological trends in
		Candida species isolated in blood cultures is important to guide therapeutic
		choices.

		period.
PG	-	390-6
AB	-	In a retrospective analysis of 128 cases of Candida bloodstream infections in a
		"London teaching hospital between 1995 and 2001, the incidence of candidaemia"
		increased from 0.2/1000 admissions in 1995 to 0.5 and 0.4/1000 admissions in 2000
		"and 2001, respectively. Risk factors for candidaemia included the presence of"
		"intravascular (IV) lines (88%), admission to intensive care (51%), parenteral"
		"nutrition (35%), multiple antibiotics (74%), corticosteroid therapy (12%), cancer"
		"chemotherapy (11%), renal transplantation (5%) and neutropenia (3%). The sources"
		"of infection were IV lines (77%), the urinary tract (7%) and the gastrointestinal"
		"tract (7%). Serious infective complications (endocarditis, endophthalmitis or"
		brain abscess) were noted in 6% of cases. The most frequently isolated species
		"were Candida albicans (64%), C. glabrata (20%), C. tropicalis (9%) and C."
		parapsilosis (5%). The overall fluconazole-resistance rate of Candida spp. was 7%
		(MIC > or = 64 mg l-1). All the C. albicans isolates were sensitive to
		fluconazole (MIC < or = 8 mg l-1) whereas 20% of non-C. albicans isolates (27% of
		C. glabrata and 14%C. tropicalis) were resistant. The mortality rate (35%) was
		lower than in other reports and may be due to the early recognition of
		candidaemia and the prompt removal of IV lines together with the initiation of
		"appropriate antifungal therapy. Regular surveillance of local Candida species,"
		resistance profiles and risk factors is important in order to identify patients
		at risk and to develop empirical treatment protocols to reduce the incidence and
		mortality of candidaemia.

		Participant Group (Europe).
PG	-	19-25
AB	-	"The SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program, an international study of blood"
		"stream infections (BSIs), detected 170 episodes of candidemia in 20 European"
		"medical centers (13 nations) between January and December, 1997. Twenty-three"
		percent of the candidal BSI occurred in patients hospitalized in an intensive
		"care unit, 21% in patients in an internal medicine service, 13% in patients in a"
		"surgical service, and 9% in patients in an oncology service. Overall, 53% of the"

		"parapsilosis (21%), C. glabrata (12%), C. tropicalis (6%), C. famata (2%), C."
		"krusei (1%), and C. inconspicua (1%). As observed previously in Canada and Latin"

		species causing yeast BSI in Europe. The proportion of these candidemias
		attributable to C. albicans varied widely from 0-100% among the 20 European
		"centers. Among the different species of Candida, resistance to fluconazole (MIC,"
		"> or = 64 micrograms/mL) and itraconazole (MIC, > or = 1.0 microgram/mL) was"
		observed with C. glabrata and C. krusei and was observed more rarely among other
		"species (e.g., C. inconspicua). Isolates of C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, C."
		"tropicalis, and C. guilliermondii were all highly susceptible to both fluconazole"
		"and itraconazole. Furthermore, the investigational triazoles (BMS-207147, Sch"
		"56592, and voriconazole) and an echinocandin (MK-0991) all demonstrated potent in"
		"vitro activity (MIC90s, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 micrograms/mL, respectively)"
		against these isolates. Continued surveillance at an international level will be
		important to monitor trends in species distribution and antifungal susceptibility
		among invasive strains of Candida.

AB	-	"Candida meningitis, a previously rare occurrence, has been increasing in"
		prevalence and often is a result of complications of neurosurgery. We describe
		"the case of a 49-year-old man who presented with headache, vertigo, intermittent"
		"blurred vision, and multiple episodes of nausea and vomiting. Computed tomography"
		(CT) showed a left cerebellar hemorrhage with obliteration of the fourth
		ventricle causing hydrocephalus. He had an occipital craniotomy with
		transcondylar evacuation of the hemorrhage and placement of a temporary
		ventriculostomy. The hospital stay was prolonged because of postsurgical
		"complications, and Candida tropicalis meningitis developed. Treatment was started"
		with 400 mg of fluconazole administered intravenously every 12 h. In vitro
		susceptibility testing showed a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) to
		fluconazole of 1 microg/mL. Fluconazole was therefore continued orally for a
		"total of 60 days, and the patient remained asymptomatic for 2 years. He then"
		presented with increased vertigo and ataxia. Cerebrospinal fluid cultures grew C.
		"tropicalis, which again showed susceptibility to fluconazole with a MIC of 1"
		"microg/mL, identical to that in the previous infection. However, a second course"
		of fluconazole failed to control the infection despite adequate cerebrospinal

AB	-	Candida tropicalis is a frequent cause of fungemia in hospitals in Latin America.
		"Candida albicans (33%) was the most frequently isolated species, followed by"
		"Candida parapsilosis (27%), and Candida tropicalis (24%) in tertiary care"
		hospital in Brazil. We identified and retrospectively reviewed 27 cases of C.
		tropicalis fungemia that occurred at Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre from
		1996 to 1999. The mean age of the patients was 32 years (range 6 months to 88
		"years). Eight patients (29.6%) had hematological malignancy, and four (14.8%) had"
		"solid tumors. All the patients were taking broad-spectrum antibiotics, including"
		vancomycin for at least 7 days. Antibiotics were given through a central venous
		catheter for the majority of the patients (77.7%). Relevant risk factors for
		"candidemia in our patients included neutropenia (59.2%), and use of"
		corticosteroids (37.0%) or cytotoxic drugs (40.7%). The onset of fever was the
		most frequent clinical manifestation (92.5%) of fungemia. Most of the patients
		(81.4%) were treated with amphotericin B or fluconazole. Overall mortality was
		"48.1%, and 7 (53.4%) of 13 deaths occurred within 10 days of the detection of"
		candidemia. Results of the in vitro susceptibility testing of nine isolates of C.
		tropicalis from seven patients did not show resistance to fluconazole and
		amphotericin B.C. tropicalis presents as an important cause of fungemia in
		oncological and nononcological patients with central venous catheters taking
		broad-spectrum antibiotics. Although there was no evidence of resistance of C.
		"tropicalis to amphotericin B and fluconazole, patients treated with antifungal"
		agents presented with a high mortality rate in the hospital setting.

AB	-	Candida auris has emerged as a nosocomial multi-drug resistant pathogen. This
		study aimed to compare the risk factors and outcomes of C. auris candidemia
		"patients with non-C. auris candidemia, at a single center in Pakistan. A"
		"retrospective study compared 38 C. auris with 101 non-C. auris (36 C. albicans,"
		"38 C. tropicalis, and 27 C. parapsilosis) candidemia patients between September"
		"2014 and March 2017 at the Aga Khan University Hospital, Pakistan. Demographics,"
		"clinical history, management and outcomes were studied. Prior history of surgery"
		"(adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 4.9, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.4-17.5),"
		"antifungals exposure (aOR 38.3, 95% CI: 4.1-356) and prior MDR bacteria isolation"
		"(aOR 5.09, 95% CI: 1.6-15.9) were associated with C. auris candidemia. On"
		survival analysis both groups of patients had similar outcome in terms of
		"mortality (62.6% vs. 52.54%, hazard ratio [HR] 1.45, 95% CI: 0.84-2.4,"
		"P-value = .17) and microbiological failure rates (42.3% vs. 32.2%, HR 0.65, 95%"
		"CI: 0.35-1.2, P-value = .17) however, C. auris patients had a higher mean"
		"hospital stay (36.32 days vs. 14.8 days, P-value = <.001) and higher >15-day"
		"in-hospital stay from positive culture (HR 2.68, 95% CI: 1.1-6.3,"
		"P-value = .025). Antifungal susceptibility was different, with C. auris more"
		often resistant to voriconazole (29.6% vs. 0%) and amphotericin (3.7 vs. 0%);
		though no echinocandin resistance was detected in either group. As opposed to
		"other Candida species, C. auris candidemia occurred after nosocomial exposure,"
		and its source was most commonly an indwelling line. Although these patients had
		"a higher in-hospital stay, but there was no excess mortality when compared to"
		other Candida species.

TI	-	Clinical profile and risk factors for oral candidosis in sick newborns.
PG	-	299-303
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To provide the clinical profile and assess the significance of
		various risk factors contributing to the occurrence of oral candidosis in
		newborns. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Neonatal Intensive Care Unit
		(NICU). SUBJECTS: Twenty newborns with oral candidosis and an equal number of age
		and weight matched controls. INTERVENTIONS: All cases of oral candidosis were
		treated with local application of 1% Clotrimazole. RESULTS: Oral candidosis was
		documented in 3.2% (20/650) cases in the NICU. Acute pseudomembranous candidosis
		was the most common presentation. The mean age of onset was 10.5 days. Candida
		"albicans was isolated in 50% cases in addition to C. tropicalis, C."
		"paratropicalis, C. krusei, C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis. On univariate"
		"analysis, male sex, birth asphyxia and prolonged antibiotic therapy had a"
		significant correlation with occurence of oral candidosis in neonates. Out of
		"these, birth asphyxia was the only factor significantly associated with oral"
		"candidosis (OR 8.09, 95% CI 1.34-48.8, p = 0.0226) on multivariate analysis."
		CONCLUSIONS: C. albicans was the predominant isolate in this series of oral
		candidosis. Clinical manifestations were evident in the second week of life and
		birth asphyxia was the most important associated perinatal event.

OAB	-	"During February-September 1992, all 650 infants admitted to the neonatal"
		intensive care unit of the University College of Medical Sciences and G.T.B.
		Hospital were screened for oral thrush. A case control study was conducted to
		determine risk factors for oral candidiasis in newborns. The rate of oral
		candidiasis in this population was 3.2% (20 cases). The most common pathogen was
		Candida albicans (50%). All but 1 oral thrush case had acute pseudomembranous
		candidiasis. 75% of oral thrush cases were asymptomatic. Mean age of onset was
		"10.4 days (median, 9.5 days). Clotrimazole solution was applied to oral lesions"
		of all oral thrush cases. The multiple logistic regression revealed that birth
		asphyxia was the only significant factor responsible for oral thrush in newborns
		(odds ratio = 8.09; p = 0.0226). These findings show that the most important
		perinatal event associated with oral thrush in newborns was birth asphyxia.

AB	-	A 76-year-old female patient was unable to ambulate due to sequelae of
		cerebrovascular disease and had been living in a healthcare facility. On
		"admission, the patient was diagnosed with sepsis and a urinary tract infection"
		"caused by Candida tropicalis. Chest radiography showed right lung atelectasis,"
		while bronchoscopy showed bronchial stenosis with anthracotic pigmentation in
		both bronchi. Bronchial washing cytology revealed herpes simplex virus (HSV) type
		1-infected cells with intranuclear inclusions and multinucleation on the 7th day.
		"Moreover, the patient showed microscopic hematuria. Urine cytology also revealed"
		"HSV type 1-infected cells. The patient was treated with antiviral (acyclovir),"
		"antifungal, and antibiotic agents. One week later, follow-up urine cytology"
		"revealed the absence of HSV infection, and her condition was stabilized. However,"
		her clinical condition deteriorated due to an infection caused by
		"multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens, and she eventually died 4 weeks after"
		admission. We describe a case of HSV type 1 pneumonia and urinary tract infection
		in an older adult patient.

		adult patients at a tertiary care hospital in North China.
PG	-	684-90
LID	-	10.1093/mmy/myv060 [doi]
AB	-	"Nosocomial candidemia extends the length of hospital stay, increases the costs of"
		"medical care, and is associated with a high mortality rate. Epidemiological data"
		that assist in the choice of initial therapy may help to improve the prognosis.
		The present study was undertaken to investigate the epidemiology of nosocomial
		candidemia and identify risk factors for nosocomial candidemia caused by C.
		albicans and non-albicans Candida species (NAC). A retrospective chart review was
		undertaken to analyze cases of nosocomial candidemia treated at the Beijing
		Friendship Hospital between January 2008 and December 2012. All cases of
		candidemia were identified using the previously published criteria. Among 106
		"patients analyzed, 53.8% had nosocomial candidemia caused by NAC. Candida"
		"albicans was the most common causative agent, accounting for 46.2% of all cases,"
		"followed by C. glabrata (25.5%), C. tropicalis (15.1%), C. parapsilosis (10.4%)"
		and C. Krusei (0.9%). Comparison of nosocomial C. albicans and NAC candidemia by
		multivariate logistic regression showed that factors independently associated
		with nosocomial NAC candidemia included exposure to azole agents (odds ratio
		[OR]: 3.359; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.136-10.154; P = .031) and artificial
		surgical implants (OR: 37.519; 95% CI: 2.5-562.998; P = .009). A significant risk
		factor for nosocomial C. albicans candidemia was cancer surgery (OR: 0.075; 95%
		CI: 0.013-0.437; P = .004). Clinical and epidemiological differences in the risk
		factors between nosocomial candidemia caused by C. albicans and NAC should be
		considered when selecting an initial antifungal regimen for the treatment of
		adult patients. This should be undertaken before the availability of species
		identification and/or antifungal susceptibility results.

AB	-	"INTRODUCTION: The incidence of Candida spp. infections is worrisome, particularly"
		in critically ill patients. Previous reports suggested that increasing use of
		antifungal therapy might affect resistance profiles of invasive strains. The
		study objective was to describe the distribution resistance profile of Candida
		"spp. strains, and to correlate it with antifungal consumptions within one ICU."
		METHOD: Antifungal drug consumption was measured as the number of defined daily
		doses per 1000 hospital days. The distribution of Candida spp. over a 10 year
		period 2004-2013 and the MICs of antifungal drugs over 2007-2013 were determined.
		Time series analyses were performed. RESULTS: Of 2403 identified Candida spp.
		"from 5360 patients, Candida albicans predominated (53.1%), followed by Candida"
		"glabrata (16.2%), Candida parapsilosis (7.9%) and Candida tropicalis (7.5%). C."
		parapsilosis increased from 5.7% in 2004 to 8.4% in 2013 (P = 0.02). The increase
		in caspofungin use is correlated with the increase in caspofungin MICs of C.
		"parapsilosis (P = 0.01), C. glabrata (P = 0.001) and C. albicans (P = 0.02)."
		Polyenes consumption correlated with an increase in amphotericin B MICs of C.
		glabrata (P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Previous history of antifungal prescription

AB	-	BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the epidemiology of oral
		yeast colonization and infection amongst cancer patients. METHODS: Patients with
		"solid tumor, head-neck cancer or hematological malignancy were recruited into the"
		"study. Demographic data on age, gender, type of cancer, preceding treatment with"
		"antibiotics, anti-fungal agents, chemotherapy, radiation or surgery and presence"
		of dentures were recorded on admission. Oral examination and microbial swabs were
		"obtained and yeast culture, identification and antifungal susceptibility"
		performed. RESULTS: Oral yeast colonization was prevalent in 56.8% (227/400) of
		all cancer patients and 18.9% (43/227) of those had clinical and microbiological
		evidence of infection. The incidence of oral candidiasis in yeast colonized
		patients was highest in head neck cancer (29.2%) followed by hematological
		malignancies (20.5%) and solid tumor (17%) patients. Age and dentures were
		identified as independent risk factors associated with yeast carriage. Candida
		albicans was the dominant (74%) species (497.5 per 1000 cancer admissions)
		"followed by C. glabrata (11.5%), C. tropicalis (2.6%), C. krusei (2.6%) and C."
		parapsilosis (1.9%). The overall resistance to azoles was 28.2% (75/266).
		"Resistance to specific drugs was seen for fluconazole (4.5%), itraconazole"
		"(11.7%), ketoconazole (11.3%), voriconazole (0.75%) and caspofungin (41.1%) but"
		none to amphotericin B or nystatin. CONCLUSIONS: The highest incidence of oral
		candidiasis amongst cancer patients was seen in head neck cancers. The majority
		of infections were caused by C. albicans but almost one third of patients
		harbored non-C. albicans strains such as C. glabrata which were often more
		resistant to anti-fungal agents.

PG	-	1122-8
AB	-	The medical records of patients with hematogenous candidiasis at M. D. Anderson
		Cancer Center (Houston) between 1988 and 1992 were retrospectively reviewed.
		"There were 491 episodes of infection (6 per 1,000 admissions), 79% of which"
		occurred outside the intensive care unit setting. A significant decrease in
		"incidence was observed among patients with leukemia over the study period,"
		together with a relative decrease in Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis
		infections and an increase in Candida krusei and possibly Candida glabrata
		"infections. In the multivariate analysis, fluconazole prophylaxis provided strong"
		protection against the development of C. tropicalis infection (odds ratio [OR] =
		"0.08) and C. albicans infection (OR = 0.15), in comparison with protection"
		"against infections due to other species, but it was the single most important"
		determinant for the relative increase in C. krusei (OR = 27.07) and C. glabrata
		"(OR = 5.08) infections. In conclusion, there has been a substantial shift in the"
		epidemiology of hematogenous candidiasis caused by different Candida species in
		recent years. Fluconazole appears to be playing a major role in this observed
		shift.

		non-albicans Candida species: review of the caspofungin database.
PG	-	1864-71
LID	-	10.1128/AAC.00911-09 [doi]
AB	-	Increasing rates of invasive candidiasis caused by non-albicans Candida species
		have been reported worldwide. Particular concerns have been raised for C.
		parapsilosis because of reduced in vitro susceptibility to echinocandins. We
		identified 212 patients with invasive candidiasis due to non-albicans Candida
		species (>or=5 cases per species) in 5 clinical trials of caspofungin monotherapy
		"from the pharmaceutical sponsor's (Merck and Co., Inc.) database: 71 cases were"
		"caused by C. parapsilosis, 65 by C. tropicalis, 54 by C. glabrata, 10 by C."
		"krusei, 9 by C. guilliermondii, and 5 by C. lusitaniae. One hundred sixty-seven"
		cases caused by C. albicans were also identified. Efficacy was assessed at the
		end of caspofungin therapy. Success (favorable overall response) required
		favorable clinical and microbiological responses. The mean APACHE II scores were
		16.5 in the non-albicans group and 15.7 in the C. albicans group. Neutropenia at
		study entry was more common in the non-albicans group (12%) than in the C.
		albicans group (5%). The median duration of caspofungin therapy was 14 days in
		both groups. The success rates were 77% in both groups and at least 70% for each
		"non-albicans species: 74% for C. parapsilosis, 71% for C. tropicalis, 85% for C."
		"glabrata, 70% for C. krusei, 89% for C. guilliermondii, and 100% for C."
		lusitaniae. The times to negative blood culture were similar for the various
		species. The overall mortality rates were 26% in the non-albicans group and 29%
		in the C. albicans group. Drug-related serious adverse events and
		discontinuations due to caspofungin toxicity were uncommon. Although the sample
		"sizes were limited, caspofungin demonstrated favorable efficacy and safety"
		profiles in the treatment of invasive candidiasis caused by the following
		"non-albicans Candida species: C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, C."
		"krusei, C. guilliermondii, and C. lusitaniae."

AB	-	While performing molecular confirmation of phenotypically identified Candida
		"tropicalis isolates, we re-identified a few isolates as Kodamaea ohmeri. This led"
		us to the present epidemiological investigation of K. ohmeri fungaemia cases. All
		phenotypically identified C. tropicalis blood isolates during October 2008
		through to December 2009 at our advanced paediatric centre were included for
		molecular identification by sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer and
		D1/D2 regions of rDNA. After identifying a large cluster K. ohmeri fungaemia
		"cases, a case-control study was carried out retrospectively to analyse potential"
		risk factors for K. ohmeri fungaemia. Molecular typing of the isolates was
		performed using a fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (FAFLP)
		technique. The antifungal susceptibility testing was performed as per the M27-A3
		protocol of CLSI. Thirty-eight (25.7%) of 148 phenotypically identified
		C. tropicalis isolates were confirmed as K. ohmeri by sequencing and FAFLP. By
		"case-control analysis, piperacillin-tazobactam was significantly associated with"
		the K. ohmeri fungaemia. The FAFLP analysis showed that all K. ohmeri isolates
		had >92% similarity. The azoles and echinocandins had good in vitro activity
		"against K. ohmeri, though 86.8% of the isolates had MIC of 1 mg/L for"
		amphotericin B. The response to antifungal therapy could be evaluated in 27
		patients and 70.4% of patients recovered after antifungal therapy. The present
		study reports the largest cluster of K. ohmeri fungaemia from a single centre.
		The study also stresses the need for accurate identification of clinical yeast
		isolates.

AB	-	The aim of this study is to describe the degree of yeast-colonization in diabetic
		and hemodialysed-users of dental prostheses. Individuals (306) were examined
		using an oral rinse technique in order to evaluate the incidence of
		"yeast-carriage, and genotype of C. albicans. Yeasts were isolated from 68.4%"
		(91/133) individual's dental prostheses users. Dental prostheses were found to be
		"a significant factor for the yeast colonization (P < 0.05). Overall, the"
		intensity of carriage was higher in diabetic patients as compared with health and
		hemodialysed individuals (P < 0.05). The isolation rates were: C. albicans
		"(51.7%), C. parapsilosis (20.9%), C. tropicalis (14.3%), C. glabrata (6.6%), C."
		"krusei (3.3%), C. rugosa (1.1%), and Pichia (Pichia ohmeri, 2.2%). Ready-To-Go"
		RAPD Analysis Beads were used and primer OPJ 6 distinguished the C. albicans
		isolates found in prostheses users. All the isolates were grouped into 11 RAPD
		"profiles in four main clusters and, the average S (AB) for the entire collection"
		of 47 C. albicans isolates were 0.779 +/- 0.178. Over 85% of isolates had a
		similarity level higher than or equal to 0.8 reinforcing the idea that the use of
		"dental prostheses, independently of the host's clinical condition, probably"
		provides the necessary conditions for these strains to gain a growth-specific
		advantage over others.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Bloodstream Candida infection is a life-threatening event among ICU
		admitted patients. This infection is caused by a diverse range of Candida species
		having varied minimum inhibitory concentrations. OBJECTIVES: To identify Candida
		species causing bloodstream infections with their antifungal susceptibility
		determination. METHODS: Candida species isolated from the blood of ICU admitted
		patients were identified by phenotypic as well as by molecular methods including
		PCR-RFLP using MspI restriction enzyme and MALDI TOF MS. The minimum inhibitory
		"concentration of fluconazole, voriconazole, amphotericin B and caspofungin was"
		determined against isolated Candida species by CLSI M27A(3) guidelines. RESULTS:
		"A total of 119 Candida species were isolated. Among them, C. tropicalis(n=29) was"
		"the predominant isolate followed by C. parapsilosis(n=18), C. glabrata (n=12), C."
		krusei (n=11) and C. albicans(n=11). Uncommon Candida species isolated were;
		"Wickerhamomyces anomalus(n=15), Kodaemia ohmeri(n=8), C. lusitaniae (n=5) and C."
		auris (n=2). A varied antifungal MIC values were observed. Caspofungin had the
		lowest MIC among the tested antifungals. Increased fluconazole MIC was observed
		against the isolated Candida species including C. tropicalis. All the isolated C.
		lusitaniae and C. auris strains have ≥1mcg/ml amphotericin B MIC. In comparison
		"to fluconazole, voriconazole was more effective when tested in vitro. CONCLUSION:"
		Emergence of uncommon Candida species having varied antifungal MIC warns the
		"physicians to have a prompt, accurate identification with antifungal MIC"
		determination in each case of bloodstream Candida infections.

PG	-	745-50
AB	-	A prospective observational study of invasive candidiasis was conducted in the
		neonatal intensive care unit of Aristotle University in Hippokration Hospital
		"between 1994 and 2000. During this period, 59 neonates developed invasive"
		"candidiasis (58 cases of candidemia and 1 case of peritonitis), resulting in an"
		overall incidence of 1.28% that showed a decreasing trend over the study period.
		Eleven (18.6%) cases developed within the first week of life and the others
		within a mean (+/-SEM) of 13.4+/-1.7 days after birth. The three most frequent
		"causative species were Candida albicans (65.5%), Candida parapsilosis (15.5%),"
		and Candida tropicalis (7%). C. albicans was the predominant species between 1994
		"and 1998, whereas, non-albicans Candida spp., particularly C. parapsilosis, were"
		the most frequent species during the period 1999-2000 (P<0.001). While the
		"overall mortality due to candidemia was 29% (17 of 59 cases), mortality"
		"associated with C. albicans and C. parapsilosis was 39.5% and 11.1%, respectively"
		"(P=0.032), and that observed in the 1999-2000 period was 0% (P=0.011). Virtually"
		"all isolates were susceptible to amphotericin B, flucytosine, fluconazole, and"
		"itraconazole, and no increases in minimal inhibitory concentrations were observed"
		during these years. With the exception of a limited cluster of cases due to
		"genotypically identical isolates, no clonal relation of C. albicans isolates was"
		"found. Moreover, no clonal persistence of C. albicans and no decrease in"
		antifungal drug susceptibility occurred over the 6-year study period.
		"Non-albicans Candida spp., mostly C. parapsilosis, have emerged as important"
		"pathogens in neonatal intensive care units, with infected patients having better"
		outcomes as compared to patients infected with C. albicans.

		"candidaemia and to evaluate the risk factors, demographic features, treatment and"
		clinical outcome associated with candidaemia in a Turkish tertiary care
		paediatric unit within a 9-year period. The data of children who were diagnosed
		"as nosocomial candidaemia, were examined in this study. Between January 1997 and"
		"December 2005, a total of 102 nosocomial candidaemia episodes were identified in"
		102 patients. The rate of nosocomial candidaemia in our clinic increased from 3.2

		and to 6.9 per 1000 admissions in 2003-2005 (P = 0.003). The species most
		"frequently causing candidaemia were Candida albicans (39.2%), Candida"
		parapsilosis (21.6%) and Candida tropicalis (15.7%). The mortality of C. albicans
		"(37.5%), was significantly higher than the mortality of non-albicans species"
		(17.7%) (P = 0.04). Independent risk factors associated with candidaemia-related
		"deaths by logistic regression analysis were disseminated candidiasis (odds ratio,"
		"5.7; P = 0.01), paediatric intensive care unit stay (odds ratio, 8.1; P = 0.001),"

TI	-	Fungal empyema thoracis: an emerging clinical entity.
PG	-	1672-8
AB	-	"STUDY OBJECTIVES: To analyze the clinical spectra, pathogenesis, treatment,"
		"outcome, and prognostic factors of fungal empyema thoracis. DESIGN: The medical"
		records of patients with positive fungal cultures from pleural effusions were
		retrospectively analyzed. SETTING: A university-based tertiary care hospital in
		"Taipei, Taiwan. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 1990 through December 1997,"
		patients diagnosed with fungal empyema were included in this study. The criteria
		for diagnosis of fungal empyema thoracis were as follows: (1) isolation of a
		"fungal species from the pleural effusion; (2) significant signs of infection,"
		such as fever (body temperature > 38.3 degrees C) and leukocytosis (white blood
		"cell > 10,000/microL); and (3) isolation of the same mold species from pleural"
		"effusion on more than one occasion, or from pleural effusion and other specimens"
		"such as blood, sputum, or surgical wounds that showed evidence of tissue"
		invasion. RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients with fungal empyema thoracis were
		"included. Their mean age was 54 years (range, 2 weeks to 93 years), and 64% (43"
		"patients) were men. Fifty-seven patients (85%) had various underlying diseases,"
		and 18 (27%) had more than one immunocompromising condition. A total of 73 fungal
		isolates were recovered from pleural effusion; the most commonly encountered were
		"Candida species (47 isolates, 64%), Torulopsis glabrata (13 isolates, 18%), and"
		"Aspergillus species (9 isolates, 12%). Candida albicans (28 isolates) was the"
		"most common Candida species, followed by Candida tropicalis (13 isolates). Six"
		"patients (9%) had two fungal strains isolated, and 16 (24%) had concomitant"
		bacterial empyema thoracis. Eighteen patients (27%) had concurrent fungemia. Most
		"(56 patients, 84%) cases of fungal empyema thoracis were nosocomial, and many"
		"case (43 patients, 64%) were acquired in ICUs. Abdominal disease (20 patients,"
		"30%), especially previous abdominal surgery and GI perforation (12% and 10%,"
		"respectively), was the most common cause of fungal empyema thoracis, followed by"
		"bronchopulmonary infection (15 patients, 22%) and chest surgery (12 patients,"
		"18%). Forty-nine patients (73%) received systemic antifungal therapy, and 38"
		(57%) underwent closed drainage therapy. Eleven patients (16%) underwent pleural
		"irrigation with normal saline solution, povidone-iodine solution, or antifungal"
		agents. Six patients (9%) finally received decortication. All patients receiving
		surgery or pleural irrigation with antifungal agents survived. Despite the
		"aforementioned management, the crude mortality was high (73%). Multivariate"
		analysis showed a significantly increased risk of death in immunocompromised
		"patients (relative risk, 1.58; p < 0.005) and those with respiratory failure"
		"(relative risk, 2.31; p < 0.001). Systemic antifungal therapy was associated with"
		"a significantly lower risk of death (relative risk, 0.69; p < 0.05). CONCLUSION:"
		These data imply an increasing incidence of fungal empyema thoracis in recent
		years and the necessity for aggressive treatment of patients with this disease.

		based on an exhaustive surveillance programme (2002-14).
PG	-	1784-1793
LID	-	10.1093/jac/dkx045 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: Using registry data to compare fungaemia caused by uncommon yeast
		"species (UYS; i.e. other than Candida albicans , Candida glabrata , Candida"
		"parapsilosis , Candida tropicalis and Candida krusei ) and C. albicans -related"
		fungaemia can reveal specific predisposing factors of UYS with potential impact
		on treatment strategies. METHODS: We analysed 338 episodes of UYS fungaemia
		"prospectively collected from 27 hospitals (Paris, France; 1 October 2002-31"
		December 2014) and compared these with 1998 single episodes of C. albicans
		fungaemia using univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: The proportion of
		UYS fungaemia was stable over time. Thirty-five different species were identified
		"(27 ascomycetes, 8 basidiomycetes), 11 had caspofungin MIC 50  >0.25 mg/L and 15"
		fluconazole MIC 50  >4 mg/L. Haematological malignancies [OR=2.39 (95% CI
		1.79-3.18)] and prior exposure to antifungal drugs [OR=1.87 (1.30-2.69)] were
		independent predisposing factors for UYS infections upon multivariate analysis.
		"However, when considering the genus/species complex level, only infections due to"
		Candida kefyr -related species [OR=4.01 (2.42-6.64)] and to Trichosporon spp.
		"[OR=5.38 (1.72-16.81)] remained associated with haematological malignancies,"
		"those due to the GEOTRICHUM group with acute leukaemia [OR=61.29 (19.23-195.36)],"
		and infections with Trichosporon spp. or the GEOTRICHUM group with prior exposure
		"to caspofungin [OR=15.67 (3.62-67.80) and OR=13.17 (3.33-52.03), respectively]"
		but not to fluconazole. The global mortality at day 30 for UYS was similar to
		"that for C. albicans (35.4%, and 39.9%, respectively), but very divergent results"
		were observed according to the specific UYS. CONCLUSIONS: UYS encompass a high
		"diversity of species, each with its own behaviour and predisposing factors for"
		human infections. This variety makes it important to rapidly identify an isolate
		to the species level in order to optimize antifungal treatment.

		"hospital in China, 2000-2009."
PG	-	510-5
AB	-	The incidence of candidemia has increased in recent years. This paper reports a
		retrospective analysis of 270 cases of candidemia occurring from January 2000 to
		December 2009 at a teaching hospital in China. Demographic and clinical data were
		collected from patient medical records and the hospital's laboratory database.
		"Candida albicans (35.9%) was the most prevalent species isolated, followed by C."
		tropicalis (21.8%) and C. glabrata (13.0%). Antifungal susceptibilities to
		"fluconazole, flucytosine, and amphotericin B tended to decline over the study"
		period. The most common risk factors were the presence of central venous
		"catheters, endotracheal intubation, hypoproteinemia, renal failure, and"
		concurrent bacteremia. In the 181 (67.0%) patients who died during
		"hospitalization, endotracheal intubation, hypoproteinemia, and C. albicans were"
		the major factors associated with mortality. This study highlights the importance
		of considering the possibility of invasive Candida infection in patients exposed
		to these risk factors.

TI	-	Distributions and antifungal susceptibility of Candida species from mucosal sites
		in HIV positive patients.
PG	-	282-7
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Mucocutaneous candidiasis (almost endogenous) is one of the most
		common manifestations of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The aim of
		"this study was the investigation of colonization patterns of Candida species,"
		"particularly C. dubliniensis, among mucosal sites of HIV-positive patients and"
		determining corresponding in vitro susceptibility patterns to the antifungals.
		"METHODS: From July 2006 to May 2008, specimens from the mucosal sites of 273"
		seropositive HIV patients were collected for Candida colonization. All isolates
		were identified by standard methods and carbohydrate assimilation patterns.
		Isolates phenotypically identified as C. albicans or C. dubliniensis were
		subjected to molecular identification. Susceptibility patterns of the isolated
		species to seven antifungal agents were determined using the broth microdilution
		method. RESULTS: The 359 samples from mucosal sites which consisted of 273 oral
		and 86 vaginal were collected and evaluated for Candida species distributions and
		their corresponding susceptibility patterns. The most commonly isolated species
		"were: C. albicans (50%) followed by C. glabrata (21.4%), C. dubliniensis (13.3%,"
		"reported for the first time in Iran), C. krusei (9.8%), C. kefyr (3.1%), C."
		"parapsilosis (1.6%), and C. tropicalis (0.8%). All species were sensitive to"
		"amphotencin B, ketoconazole, nystatin, voriconazole, and caspofungin. In some"
		"isolates, resistance to fluconazole and itraconazole was noted. CONCLUSION: As"
		"demonstrated, resistance to fluconazole and itraconazole, the most frequent"
		antifungals in use in the region suggests regular investigation into antifungal
		resistance in medical centers should be undertaken in order to promote the
		effective management of invasive candidiasis in HIV/AIDS patients.

TI	-	Epidemiology and outcome of Candida bloodstream infection in an intensive care
		unit in Hong Kong.
PG	-	255-61
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To study the epidemiology of Candida bloodstream infection in the
		"Intensive Care Unit. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: A 22-bed, mixed"
		medical and surgical Intensive Care Unit of a 1400-bed university teaching
		hospital in Hong Kong. PATIENTS: All adult patients (>18 years) who had at least
		one blood culture positive for Candida. RESULTS: During the 9 years of the study
		"period, there were 128 patients with episodes of candidaemia (point prevalence,"
		"9.6 per 1000 Intensive Care Unit admissions), 72 entailed albicans candidaemia"
		"and 56 non-albicans candidaemia. Albicans was still the predominant species, but"
		the incidence of tropicalis was increasing. The median lengths of hospital and
		Intensive Care Unit stays prior to taking of the culture revealing candidaemia
		"were 15 and 6 days, respectively. In all, 61% of patients did not have Candida"
		colonisation within 2 weeks of their candidaemia. The main anti-fungal agents
		"used were fluconazole and amphotericin B, but only 89 (70%) of the patients"
		received appropriate anti-fungal treatment. Intensive Care Unit and hospital
		"mortalities were 70% and 78%, respectively. Patients who did not receive"
		appropriate treatment within 3 days had a worse outcome than those who did.
		CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed a high point prevalence of candidaemia in the
		Intensive Care Unit. Albicans was still the predominant species. Candidaemia
		"occurred early during Intensive Care Unit stay, and a significant proportion of"
		patients did not have prior fungal colonisation. Candidaemia in the Intensive
		Care Unit was associated with high morbidity and mortality. Many patients did not
		"receive appropriately early anti-fungal therapy, and endured higher mortality"
		than in the remainder.

		their pathogen profiles and antifungal susceptibilities is important for
		antifungal treatment selection. We identified the antifungal susceptibility
		patterns and predictive factors for mortality in candidemia.A multicenter
		retrospective analysis of patients with at least 1 blood culture positive for
		Candida species was conducted. Candida species were classified into 3 groups
		"(group A, Candia albicans; group B, Candida tropicalis, and Candida parasilosis;"
		"group C, Candida glabrata and Candida krusei ) to analyze the susceptibility"
		"patterns, first-line antifungal administered, and mortality. Univariate and"
		multivariate comparisons between outcomes were performed to identify mortality
		"risk factors.In total, 317 patients were identified, and 136 (42.9%) had recorded"
		mortality. Echinocandin susceptibility was higher for group A than group B
		"(111/111 [100%] vs 77/94 [81.9%], P < .001). Moreover, group A demonstrated"
		"higher fluconazole susceptibility (144/149 [96.6%] vs 39/55 [70.9%], P < .001)"
		"and lower mortality (68 [45.3%] vs 34 [61.8%], P = .036) than those of group C."
		"In the multivariate analysis, the sequential organ failure assessment score (odds"
		"ratio OR 1.351, 95% confidence interval 1.067-1.711, p = 0.013) and positive"
		"blood culture on day 7 of hospitalization (odds ratio 5.506, 95% confidence"
		"interval, 1.697-17.860, P = .004) were associated with a higher risk of"
		mortality.Patients with higher sequential organ failure assessment scores and
		sustained positive blood cultures have an increased risk of mortality.

		associated with candida infection among critically ill children. PATIENTS AND
		METHODS: A retrospective case-control study wherein 109 children admitted to the
		pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) in the years between 2015 and 2017 with the
		"growth of candida from blood, urine, endotracheal (ET) aspirate, and pus swabs"
		were included and compared to 97 age and sex-matched controls chosen from the
		"same time period. RESULTS: Of the 124 candida isolates from 109 children, 37%"
		"were from blood, 24% from urine, and 14% in pus; 40% of the isolates were from ET"
		aspirate. Candida non-albicans types (70%) predominated with Candida tropicalis
		causing 50% of the infections. Risk factors for candida infection were
		"neutropenia [OR 20.01, 95% CI (0.94-422.32)], mechanical ventilation [OR 5.97,"
		"95% CI (2.44-14.62)], peritoneal dialysis [OR 5.81, 95% CI (1.27-26.50)],"
		"institution of amino acids [OR 5.41, 95% CI (0.85-34.13)], presence of central"
		"venous catheter [OR 3.83, 95% CI (1.59-9.19)], antibiotic use >5 days [OR 3.58,"
		95% CI (1.38-9.29)]. Candida Cases (95.4%) had a septic shock with acute kidney
		injury in 34% and had significantly lower survival than controls [72 (66%) of 109
		vs. 74 (80%) of 92] (p = 0.023). CONCLUSIONS: The rate of candida infection in
		our PICU was 4.2% of PICU admissions. The most common species was C. tropicalis.
		"The independent risk factors for candida infection were neutropenia, antibiotic"
		"duration >5 days, peritoneal dialysis, amino acid administration, mechanical"
		"ventilation, and presence of a central venous catheter (CVC). HOW TO CITE THIS"

PG	-	e442-7
LID	-	10.1016/j.ijid.2012.02.005 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candidemia affects patient populations from neonates to the elderly.
		"Despite this, little information is available about the epidemiology of"
		candidemia in elderly patients. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of
		987 episodes of candidemia in adults (>14 years of age) from the databases of
		three laboratory-based surveys of candidemia performed at 14 tertiary care
		"hospitals. Patients aged ≥60 years were considered elderly (group 1, n=455, 46%)"
		"and were compared to younger patients (group 2, n=532, 54%) regarding"
		"demographics, underlying diseases, comorbidities, exposure to medical procedures,"
		"species, treatment, and outcome. RESULTS: The median APACHE II score was"
		"significantly higher in the elderly patients (19 vs. 15, p=0.03). Variables that"
		were observed significantly more frequently in elderly patients included
		"admission to an intensive care unit, diabetes mellitus, renal failure, cardiac"
		"disease, lung disease, receipt of antibiotics or H2 blockers, insertion of a"
		"central venous catheter, mechanical ventilation, and candidemia due to Candida"
		tropicalis. The 30-day mortality of elderly patients was significantly higher
		"than that of younger patients (70% vs. 45%, p<0.001). Factors associated with"
		higher mortality by multivariate analysis included APACHE II score and being in
		group 1 (elderly). Factors associated with mortality in elderly patients were
		lung disease and the receipt of mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: Elderly
		patients account for a substantial proportion of patients with candidemia and
		have a higher mortality compared to younger patients.

		pediatric population.
PG	-	664-8
LID	-	10.1097/INF.0b013e318213da0f [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Non-albicans Candida (NAC) species have been implicated as major
		pathogens in patients with hospital-acquired candidemia. Few studies have
		investigated the impact of NAC fungemia among pediatric patients outside of the
		"neonatal age group. MATERIALS/METHODS: Between 2000 and 2009, we performed a"
		retrospective case-control study in children aged 6 months to ≤18 years with
		"blood culture proven candidemia at Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX."
		RESULTS: A total of 276 episodes of candidemia occurred in 226 patients. The
		overall incidence ranged between 0.06 and 0.3 per 1000 inpatient days. The median
		"patient age was 50 months (range, 6 months to ≤18 years) with 55.4% males; 40.2%"
		Hispanics; and 31.8% whites. Candida albicans (CA) was the most common (44.2%)
		"species although, collectively, NAC was more frequently (55.8%) isolated. Among"
		"the NAC group, Candida parapsilosis was most common (23.9%) followed by Candida"
		"tropicalis (14.8%), Candida glabrata (6.5%), and Candida lusitaniae (5.4%). No"
		"difference was found between CA and NAC candidemia in terms of demographics,"
		"underlying diagnosis, risk factors, clinical features, dissemination, or 30-day"
		mortality. Disseminated candidiasis was independently associated with the use of
		"vasopressors (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 4.58; confidence interval [CI]:"
		"1.03-20.5; P = 0.05), prolonged fungemia (≥3 days of persistently positive"
		"cultures) after catheter removal (OR, 3.2; CI: 1.08-9.3; P = 0.04), and"
		"neutropenia (OR, 4.06; CI: 1.2-13.2; P = 0.02), but not with NAC fungemia."
		"CONCLUSIONS: Though CA was the single most common species, NAC species"
		collectively have emerged as the predominant pathogens responsible for candidemia
		"in non-neonatal patients at our institution. Risk factors, clinical features, and"
		outcomes were not different between the 2 groups.

		lesions.
PG	-	550-5
AB	-	BACKGROUND: A diagnosis of systemic candidiasis is often delayed or missed owing
		"to the absence of sensitive, specific, and timely diagnostic tools. Skin lesions"
		"are not common, but they can help to rapidly establish a diagnosis. We report on"
		a 14-year experience of systemic candidiasis with skin lesions in our
		"institution. We report the prevalence, clinical findings, histologic findings,"
		"etiologic Candida species, underlying conditions, treatment modalities, and"
		outcomes of the cases and compare them with the previous reports. METHODS: We
		reviewed the medical records and laboratory data of patients diagnosed with
		"systemic candidiasis from June 1989 to September 2002 at Asan Medical Center,"
		"Seoul, Korea. We thoroughly reviewed the data on those patients with"
		characteristic skin lesions. We included the cases in which Candida organisms
		were either shown or cultured from the skin. We also included the patients who
		had developed the characteristic rash at the onset of infection if there was no
		other possible explanation for the rash. RESULTS: Of 53 documented systemic
		"candidiasis cases, 19 (35.8%) had the characteristic skin lesions. Fifteen"
		patients (78.9%) had hematologic problems and were neutropenic. The skin lesions
		were a maculopapular or nodular rash and plaques. In addition to the trunk and
		"proximal extremities, the rash also involved the face and distal extremities. The"
		"rashes were mostly purpuric, not consistently associated with underlying"
		thrombocytopenia but also associated with underlying vascular damage as a result
		of Candida organisms. The underlying vascular damage also caused intraepidermal
		necrotic and vesicular change. One case of transepidermal elimination of
		organisms was newly found. The most common causative species was Candida
		"tropicalis in the 19 patients with skin lesions, in contrast with Candida"
		albicans in a total of 53 patients. The mortality rate was 84.2%. CONCLUSIONS:
		The prevalence of systemic candidiasis-associated skin lesions may be higher than
		previously reported. Dermatologists should be familiar with the clinical
		appearance of skin lesions and suspect this fatal infection when seeing
		neutropenic patients with a resistant fever and accompanying rash.

		syndrome.
PG	-	1367-1378
LID	-	10.1111/odi.12896 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to investigate the pattern of oral yeast colonization
		"of Sjögren's syndrome patients and its correlation to salivary flow rates, age,"
		and time of the disease progression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Saliva and swab
		specimens were obtained from 45 patients (primary Sjögren's syndrome = 15/
		secondary Sjögren's syndrome = 15/ healthy controls = 15). Yeast species were
		identified using culture method through chromogenic medium followed by polymerase
		chain reaction and Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: Eleven species from six different
		genera were detected. The most prevalent species found was Candida albicans
		"followed by Candida tropicalis, Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis, and"
		Candida krusei. Both groups of Sjögren's syndrome showed higher counts of
		"C. albicans (Total and CFU counts) when compared to control group. In contrast, a"
		greater variety of yeast species was identified on samples of the control group.
		"CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that C. albicans is the most prevalent yeast, but"

PG	-	635-41
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk factors for disseminated infection in
		hospitalized children with candidemia. METHODS: We performed a nested
		case-control study within a cohort of hospitalized children with candidemia. The
		cohort was defined by all patients with positive blood cultures for Candida
		"species in a large, urban, academic, tertiary care children's hospital from 1998"
		"to 2001. Cases were patients with clinical, microbiologic or radiographic"
		evidence of disseminated candidiasis. Controls were patients with no evidence of
		"disseminated candidiasis. RESULTS: Among 168 total children with candidemia, the"
		"median age was 3.5 years (interquartile range, 0.6-14.3). There were 189 episodes"
		"of candidemia. Candida species included:Candida albicans (41%), Candida"
		"parapsilosis (24%), Candida glabrata (13%) and Candida tropicalis (9%). The most"
		"common underlying diagnoses were oncologic (24%), gastrointestinal (15%) and"
		cardiac (10%) diseases. Eighty-nine patients (53%) were admitted to an intensive
		"care unit, 46 (27%) to a general pediatric or surgical ward and 33 (20%) to the"
		"oncology ward. Of the 168 patients with candidemia, 153 were included in the"
		"analysis of risk factors for disseminated candidiasis. Of 153 (17%) patients, 26"
		had evidence of organ dissemination. Organ involvement was most commonly
		"identified in the lung (58%), followed by the liver (23%), kidney (16%), brain"
		"(12%), spleen (8%), eye (8%) and heart (8%). Eight of the 26 patients had"
		evidence of dissemination to more than 1 organ. Independent risk factors for
		disseminated candidiasis were persistently positive blood cultures for Candida
		"(>3 days) with a central venous catheter in place (odds ratio, 3.0; 95%"
		"confidence interval, 1.2, 7.8; P = 0.02) and immunosuppression (odds ratio, 2.9;"
		"95% confidence interval, 1.2, 7.0; P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged duration of"
		candidemia with a central venous catheter in place and immunosuppression were
		independent risk factors for disseminated candidiasis in children with
		candidemia. Furthermore review of the epidemiology of candidemia at our
		institution revealed a heterogeneous population of children at risk for
		candidemia and a predominance of non-albicans species as the cause of these
		infections. Future studies are needed to determine the extent of evaluation
		needed for detecting dissemination among children with candidemia and to explore
		interventions for its prevention.

AB	-	"OBJECTIVE: To describe the evolving epidemiology, management, and risk factors"
		for death of invasive Candida infections in intensive care units (ICUs). DESIGN:
		"Prospective, observational, national, multicenter study. SETTING: One hundred"
		"eighty ICUs in France. PATIENTS: Between October 2005 and May 2006, 300 adult"
		patients with proven invasive Candida infection who received systemic antifungal
		therapy were included. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: One
		"hundred seven patients (39.5%) with isolated candidemia, 87 (32.1%) with invasive"
		"candidiasis without documented candidemia, and 77 (28.4%) with invasive"
		"candidiasis and candidemia were eligible. In 37% of the cases, candidemia"
		occurred within the first 5 days after ICU admission. C. albicans accounted for
		"57.0% of the isolates, followed by C. glabrata (16.7%), C. parapsilosis (7.5%),"
		"C. krusei (5.2%), and C. tropicalis (4.9%). In 17.1% of the isolates, the"
		causative Candida was less susceptible or resistant to fluconazole. Fluconazole
		"was the empirical treatment most commonly introduced (65.7%), followed by"
		"caspofungin (18.1%), voriconazole (5.5%), and amphotericin B (3.7%). After"
		"identification of the causative species and susceptibility testing results,"
		treatment was modified in 86 patients (31.7%). The case fatality ratio in ICU was
		45.9% and did not differ significantly according to the type of episode.
		Multivariate analysis showed that factors independently associated with death in
		ICU were type 1 diabetes mellitus (odds ratio [OR] 4.51; 95% confidence interval
		"[CI] 1.72-11.79; p = 0.002), immunosuppression (OR 2.63; 95% CI 1.35-5.11; p ="
		"0.0045), mechanical ventilation (OR 2.54; 95% CI 1.33-4.82; p = 0.0045), and body"
		"temperature >38.2 degrees C (reference, 36.5-38.2 degrees C; OR 0.36; 95% CI"
		0.17-0.77; p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: More than two thirds of patients with
		invasive candidiasis in ICU present with candidemia. Non-albicans Candida species
		reach almost half of the Candida isolates. Reduced susceptibility to fluconazole
		is observed in 17.1% of Candida isolates. Mortality of invasive candidiasis in
		ICU remains high.

AB	-	PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence of Candida auris candidaemia in our ICU
		patients and its molecular epidemiology. METHODS: A prospective observational
		study was conducted on candidaemia in our ICU patients over 18 months during
		"2016-2017. Demographics, underlying disease, risk factors, antifungal therapy and"
		outcome were studied. Risk factors of C. auris and non-auris candidaemia were
		"compared. RESULTS: During the study period, among 108 candidaemia cases recorded,"
		"the incidence was 6.75/1000 ICU bed days. C. auris topped the list (n = 42,"
		"39.9%), followed by C. tropicalis (34.3%), and C. parapsilosis (15.7%). On"
		"bivariate analysis prior antibiotic therapy, long central line days, mechanical"
		ventilation and length of ICU stay were significant risk factors for C. auris
		candidaemia compared to non-auris candidaemia. Multivariate analysis showed
		underlying respiratory and neurological diseases as significantly associated with
		"risk of C. auris candidaemia. Fluconazole, amphotericin B, and caspofungin"
		"resistance were noted in 97.0%, 93.7% and 3% of C. auris isolates respectively."
		"CONCLUSION: Longer duration of central line days, prior antibiotic use,"
		mechanical ventilation and prolonged ICU stay were important risk factors
		associated with C. auris candidaemia along with underlying respiratory or
		"neurological disease. The isolates are non-clonal in origin, but they belong to a"
		single clade.

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: We aimed to describe the epidemiology of Candida bloodstream
		infection in an intensive care unit (ICU) in Reunion Island. METHODS: We
		"performed a retrospective cohort study and evaluated 63 candidemia episodes,"
		which occurred between January 2004 and December 2015 in the ICU of a University
		Hospital in St-Pierre. RESULTS: The incidence rate of candidemia in the ICU was
		estimated at 7.6%. Candida albicans was the most common yeast pathogen species
		"recovered (54%), followed by Candida glabrata (17%), Candida tropicalis (12%) and"
		"Candida parapsilosis (10%). Between 2012 and 2015, we also observed a"
		modification of antifungal use. CONCLUSION: The epidemiology of candidemia in
		Reunion Island is characterized by the predominance of Candida albicans and by
		the relative importance of Candida tropicalis. This pattern corresponds to a
		model of epidemiological transition between the one usually observed in tropical
		areas and the one observed in temperate countries.

TI	-	Epidemiology of candidemia in Brazil: a nationwide sentinel surveillance of
		candidemia in eleven medical centers.
PG	-	2816-23
AB	-	Candidemia studies have documented geographic differences in rates and
		"epidemiology, underscoring the need for surveillance to monitor trends. We"
		"conducted prospective candidemia surveillance in Brazil to assess the incidence,"
		"species distribution, frequency of antifungal resistance, and risk factors for"
		fluconazole-resistant Candida species. Prospective laboratory-based surveillance
		was conducted from March 2003 to December 2004 in 11 medical centers located in 9
		major Brazilian cities. A case of candidemia was defined as the isolation of
		"Candida spp. from a blood culture. Incidence rates were calculated per 1,000"
		"admissions and 1,000 patient-days. Antifungal susceptibility tests were performed"
		"by using the broth microdilution assay, according to the Clinical and Laboratory"
		"Standards Institute guidelines. We detected 712 cases, for an overall incidence"
		"of 2.49 cases per 1,000 admissions and 0.37 cases per 1,000 patient-days. The"
		"30-day crude mortality was 54%. C. albicans was the most common species (40.9%),"
		"followed by C. tropicalis (20.9%) and C. parapsilosis (20.5%). Overall, decreased"
		"susceptibility to fluconazole occurred in 33 (5%) of incident isolates, 6 (1%) of"
		which were resistant. There was a linear correlation between fluconazole and
		voriconazole MICs (r = 0.54 and P < 0.001 [Spearman's rho]). This is the largest
		multicenter candidemia study conducted in Latin America and shows the substantial
		"morbidity and mortality of candidemia in Brazil. Antifungal resistance was rare,"
		but correlation between fluconazole and voriconazole MICs suggests
		cross-resistance may occur.

TI	-	Species distribution and susceptibility to azole antifungals of Candida
		bloodstream isolates from eight university hospitals in Korea.
PG	-	779-86
AB	-	PURPOSE: The incidence of Candida bloodstream infections (BSI) has increased over
		the past two decades. The rank order of occurrence and the susceptibility to
		antifungals of the various Candida species causing BSI are important factors
		"driving the establishment of empirical treatment protocols; however, very limited"
		multi-institutional data are available on Candida bloodstream isolates in Korea.
		MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the susceptibility to azole antifungals
		and species distribution of 143 Candida bloodstream isolates recovered from eight
		university hospitals over a six-month period. Minimal inhibitory concentrations
		"(MICs) of fluconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole for each isolate were"
		determined by the broth microdilution method of the Clinical and Laboratory
		Standards Institute (CLSI). RESULTS: The Candida species recovered most
		"frequently from the blood cultures was C. albicans (49%), followed by C."
		"parapsilosis (22%), C. tropicalis (14%), and C. glabrata (11%). The MIC ranges"
		"for the Candida isolates were 0.125 to 64 microg/mL for fluconazole, 0.03 to 2"
		"microg/mL for itraconazole, and 0.03 to 1 microg/mL for voriconazole. Overall,"
		"resistance to fluconazole was found in only 2% of the Candida isolates (3/143),"
		while the dose-dependent susceptibility was found in 6% (8/143). The resistance
		and dose-dependent susceptibility of itraconazole were found in 4% (6/143) and
		"14% (20/143) of the isolates, respectively. All bloodstream isolates were"
		"susceptible to voriconazole (MIC, < or = 1 microg/mL). CONCLUSION: Our findings"
		"show that C. albicans is the most common cause of Candida-related BSI, followed"
		"by C. parapsilosis, and that the rates of resistance to azole antifungals are"
		still low among bloodstream isolates in Korea.

LID	-	10.1111/myc.12470 [doi]
AB	-	Candidemia remains a major cause of disease worldwide and is associated with a
		high mortality rate. We conducted a retrospective study of candidemia at Nantes
		"Hospital, France, between 2004 and 2010. A total of 191 episodes (n = 188"
		"patients) were reviewed. Incidence, demographics, risk factors, antifungal"
		"management, species identification, in vitro susceptibility and 12 weeks survival"
		were analysed. Global incidence of candidemia was 0.37‰ admissions. Higher
		incidences were observed in haematology (6.65‰) and intensive care units (2‰).
		Central venous catheter and antibiotic exposure were the most frequent risk
		factors (77% and 76% respectively). Candida albicans was the predominant species
		"(51.8%) followed by C. parapsilosis (14.5%), C. glabrata (9.8%), C. tropicalis"
		"(9.8%) and C. krusei (4.1%). However, species distribution differed significantly"
		between medical units with frequency of C. tropicalis being higher in haematology
		compared to other medical units. Fluconazole and caspofungin were the main
		"antifungals given as first-line therapy. Although not significant, 12 weeks"
		"mortality rate was 30.9%, being higher for C. tropicalis (44.4%) than for C."
		parapsilosis (16%). Acquired azole or echinocandin resistance was noted in some
		"isolates, underlining the need for systematic antifungal susceptibility testing"
		in patients with candidemia. These epidemiological findings will be of interest
		for antifungal stewardship at our hospital.

		candidemia in nonneutropenic patients.
PG	-	568-73
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candidemia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in
		hospitalized patients. OBJECTIVES: To describe the epidemiology of and risk
		factors for non-albicans candidemia (NAC) in nonneutropenic adults and the impact
		of NAC on patient outcomes and treatment cost. METHODS: We conducted a
		retrospective cohort analysis comparing demographics and risk factors for Candida
		albicans candidemia (CAC) versus NAC in 144 nonneutropenic patients with
		candidemia over a 6 year period (1997-2002) at Detroit Receiving Hospital.
		"RESULTS: Candida species distribution included albicans (50%), parapsilosis"
		"(13%), tropicalis (10%), and glabrata (13%). Predominant species varied by"
		"patient care unit, with C. glabrata more common in the medical intensive care"
		"unit (ICU) and C. parapsilosis in the burn ICU. In multivariate analysis, NAC was"
		"associated with the absence of antibiotic use at the onset of candidemia, recent"
		"history of solid tumor, and male sex. NAC was not associated with an increase in"
		"mortality or length of stay compared with CAC, but was found to have a higher"
		cost of antifungal therapy ($2030 vs $780; p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The
		epidemiology of candidemia is complex and varies among the different patient care
		"units. Specifically, patients appear less likely to develop NAC if they are"
		receiving antibiotics at the onset of candidemia. Increased awareness of risk
		factors for NAC can be used to guide adequate initial antifungal therapy.

TI	-	Global distribution and outcomes for Candida species causing invasive
		candidiasis: results from an international randomized double-blind study of
		caspofungin versus amphotericin B for the treatment of invasive candidiasis.
PG	-	470-4
AB	-	"In a randomized study, caspofungin was compared with amphotericin B for the"
		treatment of invasive candidiasis in a total of 239 adults from 56 sites in 20
		countries. This study provided a unique opportunity to assess the frequency and
		"outcome of invasive candidiasis caused by different Candida species worldwide,"
		and the results are presented here. Efficacy was primarily assessed at the end of
		intravenous therapy using a modified intent-to-treat (MITT) analysis. This
		analysis was performed on 224 of the 239 patients enrolled in the study. Attempts
		were made to collect baseline Candida isolates from all patients for species
		identification at a central laboratory. Yeasts were identified to the species
		level using two commercial systems and microscopic examination. Viable baseline
		isolates were recovered from 210 of the 224 (94%) patients included in the MITT
		analysis. Candida albicans was the most frequently isolated species in all
		"regions and was responsible for 45% of cases overall. Nevertheless, the majority"
		of cases of infection were caused by non- albicans Candida species. In the USA
		"and Canada, Candida glabrata was the second most commonly isolated pathogen"
		"(18%). In contrast, Candida parapsilosis and Candida tropicalis accounted for 55%"
		of cases in Latin America. Outcomes were comparable for patients treated with
		caspofungin (74% overall; 64% and 80% for infections due to Candida albicans and
		non- albicans species) and amphotericin B (62% overall; 58% and 68% for
		"infections due to Candida albicans and non- albicans species), and were generally"
		similar across continents. The distribution of Candida species isolated from
		patients enrolled in a clinical trial may not be representative of pathogens
		"causing invasive candidiasis in the general population. Nevertheless, our"
		findings may affect the regional choice of empirical antifungal therapy for
		seriously ill patients with suspected or documented invasive candidiasis since
		different Candida species have varying susceptibility to conventional antifungal
		drugs.

AB	-	Nosocomial yeast infections have increased significantly worldwide and especially
		in surgical and intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Although Candida species have
		"various degrees of susceptibility to frequently used drugs, antifungal resistance"
		is rare. A ten-year retrospective surveillance of candidemia was carried out in a
		University Hospital of Southern Italy. The aim of this study was the
		determination of Candida bloodstream infections (BSI) and central venous catheter
		"(CVC)- related episodes, prevalence and in vitro susceptibility. 320 candidemia"
		episodes were registered and 374 yeasts collected. Etest and Sensititre methods
		"were used to test the isolates' susceptibility to amphotericin B, anidulafungin,"
		"caspofungin, fluconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole and voriconazole. The"
		results were compared with those of CLSI reference broth microdilution method.
		"Most yeasts were susceptible to all antifungal drugs, with the exception of C."
		Glabrata susceptibility to triazoles and C. tropicalis to fluconazole and
		"voriconazole. As expected, C. parapsilosis isolates were generally associated"
		with higher echinocandin minimum inhibitory concentrations (miCs) than the other
		Candida species. This study confirms the different antifungal susceptibility
		"patterns among species, and underlines the need to perform antifungal"
		susceptibility testing of clinically relevant yeasts.

		cancer.
PG	-	225-9
AB	-	Candidemia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in cancer patients.
		The incidence of candidemia has been reported to have shifted toward nonalbicans
		species. The aim of this study was to determine the distribution of Candida
		species resulting in bloodstream infections or catheter-related blood stream
		infections (CRBSIs) in pediatric hematology-oncology (PHO) patients over a
		7-year-period. Medical and computerized microbiology laboratory records of all
		positive blood fungal cultures during the study period were analyzed
		retrospectively. The ratio of non-albicans Candida species (81.4%) was nearly
		"four times higher than that of C. albicans candidemia (18.5%). Overall, C."
		"parapsilosis caused the majority (61.4%) of candidemia episodes, followed by C."
		"tropicalis (14.8%), C. famata (2.9%), C. ciferrii (1.4%) and C. glabrata (0.7%)."
		The rate of CRBSIs was significantly higher in C. Parapsilosis candidemia. The
		overall rate of 30-day mortality in 135 candidemia episodes was 4.44%. Nearly
		"half of the C. parapsilosis candidemia was associated with CRBSIs, suggesting its"
		"importance in PHO, in which several types of central venous catheters have been"
		used.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candidemia is one of the most common nosocomial infections globally
		"and it is associated with considerable excess mortality and costs. Abreast,"
		biofilm-forming strains are associated with even higher mortality rates and poor
		prognosis for the patient. AIMS: To evaluate a possible association between the
		biofilm-forming capability of Candida bloodstream isolates and the clinical
		"evolution in patients with candidemia. METHODS: An observational, retrospective"
		study was conducted at a tertiary care university hospital during 9 years
		(2006-2015). The biofilm quantitation of the Candida bloodstream isolates was
		determined by crystal violet staining and XTT reduction assay. RESULTS: A total
		of 218 cases of candidemia had been diagnosed and 89 isolates were obtained. The
		mortality rate was 36% and the main risk factors were antibiotic exposure and the
		"use of catheters. Candida tropicalis (52.8%) was the most frequent species,"
		"followed by Candida albicans (30.4%), Candida parapsilosis sensu stricto (10.1%),"
		"Candida orthopsilosis (3.4%), Candida krusei (2.2%) and Candida glabrata sensu"
		"stricto (1.1%). All the strains were biofilm producers, which is an important"
		contribution to the patient's mortality. C. tropicalis showed the highest
		"production of biomass biofilm, whereas C. glabrata exhibited the highest"
		metabolic activity. CONCLUSIONS: This study contributes to expand the knowledge
		about the local epidemiology of candidemia and highlights the impact of Candida
		biofilm on patient's outcome.

AB	-	Candida infection is seen in patients with weak or disrupted host responses.
		Cutaneous candidiasis typically affects the intertriginous areas and presents
		with a red plaque surrounded by satellite lesions. Diagnosis of cutaneous
		candidiasis is made by visual inspection followed by potassium hydroxide normal
		saline microscopic preparation (wet mount) and polymerase chain reaction
		identification or culture of fungal organism. The following case describes a
		38-year-old patient with limited mobility who presented with a peri sacral lesion
		"that was first assumed to be a decubitus ulcer by nursing facility staff, but"
		"proved to be a cutaneous infection by Candida tropicalis, a less common Candida"
		species. The unusual location as well as the characteristic C. tropicalis micro-
		and macroscopic appearance are described which ultimately led to the diagnosis of
		a cutaneous fungal infection in an otherwise immunocompetent individual that was
		resolved with fluconazole therapy. Our case report emphasizes the need for early
		diagnosis of cutaneous lesions in patients with limited mobility in consideration
		that not all Candida species thrive in similar environments and can present in
		"unusual locations of the human body. Although rare, C. tropicalis could be found"
		in this vulnerable population.

AB	-	This study aimed to describe the effect of initial antifungal therapy on patient
		mortality and to detail the current distribution and resistance patterns of
		Candida spp. among patients with candidaemia. A prospective observational study
		was performed among consecutive patients with candidaemia from 10 Turkish medical
		centres between January 2015 and November 2018. The primary outcome was 10-day
		mortality. Species were identified using MALDI-TOF/MS. A total of 342 patients
		"with candidaemia were included, of which 175 (51.2%) were male and 68 (19.9%)"
		"were aged <18 years. The most common species were Candida albicans (47.4%),"
		"Candida parapsilosis (26.6%), Candida tropicalis (9.6%) and Candida glabrata"
		"(7.6%). Among all Candida spp., the 10-day case fatality rate (CFR) was 32.2%."
		The CFR was highest in patients with C. albicans (57.3%) and lowest in patients
		with C. parapsilosis (21.8%). The resistance rate to fluconazole was 13% in C.
		"parapsilosis, with no significant effect on mortality. No resistance to"
		"echinocandins was detected. In the multivariate analysis, being in the ICU"
		"[OR = 2.1 (95% CI 1.32-3.57); P = 0.002], renal failure [OR = 2.4 (1.41-3.97);"
		"P = 0.001], total parenteral nutrition [OR = 2 (1.22-3.47); P = 0.006], C."
		albicans infection [OR = 1.7 (1.06-2.82); P = 0.027] and echinocandin as primary
		agent [OR = 0.6 (0.36-0.99); P = 0.047] were significantly associated with
		"mortality. Candidaemia is a deadly infection. Fluconazole resistance is emerging,"
		although it was not significantly related to mortality. Using an echinocandin as
		the primary agent could be life-saving.

		primer pair.
PG	-	2962-7
AB	-	A single pair of primers was used in a PCR assay to amplify and identify the DNAs
		"from four medically important Candida species: C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, C."
		"tropicalis, and C. (Torulopsis) glabrata. The report describes the first"
		successful amplification of a chitin synthase-specific fragment from the four
		Candida species responsible for more than 90% of all cases of neonatal
		candidemia. The primer pair sequence was based on that from the C. albicans
		"chitin synthase gene, CHS1 (J. Au-Young and P.W. Robbins, Mol. Microbiol."
		"4:197-207, 1990). Each of the four amplified products is a single band of a"
		"different size. The DNA sequence of each PCR product was determined, and four"
		species-specific probes were synthesized. The DNAs from as few as 10 organisms in
		100 microliters of plasma could be detected after amplification and Southern blot
		analysis. In a retrospective study of 27 paired blood samples from 16 patients
		"with culture-proven candidemia, PCR analysis was successful at detecting and"
		correctly identifying to the species level 26 of the 27 Candida isolates. The
		speed and accuracy of this PCR-based technology make it a very powerful tool for
		detecting and diagnosing candidemia. Implementation of this assay for analyzing
		"blood samples should result in the more timely treatment of neonatal candidemia,"
		thereby reducing morbidity and mortality.

		scoring systems.
PG	-	e187-93

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Prediction rules for invasive Candida infection (ICI) are available
		for adult but not for infants and children managed in pediatric intensive care
		units (PICU). METHODS: Observational study in 24 PICU with prospective phase (all
		children admitted during 1 year) and retrospective review of ICI records. Four
		"logistic regression models were performed using ICI by Candida spp., Candida"
		"albicans, Candida parapsilosis or Candida tropicalis as dependent variables."
		Scores were constructed. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty five ICI (47 C.
		"albicans, 37 C. parapsilosis, 19 C. tropicalis and 22 others) and 1022 controls"
		"were included. Incidence (cases/100 PICU admissions): 4.22 (all Candida), 2.44"
		"(C. albicans), 1.41 (C. parapsilosis), 0.19 (C. tropicalis). ICI was associated"
		"[Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) = 0.764, 95%"
		"confidence interval (CI) = 0.719-0.809, P < 0.001] with pre-PICU hospitalization"
		"≥ 15 days [odds ratio (OR) = 3.3; score: +3], fever (OR = 2.6; +2), thrombopenia"
		"(OR = 2.0; +1) and parenteral nutrition (OR=2.4; +2). Additionally, the following"
		"associations were noted: C. albicans ICI (AUC = 0.716, 95% CI = 0.640-0.792, P <"
		"0.001) with chronic metabolic disease (OR = 10.7; score:+4), surgical digestive"
		"process (OR = 2.8; +1), fever (OR = 2.8; +1) and parenteral nutrition (OR = 2.3;"
		"+1); C. parapsilosis ICI (AUC = 0.808, 95% CI = 0.739-0.877, P < 0.001) with"
		"previous colonization (OR = 7.1; score:+3), tracheostomy (OR = 5.1; +2),"
		"parenteral nutrition (OR = 4.3; +2), thrombopenia (OR = 3.6; +1) and previous"
		"bacterial infection (OR = 3.0; +1) and ICI by C. tropicalis (AUC = 0.941, 95%"
		"CI=0.886-0.995, P < 0.001) with thrombopenia (OR = 53.8; score: +10), neutropenia"
		"(OR = 7.2; +1), pre-PICU hospitalization ≥ 15 days (OR = 17.2; +3) and"
		hematologic (OR = 22.4; +4) and cardiovascular infectious processes (OR = 5.5;
		"+1). Specificity was >90% for cut offs of 5 (all Candida), 3 (C. albicans), 3 (C."
		"parapsilosis) and 11 (C. tropicalis). CONCLUSIONS: Once validated, these scores"
		may help for identification of ICI by specific species allowing adequate
		empiric/prophylactic treatment.

PG	-	5062-5065
LID	-	10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_784_20 [doi]
AB	-	Perinephric and renal abscess are very rare entities with insidious presentation
		"and pose a great diagnostic challenge, common etiology being bacterial. Only less"
		"than 30 cases of fungal etiology have been reported in literature. Herein, we"
		report first case of fungal perinephric abscess caused by Candida tropicalis in a
		young diabetic female who presented with right flank pain and vomiting. Diagnosis
		made by CT imaging and culture of USG guided aspiration of perinephric abscess
		revealed growth of Candida tropicalis. Candida tropicalis perinephric abscess
		requires a very high index of suspicion for diagnosis. Associated high morbidity
		"and mortality rates are likely due to misdiagnosis, therefore fungal perinephric"
		and renal abscess must be kept as differential diagnosis in cases of fever with
		abdominal pain. Prompt diagnosis and early treatment are important for better
		"outcome. Imaging and microbiological investigations are required for diagnosis,"
		and drainage is indicated for successful therapy.

		parapsilosis (23.2 %) and C. tropicalis (20.5 %). In vitro susceptibility testing
		showed that 88.9 % of Candida isolates were susceptible to fluconazole. The
		"30-day hospital mortality was 27.9 %, while the early mortality (within 7 days)"
		"was 16.3 %. In a multivariate regression analysis, the Acute Physiology and"
		Chronic Health Evaluation II score [odds ratio (OR) 1.23; 95 % confidence
		interval (CI) 1.080-1.390; P = 0.002] and severe sepsis or septic shock (OR
		15.35; 95 % CI 2.391-98.502; P = 0.004) were independently correlated with early
		mortality. Severe sepsis or septic shock (OR 24.75; 95 % CI 5.099-120.162;
		"P < 0.001) was an independent risk factor for 30-day mortality, while proven"
		catheter-related candidemia (OR 0.16; 95 % CI 0.031-0.810; P = 0.027) was a
		positive factor for 30-day mortality. Early central venous catheter removal and
		adequate antifungal treatment were closely related to decreased mortality in
		patients with primary candidemia. CONCLUSION: The proportion of candidemia caused
		by C. albicans was lower than that caused by non-albicans species. The severity
		"of illness influenced early mortality, and the origin of the central venous"
		catheter remarkably affected 30-day mortality.

		lumbar vertebral osteomyelitis caused by Candida albicans and review 59 cases of
		candidal vertebral osteomyelitis reported in the literature. The mean age was 50
		"years, and the lower thoracic or lumbar spine was involved in 95% of patients."
		"Eighty-three percent of patients had back pain for >1 month, 32% presented with"

		"elevated in 87% of patients, and blood culture yielded Candida species for 51%."
		"C. albicans was responsible for 62% of cases, Candida tropicalis for 19%, and"
		Candida glabrata for 14%. Risk factors for candidal vertebral osteomyelitis were
		"the presence of a central venous catheter, antibiotic use, immunosuppression, and"
		"injection drug use. Medical and surgical therapies were both used, and"
		"amphotericin B was the primary antifungal agent. Prognosis was good, with an"
		overall clinical cure rate of 85%.

AB	-	We report a fatal case of Candida auris that was involved in mixed candidemia
		"with Candida tropicalis, isolated from the blood of a neutropenic patient."
		Identification of both isolates was confirmed by amplification and sequencing of
		internal transcribed spacer and D1/D2 domain of large subunit in rRNA gene.
		Antifungal susceptibility test by E-test method revealed that C. auris was
		"resistant to amphotericin B, anidulafungin, caspofungin, fluconazole,"
		"itraconazole and voriconazole. On the other hand, C. tropicalis was sensitive to"
		all antifungal tested. The use of chromogenic agar as isolation media is vital in
		detecting mixed candidemia.

		probable invasive candidiasis.
PG	-	462-71
LID	-	10.1093/mmy/myu018 [doi]
AB	-	The gold standard laboratory tests used to diagnose invasive Candida infection
		(ICI) are based on the in vitro culture of blood or samples from other sterile
		"sites. However, these tests have limited sensitivity (Se) and are generally not"
		diagnostic until late in the infectious process. The Serion Candida mannan kit
		was evaluated for the diagnosis of ICI at Grenoble University Hospital (France)
		between 2007 and 2011. The results were then compared with worldwide data
		published between 1997 and 2011. This retrospective study was based on follow-up
		from the investigation of 162 patients of whom 91 had proven ICI; 13 had Candida
		"colonization index (CCI) scores ≥0.42, positive mannan tests, with nonconcomitant"
		"infections; and 58 had no evidence of Candida infection. Candida albicans, C."
		"glabrata, C. tropicalis, and C. parapsilosis were the etiologic agents in 104"
		"patients. For patients with or without ICI, the 12-week mortality rates were"
		"35/104 (33.7%) and 6/58 (10.3%), respectively. The mannan diagnostic specificity"
		"was 51% and Se was 77%. However, in the meta-analysis (n = 1,536), values were"
		"86% and 62%, respectively. Positive mannan test results may appear early (median"
		6 days) in the development of candidemia and have moderate diagnostic value for
		"ICI, with a negative predictive value of 83%. In patients at risk of ICI with"
		"negative candidemia, the combination of Candida mannan test data with a CCI score"
		≥0.42 may improve the diagnosis of probable ICI.

		care unit: a retrospective cohort study.
PG	-	10
LID	-	10.1186/1471-2334-13-10 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: The incidence of fungal healthcare-associated infection (HAI) has
		increased in a major teaching hospital in the northern part of Taiwan over the
		"past decade, especially in the intensive care units (ICUs). The purpose of this"
		study was to determine the factors that were responsible for the outbreak and
		trend in the ICU. METHODS: Surveillance fungal cultures were obtained from
		"""sterile"" objects, antiseptic solutions, environment of infected patients and"
		"hands of medical personnel. Risk factors for comparison included age, gender,"
		"admission service, and total length of stay in the ICU, Acute Physiology and"
		"Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores at admission to the ICU, main"
		"diagnosis on ICU admission, use of invasive devices, receipt of hemodialysis,"
		"total parenteral nutrition (TPN) use, history of antibiotic therapy before HAI or"
		"during ICU stay in no HAI group, and ICU discharge status (ie, dead or alive)."
		Univariable analysis followed by multiple logistic regression analysis was
		performed to identify the independent risk factors for ICU fungal HAIs and ICU
		mortality. RESULTS: There was a significant trend in ICU fungal HAIs from 1998 to
		2009 (P < 0.001). A total of 516 episodes of ICU fungal HAIs were identified; the
		"rates of various infections were urinary tract infection (UTI) (54.8%), blood"
		"stream infection (BSI) (30.6%), surgical site infection (SSI) (6.6%), pneumonia"
		"(4.5%), other sites (3.5%). The fungi identified were: yeasts (54.8%), Candida"
		"albicans (27.3%), Candida tropicalis (6.6%), Candida glabrata (6.6%), Candida"
		"parapsilosis (1.9%), Candida species (0.8%), and other fungi (1.9%). Candida"
		albicans accounted for 63% of all Candida species. Yeasts were found in the
		environment of more heavily infected patients. The independent risk factors (P <
		"0.05) of developing ICU fungal HAIs from all sites were TPN use, sepsis, surgical"
		"patients, mechanical ventilation and an indwelling urinary catheter. The"
		"independent risk factors for ICU fungal UTI included TPN use, mechanical"
		ventilation and an indwelling urinary catheter. The independent risk factors for
		"ICU fungal BSI included TPN use, sepsis, and higher APACHE II score. The"
		"independent risk factors for ICU fungal pneumonia included TPN use, surgical"
		patients. The independent risk factors for ICU fungal SSI included surgical
		"patients, and TPN use. The odds ratios of TPN use in various infection types"
		ranged from 3.51 to 8.82. The risk of mortality in patients with ICU fungal HAIs
		was over 2 times that of patients without ICU HAIs in the multiple logistic
		regression analysis (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: There was a secular trend of an
		increasing number of fungal HAIs in our ICU over the past decade. Patients with
		ICU fungal HAIs had a significantly higher mortality rate than did patients
		without ICU HAIs. Total parenteral nutrition was a significant risk factor for
		"all types of ICU fungal HAIs, and its use should be monitored closely."

LID	-	10.1093/jac/dkr511 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine the impact of timing of appropriate antifungal
		"therapy, as assessed by susceptibility results, on patient survival. METHODS:"
		Patients ≥16 years of age with first episodes of candidaemia during 2001-09 were
		"included. Clinical data were collected retrospectively, including time to"
		appropriate antifungal therapy and patient survival. RESULTS: The study
		"population included 446 patients [243 (54%) female, mean age 53 years] with"
		"candidaemia, 380 (85%) of whom had antifungal susceptibility data. Candida"
		"albicans was the most common pathogen (221, 50%) followed by Candida glabrata"
		"(99, 22%), Candida parapsilosis (59, 13%), Candida tropicalis (48, 11%) and"
		"Candida krusei (6, 1%). Appropriate antifungal therapy consisted of fluconazole"
		"(177, 40%), an echinocandin (125, 28%), amphotericin B (41, 9%) and voriconazole"
		"(6, 1%); 97 (22%) failed to receive appropriate antifungal therapy. The 30 day"
		mortality was 34% (151/446) and there was no clear relationship between time from
		positive culture to receipt of appropriate antifungal therapy and 30 day
		"survival. On multivariable Cox regression, increased APACHE II score [hazard"
		"ratio (HR) 1.11, 95% CI 1.09-1.13, P<0.001], cirrhosis (HR 2.15, 95% CI"
		"1.48-3.13, P<0.001) and HIV infection (HR 2.03, 95% CI 1.11-3.72, P=0.02) were"
		independent predictors of mortality. A secondary analysis requiring patients in
		the early treatment group to have received ≥24 h of effective antifungal therapy
		did show a significant mortality benefit to receiving antifungal treatment within
		72 h of a positive blood culture being drawn (30 day mortality for early
		"treatment: 27% versus 40%, P=0.004; HR for mortality with delayed treatment on"
		"multivariable analysis: 1.41, 95% CI 1.01-1.98, P=0.045). CONCLUSIONS: Candida"
		"bloodstream infection is associated with high mortality, despite timely receipt"
		of appropriate antifungal therapy.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: This study was conducted to determine characteristics of Candida
		colonization and candidemia in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of a
		tertiary care children's hospital. METHODOLOGY: Patients between 6 months and 15
		years of age consecutively admitted to the PICU of Mansoura University Children's
		"Hospital in Mansoura, Egypt, during one year period, were evaluated for Candida"
		colonization and candidemia. Susceptibility of Candida species isolated from
		blood to fluconazole and amphotericin B was determined by Etest. RESULTS:
		Sixty-six patients without prior fluconazole prophylaxis had 88 episodes of
		"candidemia, representing 19% of all cases with blood stream infections (BSIs)."
		Candida albicans (CA) and non-albicans Candida (NAC) species accounted for 40%
		"and 60% of candidemia episodes respectively. C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, and"
		"C. glabrata accounted for 25%, 17%, and 8% of NAC candidemias respectively."
		Fluconazole resistance was detected in 11.4% and 18.9% of CA and NAC isolates
		"respectively. Of the fluconazole resistant NAC isolates, four were C. krusei."
		Amphotericin B resistance was detected in 17% of NAC isolates. Candida
		"colonization was detected in 78.8% of patients. Compared to CA candidemia, higher"
		"risk for NAC candidemia was associated with age older than 1 year, Candida"
		isolation from endotracheal tube (ETT) and from central venous catheter.
		"Mortality rate was 42.4%, attributable mortality of candidemia was 16.7%."
		Regression analysis showed that the most significant independent predictors of
		"death were ETT and mechanical ventilation (MV), MV longer than 7 days, and"
		candiduria. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents important epidemiological features
		of Candida BSIs in a non-neonatal population.

TI	-	PFGE-based epidemiological study of an outbreak of Candida tropicalis candiduria:
		the importance of medical waste as a reservoir of nosocomial infection.
PG	-	263-7
AB	-	"Between November 2002 and March 2003, an outbreak of candiduria occurred in the"
		surgical intensive care unit (SICU) of a university-affiliated hospital in South
		Korea. This outbreak affected 34 patients and was caused by Candida tropicalis.
		"To determine the source of the epidemic and the risk factors, surveillance"
		"cultures from the SICU, genotyping of Candida isolates by pulsed-field gel"
		"electrophoresis (PFGE), and a case-control study were performed. The surveillance"
		cultures revealed that 6 environmental samples related to the urine disposal
		route were positive for C. tropicalis. The PFGE analysis of genomic DNA
		demonstrated identical band patterns for all of the C. tropicalis isolates
		obtained from SICU patients and the 6 environmental samples during the outbreak
		"period, while epidemiologically unrelated strains showed unique PFGE band"
		"patterns. Although no risk factors were identified by the case-control study,"
		this epidemiological investigation involving the use of molecular techniques
		suggests that improper disposal of infectious medical waste led to the
		cross-transmission of a single clone that was responsible for the outbreak of C.
		tropicalis candiduria in this SICU. After implementing a better urine disposal
		"system and thorough hand washing procedures, no further clusters of candiduria"
		were detected in the SICU.

AB	-	"Candida spp. are among the most frequent nosocomial pathogens, contributing"
		significantly to morbidity and mortality. Longitudinal data on the epidemiology
		of Candida bloodstream infections (BSIs) are still limited. Isolates and clinical
		data from 1218 episodes of Candida BSI were prospectively collected from patients
		in 52 hospitals in the USA between 1998 and 2006. Susceptibilities to
		"amphotericin B, flucytosine, fluconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole,"
		"anidulafungin, caspofungin and micafungin were determined for 1077 Candida"
		isolates by the CLSI reference broth microdilution method using the recently

		glabrata (16.7%) and Candida tropicalis (10.2%). The prevalence of non-albicans
		Candida spp. increased over time. Patients had a mean age of 51 years and a mean
		length of hospital stay prior to BSI of 22 days. The main underlying conditions
		were gastrointestinal (20.1%) and pulmonary (13.0%) diseases. Intravenous
		catheters (19.1%) and the urinary tract (8.0%) were the most frequently
		"determined likely sources, whilst in the majority of patients (61.1%) no source"
		"could be identified. Overall mortality was 38.1%. Of the isolates studied, 0.8%"
		"of C. albicans, 100.0% of C. glabrata, 2.9% of C. parapsilosis and 4.9% of C."
		"tropicalis were non-susceptible to fluconazole, and 0.6% of C. albicans, 5.0% of"
		"Candida krusei, 7.6% of C. parapsilosis and 9.8% of C. tropicalis were"
		non-susceptible to voriconazole. All echinocandins showed good activity against
		"most Candida spp., including the majority of C. parapsilosis isolates, but only"
		38.1% of C. glabrata tested susceptible to caspofungin.

		"C. guilliermondii, C. kefyr, C. krusei, C. lusitaniae, C. parapsilosis, and C."
		"tropicalis) ranged from 97.1 to 100% and 99.8 to 100%, respectively. For the"
		"other organism targets, sensitivity and specificity were as follows: 100% each"
		"for Cryptococcus neoformans and C. gattii, 98.6% and 100% for Fusarium spp., and"
		"96.2% and 99.9% for Rhodotorula spp., respectively. In 4 of the 141 clinical"
		"samples, the BCID-FP panel correctly identified an additional Candida species,"
		undetected by standard-of-care methods. The BCID-FP panel offers a faster
		turnaround time for identification of fungal pathogens in positive blood cultures
		"that may allow for earlier antifungal interventions and includes C. auris, a"
		highly multidrug-resistant fungus.

LID	-	8828289
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Fungemia due to obstructive urinary tract fungal ball is exceedingly
		"rare. These patients often have multiple predisposing conditions, including"
		diabetes or antimicrobial exposure. While candiduria can be relatively common in
		"this population, urinary tract fungal balls are a rare entity. Hospitalists"
		should be aware of this rare complication in patients presenting with funguria.
		"Case Presentation. We present a case of a 44-year-old male with type II diabetes,"
		"chronic hepatitis C secondary to injection drug use, and chronic kidney disease"
		who developed a urinary tract fungal ball leading to fungemia and subsequent
		"bilateral chorioretinitis, additionally complicated by emphysematous cystitis and"
		pyelonephritis. Additional invasive treatment options beyond typical antifungals
		"are often required in the case of urinary tract fungal ball, and in this case,"
		bilateral nephrostomy tubes and micafungin were employed. Hospital course was
		complicated by C. tropicalis fungemia with subsequent bilateral fungal
		chorioretinitis on dilated fundus exam. This was effectively treated with
		cyclogyl and prednisolone drops along with bilateral voriconazole injections.
		"Follow-up imaging and cultures showed resolution of fungemia, urinary tract"
		"masses, and chorioretinal infiltrates; however, recurrent polymicrobial UTIs"
		continue to be an issue for this patient. CONCLUSIONS: Special multidisciplinary
		management is required in the treatment of urinary tract fungal balls with
		"subsequent fungemia, including nephrostomy tubes, antifungal irrigation,"
		"ureterorenoscopy, and more powerful antifungals such as amphotericin B and"
		"5-flucytosine. This management draws from a myriad of specialties, including"
		"urology, infectious disease, and interventional radiology. Additionally, the"
		literature has demonstrated that only approximately half of patients with
		fungemia receive an ophthalmologic evaluation. Ophthalmologic and urologic
		cooperation is essential in the case of obstructive uropathy leading to fungemia
		as the obstructive uropathy must be relieved and these patients should receive a
		dilated fundus exam.

		"hospital in Islamabad, Pakistan."
PG	-	986-991
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and antifungal susceptibility pattern of
		"Candida species. METHODS: This prospective, cross-sectional study was conducted"
		"at the Quaid-e-Azam International Hospital, Islamabad, Pakistan, from January"
		"2014 to February 2015, and comprised different clinical samples which were"
		analysed for various types of microbial infections. Species differentiation was
		confirmed by biochemical and molecular methods. Antifungal susceptibility against
		"amphotericin B, fluconazole and voriconazole was determined by Clinical and"
		Laboratory Standards Institute M44-A disk diffusion method. RESULTS: Of the 219
		"Candida isolates, majority of them were isolated from urine 78(35.6%) and vaginal"
		"swabs 59(26.9%). Moreover, 144(65.8%) samples were of females and 75(34.2%) were"
		of males. Candida albicans 128(58.45%) was the most predominant species followed
		"by Candida glabrata 30(13.69%), Candida tropicalis 26(11.87%), Candida krusei"
		"17(7.76%), Candida parapsilosis 12(5.47%), Candida dubliniensis 3(1.37%) and"
		Candida lusitaniae 3(1.37). All isolates were least susceptible to amphotericin B
		with a susceptibility rate of 213(97.26%). The highest resistance was found for
		voriconazole 40(18.26%) compared to fluconazole 32(14.61%). CONCLUSIONS: Candida
		species possessed high resistance rate against various antifungal agents.

TI	-	Time to initiation of fluconazole therapy impacts mortality in patients with
		candidemia: a multi-institutional study.
PG	-	25-31
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Inadequate antimicrobial treatment is an independent determinant of
		"hospital mortality, and fungal bloodstream infections are among the types of"
		infection with the highest rates of inappropriate initial treatment. Because of
		"significant potential for reducing high mortality rates, we sought to assess the"
		impact of delayed treatment across multiple study sites. The goals our analyses
		were to establish the frequency and duration of delayed antifungal treatment and
		to evaluate the relationship between treatment delay and mortality. METHODS: We
		conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with candidemia from 4 medical
		centers who were prescribed fluconazole. Time to initiation of fluconazole
		therapy was calculated by subtracting the date on which fluconazole therapy was
		initiated from the culture date of the first blood sample positive for yeast.
		"RESULTS: A total of 230 patients (51% male; mean age +/- standard deviation, 56"
		+/- 17 years) were identified; 192 of these had not been given prior treatment
		with fluconazole. Patients most commonly had nonsurgical hospital admission (162
		"patients [70%]) with a central line catheter (193 [84%]), diabetes (68 [30%]), or"
		cancer (54 [24%]). Candida species causing infection included Candida albicans
		"(129 patients [56%]), Candida glabrata (38 [16%]), Candida parapsilosis (25"
		"[11%]), or Candida tropicalis (15 [7%]). The number of days to the initiation of"
		"antifungal treatment was 0 (92 patients [40%]), 1 (38 [17%]), 2 (33 [14%]) or >"
		or = 3 (29 [12%]). Mortality rates were lowest for patients who began therapy on
		"day 0 (14 patients [15%]) followed by patients who began on day 1 (9 [24%]), day"
		"2 (12 [37%]), or day > or = 3 (12 [41%]) (P = .0009 for trend). Multivariate"
		"logistic regression was used to calculate independent predictors of mortality,"
		"which include increased time until fluconazole initiation (odds ratio, 1.42; P <"
		.05) and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (1-point
		"increments; odds ratio, 1.13; P < .05). CONCLUSION: A delay in the initiation of"
		fluconazole therapy in hospitalized patients with candidemia significantly
		impacted mortality. New methods to avoid delays in appropriate antifungal
		"therapy, such as rapid diagnostic tests or identification of unique risk factors,"
		are needed.

		medium.
PG	-	196-8
AB	-	Candida spp are the fourth most common group of nosocomial pathogens isolated
		"from patients on medical, surgical, and intensive care wards. Polymicrobial"
		candidaemia has rarely been described. The diagnosis of candidaemia from
		peripheral blood smears has not been widely reported. This report describes the
		case of a young woman suffering from Ewing's sarcoma who developed a syndrome of
		septic shock. Deep fungal infection was diagnosed from a systematic peripheral
		blood smear and yeasts were isolated within 24 hours. A subculture on CHROMagar
		Candida allowed the differentiation and presumptive identification of Candida
		tropicalis and Candida krusei. Species identification was confirmed by the ID 32C
		system. This report underlines the usefulness of peripheral blood smears in the
		"diagnosis of fulminant deep fungal infections, and of a differential isolation"
		medium in the rapid presumptive identification of clinically important yeast
		species from clinical samples. This medium is particularly useful for the
		"detection of mixed fungal infections, allowing early and better adapted"
		antifungal treatment.

AB	-	Chronic disseminated candidiasis (CDC) is a severe complication with high
		morbidity and mortality in patients with hematological malignancies who have
		undergone chemotherapy. Blood or sterile liver biopsy cultures are negative due
		to recurrent empirical antifungal therapy. With the escalating resistance to
		"azole-based antifungal drugs in infection by Candida species, pathogen"
		identification is becoming increasingly important for determining definitive
		"diagnosis and treatment strategy. In this case report, we present, for the first"
		"time, diagnostic confirmation of a culture-negative CDC case with Candida"
		tropicalis infection using a combination of metagenomics next-generation
		sequencing and calcofluor white staining.

		successfully treated with fluconazole: case report and review of the literature.
PG	-	109-11
AB	-	The case of a 77-year-old woman with acute myeloid leukemia who developed Candida
		tropicalis septic arthritis of the knee after remission-inducing chemotherapy is
		reported. A literature review of C. tropicalis non-prosthetic arthritis is
		included. The isolate was susceptible to fluconazole (MIC 0.25 mg/l). She was
		treated with fluconazole (400 mg orally) and frequent relieving synovial
		aspirations. After 1 month of antifungal therapy the synovial fluid became
		culture negative. Fluconazole concentration in the synovial fluid and serum were
		"20 mg/l and 19.4 mg/l, respectively. The patient was treated for a total of 7"
		months and made a full recovery. This is the first report of the successful use
		of fluconazole in the treatment of septic arthritis due to C. tropicalis.

PG	-	679-689
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-018-0258-5 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candidemia is one of the most common nosocomial bloodstream
		infections. Early diagnosis and antifungal treatment improve clinical outcomes in
		"some studies but not all, with diverse data reported from different institutions."
		"Similarly, antifungal resistance is more common in the USA than in Europe, but"
		there is little data regarding the microbiology and clinical course of candidemia
		in adult patients in Asia. AIMS: (1) To capture species distribution and drug
		"resistance rates among Candida bloodstream isolates, (2) to describe clinical"
		"features of candidemia, and (3) to identify factors associated with all-cause"
		"mortality, with emphasis on early initiation of antifungal treatment, at a large"
		tertiary University Hospital in China. METHODS: In this single-center
		"retrospective study, we identified all patients with candidemia, between 2008 and"
		"2014. Demographic and clinical characteristics, microbiological information,"
		details of antifungal therapy and clinical outcomes were collected. RESULTS: We
		studied 166 patients. 71 (42.8%) had cancer. Candida albicans was the most
		"frequent species (37.3%), followed by C. parapsilosis (24.1%), C. tropicalis"
		"(22.8%), and C. glabrata (14.5%). Antifungal resistance was more frequent in"
		non-albicans strains and especially C. glabrata. Twenty patients received
		inappropriate treatment with all-cause mortality of 35%. The remaining 146
		"patients had significantly lower mortality (21.9%, P = 0.045). Among patients who"
		"received antifungal treatment, mortality rate increased with time to appropriate"
		"antifungal therapy (AAT): 13.7%, for < 24 h, 21.1% for 24-48 h, 23.1% for > 48 h,"
		and 32.4% among patients who received no AT (χ(2) for trend P = 0.039).
		Initiating AAT more than 24 h after blood culture collection was an independent
		"risk factor for mortality, after adjustment for other confounders (OR 7.1, 95% CI"
		"1.3-39.4, P = 0.024). CONCLUSIONS: Candida albicans was the most frequent cause"
		"of candidemia at a large tertiary hospital in China, but antifungal resistance is"
		a growing concern among non-albicans Candida species. The mortality rate of
		patients treated with ineffective antifungal agents based on in vitro
		susceptibilities was similar to that of patients who received no treatment at
		"all, and delayed initiation of antifungal treatment was associated with increased"
		risk of death.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: The mortality of Candida Bloodstream Infection (CBSI) remains high.
		"Antifungal susceptibility breakpoints were recently updated for Candida species,"
		the impact remains unknown. In this study we evaluated the impact of
		inappropriate antifungal treatment according to recent breakpoints on 30-day
		"mortality of CBSI. METHODS: From June 2008 to July 2014, data on CBSI episodes"
		"from two tertiary-care centers, treated > 72 h were analyzed. Antifungal therapy"
		and 30-day mortality were registered. Inappropriate antifungal treatment
		according to current Clinical & Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) breakpoints
		was adjusted with 30-day mortality-related co-variates. RESULTS: One hundred
		forty-nine episodes of CBSI were analyzed. The most frequent species were: C.
		"albicans (40%), C. tropicalis (23%) and C. glabrata complex (20%). According to"
		"the 2012 CLSI, 10.7% received inappropriate treatment. The 30-day mortality was"
		"38%; severe sepsis [Odds ratio (OR) 3.4; 95% CI 1.3-8.4], cirrhosis (OR 36; 95%"
		"CI 12.2-605), early central venous catheter removal (OR 0.23; 95% CI 0.08-0.66)"
		"and previous antifungal therapy (OR 0.15; 95%CI 0.03-0.62), were associated with"
		30-day mortality by multivariate analysis. Inappropriate antifungal treatment was
		not (OR 0.19; 95% CI 0.03-1.2). CONCLUSIONS: Appropriate antifungal therapy
		according to CLSI 2012 did not have an impact on mortality. Mortality of CBSI
		remains high due to disease severity and comorbidities; early antifungal therapy
		and catheter removal may reduce it.

AB	-	"From 2006 to 2010, a retrospective study was conducted in a university referral"
		tertiary care hospital to study the frequency and distribution of Candida species
		"in different medical specialties. The use of mechanical ventilation, central"
		"venous catheter, and urinary catheter were recorded per 1,000 patient-days and"
		the use of antifungals was calculated using defined daily dose (DDD). A total of
		313 episodes were identified and the overall incidence was 0.54 (0.41-0.71)
		"episodes per 1,000 patient-days. Candida albicans caused 44% of the overall"
		"episodes, followed by C. tropicalis (21.7%), C. parapsilosis (14.4%), C. glabrata"
		"(11.2%), and C. krusei (3.5%). The incidence of C. glabrata significantly"
		increased from 2006-2010 (range: 4.8-23.5%) (P = 0.024). Candida glabrata was
		associated with malignancies (P = 0.004) and C. krusei with hematologic
		malignancies (P < 0.0001). The use of antifungals was higher in the
		hematology/bone marrow transplant units and represented 40% of all fluconazole
		prescription in the hospital. There was no correlation with the use of
		fluconazole and the increasing ratio of C. glabrata (r = 0.60). The use of
		invasive devices was significantly higher in the intensive care units (ICUs) than
		"the medical and surgical emergencies units (P < 0.001). In contrast, the"
		"emergencies had higher incidence of candidemia (2-2.1 episodes/1,000"
		"patient-days) than the ICUs (1.6 episodes 1,000 patient-days). Candida glabrata"
		candidemia showed a significant increase in contrast to the current national
		literature where C. parapsilosis remained the most important non-C. albicans
		Candida species in Brazilian hospitals. Our findings suggested that the
		increasing incidence of C. glabrata was not associated with use of fluconazole
		and other risk factors might play an important role.

		predominance of non-C. albicans Candida species.
PG	-	839-42
LID	-	10.3109/13693780903580121 [doi]
AB	-	This is a retrospective observational study of clinical and epidemiologic data
		from bloodstream yeast infections over 5 years (2004-2008) in a tertiary-care
		"hospital. During this period, there were 52 such infections, at a rate of 2.4 per"
		"1,000 hospital admissions. Non-C. albicans Candida species and other genera were"
		"responsible for 82% of infections, with C. tropicalis and C. parapsilosis being"
		the most common. In 2008 no C. albicans infections occurred. Several uncommon
		"fungal pathogens were observed, including Trichosporon asahii, Rhodotorula spp."
		"and Candida zeylanoides. Of 16 isolates tested, 3 (19%) were resistant to"
		"fluconazole, including one C. zeylanoides (MIC 8 microg/ml) and one C. tropicalis"
		"(MIC 16 microg/ml) isolate, as well as intrinsically resistant C. krusei. All"
		isolates tested were susceptible to itraconazole (n = 7) and amphotericin B (n =
		"8). Yeast infections were associated with severe underlying diseases, mainly"
		"hematological/solid cancers (71%), hospitalization in the ICU (41%), central"
		"venous catheters (80%), and use of antimicrobials (94%). The overall mortality"
		rate was 50%. Our finding of a predominance of non-C. albicans Candida species
		"infection with uncommon yeasts, and fluconazole resistance, suggests the need for"
		"continuous surveillance of fungemia and of antibiotic susceptibility trends, in"
		order to adopt treatment strategies applicable to particular healthcare
		institutions.

TI	-	Economic analysis of inadequate fluconazole therapy in non-neutropenic patients
		with candidaemia: a multi-institutional study.
PG	-	557-62
AB	-	Mortality significantly increases in patients with candidaemia who receive
		inappropriate fluconazole therapy. The goals of this study were to compare
		hospital length of stay and costs for non-neutropenic patients with candidaemia
		treated with fluconazole based on the empirical dose and time until initiation of
		therapy. A retrospective cohort study was conducted of patients with candidaemia
		who were prescribed fluconazole at the onset of candidaemia or later.
		Hospital-related costs were compared based on time to initiation of fluconazole
		therapy and empirical fluconazole dose. A total of 192 non-neutropenic patients
		"(55% male; mean age+/-standard deviation, 56+/-17 years) were identified."
		"Isolated Candida species included C. albicans (59%), C. glabrata (15%), C."
		"parapsilosis (11%), C. tropicalis (6%), C. krusei (3%) or other Candida spp."
		"(6%). Time to initiation of fluconazole was Day 0 (35.4%), Day 1 (14.1%), Day 2"
		(26.6%) or Day >or=3 (23.9%). Thirty-two patients (17%) received a dose of
		fluconazole >or=6 mg/kg on Day 0. Total costs were lowest for patients started on
		"fluconazole on the culture day with adequate doses ($35,459+/-25,988) compared"
		"with all other patients ($52,158+/-53,492) (P=0.0088). After controlling for"
		"covariates, each 1-day delay in fluconazole therapy was associated with increased"
		"total hospital costs of $6392+/-3000 (P=0.0344), and an adequate fluconazole dose"
		"was associated with decreased total hospital costs of $18,744+/-7173 (P=0.0097)."
		A delay or an inadequate dose or fluconazole in patients with candidaemia was
		associated with increased hospital costs. Improved methods to diagnose patients
		with candidaemia quickly are needed.

TI	-	Echinocandins Compared to Fluconazole for Candidemia of a Urinary Tract Source: A
		Propensity Score Analysis.
PG	-	1374-1379
LID	-	10.1093/cid/cix033 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Whether echinocandins could be used to treat candidemia of a urinary
		tract source (CUTS) is unknown. We aimed to provide current epidemiological
		information of CUTS and to compare echinocandin to fluconazole treatment on CUTS
		outcomes. METHODS: A multicenter study of adult patients with candidemia was
		conducted in 9 hospitals. CUTS was defined as a candidemia with concomitant
		candiduria by the same organism associated with significant urological
		comorbidity. The primary outcome assessed was clinical failure (defined by 7-day
		mortality or persistent candidemia) in patients treated with either an
		echinocandin or fluconazole. A propensity score was calculated and then entered
		"into a regression model. RESULTS: Of 2176 episodes of candidemia, 128 were CUTS"
		"(5.88%). Most CUTS cases were caused by Candida albicans (52.7%), followed by"
		Candida glabrata (25.6%) and Candida tropicalis (16.3%). Clinical failure
		occurred in 7 patients (20%) treated with an echinocandin and in 15 (17.1%)
		treated with fluconazole (P = .730). Acute renal failure (adjusted odds ratio
		"[AOR], 3.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-8.91; P = .047) was the only"
		"independent factor associated with clinical failure, whereas early urinary tract"
		"drainage procedures (surgical, percutaneous, or endoscopic) were identified as"
		"protective (AOR, 0.08; 95% CI, .02-.31; P < .001). Neither univariate nor"
		multivariate analysis showed that echinocandin therapy altered the risk of
		clinical failure. CONCLUSIONS: Initial echinocandin therapy was not associated
		"with clinical failure in patients with CUTS. Notably, acute renal failure"
		predicted worse outcomes and performing an early urologic procedure was a
		protective measure.

AB	-	"OBJECTIVES: To isolate, identify, and determine the prevalence of Candida and"
		"other yeasts of clinical importance in Aseer region, Saudi Arabia. METHODS: This"
		is a cross-sectional study involving retrospective analysis of 6100 samples
		"submitted to the Microbiology Laboratory, Aseer Central Hospital, Abha, Saudi"
		"Arabia between 2011 and 2012, and prospective isolation and identification of 84"
		isolates recovered from various clinical specimens presented to the Microbiology
		Laboratory between 2012 and 2013 using the classic morphological schemes and the
		Vitek 2 automated system. RESULTS: The results of the retrospective analysis
		(2011-2012) indicated that of the 6100 various clinical specimens submitted to
		"the routine microbiology analysis, 143 (2.35%) revealed the presence of Candida"
		spp. The distribution of the 143 Candida spp according to specimens was as
		"follows: urine 72%, sputum 10.5%, endotracheal tube 7%, blood 4.2%, catheter tip"
		"2.1%, throat swab 2.1%, eye swab 0.7%, wound exudates 0.7%, and cerebrospinal"

		"albicans 28.6% was the predominant species, followed by Candida parapsilosis"
		"21.4%, Candida tropicalis 14.3%, and Candida lusitaniae 9.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Along"
		"with the commonly encountered Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis, Candida"
		"tropicalis, and Candida lusitaniae were detected with significant rates. Many"
		other Candida species and some other pathogenic yeasts have been detected for the
		first time in the region. Urinary tract samples were the main source of Candida
		species.

AB	-	We investigated the species distribution and antifungal susceptibility of Candida
		isolates from tertiary and non-tertiary hospitals in South Korea from 2002-2004.
		"Of the 612 Candida isolates that were collected, Candida albicans, C."
		"parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, and C. glabrata occurred most frequently, accounting"
		"for 97.3% and 96.8% of the isolates in tertiary and non-tertiary hospitals,"
		"respectively. C. albicans was the most common isolate, but the incidence of"
		non-C. albicansCandida species was higher than that of C. albicans in tertiary
		hospitals. The Candida species had much lower MIC(90) to voriconazole (tertiary
		"hospitals: 0.5 microg/ml, non-tertiary hospitals: 0.25 microg/ml) than to"
		"fluconazole (tertiary hospitals: 8 microg/ml, non-tertiary hospitals: 4"
		microg/ml). The MIC(90) of Candida isolates to 5-flucytosine in non-tertiary
		hospitals was two times higher than that observed in tertiary facilities. The C.
		"glabrata isolates showed a tendency toward strong resistance to fluconazole, but"
		C. parapsilosis isolates were susceptible to all of the evaluated antifungal
		"agents. Voriconazole showed strong in vitro activity against Candida species,"
		"especially C. krusei, which is resistant to fluconazole and 5-flucytosine. To our"

AB	-	Candida spp. can lead to infections or even fungal sepsis particularly among
		immunocompromised individuals. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to
		analyze the presence of Candida spp. among patients subjected to orthotopic heart
		transplantation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Oral rinses from 50 patients subjected to
		"orthotopic heart transplantation, aged 13 to 70 years, 40 males and 10 females,"
		were examined. Sex-age-oral conditions matched-control included 50 individuals
		who were not subjected to any kind of transplantation and were not
		immunocompromised for any other reason. Counts of yeasts were expressed as median
		values of logarithm of cfu/mL and were statistically compared by Mann-Whitney's
		test. The heart transplant and control groups were compared for the presence of
		Candida spp. by chi-square test (p<0.05). RESULTS: The results showed
		statistically significant difference (p=0.001) in the prevalence of Candida spp.
		between the transplantation and control groups. Counts of yeasts (cfu/mL) in the
		transplanted group were significantly higher than in the control group (p=0.005).
		Candida albicans was the most prevalent species isolated from both groups.
		CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that Candida yeast counts were higher in the heart
		transplant recipients than in the controls. There was higher variation of Candida
		species among the heart transplant patients and the most frequently isolated
		"samples were: Candida albicans, Candida glabrata and Candida tropicalis. Isolates"
		of Candida dubliniensis was not found in either of the groups.

PG	-	4745-52
LID	-	10.1002/cncr.24507 [doi]
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: The incidence, epidemiology, Candida species distribution, resistance"
		"patterns, and outcome of candidemia in high-risk hematologic malignancy and/or"
		stem cell transplantation patients have not been extensively described since the
		"introduction of new antifungal agents. METHODS: In this retrospective study, the"
		authors reviewed the medical records and microbiologic data of hematologic
		malignancy patients with candidemia at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson
		Cancer Center from March 2001 to February 2007. RESULTS: The authors analyzed 173
		"episodes of candidemia (170 patients), 125 (72%) of which were breakthrough cases"
		"after prior antifungal agents, mainly fluconazole (28 [22%]), caspofungin (25"
		"[20%]), and voriconazole (18 [14%]). The incidence of candidemia (per 100,000"
		"inpatient days) remained relatively stable, from 13.9 in 2001 to 19.2 in 2006."
		"However, compared with the findings of previous studies at the authors'"
		"institution, the frequency of Candida glabrata and C. krusei infection decreased"
		"(to 5% and 17%, respectively) and C. parapsilosis (24%) and C. tropicalis (21%)"
		increased. C. parapsilosis fungemia was associated with prior caspofungin use
		"(P<.001). The overall 30-day crude mortality rate was 38%, and the attributable"
		"mortality rate was 19%, similar to previous findings at the authors' institution."
		The Candida species associated with the highest mortality rate was C. glabrata.
		CONCLUSIONS: Despite the widespread use of antifungal prophylaxis and the
		"introduction of new antifungal agents, the incidence and associated mortality"
		rates of candidemia remained stable in high-risk hematologic malignancy patients.
		"However, its epidemiological characteristics have shifted, with C. parapsilosis"
		and C. tropicalis becoming more common.

		"of species in Candida blood stream infection. METHODS: A prospective, descriptive"
		cohort study was conducted from June 1st till November 30th 2012 at the Sindh
		"Institute of Urology and Transplantation in Karachi, Pakistan. All patients > or"
		"= 15 years of age from nephrology, urology, gastroenterology, oncology or"

		"blood cultures, 145 (6%) were positive for Candida species in 121 patients."
		Seventy seven patients were included for further analysis as clinical data was
		available for these. The majority of patients had renal failure (89.6%) and 44%
		had femoral line. Non- albicans species were isolated in 70 (90.9%) patients;
		"Candida parapsilosis in 28 (36.4%), C. lusitaniae in 23 (29.9%), C. tropicalis in"
		"16 (20.8%), C. glabrata in 3 (3.9%) with only 7 (9.1%) with C. albicans."
		Mortality was 23.4% (18 patients). CONCLUSION: Frequency of candidemia and
		species distribution with predominantly non-albicans candida in our study is
		similar to that reported from other developing countries. Mortality is high. The
		majority of our patients had line related candidemia. Therefore prevention of
		line infection must be our top priority.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of Candida spp.
		and presence of oral lesions in Brazilian leprosy patients under multidrug
		"therapy (MDT). METHODS: Thirty-eight individuals (18 males and 20 females, median"
		age 53 years) clinically and microbiologically diagnosed as leprosy (lepromatous
		"variant), and under MDT for at least 45 days were studied. The control group"
		"constituted by 38 healthy individuals (median age 53.5), matched to the test"
		"group in relation to age, gender and oral conditions. Oral rinses were collected"
		and the Candida identification was performed by phenotypic tests. The existence
		of Candida dubliniensis among the isolates was analyzed using a validated
		multiplex PCR assay. Twenty-nine leprosy patients were examined intra-orally for
		the presence of lesions. Data were analyzed by z- and Mann-Whitney tests (alpha =
		5%). RESULTS: Yeast carriage rate between leprosy patients (65.8%) and controls
		"(47.4%) was similar (P = 0.099), and no significant difference between yeast"
		counts was observed (P = 0.1004). Candida albicans was the most frequently
		"isolated species in both groups. In the leprosy group, Candida tropicalis and"
		"Candida parapsilosis were also identified. In the control group, we additionally"
		"identified Candida tropicalis, Candida glabrata and Candida kefyr. Candida"
		dubliniensis was not detected. No leprosy-related oral lesion was registered.
		"CONCLUSION: Within the limits of the study, we concluded that Brazilian leprosy"
		patients under MDT showed similar levels of carriage and Candida species
		distribution in relation to the controls.

TI	-	Candida colonization of the respiratory tract and subsequent pseudomonas
		ventilator-associated pneumonia.
PG	-	110-7
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Recovery of Candida from the respiratory tract of a critically ill
		patient receiving mechanical ventilation (MV) usually indicates colonization
		"rather than infection of the respiratory tract. However, interactions between"
		"Candida and bacteria, particularly Pseudomonas, have been reported. Thus, Candida"
		colonization of the respiratory tract may predispose to bacterial
		ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). METHODS: In a multicenter study of
		"immunocompetent critically ill patients receiving MV for > 2 days, we compared"
		the incidence of pneumonia in patients with and without (exposed/unexposed)
		"respiratory-tract Candida colonization, matched on study center, admission year,"
		"and MV duration. RESULTS: Over the 4-year study period, of the 803 patients"
		"meeting study inclusion criteria in the six study centers, 214 patients (26.6%)"
		had respiratory tract Candida colonization. Candida albicans was the most common
		"species (68.7%), followed by Candida glabrata (20.1%) and Candida tropicalis"
		(13.1%). Extrapulmonary Candida colonization was more common in exposed patients
		"(39.7% vs 8.3%, p = 0.01). Exposed patients had longer ICU and hospital stays but"
		similar mortality to unexposed patients. The matched exposed/unexposed nested
		cohort study identified bronchial Candida colonization as an independent risk
		"factor for pneumonia (24.1% vs 17.6%; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.58; 95%"
		"confidence interval [CI], 0.94 to 2.68; p = 0.0860); the risk increase was"
		"greatest for Pseudomonas pneumonia (9% vs 4.8%; adjusted OR, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.00"
		to 4.92; p = 0.049). CONCLUSIONS: Candida colonization of the respiratory tract
		is common in patients receiving MV for > 2 days and is associated with prolonged
		"ICU and hospital stays, and with an increased risk of Pseudomonas VAP."

TI	-	Candidemia in Siriraj Hospital: epidemiology and factors associated with
		mortality.
PG	-	S91-7
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To study the epidemiology of candidemia and to identify risk factors
		for mortality among adult patients MATERIAL AND METHOD: Retrospective analysis of
		patients with candidemia in a 2400-bed tertiary-care university hospital in
		"Bangkok, Thailand from June 2006 to May 2009. RESULTS: During the study period,"
		"147 patients (50% male) with clinically significant candidemia were identified,"
		with a mean age of 61 years. The underlying conditions included renal failure
		"(47%), abdominal surgery within 30 days (31%), diabetes (27%), hematologic"
		"malignancies (25%), solid malignancies (25%), neutropenia (23%), and liver"
		disease (11%). Nearly all patients (98%) received antibacterial therapy within 30
		"days. The four most common Candida species were C. albicans (39%), C. tropicalis"
		"(28%), C. glabrata (22%) and C. parapsilosis (6%). Only sixty-nine patients (47%)"
		received appropriate antifungal therapy within 72 hours. The 28-day all-cause
		"mortality was 59%. By multivariate analysis, the independent risk factors"
		associated with mortality were neutropenia from chemotherapy OR = 9.12
		"(2.94-28.31), septic shock OR = 3.66 (1.54-8.66), ICU admission OR = 3.18"
		"(1.27-7.92), inappropriate antifungal therapy within 72 hours OR = 2.38"
		(1.07-5.28) and renal failure OR = 2.34 (1.07-5.13). CONCLUSION: Adult patients
		with candidemia had a high mortality rate particularly those receiving an
		inappropriate antifungal therapy. Empirical antifungal therapy should be
		"considered in selected patients on the basis of underlying conditions, severity"
		of illness and risk factors for mortality.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Candidemia is the worldwide life-threaten disease, especially in"
		cancer patients. This study was aimed to identify and evaluate the risk factors
		"of candidemia in cancer patients, which will prompt the improvement on current"
		"therapeutic strategies and prognosis. METHODS: A retrospective, case-control"
		study was conducted from inpatients of Tianjin Medical University Cancer
		"Institute and Hospital, during 2006 to 2013. Analyses were performed between"
		"cancer patients with candidemia as study case, and patients with bacterial"
		"bloodstream infections as control. Each case was matched up with two controls,"
		"for gender and inpatient duration. Candida species, clinical characteristics,"
		risk factors and outcomes were reviewed in details. RESULTS: Total number of 80
		cases and 160 controls were enrolled and analyzed in this study. Candida albicans
		"was identified as the most prevalent species and account for 55.0% candidemia,"
		"followed by Candida parapsilosis complex (21.3%), Candida tropicalis (8.8%),"
		"Candida glabrata complex (7.5%), Candida lusitaniae (3.8%), and Candida famata"
		"(3.8%). The crude mortality at 30-days of candidemia was up to 30.0%, which is"
		significantly higher than bacterial bloodstream infections (p = 0.006).
		Logistical analysis demonstrated that total parenteral nutrition >5 days
		"(p = 0.036), urinary catheter >2 days (p = 0.001), distant organ metastasis of"
		cancer (p = 0.002) and gastrointestinal cancer (p = 0.042) were the independent
		risk factors for candidemia. CONCLUSIONS: Candidemia showed significant higher
		"mortality than bacterial bloodstream infections, C. albicans was cited as the"
		"primary pathogen. Total parenteral nutrition, urinary catheter, distant organ"
		metastasis of cancer and gastrointestinal cancer are independent predictors for
		"candidemia, this findings provides potential therapeutic targets for improving"
		the outcome.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Bloodstream infections due to Candida species are becoming a major
		cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. The spectrum of
		"candidemia has changed with the emergence of non-albicans Candida species,"
		especially among critically ill patients. METHODOLOGY: In a retrospective study
		"(July 2009 to December 2009) on candidemia, various Candida species isolated from"
		blood cultures were characterized and studied along with the determination of
		"their antifungal susceptibility to amphotericin B, itraconazole, and fluconazole"
		by Etest. Probable risk factors for patients in the intensive care unit (ICU)
		"presenting with candidemia were also analyzed. RESULTS: During the study period,"
		"a total of 4651 samples were received, out of which 468 samples (10.06%) were"
		positive for growth of organisms: 441 (94.20%) aerobic bacterial pathogens and 27
		(5.79%) Candida species. The most common Candida spp. isolate was C. tropicalis
		"(40.8%) followed by C. albicans (29.6%), C. glabrata (18.5%) and others (11.1%)."
		"Out of the 27 Candida strains, 24 (88.9%) were isolated from patients treated in"
		"the ICU. Among these, association of previous use of broad-spectrum antibiotics"
		in 22 patients (91.6%) and central line catheter insertion in 20 patients (83.3%)
		were found to be statistically significant as compared to non-candidemia patients
		(p <0.05). Antifungal susceptibility testing of the isolates revealed a lower
		level of drug resistance to amphotericin B (18.5% of the isolates) versus 77.8%
		"resistance to fluconazole. CONCLUSION: Rapid changes in the rate of infection,"
		"potential risk factors, and emergence of non-albicans Candida demand continued"
		surveillance of this serious bloodstream fungal infection.

		"Filobasidiella neoformans var. neoformans, Histoplasma capsulatum,"
		"Pseudallescheria boydii, and Sporothrix schenckii. A section of the 28S rRNA gene"
		"from approximately 100 fungi, representing about 50 species of pathogens and"
		"commonly encountered saprophytes, was sequenced to develop universal PCR primers"
		and species-specific oligonucleotide probes. Each step in the process of
		detection and identification was standardized to a common set of conditions
		applicable without modification to all fungi of interest and all types of
		clinical specimens. These steps consist of DNA extraction by boiling specimens in
		"an alkaline guanidine-phenol-Tris reagent, amplification of a variable region of"
		"the 28S rRNA gene with universal primers, and amplicon identification by probe"
		hybridization or DNA sequencing performed under conditions identical for all
		fungi. The results obtained by testing a panel of fungal isolates and a variety
		of clinical specimens indicate a high level of specificity.

PG	-	103-7
AB	-	Due to the rising importance of Candida glabrata and other non-albicans Candida
		"as principle human opportunistic pathogens, 356 women with abnormal vaginal"
		"discharge who attended a private obstetrics and gynecology clinic in Amman,"
		"Jordan, between January 1999 and February 2001 were examined. The isolation rate"
		of Candida spp. from high-vaginal swabs was 44.9%. CHROMagar Candida and
		"conventional mycological methods identified six isolated Candida spp., including"
		"C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, C. krusei, and C."
		"kefyr. The percentages of C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. tropicalis isolates"

		"vulvovaginal candidiasis caused by C. glabrata in the two study periods,"
		"1994-1996 and 1999-2001 (P = 0.0186). In contrast, comparing the proportions of"
		"vulvovaginal candidiasis caused by C. albicans in the two periods, there was no"
		"significant difference. These results may have significant clinical implications,"
		as C. glabrata are innately less susceptible to most antifungal agents than C.
		albicans; these findings support viewing this organism as a major pathogen.

TI	-	Epidemiologic analysis and antifungal susceptibility of Candida blood isolates in
		southern Taiwan.
PG	-	200-10
AB	-	Candidemia is a clinically important disease which has increased in incidence
		worldwide in recent decades. In order to identify the risk factors for mortality
		in candidemic patients and to elucidate the role of antifungal susceptibility
		"testing, a retrospective cohort study was performed of 56 episodes of candidemia"
		in 1998 at a medical center in southern Taiwan. The minimal inhibitory
		concentration (MIC) of these isolates was determined by E-test. Malignancy and
		alimentary diseases (42.9%) were the most common underlying conditions of these
		patients. There was no difference of Candida spp. distribution among patients
		"treated in medical or surgical departments, except that all 5 isolates of C."
		intermedia were found in patients treated in medical departments (p=0.02) and 50%
		of candidemic infants had C. parapsilosis isolates (p=0.046). Among all Candida
		"isolates, 3 (5.4%) were fluconazole non-susceptible. C. tropicalis had a"
		significantly higher rate of amphotericin B resistance than the other species
		(p=0.007). Thirty four patients died and 70.6% of these deaths were attributable
		"to candidemia. Thrombocytopenia, septic shock at the date of candidemia onset,"
		"C-reactive protein > 100 mg/L, blood urea nitrogen > 20 mg/dL, length of stay <"
		"60 days, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score > or = 10"
		points were significantly associated with the death attributable to candidemia.
		Thrombocytopenia was the only independent predictor for mortality in the
		"multivariate analysis. When the breakpoint of fluconazole was set at 2 microg/mL,"
		as opposed to 8 microg/mL as in the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory
		"Standards (NCCLS) criteria, the clinical outcome of death was significantly"
		correlated to the MICs of the blood isolates. The correlation between MIC of
		"fluconazole determined by E-test data, which is more easily obtainable than with"
		"NCCLS methods, and outcome requires larger scale investigation."

AB	-	"INTRODUCTION: Legionnaires' disease is caused by Legionella bacteria, and"
		commonly manifests as pneumonia and has a high fatality rate. PATIENT CONCERNS:
		"This case study reports on the fatal incident of a patient, initially diagnosed"
		"with pneumonia, and subsequently diagnosed with Legionnaires' disease caused by a"
		new sequence type (ST) of Legionella. DIAGNOSIS: It is speculated that the
		patient acquired Legionnaires' disease from a contaminated water source.
		Legionnaires' disease was diagnosed using the Legionella urinary antigen assay
		and bacterial cultures of respiratory secretions; Legionella pneumophilia Type 1
		was also identified through serological testing. Sequence-based typing of the
		"cultured bacterium revealed it to be a previously unidentified species, and it"
		was named ST2345 new-type. INTERVENTIONS: In addition to the treatment of
		"Legionnaires' disease, blood samples taken on the second day of admission showed"
		"a co-infection of Candida tropicalis, which was treated with anti-fungal"
		"treatment. The patient improved after a week, however, on the seventh day of"
		administration lower respiratory secretions showed the growth of Klebsiella
		"pneumonia, indicative of ventilator-associated pneumonia. OUTCOMES: Despite"
		"active treatment, the patient passed away due to multiple organ failure. As this"
		"was a fatal case, further research is needed to determine whether the critical"
		condition of this case was related to the virulence of the novel Legionella
		strain. CONCLUSION: A key finding of this study is that treatment for suspected
		"Legionnaires' disease must be administered rapidly, as infection with Legionella"
		may give rise to secondary pathogenic infections.

AB	-	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To investigate in vitro microbiological
		susceptibilities of Candida vitreous endophthalmitis isolates using traditional
		and newer antifungal agents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The current study is a
		"retrospective, consecutive case series of 17 vitreous culture-proven Candida"
		endophthalmitis isolates from 2011 to 2017 from Bascom Palmer Eye Institute.
		"Susceptibilities to echinocandins, triazoles, polyenes, and nucleoside analogs"
		"were obtained. RESULTS: The study isolates consisted of 59% C. albicans, 17% C."
		"glabrata, 12% C. tropicalis, and 12% C. parapsilosis. Isolates demonstrated 100%"
		sensitivity to all antifungals tested except anidulafungin (85% sensitive) and
		"fluconazole (88.2% sensitive). Comparing in-class agents, minimum inhibitory"
		"concentration (MIC) values for voriconazole were lower than other triazoles,"
		whereas micafungin had lower MIC values compared with other echinocandins.
		CONCLUSION: Both traditional and newer antifungals included agents that were
		highly efficacious against in vitro Candida species. Although the authors' study
		"data suggest that older, established antifungals are likely adequate for the"
		"treatment of Candida endophthalmitis, newer antifungal agents also can be"
		considered. [Ophthalmic Surg Lasers Imaging Retina. 2019;50:S13-S17.].

TI	-	The epidemiology of Candida species associated with vulvovaginal candidiasis in
		an Iranian patient population.
PG	-	199-203
LID	-	10.1016/j.ejogrb.2010.11.022 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: Vulvovaginal candidiasis is a common infection among women worldwide.
		"According to previous epidemiological studies, Candida albicans is the most"
		"common species of Candida. The prevalence of non-Candida species, however, is"
		increasing. Identification of Candida species among the population will not only
		"help health professionals to choose suitable antifungal treatments, but also"
		"prevent development of drug resistance. The aim of this study was to identify,"
		"using chromogenic agar medium, the Candida species associated with vulvovaginal"
		candidiasis among a sample of the Iranian population. STUDY DESIGN: In a
		"prospective cohort study during a two year period from March 2006 to March 2008,"
		swab samples of vaginal discharge/secretion were taken from 200 patients admitted
		"to the gynecology clinic of Mahdieh Hospital (Tehran, Iran) with a clinical"
		presentation suggestive of vulvovaginal candidiasis. The isolates obtained were
		cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar and chromogenic agar medium. Candida species
		"were also identified by germ tube formation in serum, chlamydospore production on"
		Corn Meal Agar and carbohydrate absorption using the API 20C-AUX kit.
		Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire investigating the risk
		factors associated with candidiasis. An assessment of the different species of
		"recurrent and non-recurrent candidiasis was also made. Descriptive statistics,"
		"chi-square test, and t-test were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: A total of"
		191 isolates were obtained from 175 vaginal specimens. Candida albicans accounted
		for 67% of the strains including single and mixed infections. The other
		"identified species were Candida glabrata (18.3%), Candida tropicalis (6.8%),"
		"Candida krusei (5.8%), Candida parapsilosis (1.6%), and Candida guilliermondii"
		(0.5%) respectively. Mixed infection with two or more species of Candida was seen
		in 10.3% of patients. The most common mixed cause was the combination of Candida
		albicans and Candida glabrata. Participants who were sexually active and those
		who had orogenital sex were more likely to suffer recurrent vulvovaginal
		candidiasis. CONCLUSIONS: Candida albicans was the most common cause of recurrent
		and non-recurrent vulvovaginitis. The second most common species was Candida
		glabrata. This study suggests CHROMagar method as a convenient and cost effective
		yet reliable method to isolate the species of Candida especially in cases where
		more than one species is present.

		Case Report and Review of the Literature.
PG	-	48-51
AB	-	Only a handful of case reports in the literature describe presence of Candida
		albicans in the gut of otherwise healthy subjects who were older adults and
		"presented with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. In this article, the authors"
		describe an interesting case report of a 48-y-old female with Sjogren's syndrome
		and stage II cervical cancer complicated by a rectovaginal fistulae postradiation
		"therapy requiring a colectomy and ileostomy, who presented with a wasting"
		syndrome consisting of unresolving watery diarrhea and a 40-pound (18.14 kg)
		"weight loss in the course of 5 mo. On physical exam, she appeared to be a thin,"
		fragile female with wasting in the subscapular and sternocleidomastoid area with
		benign GI exam. An upper endoscopy was unremarkable for any significant
		pathological entity. A small bowel fluid aspirate was positive for overgrowth of
		Candida tropicalis and also was found to have anti-Candida immunoglobulin A. The
		patient was begun on central parenteral nutrition and she completed a 3-wk course
		of fluconazole. She was gradually weaned off total parenteral nutrition during
		"the next 3 mo, with slow reintroduction of healthy whole foods and had"
		appropriate weight gain and resolution of her GI symptoms. This case shows how
		important dietary interventions can be in managing malnutrition. Adding proper
		nutrients and slowly eradicating the dysbiotic fungi in the small intestine can
		help in resolution of GI symptoms and return to functional status.

PG	-	333-7
LID	-	S1413-86702008000400016 [pii]
AB	-	"Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of nails caused by dermatophytes, yeasts and"
		"moulds, accounting for about 50% of onychopathies. A high frequency of"
		onychomycosis caused by Candida species has been reported during the last few
		"years in northeast Brazil, as well as in other regions of the world. A clinical"
		diagnosis of onychomycosis needs to be confirmed through laboratory exams. We
		evaluated the importance of serial repetition of direct microscopic exams and
		"fungal culture for the diagnosis of onychomycosis in the city of Fortaleza,"
		"Ceará, in northeast Brazil. We first made a retrospective study of 127 patients"
		"with onychomycosis, identifying the fungi that had been isolated from fingernails"
		"and toenails. We then made a prospective study of 120 patients, who were"
		submitted to three successive mycological examinations. Ungual residues were
		scraped off and directly examined with a microscope and fungal cultures were
		"made. In the retrospective study, in which only one sample was analyzed, the"
		"incidence of onychomycosis was 25.0%. In our prospective study, in which we had"
		"data from successive mycological examinations, 37.8% had onychomycosis. The most"
		"commonly isolated fungi in both studies were yeasts from the genera Candida,"
		"especially C albicans, C. parapsilosis and C. tropicalis. We found a high"
		proportion of onychomycosis caused by Candida species. We also concluded that
		"serial repetition of direct microscopic examination and fungal culture, with"
		intervals of 2-5 days improved the diagnosis of onychomycosis. We suggest that
		this laboratorial strategy is necessary for accurate diagnosis of this type of
		"mycosis, especially when the standard procedures fail to diagnose fungal"
		"infection, despite strong clinical suspicion."

		1992-1994. Fungal Disease Registry of the Canadian Infectious Disease Society.
PG	-	493-9
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candida species are important bloodstream pathogens that are being
		isolated with increasing frequency. Despite the availability of effective
		"antifungal therapy, the mortality rate associated with Candida infection remains"
		"high. With the objective of describing the epidemiology of candidemia, the"
		Canadian Infectious Disease Society conducted a study of candidemia in Canada.
		METHODS: Fourteen medical centres across Canada identified all patients with
		candidemia from March 1992 to February 1994 through blood culture surveillance
		for Candida spp. Patient-related data for invasive fungal infection were compiled
		retrospectively by chart review using a standardized data-recording form
		developed for the Fungal Disease Registry of the Canadian Infectious Disease
		Society. Cases of Candidemia were studied in relation to underlying medical
		"conditions, predisposing factors, concurrent infection, antimicrobial agents,"
		"antifungal treatment and deaths. RESULTS: In total, 415 cases of candidemia were"
		"identified, 48 (11.6%) in children and 367 (88.4%) in adults. The causative"
		"pathogens were C. albicans in 286 cases (68.9%), C. parapsilosis in 43 (10.4%),"
		"C. glabrata in 34 (8.2%), C. tropicalis in 27 (6.5%) and other Candida species in"
		18 (4.3%); polymicrobial candidemia occurred in 7 cases (1.7%). The overall
		"mortality rate was 46%, and the rate of deaths clinically related to candidemia"
		"was 19%. However, only 13 (27%) of the children died. A univariate analysis"
		"indicated that significant risk factors for death were age greater than 60 years,"
		"therapy for concomitant bacterial infection, stay in an intensive care unit,"
		"concurrent malignant disease, cytotoxic chemotherapy and granulocytopenia,"
		although only age and stay in an intensive care unit emerged as significant risk
		factors in the multivariate analysis. After adjustment for other predictors of
		"death, only infection with C. parapsilosis was associated with a lower mortality"
		rate than infection with C. albicans. Treatment was given in 352 (84.8%) of
		cases. Amphotericin B was the preferred agent in 244 cases (69.3% of those
		treated); fluconazole was used in 101 cases (28.7%) and ketoconazole in 5 cases
		(1.4%). INTERPRETATION: Candidemia in Canada is caused predominantly by C.
		"albicans. The mortality rate associated with candidemia is high, but it varies"
		with the species of Candida and is lower in children than in adults. Age greater
		than 60 years and stay in an intensive care unit were the most significant risk
		factors for overall mortality.

PG	-	281-6
AB	-	"In order to evaluate the epidemiology of candidemia in Brazil, we performed a"
		prospective multicenter study conducted in six general hospitals from São Paulo
		"and Rio de Janeiro, We enrolled a total of 145 candidemic patients (85 males)"
		with a median age of 32 years. Non-albicans species accounted for 63% of all
		episodes and the species most frequently causing candidemia were C. albicans
		"(37%), C. parapsilosis (25%), C. tropicalis (24%), C. rugosa (5%), and C."
		glabrata (4%). Systemic azoles were used before the onset of candidemia in only
		six patients. There were no differences in the coexisting exposures or underlying
		diseases associated with the species most frequently causing candidemia. The
		overall crude mortality rate was 50%. Nosocomial candidemias in our tertiary
		"hospitals are caused predominantly by non-albicans species, which are rarely"
		fluconazole resistant. This predominance of non-albicans species could not be
		related to the previous use of azoles.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Healthcare-associated infections, formerly known as"
		"nosocomial infections, are one of the most important issues in current practice."
		"Understanding trends in overall infection rates, as well as their incidence and"
		"proportion among different causative organisms, can help us to better define our"
		infection control methods and therapy goals. To understand the changing
		"epidemiology of nosocomial bloodstream infections (BSI) in Taiwan, we"
		retrospectively collected nosocomial infection data from 11 hospitals and
		examined the trends and changing patterns of nosocomial BSI. METHODS: Eleven
		major teaching hospitals in Taiwan were invited to participate in the study. The
		"overall density of nosocomial infections and major BSI-causing organisms,"
		"including Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii,"
		"and Candida species, were collected. The distribution of the different Candida"
		"species was also recorded. Background parameters from the 11 hospitals, including"
		"the size of the hospital, hospital capacity, the number of blood stream infection"
		"events, and average length of stay, were also recorded. RESULTS: The incidence of"
		"nosocomial BSI ranged 0.23-2.56 per 1,000 patient-days, which accounted for 8-43%"
		of all nosocomial infections. The most common causative organism of nosocomial
		"bacteremia was S. aureus, ranging 0.88-0.01 per 1,000 patient-days. Overall, the"
		"incidence of S. aureus bacteremia has decreased over the last 13 years, but this"
		difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.053). The rate of Candida
		fungemia (p < 0.01) and A. baumannii (p = 0.03) bacteremia increased
		"significantly. C. albicans accounted for most cases of nosocomial fungemia,"
		"ranging from 40% to 80%, followed by Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis and"
		"Candida glabrata. However, the incidence varied significantly from hospital to"
		"hospital, and the highest incidence was observed in a cancer center. CONCLUSION:"
		The overall incidence rate of S. aureus bacteremia in the 11 major hospitals
		"studied had decreased over the last decade, though the difference was not"
		"statistically significant. However, the rate of Candida fungemia and A. baumannii"
		bacteremia had increased significantly.

TI	-	The epidemiology of candidemia in two United States cities: results of a
		population-based active surveillance.
PG	-	1164-70
AB	-	"We conducted prospective, active population-based surveillance for candidemia"
		(defined as any Candida species isolated from blood) in Atlanta and San Francisco
		"(total population, 5.34 million) during 1992-1993. The average annual incidence"
		"of candidemia at both sites was 8 per 100,000 population. The highest incidence"
		"(75 per 100,000) occurred among infants </=1 year old. In 19% of patients,"
		candidemia developed prior to or on the day of admission. Underlying medical
		"conditions included cancer (26%), abdominal surgery (14%), diabetes mellitus"
		"(13%), and human immunodeficiency virus infection (10%). In 47% of cases, species"
		"of Candida other than Candida albicans were isolated, most commonly Candida"
		"parapsilosis, Candida glabrata, and Candida tropicalis. Antifungal susceptibility"
		testing of 394 isolates revealed minimal levels of azole resistance among C.
		"albicans, C. tropicalis, and C. parapsilosis. These data document the substantial"
		burden of candidemia and its changing epidemiology. Continued surveillance will
		be important to monitor the epidemiology of candidemia and to detect emergence of
		resistance to azoles.

TI	-	The ever-evolving landscape of candidaemia in patients with acute leukaemia:
		non-susceptibility to caspofungin and multidrug resistance are associated with
		increased mortality.
PG	-	2362-8
LID	-	10.1093/jac/dkv087 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: The epidemiology and clinical course of candidaemia in patients with
		"acute leukaemia, a population frequently exposed to antifungals, have not been"
		extensively studied. In the present contemporary series of acute leukaemia
		"patients, we describe patient characteristics, Candida species and MIC"
		distributions and investigate the association between antifungal resistance and
		all-cause mortality. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of medical
		records and microbiological data of adult patients with acute leukaemia or
		high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome with at least one positive blood culture for
		Candida species at the MD Anderson Cancer Center between January 2008 and October
		2012. Susceptibility was defined according to the 2012 epidemiological cut-off
		values and clinical breakpoints. RESULTS: We identified 67 episodes of
		candidaemia in 65 patients. Almost all episodes (94%) occurred in patients who
		"were receiving antifungal agents, 71% in patients receiving an echinocandin."
		Almost all isolates (99%) were of non-albicans Candida species [most frequently
		"Candida parapsilosis (32%), Candida tropicalis (23%) and Candida glabrata (20%)]."
		Caspofungin non-susceptibility was significantly associated with fluconazole
		resistance (P < 0.001). Non-susceptibility to caspofungin and multidrug
		resistance were associated with excess 14 day [adjusted HR (aHR) 3.02 (95% CI
		"1.28-7.09), P = 0.011 and aHR 3.02 (95% CI 1.27-7.14), P = 0.012, respectively]"
		"and 30 day [aHR 2.96 (95% CI 1.38-6.37), P = 0.005 and aHR 2.86 (95% CI"
		"1.31-6.21), P = 0.008, respectively] all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In"
		"patients with acute leukaemia, a shift in candidaemia epidemiology was noted with"
		a 99% predominance of non-albicans species. Non-susceptibility of Candida strains
		to caspofungin or multidrug resistance were independent markers of poor outcome
		in this patient population.

		Resistance surveillance study in Venezuelan strains.
PG	-	137-43
LID	-	10.1080/13693780802144339 [doi]
AB	-	The aim of this study was to determine in vitro susceptibility profiles of
		Venezuelan strains of Candida spp. to four antifungal agents. One hundred and
		forty five (145) isolates were recovered during a 1-year period (June 2006 to
		June 2007) from clinical specimens of patients with severe Candida spp.
		"infections in 15 hospitals. In vitro susceptibilities to amphotericin B,"
		"fluconazole, itraconazole and voriconazole were determined by modified Etest. Non"
		Candida albicans Candida spp. were the most frequently isolated yeasts (72.4%) in
		comparison with C. albicans (27.6%). Candida spp. strains showed MIC ranges
		between <0.002 and 0.5 mug/ml to amphotericin B. While none were found to be
		"resistant to voriconazole, 5.5% and 27.6% of the test strains were resistant to"
		"fluconazole and itraconazole, respectively. C. albicans remains the most"
		susceptible of the yeasts studied to fluconazole and itraconazole (P<0.05) when
		compared with non C. albicans Candida spp. C. krusei showed the greater
		"cross-resistance to azoles, followed by C. glabrata, C. tropicalis and C."
		"parapsilosis, while C. albicans isolates did not demonstrate this characteristic."
		It is very important to carry out the correct species identification of clinical
		yeast isolates because they show up variations in both distribution and
		"susceptibility profiles according to the hospital, patient's underlying disease,"
		"clinical specimen analyzed, and the geographical region in which the studies were"
		conducted. The Mycology Department of the INHRR is the national reference center
		"responsible for antifungal resistance surveillance, performing the susceptibility"
		tests with isolates recovered from hospitalized patients in public health centres
		which do not have mycological diagnosis laboratories.

PG	-	"523-9, table of contents"
LID	-	10.1213/ane.0b013e3181607262 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: In this study we sought to identify differences in risk factors and
		outcome of critically ill patients with Candida albicans and non-albicans
		"candidemia. METHODS: Nonimmunosuppressed, nonneutropenic patients with candidemia"
		diagnosed after intensive care unit (ICU) admission were included in a
		prospective observational study in a medical-surgical ICU at a tertiary academic
		"hospital in Athens, Greece. RESULTS: During the study period (January 2001 to"
		"December 2005), 56 candidemia episodes in 1037 ICU admissions were included"
		"(5.4%). Of these patients, 36/56 (64.3%) had candidemia due to C. albicans and"
		"20/56 (35.7%) due to non-albicans species (8/56 [14.3%] C. glabrata, 6/56 [10.7%]"
		"C. tropicalis, 3/56 [5.4%] C. parapsilosis, 1/56 [1.8%] C. lusitaniae, 1/56"
		[1.8%] C. krusei and 1/56 [1.8%] C. dubliniensis). Administration of
		"glucocorticosteroids, central venous catheter placement, and preexisting"
		candiduria were independently associated with candidemia due to C. non-albicans
		"species (Odds ratio [OR]: 45.1, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.0-669.9; OR:"
		"26.2, 95% CI: 2.1-334.8; and OR: 16.5, 95% CI: 1.6-173.9, respectively). The"
		treatment response rate differed significantly between patients with C. albicans
		and patients with C. non-albicans bloodstream infections (29/36 [80.6%] vs 9/20
		"[45%], P = 0.006). Overall mortality was higher in patients with non-albicans"
		"species than C. albicans bloodstream infections (18/20 [90%] vs 19/36 [52.8%], P"
		= 0.005). Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that candidemia due
		"to non-albicans species was independently associated with death (OR: 6.7, 95% CI:"
		1.2-37.7). CONCLUSIONS: In the subset of critically ill nonimmunosuppressed
		"patients, candidemia caused by non-albicans species occurred more frequently in"
		those with medical devices or receiving steroids. Candidemia due to non-albicans
		species was also associated with higher mortality.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: The incidence of candidemia is increasing in developing countries.
		Very little is known about the epidemiology of candidemia in Peru. The aim of
		"this study is to describe the incidence, microbiology, clinical presentation and"
		outcomes of Candida bloodstream infections in three Lima-Callao hospitals.
		METHODS: Candida spp. isolates were identified prospectively at participant
		hospitals between November 2013 and January 2015. Susceptibility testing for
		"amphotericin B, fluconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole and anidulafungin was"
		performed using broth microdilution method. Clinical information was obtained
		from medical records and evaluated. RESULTS: We collected information on 158
		"isolates and 157 patients. Median age of patients was 55.0 yrs., and 64.1% were"
		males. Thirty-eight (24.2%) episodes of candidemia occurred in those <18 yrs. The
		frequency of non-Candida albicans was 72.1%. The most frequently recovered
		"species were C. albicans (n = 44, 27.8%), C. parapsilosis (n = 40, 25.3%), C."
		"tropicalis (n = 39, 24.7%) and C. glabrata (n = 15, 9.5%). Only four isolates"
		"were resistant to fluconazole, 86.7% (n = 137) were susceptible and 17 were"
		susceptible-dose dependent. Decreased susceptibility to posaconazole was also
		"observed in three isolates, and one to voriconazole. All isolates were"
		susceptible to anidulafungin and amphotericin B. The most commonly associated
		"co-morbid conditions were recent surgery (n = 61, 38.9%), mechanical ventilation"
		"(n = 60, 38.2%) and total parenteral nutrition (n = 57, 36.3%). The incidence of"
		"candidemia by center ranged between 1.01 and 2.63 cases per 1,000 admissions,"
		with a global incidence of 2.04. Only 28.1% of cases received treatment within 72
		"hrs. of diagnosis. Overall, the 30-day survival was 60.4% (treated subjects,"
		"67.4%; not-treated patients, 50.9%). CONCLUSIONS: We found a very high proportion"
		"of non-albicans Candida species. Despite this, the decreased"
		susceptibility/resistance to fluconazole was only 13.3% and not seen in the other
		"antifungals. Overall, the incidence of candidemia mortality was high when"
		"compared to other international studies. It is possible, that the delay in"
		"initiating antifungal treatment contributed to the elevated mortality rate, in"
		spite of low antifungal resistance.

		Years of Age.
PG	-	275-279
LID	-	10.1097/INF.0000000000002237 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Treatment with an echinocandin is recommended as first-line therapy
		for patients with invasive candidiasis (ICC) including candidemia. Little is
		known about the efficacy and safety of anidulafungin in children with ICC.
		METHODS: Eligible patients with ICC 2 to <18 years old were enrolled into this
		"prospective, open-label, noncomparative, international study (NCT00761267) and"
		"received anidulafungin for 10-35 days (3 mg/kg on day 1, 1.5 mg/kg daily"
		"thereafter). Safety was assessed through week 6 follow-up. Efficacy, measured by"
		"global response (based on clinical and microbiologic responses), was assessed at"
		"end of intravenous treatment (EOIVT), end of treatment, weeks 2 and 6 follow-up."
		"RESULTS: Forty-nine patients (n = 19, 2 to <5 years; n = 30, 5 to <18 years)"
		received ≥1 dose of anidulafungin (median 11 days; range 1-35 days) and were
		"assessed for safety. Among 48 patients with a Candida species isolated, C."
		"albicans (37.5%), C. parapsilosis (25.0%), C. tropicalis (14.6%) and C."
		lusitaniae (10.4%) were the most frequent Candida spp. All patients reported ≥1
		"treatment-emergent adverse event, with diarrhea (22.4%), vomiting (24.5%) and"
		pyrexia (18.4%) being most frequent. Five patients discontinued treatment because
		"of adverse events, of which 4 discontinuations were considered related to"
		anidulafungin. All-cause mortality was 8.2% (4/49) by EOIVT and 14.3% (7/49) by
		week 6 follow-up. None of 7 deaths during the study period were considered
		treatment related. Global response success rate was 70.8% at EOIVT. CONCLUSIONS:
		These data support the use of anidulafungin as a treatment option for ICC in
		children 2 to <18 years old at the studied dose.

LID	-	10.1016/j.archoralbio.2014.05.014 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Sickle cell anaemia (SCA) is the most frequent
		haematological hereditary disease. Children with SCA are submitted to long-term
		"prophylactic therapy with penicillin, but little is known about its impact on"
		oral microflora. The aim of this study was to evaluate the oral microbial
		colonization of paediatric patients with SCA. DESIGN: Forty children (4-11yrs
		old) with SCA (genotype SS) under long-term prophylactic treatment with
		penicillin were included in the study. Age/gender-matched control group of
		"healthy children was also included. Scores of dmft/DMFT (number of decayed (D),"
		"missing (M), or filled (F) teeth; dmft, for primary dentition; DMFT, for"
		permanent dentition) were obtained and stimulated saliva was sampled. Salivary
		flow rate and buffering capacity were evaluated. Counts of microorganisms (mutans
		"streptococci, lactobacilli and yeasts) were determined by plating method. Yeasts"
		were identified by API 20C AUX and PCR. RESULTS: Mean dmft/DMFT values were
		similar in the studied groups (SCA 2.13/1.60 and control 2.38/1.3). Although no
		"significant differences between cariogenic microorganism counts were observed,"
		significantly higher yeasts oral levels were observed in SCA group. Controls
		showed lower salivary buffering capacity. Candida albicans was the most
		"frequently isolated species in both groups. Candida famata, Candida parapsilosis"
		"and Candida tropicalis were also isolated from controls. Candida dubliniensis,"
		Candida rugosa and Candida sphaerica were found only in SCA group. CONCLUSIONS:
		"Based on the results, it could be concluded that paediatric patients with SCA"
		showed significantly higher oral level of yeasts. Uncommon fungal species were
		found in SCA group. Similar caries prevalence and counts of lactobacilli and
		streptococci in relation to controls were observed.

AB	-	"A prospective, observational, multicentre study of invasive candidosis (IC) in"
		surgical patients in intensive care units (ICUs) was conducted from 2006 to 2008
		"in 72 ICUs in 14 European countries. A total of 779 patients (62.5% males, median"
		age 63 years) with IC were included. The median rate of candidaemia was 9 per
		1000 admissions. In 10.8% the infection was already present at the time of
		"admission to ICU. Candida albicans accounted for 54% of the isolates, followed by"
		"Candida parapsilosis 18.5%, Candida glabrata 13.8%, Candida tropicalis 6%,"
		"Candida krusei 2.5%, and other species 5.3%. Infections due to C. krusei (57.9%)"
		and C. glabrata (43.6%) had the highest crude mortality rate. The most common
		"preceding surgery was abdominal (51.5%), followed by thoracic (20%) and"
		neurosurgery (8.2%). Candida glabrata was more often isolated after abdominal
		"surgery in patients ≥60 years, and C. parapsilosis was more often isolated in"
		neurosurgery and multiple trauma patients as well as children ≤1 year of age. The
		"most common first-line treatment was fluconazole (60%), followed by caspofungin"
		"(18.7%), liposomal amphotericin B (13%), voriconazole (4.8%) and other drugs"
		(3.5%). Mortality in surgical patients with IC in ICU was 38.8%. Multivariate

PG	-	981-7
AB	-	The aim of this study was to identify retrospectively trends in species
		distribution and susceptibility patterns of Candida species causing bloodstream
		infections in 99 medical centres (55 in Spain and 44 in Argentina) from 1996 to
		1999. A total of 744 Candida isolates were sent to the mycology reference
		laboratories during the study period (514 to the Spanish laboratory and 230 to
		the Argentinian laboratory). Candida non-albicans strains caused more episodes of
		fungaemia than Candida albicans isolates in both Spain and Argentina. C. albicans
		was isolated in 30.2% (155/514) and 40.9% (94/230) of episodes in Spain and in
		"Argentina, respectively. In addition, Candida parapsilosis was the second most"
		commonly isolated pathogen (36.4%). Candida tropicalis caused 13.7% of infections
		and Candida glabrata 7.4%. The amphotericin B MIC was <or=1 mg/L for 97.5% of
		"isolates, and 8.3% of strains had decreased susceptibility to flucytosine."
		"Regarding susceptibility to azole agents, 9.9% (74/744) and 21.9% (163/744)"
		"exhibited decreased susceptibility to fluconazole and itraconazole, respectively."
		"For Candida species, some marked differences were found between countries, and"
		decreased susceptibility to azole agents was detected significantly more
		"frequently (P < 0.05) among Argentinian isolates of C. albicans, C. parapsilosis"
		and C. tropicalis. These findings reinforced the need for continued surveillance
		programmes to analyse the factors that may have an influence on candidaemia
		incidence. Susceptibility patterns were obtained by means of the proposed
		reference procedure for antifungal susceptibility testing of the European
		Committee on Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST). Excellent
		interlaboratory agreement was achieved for MICs for quality control strains noted
		"in Spain and in Argentina (intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.97),"
		indicating that the EUCAST procedure is a reliable methodology for susceptibility
		testing.

TI	-	Changing pattern of candidaemia 2001-2006 and use of antifungal therapy at the
		"University Hospital of Vienna, Austria."
PG	-	1072-6
AB	-	A retrospective survey of candidaemia between 2001 and 2006 was performed at the
		"University Hospital of Vienna, a 2200-bed centre with large organ transplantation"
		and haematology-oncology units. The incidence rate of Candida spp. in blood
		cultures increased from 0.27 cases/1000 admissions in 2001 to 0.77 cases/1000
		admissions in 2006 (p <0.005). The incidence of candidaemia caused by Candida
		albicans and by non-albicans Candida spp. both increased during this period;
		although there was a trend towards an increased incidence (37%) of non-albicans
		"Candida spp., particularly Candida glabrata, in surgical wards, C. albicans"
		"remained the predominant pathogen (63%). In the haematology-oncology unit, C."
		"albicans remained the leading pathogen (23/29 isolates, 79%), followed by Candida"
		"tropicalis and C. glabrata (2/29, 7% each), Candida sake and Candida lusitaniae"
		"(1/29, 3% each). The overall survival rate was 43.8%, ranging from 32.8% in 2004"
		"to 63.6% in 2002. In total, 108 (33.2%) patients died within 4 weeks of the first"
		isolation of Candida spp. from blood; 58 (54%) of these patients died within the
		"first 7 days, and a further 34 patients died within the next 3 months."
		"Fluconazole was used extensively (24 701.5 defined daily doses), followed by"
		"amphotericin B (8981.4 defined daily doses), during 2005. The consumption of"
		antifungal agents increased continuously (p <0.05) because of increased use of
		voriconazole and caspofungin. Although the numbers of susceptible patients
		"remained unchanged, the net increase in the number of cases of candidaemia"
		warrants a re-evaluation of the risk-factors and the use of improved diagnostic
		procedures for invasive fungal infections.

PG	-	565-569
AB	-	"OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to determine the proportion, known risk factors and"
		etiology for Candida infection in leukoplakia lesions among patients with oral
		leukoplakia attending the Oral and Maxillofacial Clinic at a Tertiary Care
		Hospital in Sri Lanka. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty clinically suspected oral
		"leukoplakia patients were included. Two oral swabs each, from leukoplakia"
		patients: one swab from the lesion and the other one from the contralateral
		unaffected corresponding area (as a control) were collected. Direct microscopy
		and culture followed by colony count and phenotypic identification were performed
		to identify pathogenic Candida species. RESULTS: Candida infection was seen in
		47% of patients with oral leukoplakia. Candida albicans (94.7%) was the most
		common Candida species followed by Candida tropicalis (5.3%). Majority of
		Candida-infected lesions were seen in the buccal mucosa region. Alteration of
		"taste (p = 0.021), having other oral lesions (p = 0.008), angular cheilitis"
		(p = 0.024) and periodontitis (p = 0.041) showed a significant association with
		Candida-associated leukoplakia. Increasing age showed a significant tendency for
		Candida infection (p = 0.020). Smoking (p = 0.026) and betel-quid chewing
		"(p = 0.006) were also found to be significantly associated, although alcohol"
		consumption alone did not show a significant association. Oral leukoplakia
		"patients who had all three habits: alcohol consumption, smoking and betel-quid"
		chewing had a significant association with Candida infection (p = 0.004).
		"CONCLUSIONS: Patients who had a combination of risk factors: smoking, betel-quid"
		chewing and alcohol consumption were seen to have a significant association with
		Candida infection. Further betel-quid chewing alone and smoking singly was also
		significantly associated with Candida infection in oral leukoplakia.

		change in spectrum of agents and antifungal susceptibility.
PG	-	110-116
LID	-	10.4103/ijmm.IJMM_20_112 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: Candidaemia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality of hospitalised
		"patients, especially in developing countries. This study was conducted to monitor"
		any change in species distribution and antifungal susceptibility pattern of
		Candida species causing candidaemia over the last 20 years. MATERIALS AND
		METHODS: The candidaemia cases reported during January 1999 and December 2018 at
		our centre were reviewed. The yeasts were identified by phenotypic characters
		(during 1999-2014) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation-time of flight
		mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) (during 2014-2018). Antifungal susceptibility
		testing (AFST) was performed in accordance with the Clinical and Laboratory
		"Standards Institute guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 602,963 blood samples from"
		patients with suspected sepsis were processed. Candidaemia was diagnosed in 7927
		(1.31%) cases. The frequency of cases rose significantly (P = 0.000) in the last
		"quarter of the study. Candida tropicalis (40.1%) was the most common species,"
		"followed by Candida albicans (15.2%), Wickerhamomyces anomalus (13.1%), Candida"
		"krusei (6.6%), Candida parapsilosis (4.7%) and others. Rare species such as"
		"Candida auris, Candida lambica, Candida orthopsilosis, Candida vishwanathii were"
		identified after the introduction of MALDI-TOF. The minimum inhibitory
		concentrations of amphotericin B rose significantly from the first to last
		quarter (0.5%-4.9%). Fluconazole resistance was fairly constant at 7.4%-8.8%.
		CONCLUSION: Local epidemiology of candidaemia at our centre was distinct
		regarding prevalence and change of spectrum of species. The identification of
		rare species was possible after the introduction of MALDI-TOF. With the emergence
		"of multidrug-resistant C. auris and resistance in other species, routine AFST has"
		become imperative.

TI	-	Oral colonization of Candida species in patients receiving radiotherapy in the
		head and neck area.
PG	-	e52-7
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To investigate oral Candida strain diversity in patients receiving
		radiation therapy for head and neck cancer compared to controls by conventional
		"procedures, including cultivation of imprint samples on chromogenic medium and"
		subsequent identification using Analytical Profile Index testing. METHOD AND
		MATERIALS: Twenty-two irradiated patients aged 18 to 55 years were recruited from
		"the Maxillofacial Prosthetic Service, Mahidol University. Concomitantly, 22"
		healthy individuals whose age and sex matched that of the patient group were
		selected for a control group. RESULTS: All patients studied were Candida carriers
		and were predominantly infected with Candida albicans (86.36%). Besides C
		"albicans, other yeasts colonizing the oral cavity of these patients were C"
		"glabrata, C krusei, and C tropicalis. Candida carriage was found relatively less"
		"frequently (45.45%) in control subjects. However, C albicans was still the"
		predominant species detected. No C dubliniensis was found in either group.
		CONCLUSION: Head and neck cancer patients who had received radiotherapy had a
		"high prevalence of Candida colonization in the oral cavity. Consequently,"
		prophylaxis to reduce Candida infection in these patients is required. This may
		improve the quality of life for patients who receive irradiation treatment for
		malignant cancer.

AB	-	Abstract We conducted a four-year (2003-2006) retrospective study of yeasts
		recovered in a hospital laboratory in the centre of Portugal to evaluate the
		epidemiology of yeast infections. Clinical isolates and data were gathered from
		751 patients corresponding to 906 episodes of yeast infection. The isolates were
		"first identified using classical and commercial methods, routinely employed at"
		the hospital laboratory. We then re-identified the same isolates using RFLP of
		the ITS 5.8S rRNA gene and sequence of the D1/D2 domain of the 26S rRNA gene.
		Candida parapsilosis isolates were re-identified using the Ban I digestion of the
		SADH gene. C. albicans was the most frequently isolated of the yeasts found in
		"the analysed specimens, with an overall incidence of 69.6% and then in decreasing"
		"order, C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis and C. krusei. C. parapsilosis"
		"was most frequently recovered from younger patients, decreasing with age, while"
		C. glabrata occurrence increased with age. We found an increased number of cases
		"of fungemia per 100,000 people per year, reaching a maximum of 4.4 during 2006."

TI	-	Spectrum of Fungal Pathogens in Burn Wound Specimens: Data From a Tertiary Care
		Hospital Laboratory in Pakistan.
PG	-	241-244
LID	-	10.1093/jbcr/iraa148 [doi]
AB	-	Burn patients are at great risk of developing fungal wound infections. Fungi are
		frequently cultured from burn tissue specimens alone or in combination with
		"bacteria. However, the spectrum of fungi in burn patients from Pakistan has not"
		been reported previously. A retrospective laboratory-based study was conducted
		and data on all positive cultures from burn wounds were included. During the
		"study period, specimens were cultured on appropriate media and incubated for"
		anaerobic and aerobic growth. Clinical and demographic information recorded
		during clinical reporting was also collected. Seventy tissue cultures were
		"positive for microorganisms. Of these, 27 (39%) had growth of either filamentous"
		mold (17 cases) or Candida species (14 cases). Two cases had growth of both mold
		and yeast. Aspergillus flavus was the most common mold (9) followed by Fusarium
		species (3). Candida tropicalis was the most common yeast (7) followed by Candida
		"parapsilosis (4). There was concomitant bacterial growth in 19 cases,"
		"predominantly of Staphylococcus aureus (13), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8), and"
		other Gram-negative rods (6). Of the 35 patients in which treatment history was
		"available, 33 were receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. A high incidence of"
		fungal isolation was seen in this study. Their findings are consistent with the
		global increase in fungal infections in burn wounds. High index of suspicion by
		clinicians and revision of culture protocols in burn patients may be warranted
		for optimal patient management.

TI	-	Review of 49 neonates with acquired fungal sepsis: further characterization.
PG	-	61-6
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Neonatal acquired fungal sepsis (AFS) is a risky condition that
		warrants every effort for early diagnosis and management. METHODS: We
		retrospectively reviewed the medical charts of all 4445 neonatal intensive care
		unit (NICU) admissions in the past 10 years and detected 49 neonates with AFS. We
		then compared their data with those of 49 matched control neonates who did not
		"have AFS. The following details were collected: gestational, perinatal and"
		neonatal courses; bacterial sepsis; antibacterial therapy; laboratory and imaging
		investigations; and antifungal therapy and its complications. RESULTS: The
		incidence of AFS was.4 to 2 cases per 1000 live-births and 3.8% to 12.9% of very
		"low birth weight (VLBW) infants. Compared with 1989 through 1992, between 1993"
		and 1995 the rate of AFS in VLBW neonates significantly increased (3. 8%-5.6% -->
		"9.6%-12.9%), along with a significant increase of NICU admission rate (369-410"
		"--> 496-510 admissions/year). Compared with controls, AFS neonates had"
		"significantly longer hospitalizations, higher rates of mechanical ventilation,"
		"umbilical vein catheterization, and previous treatment with broad-spectrum"
		"antibacterial agents (amikacin, vancomycin, ceftazidime, or imipenem). At the"
		"onset of AFS, 42.8% of patients had hyperthermia and 40.9% had normal white blood"
		"cell count. Causative fungi were as follows: Candida albicans-42.8% of cases,"
		"Candida parapsilosis-26.5%, and Candida tropicalis-20.4%. Fungal dissemination"
		"was rare, complications of antifungal therapy were infrequent, and no deaths"
		"occurred. CONCLUSIONS: First, non-albicans Candida have become more frequent in"
		"neonatal AFS. Second, mechanical ventilation and antibacterial agents are"
		"significant risk factors for AFS. Third, hyperthermia is a frequent presenting"
		"sign of AFS. Fourth, a normal white blood cell count does not rule out AFS."
		"Fifth, meningeal involvement in neonatal AFS should be ruled out before"
		"initiation of antifungal therapy. Sixth, the policy of empiric antifungal therapy"
		"for AFS should be considered on an individual NICU basis.newborn infant, fungal"
		"sepsis, clinical signs, risk factors."

TI	-	Analysis of the risk factors associated with the emergence of azole resistant
		oral candidosis in the course of HIV infection.
PG	-	691-9
AB	-	"The objective of this case-control study, conducted in a large Italian university"
		"hospital over a 12-month period, was to evaluate the risk factors associated with"
		the emergence of azole resistant oral candidosis in 64 Human Immunodeficiency
		Virus (HIV) infected patients. A swab was obtained from each patient by brushing
		"candidal lesions. Candida albicans was isolated in 41 patients (64%), Candida"
		"glabrata in ten (16%), Candida krusei in five (8%), Candida kefyr in two (3%),"
		"Candida tropicalis in two (3%), and Candida lipolytica and Candida guilliermondii"
		"in one case, respectively. Two patients suffered a double infection i.e. C."
		"albicans+C. krusei and C. albicans+C. glabrata, respectively. Candida species"
		"were tested in vitro for their susceptibility to ketoconazole, fluconazole,"
		itraconazole and amphotericin B. MICs of the four antifungal drugs were obtained
		for each yeast using a microdilution broth method developed in our laboratory.
		Twenty four (37%) of the isolated strains were resistant both to itraconazole and
		"fluconazole, five (8%) to fluconazole alone, and two (3%) to ketoconazole alone,"
		while none of the isolated strains was resistant to amphotericin B. Patients with
		oral candidosis caused by a strain resistant to one or more azole drug were
		compared to control patients with azole-susceptible oral candidosis. On
		"univariate analysis, more than five episodes of oral candidosis in the last year"
		"(P = 0.01), previous use of azole therapy (P = 0.001), C2-3 category of HIV"
		infection (P = 0.01) and low number of circulating CD4+ T-cells (P = 0.03) were
		significantly associated with an increased risk for the development of azole
		"resistance. However, previous use of azole therapy was the only factor selected"
		by a stepwise logistic regression analysis which was independently associated
		with the isolation of azole resistant strains (P = 0.003). Our findings indicate
		"that, in view of the potential risk for the emergence and selection of azole"
		"resistant strains of Candida in patients with AIDS, it is important to carefully"
		choose the antifungal drug for the therapy of mild fungal infections after
		evaluation of the in-vitro susceptibility of the isolated strains.

TI	-	In vitro susceptibility of yeasts isolated from patients in intensive care units
		to fluconazole and amphotericin B during a 3-year period.
PG	-	278-83
AB	-	Fungal infections have increased dramatically in recent years and candidemia is a
		major risk factor for morbidity and mortality in intensive care units (ICUs).
		Candidemia has been considered to be a nosocomial infection that is strongly
		"associated with neutropenia, recent surgery or presence of intravascular lines,"
		and previous colonization is an independent risk factor. We evaluated the in
		vitro efficacy of fluconazole and amphotericin B against yeasts isolated from
		various clinical specimens of colonized or infected patients treated in the ICUs
		"of the Institute of Cardiology, Istanbul University. A total of 1397 ICU patients"
		were treated at the Institute of Cardiology between January 2000 and December
		2002. A total of 117 yeasts isolated from 97 patients were included in this
		study. These ICU patients were hospitalized for a mean of 29 days. All yeasts
		"were identified by conventional methods and using the API (20C AUX, ID 32C)"
		"system (Bio Meriéux, France). Susceptibility to fluconazole and amphotericin B"
		"was evaluated using the E-test (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden). The most commonly"
		"isolated yeast was Candida albicans (72.6%), followed by Candida tropicalis"
		"(16.2%), Candida kefyr, Candida krusei, Candida parapsilosis, Trichosporon"
		mucoides and Geotrichum spp. Fluconazole and amphotericin B MIC90 values were
		0.75 microg/ml; 0.19 microg/ml and 1 microg/ml; 0.38 microg/ml for C. albicans
		"and C. tropicalis, respectively. All Geotrichum spp. were found to be"
		susceptible-dose dependent (SDD) (MIC=16-32 microg/ml) to fluconazole. Two C.
		"albicans, two C. tropicalis, one C. krusei and one Geotrichum spp. had a MIC"
		value of > or = 0.38 microg/ml for amphotericin B. The rate of colonization was
		3.36% (47/1397). Only 10 (0.71%) patients out of a total of 1397 developed
		"candidemia during the period of the investigation. Of these, 7 (70%) were caused"
		by non-albicans Candida spp.

TI	-	Invasive fungal infections in Chile: a multicenter study of fungal prevalence and
		susceptibility during a 1-year period.
PG	-	333-9
AB	-	During the first year of an ongoing surveillance program of invasive fungal
		infections (IFI) a total of 130 patients (56% male) with fungal strains isolated
		from blood and other sterile sites were reported from 13 hospitals in Chile.
		"Significant yeast isolates were obtained from 118 patients, and molds affected 12"
		"patients. The main patient groups affected were neonates, children less than 1"
		year old and adults aged 50-79 years. All fungal bloodstream infections (BSI)
		were due to yeasts; 79 patients (61%) were affected. The main risk factors
		"recorded were antibiotic therapy (76%), stay in the intensive care unit (ICU)"
		(70%) and presence of a central venous catheter (65%). Nosocomial infections were
		"represented in 83.5% of BSI. Overall, Candida albicans (40.8%), C. parapsilosis"
		"(13.1%), C. tropicalis (10%) and Cryptococcus neoformans (10%) were the most"
		common species. Aspergillus fumigatus (3.1%) was the most frequent mold. C.
		"albicans (48.1%) and C. parapsilosis (17.7%), were the most frequent agents"
		"recovered from blood. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Trichosporon mucoides, two"
		"emerging pathogens, were also isolated. All yeasts tested were susceptible to"
		amphotericin B with minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) < or = 1 microg/ml.
		Resistance to itraconazole (MIC > or = 1 microg/ml) and fluconazole (MIC > or =
		"64 microg/ml) was observed in 4 and 6% of cases, respectively. C. glabrata was"
		"the least susceptible species, with 50% of isolates resistant to itraconazole and"
		"33% resistant to fluconazole, with one strain showing combined resistance."
		Reduction of BSI requires greater adherence to hand-washing and related infection
		control guidelines.

TI	-	Evaluation of blood stream infections by Candida in three tertiary hospitals in
		"Salvador, Brazil: a case-control study."
PG	-	36-40
AB	-	Invasive infections caused by Candida spp. are an important problem in
		immunocompromised patients. There is scarce data on the epidemiology of blood
		"stream candidiasis in Salvador, Brazil. This study evaluates the risk factors"
		"associated with candidemia, among patients admitted to three tertiary, private"
		"hospitals, in Salvador, Brazil. We conducted a case-control, retrospective study"
		to compare patients with diagnosis of candidemia in three different tertiary
		"hospitals in Salvador, Brazil. Patients were matched for nosocomial, acquired"
		"infections, according to the causal agent: cases were defined by positive blood"
		cultures for Candida species. Controls were those patients who had a diagnosis of
		"systemic bacterial infection, with a positive blood culture to any bacteria,"
		within the same time period (+/- 30 days) of case identification. The groups were
		compared for the main known risk factors for candidemia and for mortality rates.
		"A hundred thirty-eight patients were identified. Among the 69 cases, only 14 were"
		diagnosed as infected by Candida albicans. Candida species were defined in only
		"eight cultures: C. tropicalis (4 cases), C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, C."
		"guillermondi, C. formata (1 case each). The main risk factors, identified in a"
		"univariate analysis, were: presence of a central venous catheter (CVC), use of"
		"parenteral nutrition support (PNS), previous exposure to antibiotics, and chronic"
		"renal failure (CRF). No association was detected with surgical procedures,"
		"diabetes mellitus, neutropenia or malignancies. Patients were more likely to die"
		"during the hospitalization period, but the rates of death caused by the"
		infections were similar for cases and controls. The length of hospitalization was
		"similar for both groups, as well as the time for a positive blood culture. Blood"
		"stream infection by Candida spp. is associated with CVC, PNS, previous use of"
		"antibiotics, and CRF. The higher mortality rate for cases probably better"
		"reflects the severity of the underlying diseases, than as a direct consequence of"
		Candidemia.

		clinico-pathological mechanisms.
PG	-	970-80
LID	-	10.1002/ppul.21082 [doi]
AB	-	Pertussis carries a high risk of mortality in very young infants. The mechanism
		of refractory cardio-respiratory failure is complex and not clearly delineated.
		We aimed to examine the clinico-pathological features and suggest how they may be
		"related to outcome, by multi-center review of clinical records and post-mortem"
		findings of 10 patients with fulminant pertussis (FP). All cases were less than 8
		"weeks of age, and required ventilation for worsening respiratory symptoms and"
		inotropic support for severe hemodynamic compromise. All died or underwent extra
		corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) within 1 week. All had increased leukocyte
		counts (from 54 to 132 x 10(9)/L) with prominent neutrophilia in 9/10. The
		post-mortem demonstrated necrotizing bronchitis and bronchiolitis with extensive
		areas of necrosis of the alveolar epithelium. Hyaline membranes were present in
		those cases with viral co-infection. Pulmonary blood vessels were filled with
		"leukocytes without well-organized thrombi. Immunodepletion of the thymus, spleen,"
		and lymph nodes was a common feature. Other organisms were isolated as follows;
		"2/10 cases Para influenza type 3, 2/10 Moraxella catarrhalis, 1/10 each with"
		"respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a coliform organism, methicillin-resistant"
		"Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Haemophilus influenzae, Stenotrophomonas"
		"maltophilia, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), and candida"
		tropicalis. We postulate that severe hypoxemia and intractable cardiac failure
		"may be due to the effects of pertussis toxin, necrotizing bronchiolitis,"
		"extensive damage to the alveolar epithelium, tenacious airway secretions, and"
		"possibly leukostasis with activation of the immunological cascade, all"
		contributing to increased pulmonary vascular resistance. Cellular apoptosis
		appeared to underlay much of these changes. The secondary immuno-compromise may
		facilitate co-infection.

TI	-	Molecular and phenotypic analysis of Candida dubliniensis: a recently identified
		species linked with oral candidosis in HIV-infected and AIDS patients.
PG	-	S96-101
AB	-	"The discovery and characterisation of a novel species of Candida, termed Candida"
		"dubliniensis, associated with oral candidosis in HIV-infected individuals is"
		described. These organisms share several phenotypic characteristics in common
		"with Candida albicans and Candida stellatoidea, including the ability to produce"
		"germ tubes and chlamydospores. However, in contrast to these latter two species,"
		"C. dubliniensis isolates produce abundant chlamydospores, which are often"
		"arranged in contiguous pairs, triplets and other multiples suspended from a"
		single suspensor cell. They belong to C. albicans serotype A and exhibit atypical
		substrate assimilation profiles. Genomic DNA fingerprinting analysis with the C.
		albicans-specific probe 27A and five different oligonucleotide probes consisting
		"of short repeat sequence-containing motifs, demonstrated that C. dubliniensis has"
		a distinct genomic organisation relative to C. albicans and C. stellatoidea. This
		was confirmed by karyotype analysis and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)
		analysis. Comparison of 500 bp of the V3 variable region of the large ribosomal
		subunit genes from 14 separate C. dubliniensis isolates and the corresponding
		"sequences from C. albicans, C. stellatoidea, C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, C."
		"parapsilosis, C. kefyr and C. krusei demonstrated that the C. dubliniensis"
		"isolates formed a homogenous cluster (100% similarity), representing a discrete"
		taxon within the genus Candida that was significantly different from the other
		species analysed.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: Paradoxical growth (PG) and trailing effect (TE) are frequently
		observed during antifungal susceptibility testing (AFST). These two phenomena
		interfere with the determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC).
		The aim of this study was to assess the clinical impact of TE and PG. METHODS: We
		analysed the frequency of TE and PG of 690 Candida isolates collected from a
		population-based study performed in Spain (CANDIPOP) and correlated the results
		with clinical outcome of the patients. RESULTS: Around 70% (484/690) of the
		isolates exhibited TE to azoles. Candida tropicalis showed the highest presence
		of TE (39/53 isolates exhibited residual growth >25% of control). No TE was seen
		in most of the isolates from the psilosis complex. PG was mainly associated with
		echinocandins. In patients treated with fluconazole within the first 48 hours
		"after blood sampling (n = 221), the presence of TE to azoles tended to be"
		"associated with lower 30-day mortality (odds ratio (OR) 0.55, 95% confidence"
		"interval (CI) 0.25-1.00) but not with clinical failure (OR 0.85, 95% CI"
		"0.45-1.54). In the subgroup of 117 patients treated with echinocandins, the"
		presence of PG was not associated with patient's response to antifungal treatment
		"(OR for 30-day mortality 1.63, 95% CI 0.76-4.03; OR for clinical failure 1.17,"
		"95% CI 0.53-2.70). CONCLUSIONS: TE or PG are widely expressed among Candida spp.,"
		although they do not seem to influence clinical outcome.

TI	-	The epidemiology and outcomes of invasive Candida infections among organ

		Infection Surveillance Network (TRANSNET).
PG	-	921-931
LID	-	10.1111/tid.12613 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive candidiasis (IC) is a common cause of mortality in solid
		"organ transplant recipients (OTRs), but knowledge of epidemiology in this"
		population is limited. METHOD: The present analysis describes data from 15 US
		centers that prospectively identified IC from nearly 17 000 OTRs. Analyses were
		undertaken to determine predictors of infection and mortality. RESULTS: A total
		of 639 cases of IC were identified. The most common species was Candida albicans
		"(46.3%), followed by Candida glabrata (24.4%) and Candida parapsilosis (8.1%). In"
		68 cases >1 species was identified. The most common infection site was
		"bloodstream (44%), followed by intra-abdominal (14%). The most frequently"
		affected allograft groups were liver (41.1%) and kidney (35.3%). All-cause
		mortality at 90 days was 26.5% for all species and was highest for Candida
		tropicalis (44%) and C. parapsilosis (35.2%). Non-white race and female gender
		were more commonly associated with non-albicans species. A high rate of
		breakthrough IC was seen in patients receiving antifungal prophylaxis (39%).
		"Factors associated with mortality include organ dysfunction, lung transplant, and"
		treatment with a polyene antifungal. The only modifiable factor identified was
		choice of antifungal drug class based upon infecting Candida species. CONCLUSION:
		These data highlight the common and distinct features of IC in OTRs.

TI	-	Vascular catheter-associated fungemia in patients with cancer: analysis of 155
		episodes.
PG	-	875-83
AB	-	We reviewed all 155 episodes of central venous catheter-associated fungemia among
		inpatients at the National Cancer Institute during a 10-year period. Candida
		species accounted for 98% of episodes. Fungemia was documented by culture of
		blood drawn through catheters in 50% of cases and by culture of both
		catheter-drawn and peripheral blood in 39%; mortality and the rate of
		dissemination were similar for these two groups. Four management strategies were
		"used: catheter removal, antifungal therapy (with amphotericin B), both, or"
		"neither; indications for the use of both modes of treatment included fever,"
		"neutropenia, long-term indwelling catheterization, positive cultures of both"
		"catheter-drawn and peripheral blood, isolation of Candida tropicalis, and fungal"
		isolation from two or more blood cultures. Disseminated fungal infection was
		documented in 82% of cases with these features but also in 35% of the less severe
		"cases treated only with catheter removal. In addition, nine (82%) of 11 cases"
		managed only with antifungal therapy had a negative outcome (either death from
		"disseminated infection or the recurrence of fevers and/or fungemia), a finding"
		suggesting that intravascular catheters should be removed in fungemia. Virtually
		all cases of catheter-associated fungemia in patients with cancer are clinically
		significant and require prompt therapy with amphotericin B.

TI	-	Increase in Candida krusei infection among patients with bone marrow
		transplantation and neutropenia treated prophylactically with fluconazole.
PG	-	1274-7
AB	-	BACKGROUND: In early 1990 fluconazole was introduced as a prophylactic antifungal
		agent after bone marrow transplantation. During the same year Candida krusei
		emerged as the chief candida pathogen among patients with bone marrow
		transplants. METHODS: To determine whether there was a correlation between the
		"introduction of fluconazole and the increased incidence of C. krusei, we"
		"conducted a retrospective study based on the medical, mycologic, and autopsy"
		records of all adult inpatients who had undergone bone marrow transplantation (n
		= 296) or who had leukemia (n = 167) at the study center during 1989 and 1990.
		RESULTS: The 84 patients who received antifungal prophylaxis with fluconazole had
		a sevenfold greater frequency of C. krusei infection than the 335 patients who
		"did not receive fluconazole (8.3 percent vs. 1.2 percent, P = 0.002), despite"
		having a lower frequency of disseminated C. albicans and C. tropicalis infections
		"(0 vs. 6.0 percent, P = 0.02). Ten of the 11 C. krusei infections were controlled"
		by a combination of amphotericin B and flucytosine. Colonization by C. krusei was
		found in 40.5 percent of the patients who received fluconazole but in only 16.7
		percent of those who did not receive it (P less than 0.0001). Colonization was
		independently associated with the prophylactic use of both fluconazole (odds
		"ratio, 3.50; P less than 0.001) and norfloxacin (odds ratio, 2.53; P = 0.04). C."
		krusei was not susceptible to fluconazole in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: In patients at
		"high risk for disseminated candida infections, suppression of bacterial flora and"
		"the more common candida pathogens may permit some less pathogenic, but natively"
		"resistant candida species, such as C. krusei, to emerge as systemic pathogens."

AB	-	Internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) sequencing is the most extensively used
		technology for accurate molecular identification of fungal pathogens in clinical
		"microbiology laboratories. Intra-genomic ITS sequence heterogeneity, which makes"
		"fungal identification based on direct sequencing of PCR products difficult, has"
		rarely been reported in pathogenic fungi. During the process of performing ITS
		"sequencing on 71 yeast strains isolated from various clinical specimens, direct"
		sequencing of the PCR products showed ambiguous sequences in six of them. After
		"cloning the PCR products into plasmids for sequencing, interpretable sequencing"
		"electropherograms could be obtained. For each of the six isolates, 10-49 clones"
		were selected for sequencing and two to seven intra-genomic ITS copies were
		detected. The identities of these six isolates were confirmed to be Candida
		"glabrata (n=2), Pichia (Candida) norvegensis (n=2), Candida tropicalis (n=1) and"
		Saccharomyces cerevisiae (n=1). Multiple sequence alignment revealed that one to
		"four intra-genomic ITS polymorphic sites were present in the six isolates, and"
		all these polymorphic sites were located in the ITS1 and/or ITS2 regions. We
		report and describe the first evidence of intra-genomic ITS sequence
		"heterogeneity in four different pathogenic yeasts, which occurred exclusively in"
		the ITS1 and ITS2 spacer regions for the six isolates in this study.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Infections are still the most common complications of cerebral
		"shunt procedures. Even though fungal etiologies are considered to be rare, they"
		are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Due to their
		"uncommonness, diagnostic procedures and optimal therapy are poorly defined. We"
		report a case of Candida tropicalis infection of ventriculo-peritoneal
		cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt in a 49-year-old immune competent male treated
		with voriconazole (VOR). METHODS: Microbiological and CSF markers
		"(1,3-b-D-glucan-BDG) of fungal infection, biofilm production capacity,"
		"sensitivity of serial isolates of the pathogen, and the concentration of the"
		antifungal drug have been monitored and related to the clinical course of this
		"infection. RESULTS: Despite appropriate treatment with VOR, in terms of adequate"
		"achieved CSF drug concentrations and initial effective therapeutic response, loss"
		of VOR susceptibility of the C tropicalis and treatment failure were observed.
		CONCLUSION: Biofilm production of the C. tropicalis isolate might have had a
		"significant role in treatment failure. Of interest, clinical and microbiological"
		unfavorable outcome was anticipated by persistence of BDG in CSF. Rising titers
		of this marker were associated with relapse of fungal infection.

		(CGD) patients. We present a rare case of invasive mycosis in a CGD boy. An
		"11-year-old preadolescent boy presented with fever, hypoxia, and dyspnea."
		Physical examination revealed left neck enlarged lymph nodes with healed scars.
		The chest revealed bilateral diminished air entry with bilateral coarse crackles.
		"Peripheral blood leukocyte count was 28.260/μL with 84% neutrophil, 11%"
		"lymphocyte, and 4.4% monocyte. The patient's condition deteriorated regardless of"
		the empirical antibacterial against MRSA and suspected tuberculosis. A sputum
		"sample was submitted for mycological investigation, and budding yeasts with"
		pseudohyphae were detected in the direct smear and were isolated in pure culture
		using Sabouraud agar. Candida tropicalis was identified from cultural and
		microscopic features and confirmed by the Vitek 2 automated system. This result
		"confirmed the invasive mycosis, obviously due to the underlying primary"
		"immunodeficiency, chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). Amphotericin was added,"
		and he also received IV methylprednisolone for seven days. The patient improved
		"and was weaned off oxygen with no fever. However, the patient was referred to a"
		"higher center for further workup, which confirmed CGD's diagnosis. He is on the"
		list for HLA-identical bone marrow transplantation (BMT).

PG	-	49-52
AB	-	The presence of Candida species in the urine is frequent among hospitalized
		patients. We studied sample urine of 205 hospitalized patients during a 1-year
		period to determine the incidence of nosocomial candiduria. The yeasts were
		isolated in 22% (45/205) urine cultures and risk factors in these patients were
		analyzed. Candida albicans was isolated in 35.6% and C. tropicalis (22%) was the
		second most frequent species isolated. Most patients were women (57.8%) with a
		mean age of 48.7 years. The principal risk factors that were observed in patients
		"with candiduria included antibiotics therapy (100%), urinary catheterization"
		"(84.4%), surgical procedure (66.7%), female sex and extended hospitalization. The"
		efficacy of fluconazole therapy to eradicate Candida from urine was demonstrated
		"(p =0.05). Of the 23 individuals who received antifungal therapy, candiduria"
		"persisted in 9 (39.2%) and of 22 patients who received no antifungal therapy, the"
		candiduria persisted in 15 (68.2%).

PG	-	554-565
LID	-	10.3290/j.qi.a44630 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To assess the relationship between the development of denture-related
		"stomatitis (DRS) and the identification of commonly isolated yeast species, and"
		to evaluate various predisposing factors in Saudi participants wearing new
		removable dental prostheses. METHOD AND MATERIALS: A total of 75 edentulous male
		"participants were recruited, and 64 patients finished the present case-series."
		All participants received new conventional complete dentures. Colonization of
		"Candida species was assessed, and species were identified by means of the VITEK 2"
		(bioMérieux) laboratory components. RESULTS: The most prevalent type of Candida
		"at baseline was C albicans, followed by non-C albicans species (C glabrata)."
		Counts of Candida species significantly increased from the day of insertion to
		"the first month (P < . 05), but there were no significant changes between the"
		"first and second month (P > . 05). On the day of insertion, C tropicalis, C"
		"dubliniensis, and C krusei were extracted from few subjects only, with no"
		significant changes over the first and second month (P > .05). Patients revealing
		habits of sleeping with their dentures were found to frequently suffer from DRS;
		"development of the latter was rapid, and mixed Candida biofilms (with high CFU/mL"
		"counts), along with inadequate oral and denture hygiene, turned out to be"
		contributing factors (P < .05). CONCLUSION: DRS can develop faster than
		"previously reported, even with new dentures; continued denture wearing and poor"
		cleaning of dentures revealed a considerable impact on DRS onset. In the present
		"cohort, C albicans was the most identified kind of yeast, and was followed by C"
		glabrata infection in cases with DRS.

TI	-	Risk factors and clinical outcomes of breakthrough yeast bloodstream infections
		in patients with hematological malignancies in the era of newer antifungal
		agents.
PG	-	197-206
LID	-	10.1093/mmy/myx038 [doi]
AB	-	Although yeast bloodstream infections (BSIs) are increasingly being reported in
		"patients with hematological malignancies undergoing antifungal therapy, clinical"
		information regarding breakthrough infections is scarce. The aim of this study
		was to determine the risk factors for and clinical outcomes of breakthrough yeast
		BSIs in patients with hematological malignancies in the era of newer antifungal
		"agents. Between 2011 and 2014, all consecutive patients with hematological"
		malignancies who developed yeast BSIs were included in a case-control study
		wherein breakthrough infections (cases) and de novo infections (controls) were
		"compared. Of 49 patients with yeast BSIs, 21 (43%) met the criteria for"
		breakthrough infections. The proportions of Candida krusei and Candida tropicalis
		"in the cases and controls were significantly different (32% [7/22] vs. 3% [1/29],"
		"P = .015; 5% [1/22] vs. 38% [11/29], P = .007, respectively). Acute leukemia,"
		presence of a central venous catheter and neutropenia in the 3 days prior to BSI
		were significant risk factors for breakthrough infections. Six-week mortality
		rates was 33% [7/21] in the cases and 43% [12/28] in the controls (P = .564).
		Refractory neutropenia and the Pitt bacteremia score were independent predictors
		"of 6-week mortality. In conclusion, breakthrough infections accounted for a"
		significant proportion of yeast BSIs in patients with hematological malignancies.
		"However, these infections did not increase the risk of death by themselves. Our"
		"results suggest that current clinical management of breakthrough yeast BSIs,"
		which includes switching to a different antifungal class and prompt catheter
		removal is reasonable.

LID	-	10.1159/000363566 [doi]
AB	-	Lower gastrointestinal tract infections caused by Candida species are rarely
		"reported, and Candida albicans is the only pathogen that has been identified. The"
		author reports a first case of colonic candidiasis caused by Candida tropicalis
		"in a 55-year-old female with diabetes mellitus type 2, diffuse large B-cell"
		lymphoma and neutropenia induced by chemotherapy. Diarrhea and fever were the
		presenting symptoms. Diagnosis was made based on deep tissue involvement on
		colonoscopy with biopsy and positive hemoculture. This alerted the physician to
		be aware of Candida non-albicans as a cause of colonic infection. Fungal culture
		"should always be done to identify specific Candida species, leading to"
		appropriate antifungal therapy. A review of the literature on colonic candidiasis
		is also presented here.

TI	-	Comparison of Candida ID medium with sabouraud-chloramphenicol agar for the
		isolation of yeasts from clinical haematology surveillance specimens.
PG	-	221-224
LID	-	10.1099/0022-1317-51-3-221 [doi]
AB	-	Candida ID is a new chromogenic medium for the identification of yeasts from
		"clinical specimens. C. albicans produces blue pigmentation, whereas pink"
		"pigmentation is produced by C. tropicalis, C lusitaniae, C. guilliermondii and C."
		"kefyr; other Candida species appear white. In this study, 240 clinical samples"
		(throat swabs and stool samples) from haematology patients were inoculated on to
		"Candida ID and Sabouraud-chloramphenicol agar in parallel, yielding a total of"
		105 yeasts; the media had overall detection rates of 85.7% and 86.7%
		respectively. The sensitivity of Candida ID for identification of C. albicans by
		blue pigmentation was 52.9% at 24 h and 94.1% at 48 h. Specificity of the blue
		"pigmentation was 100% at 48 h. Two strains of C. tropicalis were identified, one"
		"produced pink pigmentation at 72 h, the other strain did not produce any"
		pigmentation after 5 days. Candida ID was superior in detecting mixtures of
		yeasts compared with Sabouraud-chloramphenicol agar. Candida ID is a suitable
		"primary isolation medium for yeasts from clinical specimens, providing rapid"
		direct identification of C. albicans and enhanced detection of mixtures.

TI	-	Betel quid-associated oral lesions and oral Candida species in a female Cambodian
		cohort.
PG	-	468-72
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Betel quid chewing (BQC) is still prevalent among elderly Cambodian
		women and is associated with a wide variety of oral mucosal lesions. BQC has also
		been associated with a reduced rate of dental caries and changes in the oral
		microbiological flora. METHODS: Since no studies were available on the impact of
		"BQC on the oral carriage of Candida species, in this study oral swabs"
		"(Fungiquick, Hain Diagnostika, Germany) were taken from the tongue and palate of"
		48 Cambodian women with BQC habit (study group) and 13 control subjects without
		BQC habit (control group) to determine the spectrum of Candida species in these
		"two groups. In addition, we investigated lesions of the oral mucosa likely to be"
		associated with BQC habit in both study and control groups. RESULTS: The median
		duration of BQC was 10 years (range 10 months-30 years). The following oral
		"lesions were found in the study group: betel chewer's mucosa (85.4%), oral"
		"leukoplakia (8.3%), leukoedema (37.5%) and oral lichen planus (4.2%). Oral"
		candidiasis was seen neither in BQ-chewers nor in controls. Candida spp. were
		found in 70.8% of the cases (controls 69.2%). Whilst C. albicans was isolated
		"from 27.1% of the study cohort, C. tropicalis was the second most common isolate."
		One control case was colonised by C. dubliniensis--the first report of this
		organism from a Cambodian population. There was no significant difference in the
		candidal carriage rate or the Candida species isolated between the study and the
		control group. CONCLUSIONS: Mycological findings from the present study do not
		indicate that BQC has a significant effect on oral colonisation by Candida
		species.

		fibrosis patients and healthy individuals. METHODS:   The study comprised 30
		clinically-diagnosed and -staged oral submucous fibrosis patients aged
		"20-40 years, and 20 age- and sex-matched controls. Buccal mucosa was sampled by"
		sterile swab technique. Each sample was inoculated on Sabouraud's dextrose agar
		and CHROMagar culture media. Candida species identification was done using the
		KB006 Candida identification kit. RESULTS:   Eleven (36.67%) cases in the study
		"group, and two (10%) cases in the control group, yielded Candida on culture. The"
		value of CFU/mL increased with an increased duration of betel quid chewing habit.
		All Candida-positive oral submucous fibrosis patients complained of a burning
		sensation. Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis were the most common species
		in the oral submucous fibrosis cases. Candida dubliniensis was isolated in both
		the study and control groups. CONCLUSIONS:   Our observations in this study
		affirm that oral submucous fibrosis favors the colonization of Candida. Mucosal
		"alterations due to the underlying disease process or betel quid chewing, coupled"
		"with other factors, might lead to candidal colonization, even in the absence of"
		clinically-related mycotic manifestations.

TI	-	Candiduria in critically ill patients admitted to intensive care medical units.
PG	-	1069-76
AB	-	BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of
		candiduria in critically ill patients admitted to intensive care medical units
		"(ICUs), to identify risk factors for candiduria and to assess the frequency"
		distribution of different Candidaspp. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This was a
		"prospective cohort observational and multicenter study. A total of 1,765 patients"
		older than 18 years of age who were admitted for at least 7 days to 73
		medical-surgical ICUs of 70 Spanish hospitals were included in the study. Urine
		"cultures were performed once a week. RESULTS: In 389 patients (22%), Candidaspp."
		"in one or more urine samples were isolated. In the multivariate analysis,"
		"independent risk factors for candiduria included: age >65 years, female sex,"
		"length of hospital stay before ICU admission, diabetes mellitus, total parenteral"
		"nutrition, mechanical ventilation and previous use of antimicrobials. Candida"
		"albicanswas recovered in 266 cases (68.4%), followed by C. glabrata(32 cases,"
		"8.2%) and C. tropicalis(14 cases, 36%). Previous use of antifungal agents was the"
		"only risk factor for the selection of Candidanon-albicans candiduria (OR 2.64,"
		"95% CI 1.35-5.14, P=0.004). In-hospital mortality was 48.8% in patients with"
		candiduria compared to 36.6% in those without candiduria ( P<0.001). Significant
		"differences were also found for ICU mortality (38.% vs. 28.1%, P<0.001)."
		CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-two percent of critically ill patients admitted for more than
		7 days in the ICU developed candiduria. C. albicanswas the most frequent

TI	-	Amphotericin B or ketoconazole therapy of fungal infections in neutropenic cancer
		patients.
PG	-	5-Nov
AB	-	Fungal infections in neutropenic cancer patients have increased in frequency and
		constitute an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Empiric antifungal
		therapy is often administered to those patients who have failed to respond to
		"antibacterial antibiotics. We conducted a prospective, randomized trial of"
		amphotericin B and ketoconazole for 172 neutropenic cancer patients with presumed
		"or proven fungal infections. Overall, amphotericin B and ketoconazole were"
		equally effective. Amphotericin B may have been more effective than ketoconazole
		"for the treatment of pneumonia. Also, five of eight Candida tropicalis infections"
		"treated with amphotericin B responded, whereas all eight infections treated with"
		ketoconazole failed to respond (P = 0.03). Response rates for localized fungal
		infections were similar with both drugs. Ketoconazole should not be used as
		empiric antifungal therapy at institutions where there is a high frequency of
		infections caused by Aspergillus spp. or C. tropicalis because this agent lacks
		activity in vitro against these species.

TI	-	Changes in the spectrum of fungal isolates: results from clinical specimens
		gathered in 1987/88 compared with those in 1991/92 in the University Hospital
		"Göttingen, Germany."
PG	-	247-53
AB	-	"In the University Hospital in Göttingen, the spectra of fungal species in"
		"clinical specimens of respiratory secretions, bronchial secretions and urine were"
		compared over periods of 15 months (10/87 to 12/88 and 1/91 to 3/92) before and
		after the introduction of fluconazole. The following changes could be
		demonstrated: 1. In all specimens analysed the number of Candida albicans
		"isolates decreased, while the number of Candida tropicalis isolates remained"
		almost unchanged. 2. During the observation period the number of Candida glabrata
		isolates doubled. In 1991 C. glabrata was second to C. albicans as the most
		"common of all fungal isolates, appearing in 8.6% of all specimens. 3. The total"
		"number of Candida krusei isolates increased only slightly, but the rise in the"
		number of isolates in bronchial secretions was statistically significant. 4. The
		"prevalence of rarely isolated Candida yeasts, such as Candida guilliermondii,"
		"Candida lipolytica and Candida kefyr, and Candida isolates which were not further"
		differentiated increased. 5. During the observation period the number of mixed
		cultures showed a fourfold increase. C. glabrata and C. krusei were associated in
		more than 75% of all isolates with C. albicans or C. tropicalis respectively. 6.
		The number of mould isolates increased. These changes in the spectra of fungal
		isolates are discussed with respect to the broad therapeutic and prophylactic
		usage of fluconazole in the University Hospital of Göttingen.

PG	-	89-98
LID	-	10.1007/5584_2016_196 [doi]
AB	-	Biofilm forming capacity of yeasts colonizing the intravenous devices is
		considered a key factor involved in the pathogenesis of Candida catheter-related
		bloodstream infections (CCRBSI). The biofilm production of strains of Candida
		spp. isolated both from the CVC and from the blood of patients with CCRBSI was
		"compared to that of strains isolated from patients not having CCRBSI. Results,"
		"expressed in terms of Biofilm Index (BI), revealed that biofilm-producing strains"
		were isolated in the CCRBSI group with a frequency significantly higher than in
		"the non-CCRBSI group (χ(2) = 4.25, p = 0.03). The species more frequently"
		"cultured was C. parapsilosis complex (including C. parapsilosis sensu stricto, C."
		orthopsilosis and C. metapsilosis). When this species was isolated from the CVC
		tip cultures of the CCRBSI group it showed BIs significantly (p = 0.05) higher
		than those found in the non-CCRBSI group. All the strains of C. tropicalis
		isolated from the CCRBSI group produced biofilm. Instead most of the isolates of
		C. glabrata were non-producers. The cumulative BI of non-albicans Candida strains
		isolated from CCRBSI patients was significantly higher than that of non-albicans
		strains cultured from patients non-CCRBSI (χ(2) = 6.91; p = 0.008). C. albicans
		was a biofilm producer both in the CCRBSI and in the non-CCRBSI group. When
		isolated from the blood it showed enhanced biofilm production in the CCRBSI group
		"only, while when colonizing the CVC it displayed high BIs both in the CCRBSI"
		group and in non-CCRBSI group. Our data seem to indicate that the biofilm
		production capacity should be considered in the clinical management of CCRBSI.

		(2.9% of all bloodstream isolates). The incidence of candidemia was stable over a
		10-year period. C. albicans remained the predominant Candida species recovered
		"(66%), followed by C. glabrata (15%). Candida tropicalis emerged (9%), the"
		"incidence of Candida parapsilosis decreased (1%), and recovery of C. krusei"
		remained rare (2%). Fluconazole consumption increased significantly (P<.001).
		"Despite increasing high-risk activities, the incidence of candidemia remained"

TI	-	Candida krusei fungemia. Report of 4 cases and review of the literature.
PG	-	143-50
AB	-	Candida krusei has recently been increasingly recognized as a pathogen in
		immunocompromised patients with malignancies. We report four immunocompromised
		patients with C. krusei fungemia and review the literature. Including our 4
		"cases, 62 cases of C. krusei fungemia were identified in the literature. Detailed"
		information was available for only 25 patients. The clinical features of patients
		with C. krusei fungemia are similar to those reported for Candida tropicalis.
		Most patients were neutropenic and more than one half of the patients had
		received antifungal therapy and had evidence of gastrointestinal mucosal
		breakdown before the development of C. krusei fungemia. The overall mortality was

AB	-	RATIONALE: Bacterial and fungal infections in Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19)
		patients have been inadequately investigated and reported thus far. The safety
		profile of tocilizumab (TCZ) administration in candidemia patient still
		debatable. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 54 year-old woman presenting with weakness on the
		"left side of her body was diagnosed with COVID-19. After 7 days of admission, her"
		condition worsened and developed respiratory distress and was having respiratory
		distress despite standard treatment. DIAGNOSES: Acute respiratory distress
		"syndrome (ARDS) in COVID 19 was diagnoses based on real time-PCR swab,"
		deterioration of PaO2/FiO2 and increased of acute phase reactants. INTERVENTIONS:
		Anti Interleukin-6 (IL-6) was considered to tackle her inflammatory condition.
		"Prior to TCZ administration, blood culture was performed and the result came with"
		Candida tropicalis in the absence of bacterial growth. OUTCOMES: No major
		complications associated with intravenous antifungal or TCZ occurred. After
		"40 days of hospitalization, the patient's clinical condition improved and was"
		finally discharged. LESSONS: This case underscores the safety profile of giving
		TCZ in candidemia as a secondary infection in severe COVID-19 patient.

TI	-	Oral itraconazole in treatment of candidemia in a pediatric intensive care unit.
PG	-	973-7
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To examine efficacy of itraconazole in the treatment of candidemia in
		critically ill children. METHODS: We studied retrospectively cases of candidemia
		seen consecutively in our Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) over three and
		"half years. Candida isolates from those patients included. Candida albicans--19,"
		"C. tropicalis--31, C. guillermondii--9, C.krusei--4 and C. glabrata--1. RESULTS:"
		"Of the 64 patients, 48 (75%) had symptoms suggestive of septicemia and 16 had no"
		symptoms suggestive of septicemia. No antifungal therapy was given to
		asymptomatic patients; they recovered from candidemia without development of any
		sequelae. Of the 48 symptomatic patients 11 died before results of fungal culture
		became available and antifungal therapy could be started. Thirty seven patients
		were treated with itraconazole (10 mg/kg/day orally or through gastric tube).
		"Seven (18.9 %) of 37 patients died, 3 within first week of antifungal therapy."
		Thirty (81%) patients recovered; microbiological cure was noted on average by day
		14 (range 4-30 days). The mean +/- SD duration of therapy in patients who
		responded was 24 +/-7 days (range 21-42 days). None had any major side effect.
		CONCLUSION: We conclude that oral itraconazole may be effective in treatment of
		candidemia in children in a PICU where non-C. albicans candida species
		constituted majority (70%) of all Candida isolates.

TI	-	Hematogenous infections due to Candida parapsilosis: changing trends in fungemic
		patients at a comprehensive cancer center during the last four decades.
PG	-	6-Nov
AB	-	This study was performed to evaluate trends in species distribution in patients'
		with hematogenous candidiasis at a comprehensive cancer center. The results of a
		"retrospective analysis from January 1, 1993 to December 31, 1998 were compared"
		with prior reports from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in the last forty
		"years. In 570 total episodes since 1974, 43.9% were due to Candida albicans."
		"During 1990's, C. parapsilosis emerged as the most frequent yeast species in the"
		non-C. albicans group (36.1% during 1993-1998 from 20.9% 1974-1982; p < 0.01). An
		increase in C. krusei from 5.9% (1974-1982) to 10.5% during the recent six years
		(1993-1998) was also noticed. The proportion of C. tropicalis among non-albicans
		"fungemia during 1974-1982 was 42.8%, whereas in 1993 to 1998 a marked decline in"
		"C. tropicalis hematogenous infection was observed (27.8%; p < 0.01). During 1998,"
		the incidence of candidemia declined from 7.1% (1972-1973) and 6.5% (1982) to
		"3.4% (p < 0.01), and improved survival among fungemic patients (33% mortality in"
		1998; 77.3% during 1974-1982; p < 0.001) was encouraging. The increase in C.
		parapsilosis bloodstream invasion during 1990's was associated with a significant
		reduction in the endogenous non-albicans Candida tropicalis infection that
		"probably resulted in part due to the common prophylaxis, and/or preemptive"
		fluconazole given routinely in high-risk patients undergoing treatment for
		cancer. The widespread use of extraneous implantable and/or semi-implantable
		indwelling intra-vascular devices may also have played an important role in
		promoting (exogenous) C. parapsilosis infection. This study emphasizes the
		"importance of periodic evaluation of candidemia, especially at centers caring for"
		patients at risk.

TI	-	Secular trends in nosocomial candidaemia in non-neutropenic patients in an
		Italian tertiary hospital.
PG	-	908-13
AB	-	A retrospective study was performed in an Italian tertiary hospital to evaluate
		"trends in candidaemia between 1992 and 2001, and to compare the characteristics"
		"of episodes of fungaemia between 1992--1997 and 1998--2001. In total, 370"
		"episodes of candidaemia were identified, with an average incidence of 0.99"
		episodes/10 000 patient-days/year (range 0.49--1.29 episodes). On an annual trend
		"basis, the overall incidence was essentially stable in surgical and medical"
		"wards, but decreased in intensive care units (ICUs) (p 0.0065). The average use"
		"of fluconazole was 37.9 g/10 000 patient-days/year (range 21.4--56.1 g), and did"
		not change significantly during the 10-year period. Nearly two-thirds of patients
		"were in ICUs at the onset of candidaemia, but none was neutropenic in either"
		study period. Candida albicans remained the predominant species isolated (53.8%
		"vs. 48.1%), followed by Candida parapsilosis, Candida glabrata and Candida"
		"tropicalis, the distribution of which did not change significantly. The 30-day"
		crude mortality rate was essentially similar (44% vs. 35%) in both study periods.
		"Thus the incidence of nosocomial candidaemia, although high in this institution,"
		decreased among critically-ill patients during the 10-year period. This finding
		"seemed to be related to an improvement in infection control practices,"
		particularly regarding the prevention of intravascular catheter-related
		"infections in ICUs. Although the overall use of fluconazole was considerable, no"
		increase in azole-resistant non-albicans Candida spp. was detected.

AB	-	The incidence of Candida bloodstream infection has increased over the past years.
		"In the Center-West region of Brazil, data on candidemia are scarce. This paper"
		reports a retrospective analysis of 96 cases of Candida bloodstream infection at
		"a Brazilian tertiary-care teaching hospital in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul,"
		"from January 1998 to December 2006. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data"
		were collected from medical records and from the hospital's laboratory database.
		"Patients' ages ranged from three days to 92 years, with 53 (55.2%) adults and 43"
		"(44.8%) children. Of the latter, 25 (58.1%) were newborns. The risk conditions"
		"most often found were: long period of hospitalization, utilization of venous"
		"central catheter, and previous use of antibiotics. Fifty-eight (60.4%) patients"
		died during the hospitalization period and eight (13.7%) of them died 30 days
		after the diagnosis of candidemia. Candida albicans (45.8%) was the most
		"prevalent species, followed by C. parapsilosis (34.4%), C. tropicalis (14.6%) and"
		C. glabrata (5.2%). This is the first report of Candida bloodstream infection in
		the state of Mato Grosso do Sul and it highlights the importance of considering
		the possibility of invasive Candida infection in patients exposed to risk
		"factors, particularly among neonates and the elderly."

PG	-	20-Nov
AB	-	A prospective study of the clinical and epidemiological aspects of Candida spp.
		"sepsis was performed to assess the frequency, etiology, and risk factors in the"
		"neonatology service of the Pediatrics Hospital ""Dr. Elías Toro"" (2002-2003)."
		"Forty four out of 128 neonatal intensive care patients, with clinical sepsis and"
		"suspected fungal etiology, were chosen randomly for this study. Infant blood,"
		"urine, gastrointestinal tract, oral and skin samples were cultured. Samples were"
		also taken from health care worker hands and the environment. The antifungal
		susceptibility patterns of the isolates were evaluated. The prevalence of Candida
		"spp. from the clinical samples was: C. albicans (72.06%), C. parapsilosis"
		"(13.24%), C. tropicalis (10.29 %), C. guilliermondii (2.94%), and C. glabrata"
		(1.47%). Due to the similarity of the susceptibility pattern of some isolates
		"from infants and health care workers, we speculate a horizontal nosocomial"
		infection. Statistical analysis revealed the following significant risk factors
		"associated with Candida spp. isolation: prolonged hospitalization (p < 0.05),"

TI	-	Risk factors for Candida infections in a neonatal intensive care unit in Costa
		Rica.
PG	-	90-5
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To identify potential risk factors associated with Candida infections
		and compare these risk factors between patients who both died and survived. STUDY
		DESIGN: A group of patients with positive Candida spp. blood cultures admitted to
		a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in Costa Rica between January 1994 and
		December 1998. Cases were identified through a computerized search of the
		microbiology laboratory's database on blood cultures. RESULTS: One hundred and
		ten newborns were identified. Sixty-six patients (60%) were male; 46 (62%) were
		preterm infants. Thirty-seven (34%) patients died. Twenty (54%) of them died
		within three days of the candidemia diagnosis and 17 had disseminated Candida
		infection on autopsy. Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis were isolated in
		"90% and 10% of blood cultures, respectively. Mean +/- SD (range) number of days"
		from admission to NICU to the initial positive blood culture were 13.5 +/- 8.5
		(1-30) days. Most patients had at least two positive blood cultures (range 1-8).
		Median (range) days for the sterilization of blood culture were four (1-25) days.
		Significant differences in survival were identified in patients with
		"axillary-inguinal lesions, apnea and seizures. CONCLUSIONS: Invasive fungal"
		infections are frequent in NICU. Future case-control prospective studies should
		be carried out to confirm the findings from this report.

TI	-	High-dose liposomal amphotericin B in the therapy of systemic candidiasis in
		neonates.
PG	-	603-7
AB	-	High-dose (5-7 mg/kg/day) liposomal amphotericin B was evaluated prospectively
		during the period 1995-2001 in 41 episodes of systemic candidiasis occurring in
		37 neonates (36 of the 37 were premature infants with very low birth weights).
		Median age at the onset of systemic candidiasis was 17 days. Candida spp. were
		"isolated from blood in all patients and from urine, skin abscesses and peritoneal"
		"fluid in 6, 5 and 1 neonates, respectively. Candidiasis was due to Candida"
		"parapsilosis in 17 cases, Candida albicans in 15 cases, Candida tropicalis in 5"
		"cases, Candida guilliermondii in 2 cases, Candida glabrata in 2 cases and an"
		"unidentified Candida sp. in 1 case. Twenty-eight, five and eight infants received"
		"7, 6-6.5 and 5 mg/kg/day, respectively. Median duration of therapy was 18 days;"
		median cumulative dose was 94 mg/kg. Fungal eradication was achieved in 39 of 41
		(95%) episodes; median duration of therapy until fungal eradication was 8.7+/-4.5
		days. Fungal eradication was achieved after 10.9+/-4.8 days in patients who had
		received previous antifungal therapy compared to 8.2+/-4.3 days in those treated
		with liposomal amphotericin B as first-line therapy. One patient died due to
		systemic candidiasis on day 12 of therapy. High-dose liposomal amphotericin B was
		effective and safe in the treatment of neonatal candidiasis. Fungal eradication
		was more rapid in patients treated early with high doses and in patients who
		received high-dose liposomal amphotericin B as first-line therapy.

		intrathecal and intravenous amphotericin B: A case report.
PG	-	e27205
LID	-	10.1097/MD.0000000000027205 [doi]
LID	-	e27205
AB	-	"RATIONALE: Studies on Candida infections in the central nervous system,"
		especially in infants and young children that did or did not have postoperative
		"surgery, are rarely reported. Thus far, intrathecal (i.t.) amphotericin B (AmB)"
		is not routinely recommended as a therapy for Candida meningitis. We report the
		first case of Candida meningitis in an infant who underwent abdominal surgery and
		was successfully treated with i.t. and intravenous (i.v.) AmB in the mainland of
		China. PATIENT CONCERNS: Candida meningitis was confirmed by culture and
		immunoserological tests in a 1-day-old girl after surgery. She was treated with
		"fluconazole for 1 month, but the patient's symptoms showed no improvement."
		"DIAGNOSES: After surgery, the infant started having recurrent attacks of fever,"
		and laboratory tests of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed antigens of
		Candida tropicalis. CSF tests revealed a high total protein level and a low
		glucose level. She was diagnosed with a secondary Candida meningitis.
		"INTERVENTIONS: After azole therapy failure, intrathecal and intravenous AmB"
		therapy were used as rescue therapies. OUTCOMES: After nearly 2 months of AmB
		"treatment, all repeat CSF cultures were negative, the infant was deemed stable"
		"and was discharged home, and she continued taking voriconazole orally as an"
		outpatient. LESSONS: The combination of i.t. and i.v. administration of AmB can
		provide a safe and effective alternative to managing this rare but severe
		disease.

TI	-	Candida tropicalis fungaemia in adult patients with haematological malignancies:
		clinical features and risk factors.
PG	-	316-9
AB	-	Candida tropicalis fungaemia is a serious opportunistic infection. Eighteen
		consecutive patients with C. tropicalis fungaemia diagnosed within a five-year
		period were studied retrospectively. All patients had haematological malignancies
		treated by chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Antifungal
		"prophylaxis included nystatin (20 mg daily) for patients receiving chemotherapy,"
		and fluconazole (200 mg daily) for patients undergoing BMT. Sixteen patients had
		refractory and advanced haematological malignancies. All patients were
		"neutropenic, had central venous catheters, and were receiving treatment with"
		broad-spectrum antibiotics at the time of fungaemia. Septic shock with skin
		"emboli were the most common presenting features. In seven cases, fungaemia was"
		preceded by a positive culture of C. tropicalis in the urine. Concomitant
		"bacteraemia was found in 11 cases, of which six cases were due to Staphylococcus"
		aureus. The overall mortality rate was 56%. The predominance of
		chemotherapy-treated patients developing fungaemia in this series might be
		attributable to the omission of fluconazole prophylaxis. The clinicopathologic
		features and risk factors identified in this study may help design better
		treatment strategies for this often-lethal complication.

		ill patients.
PG	-	47-53
AB	-	This study was carried out to evaluate the utility of serological tests in the
		diagnosis of candidal infections in non-neutropenic critically ill patients. A
		prospective study was carried out in a 10-bed general intensive care unit; all
		patients with at least one organic sample with Candida spp. were included. A
		"therapeutic-diagnostic algorithm was designed, and patients were treated or not,"
		"according to a classification. Blood samples were taken, and serological tests"
		included: antigenaemia detection using two different commercial latex kits
		(Cand-Tec and Pastorex) and antibody detection by indirect haemagglutination
		(IHA) and indirect germ tube immunofluorescence (IFA). A total of 56% of antibody
		tests (IHA 45% and IFA 64%) and 26% of antigen tests (Cand-Tec 36% and Pastorex
		17%) were positive. The sensitivity and specificity of these tests with respect
		"to systemic candidosis were 37% and 78%, respectively, for antibodies, and 0% and"
		90% for antigens. There was statistical significance for mortality and low levels
		of antibodies; Candida glabrata was detected by IFA and Candida tropicalis by
		Cand-Tec. Serological tests may help to define the prognosis of these patients
		and to support the detection of specific Candida species.

PG	-	54-57
LID	-	10.18502/cmm.5.4.2150 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Fungal renal abscesses are rare entities associated with
		"significant morbidity and mortality. Affected kidneys can have microabscess,"
		"pyelonephritis, pyonephrosis, or papillary necrosis. CASE REPORT: Herein, we"
		reported an unusual case of a large renal abscess cause by Candida tropicalis in
		a diabetic patient. The entity presented as a lump in the abdomen and later was
		diagnosed to be an abscess on computed tomography scan. Candida tropicalis was
		confirmed on the culture of the aspirate. The abscess was successfully treated by
		percutaneous drainage and administration of amphotericin B deoxycholate.
		CONCLUSION: Candida tropicalis is now a global concern because of its rising
		prevalence and high virulence. The growing resistance of this Candida species to
		"azoles, as in our case, calls for a more judicious usage of antifungal agents."
		Empirical therapy with either amphotericin or echinocandins is an option in case
		of high azole resistance. This case highlights the importance of timely diagnosis
		and implementation of aggressive management in cases suffering from fungal
		abscesses.

AB	-	Severe pneumonia due to Candida tropicalis infection mainly occurs in
		immunosuppressed patients or those currently receiving broad-spectrum
		"antibiotics. Herein, we report a case of severe pneumonia caused due to C"
		tropicalis in an elderly patient. A 72-year-old man with a previous history of
		"hypertension, ischemic stroke, and facial paralysis sequelae treated with the"
		"botulinic toxin, was admitted to the hospital for dyspnea. Severe acute"
		respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) infection was negative. Computed
		tomography of the chest revealed bilateral consolidation with left predominance.
		"A bronchoalveolar lavage sample was sent to molecular biology, but no"
		"microorganisms were detected using a FilmArray respiratory panel. However,"
		"mamanocandidas test for candida was 166 pg/mL (positive), and fungal structures"
		were identified by the MALDI-TOF Biotyper mass spectrometry and attributed to C
		tropicalis. Antifungal therapy was started using caspofungin 75 mg as the initial
		"dose followed by 50 mg daily. After 10 days of treatment, ventilatory weaning was"
		"achieved. By day 14, the patient was decannulated from the tracheostomy. Oral"
		"antifungal treatment with voriconazole was continued, and he was discharged from"
		intensive care in good clinical condition. Severe pneumonia due to C tropicalis
		"might occur in specific cases, especially in those patients with risk factors,"
		and must thus be considered when approaching such cases.

		child presented with respiratory distress. Chest X-ray showed massive pleural
		"effusion, thoracocentesis showed it as purulent exudate and she was empirically"
		treated with antibiotics. C. tropicalis and C. krusei were isolated from the pus
		sample proving to be fungal empyema. Inspite of antifungal agents and mechanical
		"ventilation, her general condition rapidly deteriorated and she succumbed."

PG	-	295-7
LID	-	10.1097/ICB.0000000000000194 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: To describe the case of a patient with Candida tropicalis
		endophthalmitis who presented with a pattern of segmentally distributed
		preretinal infiltrates overlying the retinal blood vessels. METHODS: A
		retrospective chart review was performed. A 72-year-old East Indian male
		"presented with redness, pain, photosensitivity, and loss of vision in the right"
		eye for 1 month. He had been recently hospitalized for necrotizing pancreatitis
		and had been receiving intravenous medications as well as parenteral nutrition
		through a peripherally inserted central catheter. RESULTS: Fundus examination
		"revealed moderate vitreous cells and infiltrates, including a segmental pattern"
		of preretinal bead-like opacities along several blood vessels. The patient
		underwent emergent vitrectomy with injection of antibiotics and antifungal
		medications. Vitreous cultures grew C. tropicalis. The patient was treated with
		"oral antifungal medication for 6 weeks. By 7 weeks after surgery, all infiltrates"
		and inflammatory cells had completely resolved. The imaging and intraoperative
		observations suggest that the opacities behaved like infiltrates and were
		associated with vitreous rather than vascular inflammation. CONCLUSION: A
		segmental pattern of preretinal infiltrates over retinal vessels can be a
		presenting feature in endogenous fungal endophthalmitis. The observations in this
		case may contribute to understanding the pathophysiology of the findings.

AB	-	RATIONALE: Collodion baby is a rare autosomal recessive disorder. It can be the
		first expression of some forms of ichthyosis. PATIENT CONCERNS: The authors
		present the case of a newborn diagnosed with severe Collodion baby syndrome who
		required prolonged hospitalization in the intensive care unit because of
		infectious complications like the fungal sepsis and other bacterial
		superinfections. DIAGNOSES: The case has many diagnostic and therapeutic
		"particularities and management difficulties. Skin culture, dermatological and"
		genetic exam were required. INTERVENTIONS: The treatment required
		"multidisciplinary involvement: neonatologist, pediatrician, geneticist,"
		"dermatologist, psychologist, ophthalmologist, audiologist. OUTCOMES: The"
		"evolution during hospitalization was slowly favorable, but later, after a few"
		"months, it developed some complications. LESSONS: In our case, skin injuries,"
		"total parenteral nutrition, aggressive and prolonged antibiotic therapy,"
		"intravenous devices, high hospitalization duration were risk factors for"
		"colonization and sepsis with fungi, especially in the neonatal period, sometimes"
		with severe evolution and prognosis.

PG	-	23-30
AB	-	"This study, included in the prospective survey of candidaemia in Europe supported"
		"by the European Confederation of Medical Mycology, presents the epidemiological"
		and antifungal susceptibility results of 290 cases of candidaemia (80 in children
		<15 years old) reported from September 1997 to August 1999 by 19 Spanish
		hospitals. Presence of an intravenous catheter and previous antibiotic therapy
		were the most frequent risk factors. The percentages of the four most common
		"species isolated (adults/children) were as follows: Candida albicans (46/36.2),"
		"C. parapsilosis (21.9/50), C. tropicalis (12.8/3.75), and C. glabrata (10.1/5)."
		"As initial therapy, fluconazole was preferred in adults (54%) and liposomal"
		"amphotericin B in children (58%). The 30-day mortality rate was 40.6%, and the"
		species most frequently associated with a fatal outcome was C. krusei (60%). The
		"rates of susceptibility to antifungal agents were as follows: amphotericin B,"
		"91%; flucytosine, 99%; fluconazole, 93.6%; itraconazole, 87.4%; and voriconazole,"
		92%. These results provide baseline data for future epidemiological and
		susceptibility studies and for evaluating the impact of new antifungal agents on
		the distribution of species and the mortality rates associated with candidaemia
		in Spain.

AB	-	"AIM: To determine the clinical characteristics of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC),"
		the Candida species involved and the antifungal susceptibility of Candida species
		isolated from patients with VVC. METHODS: Candida organisms were cultured from
		samples obtained from patients who presented with VVC to the Gynecology
		"Department, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital. Antifungal susceptibility"
		testing was performed using a commercial agar diffusion test. RESULTS: Of the
		"1,070 cases of VVC reported in this study, 36.5% were uncomplicated VVC, and"
		63.5% were complicated VVC. Twenty-four patients were identified as having two
		species of Candida. Candid albicans alone was isolated from 89.5% of cases (n =
		"958). Candida glabrata was isolated from 85 cases (7.9%), Candida tropicalis from"
		"10 (0.9%), Saccharomyces cerevisiae from eight (0.7%), Candida parapsilosis from"
		"six (0.6%), Candida famata from two (0.2%), and Candida krusei from one case"
		(0.1%). All isolates of Candida albicans were susceptible to nystatin. The
		resistant rate of Candida albicans to azole agents was 0-4.9%. CONCLUSION:
		Candida albicans was the predominant Candida species isolated from this series of
		patients with VVC. Resistance of vaginal Candida albicans isolates to antifungal
		agents was infrequent.

PG	-	204-6
AB	-	We report the case of a 61-year-old man with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who
		presented with a tender skin lesion on the left side of the flank of 5 weeks'
		duration after undergoing myeloablative chemotherapy. Prior treatment with
		intravenous vancomycin showed minimal response. Clinical examination revealed a
		"tender, indurated, erythematous plaque on the left side of the flank. A skin"
		biopsy demonstrated a lymphohistiocytic and neutrophilic infiltrate with deep
		dermal necrosis and fungal forms in the dermis and subcutis. A tissue culture
		"grew Candida tropicalis; however, blood cultures remained negative for yeast. A"
		diagnosis of primary cutaneous candidiasis was made based on the lack of response
		"to antibiotics, tissue evidence of C tropicalis, and negative blood cultures."
		"Although rare, primary cutaneous candidiasis should be considered in"
		immunocompromised patients presenting with cellulitis or an abscess that is
		unresponsive to treatment.

AB	-	The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical aspects of the
		epidemiology of candidemia and compare the prognostic impact of potential risk
		factors and the microbiology data of adults and children with cancer. A
		prospective cohort study enrolling 99 adults and 130 children with candidemia at
		a tertiary oncology care center in Brazil was undertaken. A total of 229 episodes
		were analyzed. The overall mortality was higher among adults than in children
		"(37.4% vs. 7.7%, respectively). Univariate analysis revealed significant"
		differences in the risk factors associated with death between both groups.
		Mortality was similar following fungemia with Candida albicans and all C.
		"non-albicans species. However, significant differences in the interspecies"
		"distribution and death rates were observed, mainly among C. glabrata, krusei, and"
		tropicalis species. Multivariate analysis showed comorbidities and neutropenia to
		"be independently associated with mortality in adults, while in children, only"
		comorbidities negatively affected the outcome. Comorbidities were the most
		important independent prognostic factor in both groups. The inclusion of detailed
		information about pre-existent illnesses might have a real benefit in studies of
		candidemia outcome.

PG	-	448-50
LID	-	10.4103/0972-2327.144036 [doi]
AB	-	Fungi are a relatively uncommon cause of brain abscess in neonates and early
		"infancy. They are usually associated with predisposing factors like prematurity,"
		"low birth weight, use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and prolonged stay in the"
		intensive care unit. Candida tropicalis (C. tropicalis) is rapidly emerging as a
		nosocomial threat in the neonatal intensive care settings. This case report
		describes a neonate with C. tropicalis brain abscess who was diagnosed early and
		managed aggressively with a favorable outcome. Inadvertent use of intravenous
		antibiotics can have serious complications such as invasive fungal infection.
		Correct microbiological diagnosis is the key to successful treatment of
		deep-seated pyogenic infection. Fungal etiology should always be studied in
		relevant clinical settings.

TI	-	Characterization of Candida species isolated from cases of lower respiratory
		tract infection.
PG	-	290-4
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: (1) To identify and characterize the Candida species isolates from
		lower respiratory tract infection. (2) to determine the rate of isolation of
		Candida species from sputum samples. METHODS: This study was carried out in the
		"Department of Microbiology, Manipal Teaching Hospital, Pokhara, Nepal from June"
		2002 to January 2003. A total of 462 sputum samples were collected from patients
		suspected lower respiratory tract infection. The samples were processed as Gram
		"staining to find out the suitability of the specimen, cultured on Sabouraud's"
		Dextrose Agar (SDA) and also on blood agar and chocolate agar to identify the
		"potential lower respiratory tract pathogens. For the identification of Candida,"
		"sputum samples were processed for Gram stain, culture, germ tube test, production"
		"of chlamydospore, sugar fermentation and assimilation test. For the"
		"identification of bacteria, Gram stain, culture, and biochemical tests were"
		"performed by standardized procedure. RESULT: Out of 462 samples, 246 (53.24%)"
		samples grew potential pathogens of lower respiratory tract. Among them
		Haemophilus influenzae 61(24.79%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae 57 (23.17%) were
		the predominant bacterial pathogens. Candida species were isolated from 30
		samples (12.2%). The majority of Candida species amongst the Candida isolates
		were Candida albicans 21(70%) followed by Candida tropicalis 4(13.33%). Candida
		"krusei 3(10%), Candida parapsilosis 1(3.33%) and Candida stellatoidea 1(3.33%)."
		The highest rate of isolation of Candida was between the age of 71 and 80.
		CONCLUSION: Candida isolation from sputum samples is important as found in the
		present study in which Candida species were the third most common pathogen
		isolated from patients with lower respiratory tract infection.

PG	-	119-25
AB	-	AIM: To know the correlation between CD4 count and intensity of Candida
		"colonizations in the oropharynx of HIV-infected/AIDS patients, to get the"
		"prevalence of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC), and to know what kind of Candida"
		species that causes oropharynx candidiasis of HIV-infected/AIDS patients.
		METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in HIV-infected/AIDS patients who
		came as outpatients and inpatients in Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital. The patients
		"were interviewed, physically examined, their CD4 counts were checked, and their"
		mouth rinse samples were taken to be cultured. Candida species was identified in
		"CHROMagar media, and data were processed. RESULTS: From September 2004 until"
		"January 2005, 60 HIV-infected/AIDS patients were included in this study. There"
		were 86.7% males and 13.3% females. Majority of the patients were from 20-30
		years age group (85%). The most frequent transmission was among drug users (75%)
		"followed by sexual contact (18.3%). The median of CD4 counts was 100 cells/il,"
		ranged from 2 to 842 cells/il. Proportion of the OPC was 63.3% (CI 95% = 51.1 -
		"75.5). From 59 Candida isolates in this study, 74.58% were C. albicans. Candida"
		"non C. albicans species that were found in this trial were C. krusei, C."
		parapsilosis and C. tropicalis. There was significant correlation between low CD4
		counts and high intensity of Candida colonization on the oropharynx of the
		subjects (r = -0.756). CONCLUSION: There was strong negative correlation (r =
		-0.756) between CD4 count and intensity of Candida colonization in the oropharynx
		of HIV-infected/AIDS patients. Proportion of OPC in this study was 63.3%. The
		most frequent species found in the oropharynx of the subjects was C. albicans.

TI	-	Increasing fungal isolation from clinical specimens: experience in a university
		hospital over a decade.
PG	-	185-95
AB	-	The local patterns of fungal isolates were studied by a retrospective analysis of
		fungal species isolated from clinical specimens in a university hospital in
		"Jerusalem. Between 1984 and 1993, 5630 fungi [4071 patient unique isolates (PUI)]"
		"were isolated and identified. During the study decade, the annual incidence of"
		"all isolates increased 2.7-fold, and PUI increased 1.6-fold. Candida albicans"
		accounted for 61% of PUI; urine was the source of 53%. The intensive care units
		(ICUs) and the Bone Marrow Transplantation (BMT) Department had the highest
		incidence of fungal isolation. The following trends were observed: (1) a decrease
		in the relative frequency of C. albicans and increase in Candida tropicalis; (2)
		"increased number of isolates from urine, surgical wounds and intra-abdominal"
		sites; (3) increased number of isolates from ICUs and BMT. Fungi are emerging as
		"important hospital-acquired pathogens in tertiary care and teaching hospitals,"
		and are associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. It is important to
		be familiar with the local patterns of fungal isolation in order to improve
		treatment.

AB	-	Candida is the most important agent of fungal infections. Several risk factors
		have been described associated with invasive infection by fluconazole-resistant
		Candida spp. A prospective cross-sectional study with case-control analysis was
		conducted. Case group patients with fluconazole-resistant Candida isolate were
		included; control group were patients with fluconazole-susceptible Candida spp. A
		multivariate logistic regression model was performed. Three hundred isolates of
		Candida spp. were analyzed. Most frequent species were Candida albicans/Candida
		dubliniensis (48.3%) and Candida tropicalis (22.3%). Posaconazole susceptibility
		"was 93.7%; voriconazole, 84%; and fluconazole, 78.7%. Susceptibility to"
		"anidulafungin and caspofungin was 92.7% and 92.3%, respectively. Neutropenia"
		"(adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 6.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0-43.1),"
		"antifungal exposure (aOR 5.1, 95% CI 2.3-11.2), and antituberculosis therapy (aOR"
		"7.7, 95% CI 1.4-43.2) were associated to fluconazole resistance. Susceptibility"
		results are useful to guide the selection of empiric antifungal treatment and the
		design of local therapeutic guidelines. Previous antifungal exposure suggests
		"possible resistance to fluconazole, pointing towards the selection of a different"
		class of antifungal agents.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive fungal infection (IFI) is one of the most challenging
		complications in children undergoing acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)
		"treatment, but acute fungal osteomyelitis (OM) is rarely encountered. CASE"
		"PRESENTATION: Here, we describe a case of Candida tropicalis osteomyelitis in a"
		10-year-old patient with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive ALL. He was on
		"remission induction therapy at the time of neutropenia, and an abscess developed"
		in his right arm. The blood and bone cultures were positive for C. tropicalis.
		Antibiotics and antifungals were administered. Magnetic resonance imaging of the
		"arm revealed an intraosseous abscess, suggestive of OM. Surgical irrigation and"
		debridement of the bone were performed immediately. The patient was effectively
		treated with antifungal therapy and ALL treatment. He has fully recovered into
		complete clinical remission but with visible sequelae on magnetic resonance
		imaging (MRI). He took oral posaconazole for consolidation until disappearance of
		the lesion shadows on MRI and received subsequent cycles of chemotherapy in
		"parallel. CONCLUSIONS: In the successful management of Ph-positive ALL,"
		"dasatinib, a second-generation Abl-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is crucial. The"
		recommended treatment for Candida osteomyelitis in Ph-positive ALL patients is a
		fungicidal agent combined with surgery and modification chemotherapy with
		dasatinib. The use of combined modalities of treatment seems to be crucial in the
		successful management of Ph-positive ALL.

TI	-	Endophthalmitis in patients with disseminated fungal disease.
PG	-	67-70; discussion 70-1
AB	-	BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Fungal endophthalmitis caused by dissemination from
		extraocular fungal infections has been reported to vary between 9% and 45%.
		"However, recent clinical experience disagrees with that. This study is an"
		"investigation of patients in an inner city teaching hospital, the risks"
		"associated with endogenous fungal endophthalmitis, and this incidence. METHODS:"
		All ophthalmology consultations between February 1995 and August 2000 that might
		be associated with disseminated fungal infection were examined in a prospective
		manner. Patients were excluded if there was no evidence of a positive fungal
		culture from any site at any time. Visual symptoms were recorded along with
		"ophthalmologic and systemic examination features. Information was gathered,"
		"including the identity of cultured organisms, the sites from which the organisms"
		"were obtained, and the patients' disposition. RESULTS: During this interval, 170"
		"consultation requests contained the words ""endophthalmitis"" or ""retinitis"" and/or"
		indicated concern about disseminated fungal infections. Extraocular fungal
		"infections were found in 114 patients, but only 82 of them had evidence of"
		systemic dissemination. Some patients had more than one organism. The following
		"are listed in decreasing frequency of occurrence: Candida albicans, Torulopsis"
		"glabrata, Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis, Candida krusei, Aspergillus"
		"niger, and others. Only two patients had evidence of chorioretinitis and"
		progressed to fungal endophthalmitis. CONCLUSIONS: Endophthalmitis was rare among
		these patients with known fungal infections. Less than 2% had any related
		"ophthalmic manifestations. Nevertheless, since treatment can save vision,"
		evidence of intraocular infection should be sought as eagerly as before.

AB	-	Candida albicans is found frequently as a commensal organism in the
		"gastrointestinal tract. Despite this, it is rarely found in pancreatic abscesses,"
		there being only a few cases in the literature and in most of these cases the
		significance of Candida spp. as a pathogen was not initially recognized at the
		time of diagnosis. In most of the earlier reported pancreatitis associated with
		"candida, C. albicans was the commonest isolate. We report the case of a patient"
		"in whom computed tomography was used initially to diagnose a pancreatic abscess,"
		aspiration of which showed growth of Candida tropicalis and Escherichia coli on
		"culture. The patient was started on amphotericin B and imipenem, but the"
		"condition of the patient deteriorated, for which the patient underwent surgical"
		necrosectomy and continued treatment with imipenem and amphotericin B led to the
		satisfactory recovery of the patient.

		"detected from the bloodstream of 55 patients during the study period. Overall,"
		74% of cases were due to non-albicans Candida. C. tropicalis was most commonly
		"isolated (39.7%), followed by C. albicans (26.4%). All Candida isolates remain"
		"susceptible to voriconazole, whereas highest degree of resistance was observed"
		for fluconazole.

TI	-	Staged Reimplantation of a Total Hip Prosthesis After Co-infection with Candida

PG	-	579-584

AB	-	Fungal prosthetic joint infection is a rare complication in total joint
		arthroplasty. There are no established guidelines for management of these
		infections. We present a case of a 53-year-old male with a hip joint prosthesis
		co-infected with Candida tropicalis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus. A two-stage
		"exchange arthroplasty was performed. The patient underwent implant removal,"
		"debridement, irrigation with saline solution and application of cement spacer"
		impregnated with vancomycin followed by aggressive antimicrobial treatment in
		first stage. Complete eradication of infection was demonstrated by negative
		culture of sonicated cement spacer fluid and negative 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA gene
		"PCR of sonicate fluid, synovial fluid and periprosthetic tissue samples. He"
		underwent second-stage revision hip arthroplasty after 9 months of the first
		"stage. At the latest follow-up, there was no evidence of recurrence of infection."
		This case illustrates the utility of sonication of biomaterials and molecular
		techniques for microbiological confirmation of absence of infection in staged
		surgeries which is required for a successful outcome.

		from blood.
PG	-	679-82
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To analyse the in vitro antifungal susceptibility of 261 non-albicans
		Candida bloodstream strains isolated during the European Confederation of Medical
		"Mycology survey of candidaemia performed in Lombardia, Italy (September"
		"1997-December 1999). METHODS: In vitro susceptibility to flucytosine,"
		"fluconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole and voriconazole was determined using the"
		broth microdilution method described in the NCCLS M27-A guidelines. Etest strips
		were used to assess susceptibility to amphotericin B. In vitro findings were
		correlated with the patient's underlying condition and previous antifungal
		"treatment. RESULTS: MICs (mg/L) at which 90% of the strains were inhibited were,"
		"respectively, 2 for flucytosine, 8 for fluconazole, 0.5 for itraconazole, 0.25"
		for voriconazole and 0.25 for posaconazole. Amphotericin B MIC endpoints were
		<0.50 mg/L in all the isolates tested. Flucytosine resistance was detected in 19
		"isolates (7%), mainly among Candida tropicalis strains (30%). Innate or secondary"
		fluconazole resistance was detected in 13 strains (5%). Among the 13 patients
		"with fluconazole-resistant Candida bloodstream infection, three were HIV"
		"positive, including one treated with fluconazole for oral candidosis; the four"
		who were HIV negative had received the azole during the 2 weeks preceding the
		candidaemia. Cross-resistance among fluconazole and other azoles was a rare
		event. CONCLUSIONS: Resistance is still uncommon in non-albicans Candida species
		"recovered from blood cultures. However, in fungaemias caused by C. tropicalis,"
		"Candida glabrata and Candida krusei, there is a high prevalence of resistance to"
		fluconazole and flucytosine. Fluconazole resistance should be suspected in
		"patients treated previously with azoles, mainly those with advanced HIV"
		infection.

TI	-	Spinal osteomyelitis after TPN catheter-induced septicemia.
PG	-	291-5
AB	-	Osteomyelitis of the spine is a well-recognized delayed manifestation of
		septicemia but has not been recognized as a complication of total parenteral
		nutrition. We report five cases of spinal osteomyelitis that were clinically
		recognized 1 to 13 months after total parenteral nutrition catheter-induced
		septicemia. Radiographic evidence of osteomyelitis was seen in all five patients.
		"In three patients, culture of bony aspirates was positive for the same organism"
		"as from the blood. In one case, the diagnosis was established by histology, and"
		in one the diagnosis was based on radiographic and radionuclide evidence of
		"osteomyelitis. The organism responsible was Staphylococcus aureus in two cases,"
		Candida albicans in another two cases and C tropicalis in one case. The septic
		episode that preceded osteomyelitis was treated with systemic antibiotics and
		"catheter removal in four patients, and antibiotics without catheter removal in"
		"one patient. Nevertheless, osteomyelitis occurred, requiring bracing or operative"
		debridement as well as prolonged antibiotic therapy. Spinal osteomyelitis may
		occur as a delayed manifestation of total parenteral nutrition catheter-induced
		septicemia. Prompt and effective treatment of septicemia is indicated but may not
		always be sufficient. Clinical suspicion is the key to the correct and early
		diagnosis of osteomyelitis and therefore to adequate treatment.

TI	-	The spectrum of systemic candidiasis at Auckland Hospital.
PG	-	505-7
AB	-	Systemic candidiasis is uncommon. We reviewed our experience with this disease
		"from the infectious disease unit, Auckland Hospital, between 1982 and 1988,"
		because many of these patients are referred to us. We then selected 11 of them to
		"highlight particular presentations, diagnostic or management issues. We included"
		both compromised and noncompromised patients from medical and surgical services.
		"Candida albicans was the most common cause, but we also saw patients infected"
		"with C glabrata, C parapsilosis, and C tropicalis and present them to exemplify"
		their different clinical presentations. Demonstrable fungaemia is uncommon in
		"patients with systemic candidiasis, serological techniques are both insensitive"
		and nonspecific and patients are often too ill from underlying disease to allow
		for invasive diagnostic procedures. Thus diagnosis is often difficult. Parenteral
		amphotericin B with or without 5-fluorocytosine is still the main antifungal
		treatment. Triazole antifungals may change that in the future. Systemic
		candidiasis retains a high mortality: careful individualised management of
		patients may improve mortality and morbidity.

AB	-	The incidence of invasive fungal infection is increasing as the population of
		immunosuppressed patients grows. Many species that were previously thought to be
		benign are now known pathogens. The most commonly isolated organisms (>80 %)
		"include Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus fumigatus."
		"However, there are several new and emerging organisms. The Non-albicans species"
		of Candida are one of the emerging invasive fungal organisms that are beginning
		"to affect high-risk patients such as those with bone marrow transplant,"
		"neutropenia, HIV/AIDS or on immunosuppressive therapy. We present a case of a"
		"patient who suffered with angioinvasive non-Albicans Candidal infection, leading"
		to a life-threatening necrotizing cellulitis.

PG	-	767-74
AB	-	"The demographic, clinical and microbiological data of patients with candidemia at"
		"the ""Hopital Universitario La Fe"", a tertiary-care hospital in Valencia, Spain,"
		from 1995 to 1997 was analyzed retrospectively. Candida spp. were isolated in
		"blood cultures from 145 patients, 32% of whom were children (25% of these were"
		"neonates). The most common species isolated was Candida albicans, followed by"
		"Candida parapsilosis, Candida krusei and Candida tropicalis. Risk factors for"
		"candidemia included underlying disease, therapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics"
		and the presence of a central venous catheter. The majority of children were
		"treated with amphotericin B, whereas 52% of adults received fluconazole. Overall"
		"mortality was 44% (30% in children and 50% in adults), and attributable mortality"
		was 30% (24% in children and 33% in adults). Multivariate analysis indicated that
		"neutropenia, corticosteroid therapy, lack of antifungal treatment, and failure to"
		replace the central venous catheter were factors associated with
		"candidemia-related death. Among the adult population, an APACHE II score greater"
		than 15 predicted candidemia-related death.

TI	-	Fungal colonization in the very low birth weight infant.
PG	-	225-32
AB	-	"In the neonate, fungal infections result in significant morbidity and mortality."
		"For very low birth weight (less than 1,500 g) infants, we prospectively"
		determined the fungal colonization rate to be 26.7%. In one third of infants with
		"fungal colonies, mucocutaneous candidiasis developed, and in 7.7%, systemic"
		disease developed. Two thirds of the infants had colonies in the first week of
		"life. This colonization was probably acquired during labor and delivery, because"
		those infants who had colonization were more often delivered vaginally than by
		"cesarean section. Early colonization, commonly from the gastrointestinal or"
		"respiratory tract, featured Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis. Late"
		"colonization, occurring after 2 weeks of life (15.0% of patients), was more"
		likely to be cutaneous and was associated with either Candida parapsilosis or
		such poor growth that the organism could not be identified. Infants with
		"colonization only rarely had budding yeasts (6.1%), whereas more than half of the"
		infants with either a urinalysis showing budding yeasts or a urine culture
		growing fungi had invasive disease. Fungal contamination was not found on either
		"thoracotomy tubes or catheter tips. In the low birth weight infant, fungal"
		colonization represents a significant risk factor for cutaneous or systemic
		candidiasis in these infants.

TI	-	Frequency of Candida albicans in Patients with Funguria.
PG	-	113-6
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of Candida albicansin patients with
		funguria. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive cross-sectional study. PLACE AND DURATION OF
		"STUDY: Department of Microbiology, Sindh Institute of Urology and"
		"Transplantation, from July to December 2012. METHODOLOGY: Patients’ urine samples"
		with fungus/Candida were included. Candida albicans was identified by the
		production of tubular structures (germ tubes) on microscopy as per standard
		procedure followed by inoculation on Chrom agar (Oxoid) and Corn Meal-Tween 80
		agar (Oxoid). The identification of other non-albicans Candidaspecies was also
		done both microscopically and macroscopically as per standard procedure. RESULTS:
		"Out of the 289 isolates, 204 (70.6%) were male patients and 85 (29.4%) were"
		"female patients, with 165 (57.1%) from the out-patients and 124 (42.9%) from the"
		in-patients. Five species of Candidawere found to be prevalent including 87
		"(30.1%) Candida albicans, 176 (60.9%) Candida tropicalis, 14 (4.8%) Candida"
		"parapsilosis, 8 (2.8%) Candida glabrata and 4 (1.4%) Candida lusitaniae. Majority"
		of patients with funguria were aged above 50 years (60.2%). CONCLUSION: In the
		"present study, 30.1% patients with funguria had Candida albicans. The most"
		"frequently isolated species was Candida tropicalis(60.9%), followed by other"
		non-albicansCandida. This study has shown the emergence of non-albicans Candidaas
		a major cause of candiduria.

TI	-	Candida tropicalis vertebral osteomyelitis: a late sequela of fungemia.
PG	-	697-703
AB	-	Two adult patients who had undergone bone marrow transplantation had transient
		fungemia due to Candida tropicalis during the posttransplantation neutropenic
		period and later (at 5 and 14 months post-transplantation) developed vertebral
		osteomyelitis due to the same organism. The courses of all adult patients who
		underwent bone marrow transplantation at our center during this time were
		reviewed for determining the frequency of this problem. Molecular typing
		techniques were used to establish the relationship between the organisms isolated
		during the initial fungemia and those causing the subsequent osteomyelitis. Only
		two of 532 adults who received transplants at our center from 1980 to 1993
		"developed candidal osteomyelitis. Moreover, they are part of a subset of 13"
		patients (2.4% of the total) whose cultures were positive for C. tropicalis; five
		of the 13 had fungemia. The study of fungal isolates from prior sites of
		colonization and from blood sampled during the original fungemia and of
		subsequently recovered vertebral bone isolates by means of DNA restriction
		fragment analysis (with use of standard agarose gel electrophoresis or
		"pulsed-field gel electrophoresis) showed that the colonizing, bloodstream, and"
		bone isolates were identical in each case. Transient C. tropicalis fungemia in
		severely immunocompromised patients may cause important late infectious
		"complications, including osteomyelitis. Although these initial septic events may"
		"appear to resolve easily, the outcome in the two cases in this report suggests"
		"that special treatment considerations, such as immediate removal of the central"
		"venous catheter and intensive treatment with amphotericin B, may be required in"
		selected cases for prevention of late sequelae.

TI	-	Nosocomial candidemia in non-neutropenic patients at an Italian tertiary care
		hospital.
PG	-	602-7
AB	-	"In a retrospective study conducted in an Italian tertiary care hospital, the"
		incidence of nosocomial candidemia was evaluated together with causative
		"pathogens, treatment, and risk factors for death. Over a 6-year period"
		"(1992-1997), a total of 189 episodes of candidemia occurred in 189 patients (mean"
		"age 58+/-19 years), accounting for an average incidence of 1.14 episodes per"
		"10,000 patient-days per year. The most common reasons for hospitalization were"
		"solid neoplasia (21%), trauma (17%), abdominal diseases requiring surgery (13%),"
		and cardiovascular diseases (13%). No patient was neutropenic within 3 weeks
		prior to the onset of candidemia. One hundred thirty patients were hospitalized
		"in intensive care units, 47 patients in surgical wards, and 12 patients in"
		"medical wards. Candida albicans was the most frequently isolated pathogen,"
		"accounting for 54% of fungal isolates, followed by Candida parapsilosis (23%),"
		"Candida glabrata (7%), Candida tropicalis (5%), Candida pelliculosa (4%), Candida"
		"lusitaniae (1%), Candida humicula (1%), and other non-albicans Candida spp. (5%)."
		Seventy-six (41%) patients received adequate antifungal therapy. Seventy-one
		(58%) of the 123 evaluable patients with central venous catheters underwent line
		removal; 51 of them had catheter-related candidemia. The 30-day crude mortality
		"rate was 45%. Older age, hospitalization in an intensive care unit, a longer"
		"duration of candidemia, retention of central lines, and inadequate antifungal"
		"therapy were significantly associated with poor outcome. In the present study,"
		nosocomial candidemia was a frequent and relatively underestimated illness.
		Adequate antifungal therapy and central line removal independently reduced the
		high mortality of the disease.

AB	-	PURPOSE: To report a case of polymicrobial keratitis resistant to topical and
		intraocular antibiotics with recurrence after penetrating keratoplasty. METHODS:
		Case report. RESULTS: We report a case of polymicrobial keratitis caused by
		"Phialophora verrucosa, Candida tropicalis, and Propionibacterium acnes. Initial"
		"treatment included topical vancomycin, tobramycin, amphotericin B, voriconazole,"
		"and oral fluconazole, as well as subconjunctival amphotericin B. Penetrating"
		"keratoplasty was performed, and the infection seemed to have resolved until 4"
		"weeks after keratoplasty. A second penetrating keratoplasty was performed,"
		followed by 4 weekly intracameral injections of voriconazole. Two weeks after the
		"fourth intracameral injection, the infection manifested as an active"
		anterior-chamber reaction. The patient's eye was subsequently enucleated.
		Histopathologic evaluation showed penetration of the crystalline lens by fungus
		at the site of synechiae between the intact lens capsule and iris. CONCLUSIONS:
		"To our knowledge, this is the first documented case of a polymicrobial keratitis"
		"caused by a bacterium, yeast, and a fungus. It is the first histopathologic"

AB	-	Candida induced osteomyelitis is infrequent. There is scarcity of literature on
		this entity in maxillofacial region and thus there is possibility to mismanage
		such cases. We are presenting a case of chronic maxillofacial Candida tropicalis
		osteomyelitis causing palatal and septal perforation with saddle nose deformity
		in a young lady with commencement and progression of disease process over two
		pregnancies. Diagnosis was established by histopathology and repeated isolation
		on culture. Debridement followed by adequate antifungal therapy instituted.

TI	-	Cross-sectional study of the susceptibility of Candida isolates to antifungal
		drugs and in vitro-in vivo correlation in HIV-infected patients.
PG	-	945-50
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To investigate (1) the frequency of clinical resistance to oral
		"polyenes or azole treatment for oral candidiasis, (2) the frequency of resistant"
		"in vitro Candida strains, (3) the relationship between the susceptibilities of in"
		vitro Candida species and in vivo status in HIV patients. DESIGN: Prospective
		"cross-sectional study. SETTING: Tertiary care clinic at Bocage Hospital, Dijon,"
		France. PATIENTS: HIV-infected patients with and without oral candidiasis.
		"INTERVENTIONS: Clinical examination, oral swab for mycologic investigations. MAIN"
		"OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical diagnosis of oral candidiasis, identification of the"
		"antifungal treatment given within the previous month, identification of Candida"
		"species, antimycogramm and determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration"
		"(MIC) for fluconazole, and measurement of T-helper cell count. RESULTS: Within a"
		"2-month period, 154 HIV-infected patients were studied: 46 heterosexuals, 51"
		"intravenous drug users (IVDU), 52 homosexuals and five blood transfusion"
		"recipients. The percentages of patients with oral candidiasis were: 41, 80, 44"
		"and 20%, respectively (P < 0.05); the mean T-helper cell counts were 200, 135,"
		"210 and 238 x 10(6)/l cells, respectively (P < 0.05). Twenty-two patients (14.3%)"
		had received recent azole treatment and 29 (18.8%) recent oral polyene treatment.
		"Among the 84 patients with and the 70 patients without oral candidiasis, 78 and"
		"28 Candida strains were isolated, respectively. Although Candida albicans"
		"represented the majority of Candida species (88 strains, 83%), the non-albicans"
		strains were isolated more frequently in patients who had received recent
		"antifungal treatment. No strains were resistant to ketoconazole, miconazole or"
		"econazole; however, six (5.6%), 16 (15%) and 10 (9.5%) were intermediately"
		"susceptible to the three drugs, respectively. Twelve (13.6%) of the 88 C."
		"albicans, five of the six C. (Torulopsis) glabrata, one of the five C. tropicalis"
		and all three C. krusei strains were resistant to fluconazole. These resistant
		strains were separated as follows: 41.1% of C. albicans strains resistant to
		"fluconazole were isolated from patients who had received recent azole therapy,"
		"17.6% from patients who received recent oral polyene, and 3.7% from patients who"
		had not received any recent antifungal treatment (P = 0.004). The mean MIC of
		"these three categories of isolates were 3.6, 1.6 and 0.6 mg/l, respectively (P ="
		0.06). CONCLUSIONS: Oral candidiasis and fluconazole-resistant Candida isolates
		are more frequently found in IVDU. Treatments using azoles select non-albicans
		strains and are associated with decreased susceptibilities of C. albicans strains
		to fluconazole in particular. These findings show that prolonged azole treatment
		in severely immunocompromised patients should be avoided.

AB	-	Monitoring fungal ecology and resistance to antifungal agents within intensive

		"Therefore, a retrospective descriptive study was carried in the ICU of Nimes"
		"University Hospital, France, from 2007 to 2016. As the majority of invasive"
		"fungal infections in ICU are caused by Candida species, the study objectives were"
		"to describe Candida species distribution, to assess candidaemia incidence and to"
		monitor the antifungal drug susceptibility of Candida isolates and the
		consumption of antifungal agents. Among the recorded invasive Candida infections
		"(n=244), 43% were intra-abdominal and 22% bloodstream infections. Candida"
		"albicans was the most frequent species (55.8%), followed by Candida glabrata"
		"(14.1%), Candida tropicalis (10%), Candida parapsilosis (8%) and Candida krusei"
		(5.3%). Candidaemia incidence was 4.49 per 1000 admissions. The mean consumption
		of antifungal agents was of 170.5 defined daily doses (DDD) for 1000 hospital
		"days (HD) per year. Changes in antifungal drug consumption were observed, with an"
		increased use of echinocandins (from 17.96 DDD/1000 HD in 2007 to 48.76 DDD/1000
		"HD in 2016), and the total treatment cost tripled during the study period. No"
		significant change in fungal ecology or in the emergence of resistant species was
		"observed; indeed, only 1.1% of isolates presented an unusual resistance to"
		antifungal agents.

AB	-	Candida arthritis in patient with hematological malignancy is rare. A case of
		Candida tropicalis arthritis of knee occurred in a patient with acute monocytic
		leukemia was reported during the recovery phase of post chemotherapy
		myelosuppression and agranulocytosis. The patient was diagnosed as Candida
		tropicalis arthritis of knee according to the Candida tropicalis isolated from
		the synovial fluid. Itraconazole and amphotericin B were intravenously injected
		"for therapy for 4 - 5 weeks based on the susceptibility test in vitro, which"
		showed better efficacy. But the arthritis relapsed at 4 - 6 weeks after the drug
		withdrawal. The curative effect was found in patient after treatment with
		fluconazole injection and articular cavity douching with amphotericin B for 8
		"weeks. In conclusion, although Candida arthritis in patient with hematological"
		"malignancy is rare, it still occurred in the patient with hypoimmunity. The"
		treatment emphasis showed be placed on the full dosage and full treatment course
		of antifungal agent.

TI	-	A 5-year (2000-2004) epidemiological survey of Candida and non-Candida yeast
		"species causing vulvovaginal candidiasis in Graz, Austria."
PG	-	471-5
AB	-	Vulvovaginal candidasis (VVC) is a common disease. The majority of cases is
		"caused by Candida albicans, but in recent years an increase has been observed in"
		"the frequency of non-albicans Candida infections, especially due to C. glabrata"
		and C. tropicalis. The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of
		"non-albicans Candida infections in patients suffering from VVC. Therefore, the"
		statistical data of culture-confirmed VVC ascertained at the Institute of Hygiene
		"(Medical University Graz) have been studied. Altogether, 10,463 samples from"
		"patients with vulvovaginal complaints were analysed in the years 2000-2004, a"
		number of 3184 proved to be culture-positive for yeast. Candida albicans was the
		most prevalent cause in 87.9% of all cases. Non-albicans Candida yeast were
		"detected in 12.1%, mainly C. glabrata and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. During a"
		1-year period 185 patients showed more than one episode of VVC. Patients aged
		21-40 years were significantly more prone to suffer from VVC compared with other
		age-related groups.

AB	-	In recent decades the incidence of Candida endocarditis has increased
		"dramatically. Despite the application of surgery and antifungal therapy, Candida"
		endocarditis remains a life-threatening infection with significant morbidity and
		"mortality. We report a 37-year-old male drug abuser presenting with high fever,"
		"chest pain, loss of appetite and cardiac failure. His echocardiography revealed"
		mobile large tricuspid valve vegetations. Fungal endocarditis was confirmed by
		culturing of the resected vegetation showing mixed growth of Candida albicans and
		"Candida tropicalis, although three consecutive blood cultures were negative for"
		Candida species. Phenotypic identification was reconfirmed by sequencing of the
		internal transcribed spacer (ITS rDNA) region. The patient was initially treated
		"with intravenous fluconazole (6 mg kg(-1) per day), followed by 2 weeks of"
		intravenous amphotericin B deoxycholate (1 mg kg(-1) per day). Although MICs were
		"low for both drugs, the patient's antifungal therapy combined with valve"
		"replacement failed, and he died due to respiratory failure."

TI	-	Silver-sulfadiazine eschar pigmentation mimics invasive wound infection: a case
		report.
PG	-	154-7
AB	-	"A 3-year-old girl with 52% TBSA scalds, mostly partial thickness, was treated"
		topically with 5% mafenide acetate solution and 1% silver sulfadiazine cream. All
		blood cultures and wound swabs were negative for the first 5 days. On day 6
		gram-negative bacteria and yeast forms were isolated from her wounds. High fever
		and leukocytosis were present and the child was treated with intravenous
		ampicillin and gentamicin according to sensitivity bacteriogram. The bacteria
		were identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the yeast was Candida tropicalis.
		"On day 7, Escherichia coli was identified in blood cultures and intravenous"
		cefixime was added. Amphotericin B was added on day 9 when blood cultures grew
		Candida tropicalis and Burkholderia cepacia. On day 13 dark pigmentation foci
		"developed on some areas of partial-thickness burns in the back, resembling"
		"invasive wound infection. White blood cell count was 14,300 cells/mm3, and her"
		body temperature reached 39.7 degrees C. Cultures from the pigmented areas were
		"negative, and biopsies revealed deposits of silver. Most of the areas healed"
		"uneventfully, and only about 8% TBSA needed grafting, including some of the"
		pigmented areas. No residual pigmentation remained on discharge.

TI	-	Secular trends in the epidemiology of nosocomial fungal infections at a teaching
		"hospital in Taiwan, 1981 to 1993."
PG	-	369-75
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To describe the incidence and patterns of nosocomial fungal infection
		"in a large teaching hospital in Taiwan. DESIGN: Prospective, hospitalwide"
		nosocomial surveillance data from 1981 through 1993 were analyzed to show the
		secular trend in nosocomial fungal infection rates and to identify the most
		common pathogens and sites of infection (other than skin) in this hospital.
		SETTING AND PATIENTS: The National Taiwan University Hospital is a medical
		"school-affiliated hospital in the city of Taipei, Taiwan, with a 1200-bed"
		capacity before 1991 and 1500 beds since 1992. It provides both primary and
		tertiary medical care. RESULTS: The overall nosocomial fungal infection rate rose
		from 0.9 infections per 1000 discharges in 1981 to 6.6 per 1000 discharges in
		"1993, with the highest rate at the medical intensive-care unit (26.5/1000"
		discharges in 1993). This increase in infection rate was found at four major
		"anatomic sites of infection, particularly including the bloodstream"
		(0.08-2.19/1000 discharges) and the urinary tract (0.36-2.95/1000 discharges). Of
		"256 pathogens causing nosocomial fungemia from 1981 through 1993, Candida"
		"albicans was the most commonly isolated (50.8%), followed by Candida tropicalis"
		"(17.6%). Candida parapsilosis (11.7%), and Candida glabrata (8.2%). As compared"
		"to isolates from 1981 through 1988, the proportion of C parapsilosis and C"
		"glabrata isolated between 1989 and 1993 increased more than sixfold and fourfold,"
		respectively. The increasing importance of fungal infections was confirmed
		further by the increased use of amphotericin B and azoles in this hospital.
		CONCLUSIONS: Candida species and other yeasts have become a prominent cause of
		nosocomial infections in this hospital. These fungal pathogens accounted for a
		higher proportion of nosocomial bloodstream and urinary infections than any
		"single bacterial species. Therefore, it is important to conduct a prospective"
		epidemiological study and to establish in vitro antifungal susceptibility testing
		to enhance efforts to control nosocomial fungal infections and to minimize the
		risk of emergence of antifungal resistance.

PG	-	799-804
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To use multivariate analysis to determine risk factors for death among
		pediatric patients with candidemia and a central venous catheter in place.
		"DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study conducted at Santa Casa Complexo Hospitalar, a"
		"1,200-bed teaching hospital in southern Brazil. METHODS: All cases of candidemia"
		"in pediatric patients (age, <or=13 years) at our medical center over a 9-year"
		period were reviewed. A diagnosis of sepsis was required for inclusion in the
		study. Severity of illness was confirmed by the presence of hypotension requiring
		inotropes and according to the following scores: the Pediatric Risk of Mortality
		"(PRISM) II score, the PRISM III score, and the Pediatric Logistic Organic"
		"Dysfunction score. The following 2 outcomes were evaluated: early death, defined"
		"as death occurring within 7 days after candidemia was diagnosed, and late death,"
		defined as death 8-30 days after candidemia was diagnosed. RESULTS: A total of 61
		"patients were included in the study, including 14 neonates. Most (63.9%) of these"
		"patients were girls, and the median age was 0.3 years. A total of 80.3% of"
		"candidemia cases were due to species other than Candida albicans, primarily"
		Candida parapsilosis (32.8% of cases) and Candida tropicalis (24.6% of cases).
		"Using multivariate analysis, we demonstrated that failure to remove the central"
		venous catheter was an independent risk factor for early death among pediatric
		"patients with candidemia. However, patients whose catheters were retained were"
		"sicker than patients whose catheters were removed, and catheter removal had no"
		"impact on late death. Instead, severity of illness determined using the PRISM III"
		score was also an independent predictor of late death. CONCLUSIONS: Results from
		this study suggest that systematic removal of catheters from pediatric patients
		with candidemia does not reduce the occurrence of late death.

AB	-	The use of improved microbiological procedures associated with molecular
		"techniques has increased the identification of Candida bloodstream infections,"
		even if the isolation of more than one species by culture methods remains
		uncommon. We report the cases of two children presenting with severe
		gastrointestinal disorders and other risk factors that contribute to Candida
		"infections. In the first patient, C. albicans DNA was initially detected by a"
		"nested-amplification and C. tropicalis was found later during hospitalization,"
		"while blood cultures were persistently negative. In the second child, there was"
		"amplification of C. albicans and C. glabrata DNA in the same samples, but blood"
		cultures yielded only C. albicans. Both patients received antifungal therapy but
		had unfavorable outcomes. These two cases illustrate that PCR was more successful
		than culture methods in detecting Candida in the bloodstream of high risk
		"children, and was also able to detect the presence of more than one species in"
		the same patient that might impact therapy when the fungi are resistant to azole
		compounds.

TI	-	"Triazole cross-resistance among Candida spp.: case report, occurrence among"
		"bloodstream isolates, and implications for antifungal therapy."
PG	-	529-35
AB	-	Candida spp. are common causes of bloodstream infections among hospitalized
		patients. Fluconazole (FLC) remains a first-line therapy for candidemia; and
		"voriconazole (VRC), an expanded-spectrum triazole, was recently approved for the"
		treatment of candidemia in nonneutropenic patients. In vitro studies have
		suggested that VRC has potent activity against Candida spp. with reduced
		susceptibilities to FLC. We present a case report of invasive candidiasis and
		candidemia due to a Candida glabrata isolate that developed resistance to all
		currently available triazole antifungals after a course of FLC treatment. This
		case prompted us to determine the frequency of cross-resistance among bloodstream
		"Candida isolates collected during a recent 12-month period at a large, academic"
		medical center. FLC MICs were determined for 125 of 153 isolates (81.7%). Thirty
		of 125 isolates (24%) were resistant or showed reduced susceptibilites to FLC
		(MICs >/= 16 microg/ml). When 28 of these 30 isolates were tested for their VRC
		"susceptibilities, 9 (32%) had MICs that were >/=2 microg/ml. Five of these nine"
		"isolates were C. glabrata, two isolates were Candida tropicalis, one isolate was"
		"Candida albicans, and one isolate was Candida parapsilosis. All five Candida"
		krusei isolates tested had VRC MICs </=0.5 microg/ml. These data have prompted
		the introduction of reflexive FLC susceptibility testing of first bloodstream
		Candida isolates at our institution. The case report and our data also suggest
		that VRC should be avoided as initial therapy in unstable patients with invasive
		"candidiasis, particularly in the setting of prior azole exposure. Studies are"
		needed to define the clinical significance of in vitro resistance to the newer
		antifungal agents.

AB	-	Nosocomial candidemia is the 4(th) most common pathogen in blood stream
		infection. Emergence of non-albicans Candida species with often intrinsically
		resistance fluconazole pattern may lead to difficulty in management of
		septicemia. Although the present study isolated 80% of non albicans candida
		"species with C.tropicalis as the most common (35%) species, 96% of our Candida"
		species isolated were sensitive to fluconazole. The probable causes of low
		resistance pattern to fluconazole in our institute are discussed. It is however
		necessary to identify the complete clinical response to the given treatment.
		"Therefore, appropriate identification of species with susceptibility testing"
		would be advisable before start of anti-fungals. This would prevent emergence of
		fluconazole resistance.

AB	-	CONTEXT: Infection is a major determinant in the outcome of patients with cancer.
		AIMS: The aim was to know the epidemiology and outcome of patients with cancer in
		a cancer care center in Eastern India. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Retrospective study
		"of pediatric patients in Tata Medical Center, Kolkata, India. METHODS: Patients"
		(n = 262) between the age group of 0 and 18 years were reviewed for infections
		and infection-related outcome (January to December 2013). STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:
		Modified Wald method was used to determine confidence interval of proportions.
		RESULTS: Gram-negative bacteria were found to be the most common cause of
		"bloodstream infections (BSIs) (56.4%), followed by Gram-positive cocci (34.5%),"
		and Candida species (9.1%). Carbapenem-resistance was noted among 24% of
		"Gram-negative bacilli (GNB), and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase among 64% of"
		GNBs. A single case of Vibrio cholerae septicemia was also noted. No case of
		"vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus was observed, whereas only two cases of"
		methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (1/3 of all Staphylococcus
		"aureus bacteremia) were detected. Escherichia coli, followed by Klebsiella,"
		"Pseudomonas, and Acinetobacter were the predominant organisms detected in BSIs."
		"Among Candida spp. BSIs no resistance to caspofungin, amphotericin B,"
		"Voriconazole was noted. Candida tropicalis was the most common isolate, and 1"
		isolate of Candida glabrata showed dose-dependent sensitivity to fluconazole.
		Three out of 25 patients died of multi-drug resistant Gram-negative bacteria
		(12%) in 2013. Seventeen patients had radiological evidence of invasive fungal
		infections (no mortality was noted). CONCLUSIONS: Periodic review of
		"infection-related data, as well as infection control practices, is essential to"
		optimize clinical outcome in patients with pediatric malignancies.

PG	-	65-8
AB	-	The objective of this study was to characterize the epidemiology of candidemia in
		"cancer patients in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. An 18-month survey of"
		fungemia in patients with cancer was undertaken in three Hospitals in Rio de
		"Janeiro. Forty-three episodes of candidemia were identified in 43 patients, 43 of"
		which were episodes of candidemia; in ten case the strains were not available for
		further identification of species and were excluded from this analysis. The
		"overall distribution of fungi causing fungemia was: Candida albicans (5), Candida"
		"tropicalis (16), Candida parapsilosis (6), Candida guilliermondii (4), Candida"
		lusitaniae (1) and Candida stellatoidea (1). Antifungal prophylaxis had been
		administered before the episode of fungemia in only six patients (18.2%): oral
		"itraconazole in three patients and oral nistatin, low dose intravenous"
		amphotericin B and oral fluconazole in one patient each. There was no difference
		"in the presence of risk factors, clinical characteristics or in the outcome"
		"between albicans and non-albicans species, nor between Candida tropicalis and"
		other non-albicans species. There was a clear predominance of non-albicans
		"species, regardless of the underlying disease, antifungal prophylaxis or the"
		presence of neutropenia.

PG	-	30-5
AB	-	Fungal urinary tract infections are increasingly prevalent in the elderly in
		acute and chronic care settings. This randomized trial compares the efficacy and
		safety of oral fluconazole with the efficacy and safety of bladder irrigation
		"with amphotericin B for treatment of funguria (> or = 10,000 cfu/mL of urine) in"
		109 hospitalized elderly patients. A second treatment course was given for
		persistent funguria. Indwelling bladder catheters were present in 69% of the
		patients. While Candida albicans was the predominant isolate from catheterized
		"patients, C. albicans, Candida tropicalis, and Torulopsis glabrata were recovered"
		"from noncatheterized patients. Two days after completion of treatment, funguria"
		was eradicated in 96% of the patients treated with amphotericin B and 73% of
		"those treated with fluconazole (P < .05). At 1 month after study enrollment, the"
		mortality rate associated with all causes was greater among patients who were
		treated with amphotericin B bladder irrigation than among those who received oral
		"fluconazole therapy (41% vs. 22%, respectively; P < .05); this finding suggests"
		that local therapy may be associated with poorer survival. The proportion of
		patients without funguria at 1 month after study enrollment was similar in the
		"two treatment groups (84%, amphotericin B group; 80%, fluconazole group). A few"
		minor and mild adverse events occurred.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candida species are responsible for various clinical infections
		ranging from mucocutaneous infection to life threatening invasive diseases along
		with increased resistance to antifungal drugs has made a serious concern.
		"Resistance to antifungal agents has increased during the last decade. Thus,"
		identification of Candida up to species level and its antifungal susceptibility
		testing has a paramount significance in the management of Candidal infections.
		The aim of the study was to speciate Candida species and to determine antifungal
		susceptibility pattern of Candida species to antifungal agents. METHODS: A total
		of 100 consecutive Candida species were isolated from 1248 clinical specimens
		over 7 months period. Growths on Sabouraud dextrose agar were evaluated for
		"colony appearance, macroscopic examination, Gram staining, germ tube test and"
		"urea hydrolysis test. Further, they were processed for Candida speciation on"
		CHROMagar. Antifungal susceptibility testing was performed as recommended by
		Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M44-A document. RESULTS: Out
		"of 100 Candida isolates, Candida albicans (56%) was the most common species."
		"Among the non-albicans Candida species, Candida tropicalis (20%) was the"
		predominant isolate followed by Candida glabrata (14%). Regarding antifungal
		"susceptibility pattern, Candida species were more susceptible to clotrimazole"
		(82%) followed by fluconazole (64%) and miconazole (44%). CONCLUSIONS: Candida
		albicans was the predominant species responsible for various Candidal infections.
		"Among commonly used antifungal drugs clotrimazole, miconazole and fluconazole"
		were most effective.

AB	-	PURPOSE: Postoperative endophthalmitis is a dreaded outcome of any intraocular
		surgery. Fungal endophthalmitis is a particularly severe complication that poses
		a significant threat of blindness. We experienced seven consecutive cases of
		postoperative fungal endophthalmitis stemming from a single local clinic in which
		extensive early intervention resulted in favorable final visual acuity. METHODS:
		The present study is retrospective observational case series of fungal
		"endophthalmitis. The initial case, as diagnosed by fungal culture, resulted in"
		"blindness. In the ensuing eight months, seven consecutive cases were referred to"
		our institution. All were presumed to be fungal endophthalmitis as the cases
		possessed similar inflammatory findings to the preceding case and occurred in the
		same environment. Extensive surgical and antifungal treatment was immediately
		"administered, including complete vitrectomy with removal of the intraocular lens"
		and lens capsule and Amphotericin B injections. RESULTS: Retinal infiltration was
		identified in three cases and the lesion site was photocoagulated with an
		endolaser. All cases were confirmed fungal endophthalmitis by culture (4 cases:
		"Candida parapsilosis, one case each: Fusarium, Acremonium, Candida tropicalis)"
		and five cases required secondary intraocular lens implantation. Final corrected
		visual acuity ranged from 20/20 to 40/200 by the Snellen chart. CONCLUSIONS:
		Early extensive surgical intervention and antifungal agent administration may
		result in favorable visual outcomes in patients with fungal endophthalmitis
		following cataract surgery.

TI	-	Candidemia and the susceptibility pattern of Candida isolates in blood.
PG	-	1060-3
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: Candida species has become one of the most common blood isolates as
		well as one of the leading causes of nosocomial bloodstream infections. The
		purpose of our study was to determine the prevalence of Candida species among our
		bloodstream infecting organisms and the susceptibility pattern of the Candida
		isolates to antifungal agents. METHODS: A prospective study was carried out in
		"the Division of Microbiology, King Khalid National Guard Hospital, Jeddah,"
		Kingdom of Saudi Arabia of all positive blood cultures for Candida species. The
		study took place from 1st January 1998 to March 2002. Identification and
		susceptibility pattern of isolates were determined by the Candifast technique to
		"amphotericin B, fluconazole, nystatin, Flucytosine, econazole, ketoconazole and"
		"miconazole. RESULTS: Over a 2-year period, 17,916 blood cultures were performed"
		"in our hospital. There were 2,972 positive cultures, of which 83 (2.8%) patients"
		"had Candida species isolated from their bloodstream. Of these, 38 (46%) were"
		Candida albicans (C.albicans). The remaining 45 strains were made up of Candida
		tropicalis 9 (10.8%); Candida parapsilosis 9 (10.8%); Candida species 9 (10.8%);
		Candida guilliermondi 6 (7.2%); Candida krusei 5 (6%); Candida glabrata 4 (4.8%);
		Candida pseudotropicalis 2 (2.4%) and Trichosporon species 1 (1.2%). All Candida
		"species were susceptible to amphotericin B. However, only 18 (47%) out of 38"
		"C.albicans were susceptible to fluconazole, while only 8 (17.7%) of 45"
		non-C.albicans strains were susceptible to this drug. CONCLUSION: The
		susceptibility of C.albicans to fluconazole in our hospital using the Candifast
		method is very low (47%). These results need to be confirmed by carrying out the
		Etest or the NCCLS M27-A method to confirm the true susceptibilities of Candida
		strains in our locality.

TI	-	An unusual case of Candida tropicalis and Candida krusei arthritis in a patient
		with acute myelogenous leukemia before chemotherapy.
PG	-	1195-7
AB	-	A 79-year-old male with acute myelogenous leukemia developed acute right knee
		"arthritis during admission, after the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics before"
		chemotherapy. The initial synovial fluid sample appeared to be mildly
		inflammatory with a low white cell count. The fungal septic arthritis was not
		"diagnosed until Candida tropicalis, a rare species of Candida, was isolated in"
		the synovial fluid. Although fluconazole is effective in treating the
		"microorganism, the untreated leukemia rendered the infection incurable and led to"
		the growth of fluconazole-resistant Candida krusei. We reported the unusual case
		of fungal arthritis and reviewed the literature.

AB	-	A patient with a purulent pericarditis due to Candida tropicalis is described. A
		77-year-old woman undergoing chemotherapy for Hodgkin's disease was admitted to
		the hospital with a history of several febrile episodes. She was thought to be
		"septic and was begun on broad-spectrum antibiotics, despite treatment, however,"
		"the patient expired. Among the multiple premortem blood, urine, and cerebrospinal"
		"fluid cultures, one blood culture yielded C. tropicalis 2 days postmortem."
		Autopsy revealed purulent pericarditis accompanied by endocarditis and
		myocarditis due to culture-proven C. tropicalis. This is the first reported case
		of purulent pericarditis complicating systemic infection with this organism and
		is indicative of the fulminant course of fungal pericarditis.

TI	-	Fungemia caused by Candida species and Torulopsis glabrata in the hospitalized

		outcome.
PG	-	379-90
AB	-	We reviewed 135 cases of candidemia occurring between 1983 and 1986 to examine
		oncologic and nononcologic populations and assess factors for survival. Candida
		albicans was the most common species (51%); Candida tropicalis occurred most
		"frequently in leukemia patients (57%), whereas Candida parapsilosis and"
		Torulopsis glabrata were associated with solid tumors and nononcologic diseases.
		"Risk factors identified were: preceding surgery, antibiotics, cannulas, and"
		steroids in solid tumor and nononcologic diseases; and chemotherapy and
		neutropenia with hematologic malignancies. Even transient cannula-associated
		candidemia was not a benign process. Intravenous cannulas were common portals of
		entry (39%) in debilitated patients without cancer (59%) and were associated with
		"high mortality (55%). Overall mortality was 59%, candidemia directly contributing"
		"to death in 75% of cases. In patients with candidemia, failure to initiate"
		"therapy with amphotericin B had a negative influence on outcome, whereas analysis"
		of the entire group identified severity of underlying illness as the dominant
		cofactor influencing outcome.

		Patients who have undergone therapy with purine nucleoside analogues such as
		fludarabine and cladribine are also at risk.

TI	-	Fungal infection of ventriculoperitoneal shunts in children.
PG	-	1049-53
AB	-	Infection is still the most common complication of shunt procedures in children.
		"However, fungal infection is still considered to be rare. We found that fungi"
		accounted for 17% of shunt infections (8 of 48) in a retrospective study. All of
		the patients were premature babies and had received a ventriculoperitoneal shunt
		because of hydrocephalus. The clinical manifestations were subtle and insidious.
		The time of onset of infection ranged from 1 month to 1 year after the insertion
		of the shunt. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid of infected patients showed
		mild pleocytosis with an elevated protein concentration. Candida species
		"(including Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis, and Candida tropicalis) or"
		"Torulopsis glabrata were isolated. In all but one case, shunts were removed and"
		systemic therapy with amphotericin B was administered. Amphotericin B was given
		"intrathecally to two patients, who did not respond to systemic therapy. Treatment"
		with fluconazole failed for one patient. We suggest performing fungal cultures in
		"cases of shunt infection, especially those involving premature infants."
		"Extraventricular drainage, systemic therapy with amphotericin B, and insertion of"
		a new shunt remain the principal components of the treatment regimen for fungal
		shunt infections in children.

AB	-	Acute disseminated candidiasis is a serious and difficult problem often seen in
		immunocompromised states. Appearance of a characteristic skin eruption is helpful
		in the diagnostic. We report below a case report of an eight year old girl with
		aplastic anemia who had received multiple courses of antibiotics. A profuse
		"monomorphic papular nodular eruption subsequently appeared on the face, palms and"
		soles. Candida tropicalis was identified from the skin biopsy taken from one such
		lesion.

PG	-	233-7
AB	-	Sixty episodes of candidemia occurring between January 1987 and September 1989
		were retrospectively reviewed and the outcome was compared for three patient
		"categories: neutropenic, postsurgical, and nonneutropenic nonsurgical. Because of"
		"increasing reports of resistant yeasts, minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs)"
		to amphotericin B (amB) were determined to examine its relationship to patient
		outcome. No significant differences between patient categories were found for
		"selected risk factors, mortality, or species isolated, although there was a"
		tendency for Candida tropicalis to occur in neutropenic patients. Statistical
		analysis using logistic regression showed that both an amB dose greater than 500
		mg and a yeast MIC greater than 0.78 micrograms/ml were independent
		prognosticators of patient outcome.

PG	-	47-51
AB	-	Retrospective evaluation of candidaemia patients was performed in an Indian
		teaching hospital over a 10-year period. The incidence of patients with
		candidaemia increased eleven-fold in the second half of the study period (55
		patients) compared with the first half (5 patients). Haematological malignancies
		"(11 patients), neonatal septicaemia (9), cardiac abnormalities and cardiac"
		surgery (9) were the commonest underlying diseases in these patients. Candida
		"albicans (50%), C. guilliermondii (17%), C. tropicalis (15%) and C. parapsilosis"
		(8%) were the most common fungal pathogens isolated from blood culture. Therapy
		"with two or more antibiotics (92%), corticosteroid administration (25%),"
		intravascular catheter use for over 24 h (78%) and neutropenia (48%) were the
		accountable predisposing factors. Prolonged hospitalization (mean average 22.2
		days as compared with 11.2 days in other patients) was an added risk factor in
		these patients.

AB	-	Some emerging but less common human fungal pathogens are known environmental
		"species and could be of low virulence. Meanwhile, some species have natural"
		"antifungal drug resistance, which may pose significant clinical diagnosis and"
		treatment challenges. Implant breast augmentation is one of the most frequently
		"performed surgical procedures in China, and fungal infection of breast implants"
		"is considered rare. Here we report the isolation of a rare human fungal species,"
		"Quambalaria cyanescens, from a female patient in China. The patient had undergone"
		bilateral augmentation mammoplasty 11 years ago and was admitted to Peking Union
		Medical College Hospital on 15 September 2011 with primary diagnosis of breast
		infection. She underwent surgery to remove the implant and fully recovered
		"thereafter. During surgery, implants and surrounding tissues were removed and"
		sent for histopathology and microbiology examination. Our careful review showed
		that there was no solid histopathologic evidence of infection apart from
		"inflammation. However, a fungal strain, which was initially misidentified as"
		"""Candida tropicalis"" because of the similar appearance on CHROMagar Candida, was"
		"recovered. The organism was later on re-identified as Q. cyanescens, based on"
		sequencing of the rDNA internal transcribed spacer region rather than the D1/D2
		domain of 26S rDNA. It exhibited high MICs to 5-flucytosine and all
		"echinocandins, but appeared more susceptible to amphotericin B and azoles tested."
		The possible pathogenic role of Q. cyanescens in breast implants is discussed in
		"this case, and the increased potential for misidentification of the isolate is a"
		cause for concern as it may lead to inappropriate antifungal treatment.

		underwent a total hip arthroplasty (THA). She complained of a persisting
		low-grade fever and local heat on the THA scar. Arthrocentesis of the hip was
		performed and the Candida tropicalis was detected. Debridement and polyethylene
		liner/modular head exchange were performed 28 days after the primary THA.
		Fluconazole was administrated for one year. The patient reported no symptoms five
		years later. It was found that periprosthetic infection could be prevented by
		implant preservation surgery.

PG	-	423-428
LID	-	10.1099/jmm.0.46045-0 [doi]
AB	-	The incidence of candidaemia among immunocompromised patients in Malaysia is
		increasing at an alarming rate. Isolation of clinical strains that are resistant
		to fluconazole has also risen markedly. We report here the repeated isolation of
		Candida tropicalis from the blood of a neonatal patient with Hirschsprung's
		disease. In vitro fluconazole susceptibility tests of the eight isolates obtained
		at different time points showed that seven of the isolates were resistant and one
		isolate was scored as susceptible dose-dependent. Random amplification of
		polymorphic DNA fingerprinting of the isolates using three primers and subsequent
		phylogenetic analysis revealed that these isolates were highly similar strains
		"having minor genetic divergence, with a mean pairwise similarity coefficient of"
		0.893+/-0.041. The source of the infectious agent was thought to be the central
		"venous catheter, as culture of its tip produced fluconazole-resistant C."
		tropicalis. This study demonstrates the utility of applying molecular
		epidemiology techniques to complement traditional mycological culture and drug
		susceptibility tests for accurate and appropriate management of recurrent
		candidaemia and highlights the need for newer antifungals that can combat the
		emergence of fluconazole-resistant C. tropicalis strains.

TI	-	Concurrent isolation of Candida krusei and Candida tropicalis from multiple blood
		cultures in a patient with acute leukemia.
PG	-	521-3
AB	-	Reports of the concurrent isolation of more than one non-albicans species of
		Candida from blood cultures of immunocompromised patients with disseminated
		candidiasis are extremely infrequent. We report on the isolation of Candida
		krusei and Candida tropicalis from 17 blood cultures that were taken from a
		67-year-old white man with a diagnosis of acute biphenotypic leukemia during a
		2-week period of hospitalization for induction chemotherapy. Despite receiving
		"high-dose amphotericin B throughout this period, the status of the patient"
		"worsened, and he experienced pancytopenia, hypernatremia, azotemia, and"
		"disseminated intravascular coagulation, which led to his death. Candida krusei"
		"and C tropicalis were isolated concurrently from 10 of the 17 blood cultures,"
		while C krusei was the single isolate in three cultures and C tropicalis was
		isolated alone in four cultures. Each species manifested markedly different
		colonial morphological features. This case report serves to emphasize to
		microbiologists that they must exercise extreme suspicion when non-albicans
		species of Candida are isolated singly or concurrently from blood cultures in
		"neutropenic patients, given the increasing clinical significance of these yeasts."

TI	-	Breakthrough candidaemias during empirical therapy with fluconazole in non-cancer
		and non-HIV adults caused by in vitro-susceptible Candida spp.: report of 33
		cases.
PG	-	749-51
AB	-	The objective of this study was to assess risk factors and the outcome of
		breakthrough fungaemias (BFs) occurring during fluconazole (FLU) therapy in
		non-cancer and non-HIV individuals. Thirty-three fungaemias occurring during
		therapy with FLU among a total of 310 fungaemias observed within a 10-y national
		survey were analysed. The agar disk diffusion method was used for antifungal
		susceptibility testing and the Vitek system for species identification.
		Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed to determine risk factors for
		BF. All BFs were due to species known to be susceptible to FLU: Candida albicans
		"(25/33), C. parapsilosis (6/33) and C. guillermondii (2/33). The mean number of"
		positive blood cultures per episode was 2.4. The MIC of Candida spp. to FLU was
		"0.5-8 mg/ml (all strains were susceptible in vitro). Neonatal age (< 4 weeks),"
		"very low birth weight, prior surgery, central venous catheter placement,"
		"artificial ventilation, total parenteral nutrition and C. parapsilosis were"
		"significantly related to BF in univariate analysis, but only central venous"
		"catheter placement was significantly related in multivariate analysis. However,"
		the outcome of BFs and non-BFs was similar. All BFs occurred in non-HIV patients
		"who were not previously treated with azoles, and were caused by in vitro"
		FLU-susceptible species (C. albicans and C. tropicalis). Thus factors other than
		in vitro susceptibility play a role in BFs.

TI	-	Acute conjunctivitis associated with biofilm formation on a punctal plug.
PG	-	559-60
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Punctal plugs are used for the treatment of tear-deficient type dry
		eye. We recently examined a case of acute conjunctivitis associated with
		bacterial biofilm formation on a punctal plug. CASE: A 63-year-old woman
		diagnosed as having tear-deficient type dry eye came to our hospital with a
		complaint of soreness in her right eye. Punctal plugs had been inserted into this
		"eye 5 1/2 months previously. On the day of her visit, she presented with acute"
		"conjunctivitis. OBSERVATIONS: In biomicroscopical examination, the top of the"
		punctal plug was seen to be covered with a whitish soft material. Microbiological
		analysis performed on a part of this material was positive for Staphylococcus
		haemolyticus and Candida tropicalis. Scanning electron microscopy of the removed
		punctal plug revealed widespread bacterial colonization embedded within an
		extensive extracellular matrix. Treatment consisted of the replacement of the
		"plug, and administration of a combination of antibacterial eyedrops and"
		"preservative-free artificial solution. As a result, the acute conjunctivitis"
		cleared up within 1 month. CONCLUSIONS: This case suggests that a punctal plug
		poses a potential risk of causing the formation of bacterial biofilm. In such a
		"case, replacement of the plug and/or removal of the accumulated materials should"
		be considered.

AB	-	Candida spp. are recognized as a leading contributor to mortality and morbidity
		in patients with onco-hematological malignancies. The rates and risk factors for
		"mycotic infections in pediatric oncology patients are undetermined, particularly"
		for those treated at centers in developing countries. The objective of the
		present study was to prospectively evaluate the species stratification and
		antifungal susceptibility profile of Candida spp. associated with superficial and
		systemic infection in children with onco-hematological diseases. Acute
		lymphoblastic leukemia was the most common underlying disease (71.4%) among the
		"91 children under study. Candida albicans was the predominant species, with 17/29"
		"isolates (58.6%); followed by C. tropicalis, with 10/29 isolates (34.5%). The"
		drug susceptibility data analysis for the clinical isolates of Candida revealed
		17.2% (5/29) resistance to fluconazole. This study reinforces the need for the
		systematic surveillance of candidosis for the correct management of such
		life-threatening infections.

		Documentation by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.
PG	-	545-7
AB	-	Candida albicans and other Candida species have emerged as major nosocomial
		pathogens associated with a high mortality. Therapeutic options for fungal
		infections are limited. Amphotericin B has been the mainstay of treatment for
		"serious systemic candidal infections, but it is relatively toxic and associated"
		with a variety of side effects. Fluconazole has been proposed as alternative
		therapy for the treatment of systemic candidiasis including candidemia. We report
		the case of a patient with fungemia in whom fluconazole failed to eradicate C.
		albicans and C. tropicalis. These pathogens were recovered from sputum and urine
		"cultures, respectively, on day 12 of intravenous fluconazole therapy. Molecular"
		epidemiologic techniques employing pulsed-field gel electrophoresis confirmed the
		persistence of the same C. albicans strain. Susceptibility studies showed a
		"marked change in MICs of fluconazole between 24 and 48 hr, with an increase from"
		less than or equal to 1.25 to greater than 80 micrograms/ml. Controlled trials
		will be needed to delineate the role of fluconazole in the treatment of
		disseminated candidiasis and its efficacy in comparison with amphotericin B.
		Amphotericin B should remain the drug of choice for such infections until data
		from controlled trials are available.

PG	-	465-70
AB	-	Of the 393 children who underwent BM autotransplantation in the pediatric
		oncology unit of the Institut Gustave Roussy between February 1979 and September
		"1991, 14 (3.56%) developed disseminated Candida infection within 3 months. This"
		incidence was far lower than in other published series. Eleven of the 14 patients
		"recovered from the infection, giving a far higher survival rate (78%) than among"
		adult BM transplant recipients (usually < 30%). All 14 patients had four or more
		"risk factors and persistent BM aplasia (median, 25 days); six had Candida"
		"tropicalis infection. Four cases of deep visceral involvement were documented,"
		two of which were lethal. Clinical signs were relatively uniform and included
		secondary high-grade fever (> 40 degrees C) for 8 days; half the patients
		"developed cardiovascular impairment, respiratory distress, neurological"
		"disturbances (altered consciousness or delirium) and severe diarrhoea, within as"
		little as 10 days after transplantation. Blood cultures rapidly became positive
		after the onset of clinical signs and this permitted prompt treatment with a
		"combination of amphotericin B and 5-fluorocytosine; in addition, central"
		catheters were removed. Blood cultures became sterile within 4 days of treatment
		in 10 of the 14 cases. The generally favourable outcome in this series could be
		"related to the young age of the patients, the absence of GVHD, the absence of"
		"total body irradiation in the conditioning regimen, and early antifungal"
		treatment.

		tropicalis from clinical specimens of patients with heterogeneous clinical
		presentations during the past 5 years. We have found that this species ranks
		third among all yeasts in frequency of isolation from clinical specimens and that
		the trend of recovery from the specimens is rising over the years. The isolation
		rate of C. tropicalis was highest from urine specimens (36%) followed by
		respiratory specimens (22%). The frequency of isolation of C. tropicalis from
		"vaginal specimens was relatively high (14%), however the trend was declining over"
		"the years. In general, the high recovery of Candida tropicalis from clinical"
		specimens of patients with variable disease supports the views of this organism
		being a major pathogen.

PG	-	559-60
AB	-	PURPOSE: To document a case of Candida tropicalis endophthalmitis as the only
		manifestation of pacemaker endocarditis. METHODS: We examined a 75-year-old man
		with diabetes mellitus who was initially examined for bilateral multifocal
		endophthalmitis complicating endocarditis 2 years after a permanent pacemaker for
		sick sinus syndrome was implanted. RESULTS: Transesophageal echocardiography
		showed a large vegetation with a 3-cm diameter attached to the pacing electrode
		in the right ventricle. Six consecutive blood cultures grew C tropicalis.
		"CONCLUSIONS: Ocular involvement, including multifocal endophthalmitis, may occur"
		"as the only manifestation of C tropicalis endocarditis, complicating an"
		intravenous permanent pacemaker.

		Several reports have already stressed the poor prognosis in invasive candidiasis

		rhG-CSF-primed granulocyte transfusions plus amphotericin B in two neutropenic
		patients who developed life-threatening systemic fungal infections. This approach
		was successful and both patients fully recovered from the infection.

TI	-	Intervertebral diskitis due to Candida tropicalis.
PG	-	270-3
AB	-	This report describes a case of Candida tropicalis intervertebral diskitis
		successfully treated with a brief course of amphotericin B followed by a longer
		course of ketoconazole. Candida tropicalis is an increasingly frequent pathogen

AB	-	Candida bloodstream infections (BSI) are a significant cause of mortality in
		"intensive care units (ICU), hereof the prospective 12-months (2014-2015)"
		hospital- and laboratory-based survey was performed at the Serbian National
		Reference Medical Mycology Laboratory (NRMML). Candida identification was done by
		a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry
		"and a susceptibility test, according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards"
		"Institute methodology. Among nine centres (265 beds; 10 820 patient admissions),"
		"four neonatal/paediatric (NICU/PICUs) and five adult centres (ICUs) participated,"
		"representing 89 beds and 3446 patient admissions, 166 beds and 7347 patient"
		"admissions respectively. The NRMML received 43 isolates, 17 from NICU/PICUs and"
		"26 from adult ICUs. C. albicans dominated highly in NICU/PICUs (~71%), whereas"
		"C. albicans and C. parapsilosis were equally distributed within adults (46%,"
		"each), both accounting for ~90% of received isolates. The resistance to"
		"itraconazole and flucytosine were 25% and 2.4% respectively. In addition, the 2"
		C. albicans were azole cross-resistant (4.6%). The overall incidence of
		CandidaBSI was ~3.97 cases/1000 patient admissions (4.93 in NICU/PICU and 3.53 in
		"adult ICU). The 30-day mortality was ~37%, most associated with C. tropicalis and"
		C. glabrataBSI. Data from this national survey may contribute to improving the
		Balkan and Mediterranean region epidemiology of CandidaBSI within ICUs.

PG	-	502-6
LID	-	10.1111/jop.12260 [doi]
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to investigate Candida carriage and
		species in Maras powder users and non-users. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study
		"included 100 volunteering men in 12 cafés in the city of Kahramanmaras, Turkey. A"
		questionnaire composed of questions about socio-demographic features and Maras
		powder use was filled in by the participants. Culture specimens were obtained
		from bilateral buccal mucosa and dorsum of the tongue with a sterile
		cotton-tipped swap. The specimens were inoculated in Sabouraud Dextrose Agar
		"(SDA). RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 48.0 ± 12.5 years (min = 20,"
		max = 70). Fifty-four percent of the Maras powder users and 22% of the non-users
		were Candida carriers. The difference between the groups was significant (P =
		0.001). The most frequently isolated species was Candida albicans at a rate of
		44% in the Maras powder users and at a rate of 18% in the non-users. Other
		frequent species were Candida glabrata at a rate of 6% in the Maras powder users
		and 2% in the control group and Candida tropicalis at a rate of 4% in the Maras
		powder users and 2% in the nonusers. CONCLUSION: We found that a significantly
		high rate of the Maras powder users was Candida carriers. It should be kept in
		mind that opportunistic infections may be caused by Candida species in Maras
		powder users especially with immunosuppressive conditions since Candida species
		are likely to lead to such infections in cases of immunosuppressive diseases.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: This retrospective study investigated clinical manifestations of
		candidemia caused by uncommon Candida species and antifungal susceptibility of
		the isolates in a regional hospital in Taiwan. METHODS: The uncommon Candida
		"species was initially defined as Candida species other than C. albicans, C."
		"tropicalis, C. glabrata complex, C. parapsilosis complex and C. krusei. All"
		uncommon Candida isolates were identified and confirmed by molecular methods.
		In vitro susceptibility testing of the uncommon Candida species to nine
		antifungal agents was conducted using the broth microdilution method with the
		"Sensititre YeastOne (SYO) system (Trek Diagnostic Systems, Ltd., East Grimstead,"
		"UK). RESULTS: Twenty-one patients, comprising 11 males and 10 females with a"
		"median age of 69 years, were recruited. Cancer (n = 11) was the most common"
		"underlying disease, 19 (90.5%) cases had prior antibiotic exposure, and only two"
		patients had prior antifungal use. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was
		"38.1% (n = 8). C. guilliermondii (n = 11) was the most common pathogen, followed"
		by C. curvata (n = 3). C. guilliermondii isolates exhibited relatively high rates
		of azole minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) above epidemiological cut-off
		"values (ECVs), whereas C. pelliculosa and C. lusitaniae isolates all remained"
		susceptible to azoles. All three C. curvata isolates had high caspofungin
		(>8 mg/L) and fluconazole MICs (8 mg/L) and could be defined as
		multidrug-resistant. CONCLUSIONS: Uncommon Candida species frequently exhibit
		high rates of non-susceptibility to antifungals. Identification of all Candida
		isolates at the species level from blood samples is of value for treatment.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Oropharyngeal candidiasis continues to be a major opportunistic
		infection in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. The objectives
		"of this study were to investigate the prevalence, associated factors, and"
		microbiologic features for oropharyngeal yeast colonization in HIV-infected
		"patients. METHODS: From October to December 2009, consecutive HIV-infected"
		patients older than 18 years were recruited in this study. Demographic
		"information, underlying conditions, and clinical histories were collected."
		Oropharyngeal swab cultures for yeasts and antifungal drug susceptibilities of
		"the isolates were performed. RESULTS: Of the 105 HIV-infected patients, 54"
		"(51.4%) were colonized with yeasts, including 11 patients (20.4%) with more than"
		"one species. Among the 68 isolates, Candida albicans accounted for 73.5%,"
		"followed by Candida tropicalis (5.9%), Candida glabrata (5.9%), and Candida"
		dubliniensis (4.4%). There were 7.5% and 6% Candida isolates resistant to
		"fluconazole and voriconazole, respectively. All of the Candida isolates were"
		susceptible to amphotericin B. A higher prevalence of yeast colonization was
		noted in patients with a CD4 cell count ≤200 cells/μL (p = 0.032). Multivariate
		regression analysis showed that intravenous drug use was an independent
		"associated factor for oropharyngeal yeast colonization (odds ratio, 5.35; 95%"
		"confidence interval, 1.39-20.6; p = 0.015), as well as protease"
		"inhibitor-containing antiretroviral therapy (odds ratio, 3.59; 95% confidence"
		"interval, 1.41-9.12; p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: Despite previous studies showing"
		"that protease inhibitors decreased Candida adhesion to epithelial cells in vitro,"
		the current study found protease inhibitor-containing antiretroviral therapy
		predisposed to oropharyngeal yeast colonization in HIV-infected patients.

AB	-	The Mycology Department of the Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Infecciosas
		"""Dr. C. Malbrán"", conducted the Second National Multicenter Survey on Fungemia"
		due to Yeasts in Argentina. The aim was to obtain updated data of the frequency
		of the causative species encountered and their in vitro susceptibility to seven
		antifungal agents. Yeast species were identified by micromorphological and
		biochemical studies. Antifungal susceptibility testing was performed by the
		reference microdilution method E.Def 7.1 of the European Committee on Antibiotic
		Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST). A total of 461 viable yeasts were identified.
		"The most frequent species were: Candida albicans (38.4 %), Candida parapsilosis"
		"(26 %), Candida tropicalis (15.4 %) and Candida glabrata (4.3 %). Other uncommon"
		"species, such as Candida viswanathii (0.6 %), Candida haemulonii (0.4 %), Candida"
		inconspicua (0.2 %) and Candida fermentati (0.2 %) were also isolated. Among the
		"Candida spp., 5.4 % and 1.6 % were resistant to fluconazole and voriconazole,"
		respectively. Itraconazole and caspofungin were the most efficient agents against
		"all Candida spp. tested (MIC < 1 mg/l). For anidulafungin, 21.6 % of C."
		parapsilosis showed a MIC value of 4 mg/l. Fluconazole was less active against
		"53.1 % of Cryptococcus neoformans (MIC > 8 mg/l), 75 % of Trichosporon spp., and"
		"100 % of Rhodotorula spp., Geotrichum candidum, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The"
		global percentage of mortality was 20 %. The presence of uncommon species
		reinforces the need for performing continuous laboratory surveillance in order to
		"monitor possible changes, not only in the epidemiological distribution of"
		"species, but also in the resistance to antifungal drugs."

		A six-year retrospective study.

AB	-	Candidemia has been considered a persistent public health problem with great
		impact on hospital costs and high mortality. We aimed to evaluate the
		epidemiology and prognostic factors of candidemia in a tertiary hospital in
		Northeast Brazil from January 2011 to December 2016. Demographic and clinical
		data of patients were retrospectively obtained from medical records and
		antifungal susceptibility profiling was performed using the broth microdilution
		method. A total of 68 episodes of candidemia were evaluated. We found an average
		incidence of 2.23 episodes /1000 admissions and a 30-day mortality rate of 55.9%.
		"The most prevalent species were Candida albicans (35.3%), Candida tropicalis"
		"(27.4%), Candida parapsilosis (21.6%) and Candida glabrata (11.8%). Higher"
		mortality rates were observed in cases of candidemia due to C. albicans (61.1%)
		"and C. glabrata (100%), especially when compared to C. parapsilosis (27.3%)."
		Univariate analysis revealed some variables which significantly increased the
		"probability of death: older age (P = 0.022; odds ratio [OR] = 1.041), severe"
		"sepsis (P < 0.001; OR = 8.571), septic shock (P = 0.035; OR = 3.792), hypotension"
		"(P = 0.003; OR = 9.120), neutrophilia (P = 0.046; OR = 3.080), thrombocytopenia"
		"(P = 0.002; OR = 6.800), mechanical ventilation (P = 0.009; OR = 8.167) and"
		greater number of surgeries (P = 0.037; OR = 1.920). Multivariate analysis showed
		"that older age (P = 0.040; OR = 1.055), severe sepsis (P = 0.009; OR = 9.872) and"
		hypotension (P = 0.031; OR = 21.042) were independently associated with worse
		"prognosis. There was no resistance to amphotericin B, micafungin or itraconazole"
		"and a low rate of resistance to fluconazole (5.1%). However, 20.5% of the Candida"
		isolates were susceptible dose-dependent (SDD) to fluconazole and 7.7% to
		"itraconazole. In conclusion, our results could assist in the adoption of"
		strategies to stratify patients at higher risk for developing candidemia and
		"worse prognosis, in addition to improve antifungal management."

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to evaluate periodontal conditions and
		"identify the presence of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas"
		"gingivalis and Tannerella forsythia, and four different species of Candida (C."
		"albicans, C. dubliniensis, C. glabrata and C. tropicalis) in periodontal pockets"
		and furcation sites of insulin-dependent type 2 diabetic and non-diabetic
		"patients with generalised chronic periodontitis. DESIGN: Clinical parameters,"
		"including oral status assessed using plaque index, gingival index, probing depth,"
		gingival recession and clinical attachment level and systemic conditions with
		fasting glucose level or glycosylated haemoglobin were measured in diabetic and
		non-diabetic patients with chronic periodontitis. Samples of subgingival biofilm
		were obtained from the periodontal pockets and furcation sites and submitted to
		phenol-chloroform DNA extraction and PCR analysis using specific primers.
		"RESULTS: Clinical conditions of diabetic and non-diabetic patients were similar,"
		without statistical differences in both periodontal indexes and glucose levels
		"(p>0.05). Diabetics had a higher prevalence of Candida spp., mainly C. albicans"
		"and C. dubliniensis, and a lower frequency of T. forsythia, when compared to"
		"non-diabetic patients, for both periodontal sites. C. glabrata and C. tropicalis"
		were not found in periodontal pockets and furcation sites of non-diabetic
		patients. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated a strong colonisation of Candida
		spp. in the periodontal sites of diabetic patients that have generalised chronic
		periodontitis with a higher prevalence of C. dubliniensis followed by C.
		albicans.

TI	-	Candida biofilm production is associated with higher mortality in patients with
		candidaemia.
PG	-	352-360
LID	-	10.1111/myc.13049 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candidaemia is a common life-threatening disease among hospitalised
		"patients, but the effect of the Candida biofilm-forming ability on the clinical"
		outcome remains controversial. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to determine the impact of
		"biofilms, specifically focusing on biofilm mass and metabolic activity, on the"
		mortality in candidaemia. PATIENTS/METHODS: The clinical data of patients
		"(n = 127) treated at the University of Debrecen, Clinical Centre, between January"
		"2013 and December 2018, were investigated retrospectively. Biofilm formation was"
		"assessed using the crystal violet and XTT assays, measuring the biofilm mass and"
		"metabolic activity, respectively. Isolates were classified as low, intermediate"
		and high biofilm producers both regarding biofilm mass and metabolic activity.
		"The susceptibility of one-day-old biofilms to fluconazole, amphotericin B,"
		"anidulafungin, caspofungin and micafungin was evaluated and compared to"
		planktonic susceptibility. RESULTS: Intermediate/high biofilm mass was associated
		"with significantly higher mortality (61%). All Candida tropicalis, Candida"
		parapsilosis and Candida glabrata isolates originating from fatal infections were
		"intermediate/high biofilm producers, whereas this ratio was 85% for Candida"
		albicans. Solid malignancy was associated with intermediate/high biofilm
		producers (P = .043). The mortality was significantly higher in infections caused
		by Candida strains producing biofilms with intermediate/high metabolic activity
		"(62% vs. 33%, P = .010). The ratio of concomitant bacteraemia was higher for"
		"isolates forming biofilms with low metabolic activity (53% vs 28%, P = .015)."
		CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that the Candida biofilms especially
		with intermediate/high metabolic activity are related to higher mortality in
		candidaemia.

AB	-	A cross-sectional study was performed in two primary schools with different
		"socioeconomic status in the suburban and central areas of Manisa, Turkey, in"
		order to determine the prevalence of tinea pedis and onychomycosis. A full
		dermatological examination and a questionnaire on socioeconomic conditions were
		performed in a group of 785 randomly selected children aged 6-14. Of 9 clinically
		"suspected tinea pedis and 4 onychomycoses cases, KOH examination (direct"
		"microscopy) and/or mycological cultures were positive in six boys, in whom"
		Candida glabrata and C. tropicalis grew. Older age and higher number of siblings
		were found to be significant factors for fungal infection.

		a case report and an updated literature review.
PG	-	e16-22
LID	-	10.1016/j.ijid.2011.10.001 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: We present a case of bilateral polymicrobial osteomyelitis with
		"Candida tropicalis and Candida krusei, and review the literature on Candida"
		osteomyelitis. METHODS: PubMed was searched for cases of Candida osteomyelitis
		published in the English-language literature between 1970 and 2010. CASE: A
		60-year-old previously healthy man was hospitalized with gallstone pancreatitis.
		"Between 3 weeks and 6 months after hospitalization, he developed bilateral"
		osteomyelitis of the feet with C. tropicalis and C. krusei. The patient was
		"treated with surgery, fluconazole, and a liposomal formulation of amphotericin B."
		"The left lower limb was amputated, and at a 2-year follow-up, the patient had"
		almost no pain in his right foot. LITERATURE REVIEW: We identified 40 new cases
		in the literature since the latest review in 2004. Most cases of Candida
		"osteomyelitis are caused by Candida albicans, but an increasing number are caused"
		"by non-albicans species. The prognosis is favorable, with full recovery in the"
		majority of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Candida osteomyelitis should be considered when a
		"patient presents with risk factors and pain without previous trauma, because"
		"Candida, despite being part of the normal flora, is the fourth leading cause of"
		hematogenous nosocomial infections. The recommended treatment is surgery and
		"fluconazole as monotherapy or initially combined with a fungicidal agent, either"
		a different amphotericin B formulation or an echinocandin.

TI	-	Association of fungal infection and increased mortality in liver transplant
		recipients.
PG	-	426-30
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive fungal infection is associated with increased morbidity and
		mortality following orthotopic liver transplantation (OLTx). Understanding the
		risk factors associated with fungal infection may facilitate identification of
		high-risk patients and guide appropriate initiation of antifungal therapy.
		OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of fungal
		"infections, identify the most common fungal pathogens, and determine the risk"
		factors associated with fungal infections and mortality in OLTx recipients.
		METHODS: Medical records from 96 consecutive OLTx in 90 American veterans (88
		"males, 2 females; mean age 48 years, range 32 to 67) performed from January 1994"
		to December 1997 were retrospectively reviewed for fungal infection in the first
		120 days after transplantation. Infection was defined by positive cultures from
		"either blood, urine (<105 CFU/mL), cerebrospinal or peritoneal fluid, and/or deep"
		tissue specimens. Superficial fungal infection and asymptomatic colonization were
		"excluded from study. All patients received cyclosporine, azathioprine, and"
		prednisone as maintenance immunosuppressive therapy. Fungal prophylaxis consisted
		"of oral clotrimazole (10 mg) troches, five times per day during the study period."
		RESULTS: Thirty-five patients (38%) had documented infection with one or more
		"fungal pathogens, including Candida albicans (25 of 35; 71%), C torulopsis (7 of"
		"35; 20%), C tropicalis (2 of 35; 6%), non-C albicans (2 of 35; 6%), Aspergillus"
		"fumigatus (4 of 35; 11%), and Cryptococcus neoformans (1 of 35; 3%). The crude"
		"survival for cases with or without fungal infection was 68% and 87%, respectively"
		(P <0.0001). The median intensive care unit stay and overall duration of
		hospitalization were significantly longer for patients with fungal infection (P
		<0.01). The mean time interval from transplantation to the development of fungal
		infection was 15 days (range 4 to 77) with a mean survival time from fungal
		infection to death of 21 days (range 3 to 64). Fungal infections occurred
		significantly more often in patients with renal insufficiency (serum creatinine
		">2.5 mg/dL), biliary/vascular complications, and retransplantation. CONCLUSIONS:"
		Fungal infections were associated with increased morbidity and mortality
		"following OLTx, with Candida albicans being the most common pathogen. Treatment"
		strategies involving antifungal prophylaxis for high-risk patients and earlier
		initiation of antifungal therapy in cases of presumed infection are warranted.

TI	-	Relationship between salivary flow rates and Candida counts in subjects with
		xerostomia.
PG	-	149-54
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the relationship between salivary flow and
		Candida colony counts in the saliva of patients with xerostomia. STUDY DESIGN:
		Sialometry and Candida colony-forming unit (CFU) counts were taken from 112
		subjects who reported xerostomia in a questionnaire. Chewing-stimulated whole
		saliva was collected and streaked in Candida plates and counted in 72 hours.
		Species identification was accomplished under standard methods. RESULTS: There
		was a significant inverse relationship between salivary flow and Candida CFU
		counts (P =.007) when subjects with high colony counts were analyzed (cutoff
		"point of 400 or greater CFU/mL). In addition, the median sialometry of men was"
		"significantly greater than that of women (P =.003), even after controlling for"
		confounding variables like underlying disease and medications. Sjögren's syndrome
		was associated with low salivary flow rate (P =.007). There was no relationship
		between the median Candida CFU counts and gender or age. There was a high
		frequency (28%) of mixed colonization. Candida albicans was the most frequent
		"species, followed by C parapsilosis, C tropicalis, and C krusei. CONCLUSIONS: In"
		subjects with high Candida CFU counts there was an inverse relationship between
		salivary flow and Candida CFU counts.

		patients with acute myelogenous leukemia and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome
		undergoing induction chemotherapy.
PG	-	568-73
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Systemic fungal infections remain the leading cause of mortality in
		patients with newly diagnosed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and high-risk
		myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The objective of the current study was to
		determine whether intravenous itraconazole (i.v. ITRA) reduced the incidence of
		"probable/proven fungal infections in this group of patients, and compare the"
		results with those of a historic control group treated with fluconazole plus
		itraconazole capsules (F+I). METHODS: Patients with AML and high-risk MDS who
		underwent induction chemotherapy received 200 mg of i.v. itraconazole over 60
		minutes every 12 hours during the first 2 days followed by 200 mg given i.v. once
		"daily. RESULTS: One hundred patients were enrolled, 96 of whom were evaluable."
		Approximately 48% of the patients in the group of patients treated with i.v. ITRA
		as well as in the F+I group completed prophylaxis. Nine patients (9%) in the
		study group developed either proven/probable fungal infections (Candida glabrata
		"in 5 patients, C. tropicalis in 1 patient, C krusei in 1 patient, and Fusarium in"
		2 patients) compared with 3 patients (4%) with proven fungal infection in the
		historic control group (C. tropicalis in 1 patient and Aspergillus in 2
		patients). There were no significant differences noted between the two groups
		with regard to the percentage of patients who developed proven/probable or
		possible fungal infection as well as with regard to survival. These results also
		were obtained after adjusting for relevant prognostic factors (creatinine and
		bilirubin). The most common toxicity encountered with the use of i.v. ITRA was
		NCI Grade 3-4 hyperbilirubinemia (6%). CONCLUSIONS: Despite its theoretic
		"advantages, the authors found no evidence that i.v. ITRA is superior to"
		"itraconazole capsules, at least when the latter is combined with fluconazole."

TI	-	Mycoses in northeastern Brazil: epidemiology and prevalence of fungal species in
		8 years of retrospective analysis in Alagoas.
PG	-	969-978

AB	-	"Superficial and cutaneous mycoses are common in tropical countries, caused by"
		"dermatophytes, yeast, and non-dermatophyte molds in different clinical specimens."
		In order to define the epidemiology of mycoses and the profile of their
		"etiological agents in Alagoas (northeastern Brazil) between 2009 and 2016, we"
		"obtained data of patients from the main laboratories of Alagoas, by examining"
		clinical samples with direct microscopy and culture on Sabouraud dextrose agar
		and Chromagar(®)Candida. A total of 3316 patients were confirmed with mycoses
		"(595 men/2716 women) and 40.25 of average age. Positive samples totaled 3776,"
		"mainly vaginal secretion (1593/42.2%), toenails (876/23.2%), and fingernails"
		"(589/15.6%). Yeasts were the most isolated (3129/82.9%), including 3012 Candida"
		"spp. (79.8%), 57 Malassezia spp. (1.5%), 42 Trichosporon sp. (1.1%), 10"
		"Geotrichum spp. (0.3%), and 8 Rhodotorula spp. (0.2%). Candida albicans was the"
		"most frequent species (715/18.9%), followed by C. krusei (194/5.1%), C."
		"tropicalis (24/0.6%), and 2079 unspecified species (55.1%). Among 17.1%"
		"filamentous fungi, 14.8% dermatophytes were distributed as 211 Trichophyton sp."
		"(5.6%), 125 T. rubrum (3.3%), 106 T. tonsurans (2.8%), 72 T. mentagrophytes"
		"(1.9%), 2 Microsporum sp. (0.1%), 15 M. canis (0.4%), and 26 Epidermophyton sp."
		(0.7%). Other fungi represented the minority: Fusarium sp. and Aspergillus sp.
		These are the first clinical data on the Alagoas population affected by fungi
		"pathogens, confirming a higher incidence of candidiasis (mainly vulvovaginal and"
		"onychomycosis) and dermatophytes, providing a better understanding of different"
		mycoses in northeastern Brazil.

TI	-	Bacterial and fungal colonization of burn wounds.
PG	-	535-9
AB	-	A prospective study of fungal and bacterial flora of burn wounds was carried out
		from February 2004 to February 2005 at the Burns Unit of Hospital Regional da Asa
		"Norte, Brasília, Brazil. During the period of the study, 203 patients were"
		treated at the Burns Unit. Wound swab cultures were assessed at weekly intervals
		for four weeks. Three hundred and fifty four sampling procedures (surface swabs)
		were performed from the burn wounds. The study revealed that bacterial
		colonization reached 86.6% within the first week. Although the gram-negative
		"organisms, as a group, were more predominant, Staphylococcus aureus (28.4%) was"
		the most prevalent organism in the first week. It was however surpassed by
		Pseudomonas aeruginosa form third week onwards. For S. aureus and P. aeruginosa
		vancomycin and polymyxin were found to be the most effective drugs. Most of the
		isolates showed high level resistance to antimicrobial agents. Fungi were found
		"to colonize the burn wound late during the second week postburn, with a peak"
		incidence during the third and fourth weeks. Species identification of fungi
		"revealed that Candida tropicalis was the most predominant, followed by Candida"
		parapsilosis. It is crucial for every burn institution to determine the specific
		"pattern of burn wound microbial colonization, the time-related changes in the"
		"dominant flora, and the antimicrobial sensitivity profiles. This would enable"
		early treatment of imminent septic episodes with proper empirical systemic
		"antibiotics, without waiting for culture results, thus improving the overall"
		infection-related morbidity and mortality.

LID	-	10.1016/j.ijid.2016.07.001 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Non-albicans Candida (NAC) spp. in immunocompromised patients are
		linked to invasive infections with narrow treatment choice. This study aimed at
		comparing the oral colonization of NAC spp. between HIV and non-HIV infected
		"individuals in Mwanza, Tanzania. METHOD: Oral rinse of 351 HIV-infected and 639"
		non-HIV infected individuals were collected between March and July 2015.
		Phenotypic identifications of Candida spp. was done using Candida Chromogenic
		agar and confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS. RESULTS: NAC spp. were detected in 36/351
		(10.3%) HIV-infected individuals compared to 28/639 (4.4%) of non-HIV infected
		"individuals; P=0.0003. In HIV infected individuals, commonly isolated NAC spp."
		"were Candida tropicalis, 10(2.8%), C. krusei (Issatschenki orientalis) 9(2.6%)"
		and C. glabrata 8(2.3%). While for non-HIV infected individuals C. dubliniensis
		8(1.3%) and C. tropicalis 5(0.9%) were commonly detected. As CD4 count/μl
		decreases by one unit the risk of being colonized by NAC spp. among HIV infected
		"individuals increases by 1% (OR 1.01, 95% CI; 1.001-1.004, P=0.001). CONCLUSION:"
		The prevalence of NAC spp. is high among HIV-infected individuals with low CD4
		count placing them at higher risk of invasive infections. Further studies to
		investigate the role of NAC spp. in causing invasive infections among
		immunocompromised patients are recommended.

		"methods can be time-consuming, particularly for non-albicans Candida species,"
		"non-Candida yeasts, and moulds. An oligonucleotide array system targeting the"
		internal transcribe spacer (ITS) 1 or 2 region of the rRNA genes was used to
		analyse prospectively 116 fungus-positive blood cultures [BACTEC Myco/F Lytic
		"bottles (Becton-Dickinson Microbiology Systems, Sparks, MD, USA)] from 105"
		"patients, and the results were compared with those obtained using conventional"

		"these microorganisms (isolate no.) included C. albicans (50), C. tropicalis (26),"
		"C. glabrata (18), C. parapsilosis (14), Cryptococcus neoformans (9), Trichosporon"
		"asahii (2), Rhodotorula mucilaginosa (2), Penicillium marneffei (2) and three"
		other species. Multiple species fungaemia (MSF) was detected in ten samples as
		"opposed to six detected using conventional methods. In two discrepant samples,"
		antifungal susceptibility testing revealed that the additionally detected isolate
		had higher MICs of fluconazole. An isolate reported as Rhodotorula glutinis by
		"the Vitek Yeast Biochemical Card (bioMérieux Vitek, Marcy l'Etoile, France) was"
		identified as R. mucilaginosa by the array and the identification by array
		hybridization was confirmed by sequence analysis of the ITS region. A test
		sensitivity of 100% was obtained. The test specificity was 100% according to
		examination of 57 blood samples containing non-target fungal species or bacterium
		"only. From the time at which growth was detected in blood cultures, the entire"
		identification procedure could be completed within 16-24 h.

AB	-	Microbial co-infections may contribute to the pulmonary deterioration in COVID-19
		patients needing intensive care treatment. The present study portrays the extent
		"of co-infections in COVID-19 ICU patients. Conventional culture, molecular"
		"detections for atypical aetiologies, QiaStat-Dx® respiratory panel V2 detecting"
		21 respiratory pathogens and ribosomal DNA genes 16S/18S amplicon-based
		microbiome analyses were performed on respiratory samples from 34 COVID-19
		patients admitted to the ICU. Potential pathogens were detected in seven patients
		"(21%) by culturing, in four patients (12%) by microbiome analysis and in one"
		patient (3%) by respiratory panel. Among 20 patients receiving antibiotics prior
		"to ICU admission, fungi (3 Candida albicans, 1 C. tropicalis, 1 C. dubliniensis)"
		were cultured in 5 (15%) endotracheal aspirates. Among 14 patients who were
		"antibiotic-naive at ICU admission, two patients (6%) had bacterial respiratory"
		"pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae) cultured in"
		their endotracheal aspirates. Microbiome analysis recognized four potential
		"respiratory pathogens (3 Haemophilus influenza, 1 Fusobacterium necrophorum)"
		isolated in samples from four other patients (12%). QiaStat-Dx® respiratory panel
		V2 detected adenovirus in one patient (3%). The prevalence of pulmonary microbial
		co-infections is modest among COVID-19 patients upon admission to ICU. Microbiome
		analysis complements conventional microbial diagnostics in characterization of
		respiratory co-infections.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: The aim of our study was to evaluate the concordance between the
		two antifungal susceptibility testing of Candida sp. isolates using agar
		diffusion method: Neo-Sensitabs(®) tablets and Bio-Rad(®) disks. MATERIALS AND
		METHODS: This is a prospective study conducted in the Laboratory of Parasitology
		and Mycology of the Mohammed V military teaching hospital from February to August
		"2012. Upon receiving blood cultures and peripheral sites samples, the"
		identification of Candida isolates performed using routine phenotypic standard
		tests and the realization of the antifungal susceptibility was carried out on
		Neo-sensitabs(®) tablets and Bio-Rad(®) disks. RESULTS: A total of 38 Candida
		"strains were isolated: 15 C. albicans (39%), 13 C. glabrata (34%), 5 C."
		"tropicalis (13%), 4 C. krusei (11%) and 1 C. dubliniensis (3%). There were no"
		significant difference (P>0.05) in susceptibility rate between both methods for
		all antifungal agents tested except for 5-fluorocytosine. The concordance
		"percentage between two methods was 100% for amphotericin B, 97.4% for"
		"fluconazole, 94.7% for voriconazole and 73% for 5-fluorocytosine. CONCLUSION:"
		"Both methods are easy to perform, rapid and cost effective. Our results showed"
		the best agreement between the two methods for testing the susceptibility of
		"Candida isolates to amphotericin B, fluconazole and voriconazole while for the"
		"5-fluorocytosine, the concordance rate was low."

AB	-	The epidemiology of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) after liver transplantation
		(LT) is continuing to evolve in the current era of antifungal prophylactic
		therapy. This multicenter retrospective cohort study aimed to evaluate the
		"epidemiology, risk factors, and outcomes of IFIs among LT recipients in the"
		current era.We analyzed a total of 482 LT recipients aged 18 years and older who
		were admitted to 3 tertiary hospitals in Korea between January 2009 and February
		2012.Twenty-four episodes of IFIs occurred in 23 patients (4.77%; 23/482). Of
		"these episodes, 20 were proven cases and 4 were probable cases according to"
		"EORTC/MSG criteria. Among these cases, IFI developed within 30 days of"
		"transplantation in 47.8% of recipients, from 31 to 180 days in 34.8% of"
		"recipients, and from 181 to 365 days in 17.4% of recipients. The most common"
		"isolates were Candida species (n = 12, 52.2%; Candida albicans, 6 cases; Candida"
		"tropicalis, 1 case; Candida glabrata, 1 case; Candida parapsilosis, 1 case; and"
		"unspecified Candida species, 1 case) and Aspergillus species (n = 7, 30.4%). The"
		mortality in patients with IFIs was significantly higher than that in patients
		"without IFIs (47.83% [11/23] vs 7.18% [33/459], P < .001). The incidence of"
		"late-onset IFIs is increasing in the antifungal prophylactic era, and"
		fluconazole-resistant non-albicans Candida species have not yet emerged in Korea.

TI	-	Temporary Abdominal Closure Is Associated with Increased Risk for Fungal
		Intra-Abdominal Infections in Trauma Patients.
PG	-	745-751
LID	-	10.1089/sur.2019.286 [doi]
AB	-	Background: Fungal infections are associated with increased morbidity and death.
		Few studies have examined risk factors associated with post-operative fungal
		intra-abdominal infections (FIAIs) in trauma patients after exploratory
		"laparotomy. In this study, we evaluated potential risk factors for acquiring"
		post-operative FIAIs and their impact on clinical outcomes. Methods: This was a
		retrospective analysis of trauma patients admitted from 2005 to 2018 who
		underwent exploratory laparotomy and subsequently had development of
		"intra-abdominal infection (IAI). Demographics, comorbidities, culture data,"
		"antimicrobial usage, Injury Severity Scores (ISS), and clinical outcomes were"
		abstracted. All post-operative IAIs were evaluated and stratified as either
		"bacterial, fungal, combined, and with or without colonization. All groups were"
		compared. Risk factors for the development of post-operative IAI and clinical
		outcomes were analyzed by Student t test and chi-square test. Multi-variable
		logistic regression was used to determine independent predictors of
		post-operative FIAIs. Results: There were 1675 patients identified as having
		"undergone exploratory laparotomy in the setting of traumatic injury, 161 of whom"
		were suspected of having IAI. A total of 105 (6.2%) patients had a diagnosis of
		"IAI. Of these patients, 40 (38%) received a diagnosis of FIAI. The most common"
		"fungal pathogens were unspeciated yeast (48.3%), followed by Candida albicans"
		"(42.7%), C. glabrata (4.5%), C. dubliniensis (2.25%), and C. tropicalis (2.25%)."
		"There were no significant differences in demographics, comorbidities, and"
		percentage of gastric perforations between FIAI and bacterial IAI (BIAI) groups.
		"Patients with FIAIs, however, had a 75% temporary abdominal closure (TAC) rate"
		"compared with 51% in BIAIs (p = 0.01). The FIAI group had higher ISS (27 vs. 22,"
		"p = 0.03), longer hospital days (34 vs. 25, p = 0.02), and longer intensive care"
		"unit (ICU) days (17 vs. 9, p = 0.006) when compared with BIAI. The FIAI group"
		also had a five-fold greater mortality rate. Logistic regression identified TAC
		as an independent risk factor for the development of post-operative FIAIs (odds
		"ratio [OR] 6.16, confidence interval [CI] 1.14-28.0, p = 0.02). Conclusions: An"
		FIAI after exploratory laparotomy was associated with greater morbidity and
		death. A TAC was associated independently with increased risk of FIAI after
		exploratory laparotomy in the setting of traumatic injury. Clinicians should
		suspect fungal infections in trauma patients in whom post-operative IAI develops
		after undergoing exploratory laparotomy using TAC techniques.

TI	-	Oral candidal species among smokers and non-smokers.
PG	-	679-82
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To determine the various oral Candidal species among healthy Malaysian
		adults. DESIGN: Case-control study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: This study was
		"collaborated between the Department of Medical Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine"
		"and Department of Oral Pathology, Oral Medicine and Periodontology, Faculty of"
		"Dentistry, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, between September 2002"
		till January 2004. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred adults (50 smokers and 50
		"non-smokers), aged between 40 and 70 years were studied. Swabs and carbohydrate"
		"assimilation (Saboraud Dextrose Agar, Corn Meal Agar, API 20C AUX System) were"
		"performed. Specimens were collected from dorsum of the tongue, buccal mucosa and"
		commissures (right and left each). Colony forms were established by positive
		"colony forming units, on SDA medium (24-48 hours). Germ tube test for"
		(true/pseudohyphae) growth was done on Corn Meal Agar Medium. Candida biotypes
		"were evaluated by API 20C AUX system, which had a numerical 7 digit profile,"
		added to evaluate a definite Candida species. RESULTS: Thirty-five percent of
		Malaysian adults harbored Candida intraorally. Candidal species identified among
		"100 subjects had C. albicans (27) 77%, C. glabrata (3) 8%, C. famata, C."
		"tropicalis, C. krusei, C. lusitaniae and C. guilliermondii (1) 3% each."
		Thirty-three positive cases comprised of 35 species i.e. two cases had two
		species each. Fifty seven percent of these were smokers and 43% non-smokers.
		"These included 40% Chinese, 36% Malays and 24% Indians. Species were, however,"
		"not specified according to intra-oral sites i.e. buccal, commissural mucosa and"
		dorsum of tongue. CONCLUSION: On this series C. albicans is the most common
		species found in the oral cavity of Malaysian adults. It is equally frequent in
		"smokers and non-smokers, but showed a predilection for the ethnic Chinese group."

AB	-	Contamination of preservation solution (PS) with yeasts during solid organ
		recovery can lead to life-threatening complications in the recipients. The
		prevalence of such a contamination needs to be established. From January 2004 to
		"December 2008, we prospectively investigated the potential fungal contamination"
		of all the PSs collected in our institution using a standardised procedure
		consisting in centrifugation of 10 mL PS and incubation of the pellet seeded on
		"fungal-specific medium for 15 days at 30 degrees C. During the study period, 728"
		"transplantations (397 kidneys, 262 livers and 69 hearts) were performed for which"
		"659 PSs (90.5%) were available. The yeast contamination rate was 0% (0/62), 3.1%"
		"(11/356) and 4.1% (10/241) for heart, kidney and liver transplants, respectively."
		"We identified 10 Candida albicans, five C. glabrata, two C. krusei, one C."
		"tropicalis, one C. valida, one Pichia etchelsii and one Rhodorula sp. Routine"
		bacterial analysis identified only five of these 21 fungal contaminations. Twenty
		recipients were alive after at least one year of follow-up and one died from
		meningeal carcinomatosis at seven months. Three patients were found to have the
		same species of Candida from their surgical drains but did not develop any
		infection or abnormalities upon ultrasound investigation. Fourteen patients
		received antifungal drugs. Yeast contamination occurred in 3.4% of all kidney and
		liver PSs tested. Its clinical consequences and therapeutic management remain to
		be defined. Our study also suggests that optimisation/standardisation of
		"microbiological procedures is warranted, including analysis of large PS volume,"
		seeding of fungal-specific medium and prolonged incubation.

PG	-	157-63
AB	-	"This retrospective study included 18 pediatric cases (median age, 3 years) with"
		pathologically proved hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) from a single institution
		"during 1992 and 2001. There were 9 males and 9 females. Prolonged fever,"
		"cytopenia, liver dysfunction and hepatomegaly were the most common features at"
		presentation. Sixteen (88.9%) cases were previously healthy. The case fatality
		"rate was 61.1%, and all fatal cases died within 2 months of disease onset. The"
		"infectious agents associated with HPS were identified in 11 cases (61.1%), and 8"
		(72.7%) of them had evidence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection or
		reactivation. Underlying immunologic disorder or neoplastic disease was
		identified in 11.1% of the cases. Children less than 3 years of age with HPS were
		more vulnerable to neutropenia-associated bloodstream infection (85.7% vs 27.3%;
		p=0.025). Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3) and Candida tropicalis (2) were the 2 most
		"commonly isolated pathogens. Regarding specific management of HPS, intravenous"
		immunoglobulin and steroids were the first-line agents and were administered in
		"16 cases and 11 cases, respectively, while etoposide was administered in 5"
		refractory cases during the late phase of disease. Most HPS occurred in
		"previously healthy children, and a substantial proportion of cases rapidly"
		"progressed to death. Most cases were associated with viral infection,"
		"particularly EBV, and young children tended to develop neutropenia-associated"
		bacteremia during the active phase of the disease.

PG	-	1366-1369
LID	-	10.1097/ICO.0000000000001727 [doi]
AB	-	"PURPOSE: To evaluate the incidence, clinical course, and management of fungal"
		interface keratitis (IK) after Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK).
		METHODS: This is a single-center retrospective observational case series of 3950
		eyes undergoing DMEK. Six eyes with fungal IK were detected and analyzed.
		"Analysis included graft storage condition, incidence of fungal IK, identification"
		"of the pathogenic agent, topical/systemic and surgical treatment regimen, and"
		best-corrected visual acuity. RESULTS: Fungal IK after DMEK occurred in 6 of 3950
		cases (0.15%). Corneal grafts were either stored in Optisol-GS (n = 4) or in
		"organ culture (n = 2). In all cases, Candida species were isolated (Candida"
		"tropicalis, Candida albicans, Candida orthopsilosis, and Candida guilliermondii)."
		Four eyes developed fungal IK during the early postoperative period (3-5 d) and 2
		eyes later at 16 to 42 days after surgery. All patients received topical and
		systemic antifungal treatment and intracameral application of antifungal agents.
		"In the case of an early infection, graft removal was performed in 3 of 4"
		patients. Late infections were eradicated without graft exchange. Recurrence of
		fungal infection was observed in 1 case after early IK and in both cases after
		late IK. Final visual acuity ranged from 20/200 to 20/20. CONCLUSIONS: Fungal IK
		"is a rare complication after DMEK. Based on our experience, we believe that"
		treatment of early fungal IK with aggressive presentation should include both
		immediate graft exchange and intracameral application of voriconazole and
		"amphotericin, in addition to topical and systemic antifungal treatment. Graft"
		exchange seems not to be mandatory in late infections.

TI	-	Role of environmental surfaces and hands of healthcare workers in perpetuating
		multi-drug-resistant pathogens in a neonatal intensive care unit.
PG	-	619-628
LID	-	10.1007/s00431-021-04241-6 [doi]
AB	-	Neonates admitted to neonatal intensive care units are at a risk of developing
		"healthcare-associated infections, leading to increased risk of mortality. This"
		study aimed to identify organisms causing such late-onset infections in neonates
		and determine whether these isolates were genetically identical to those from the
		surrounding environmental surfaces and hands of healthcare workers (HCWs). A
		cross-sectional study was carried out over a period of 4 months in a university
		neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Samples were collected from all neonates
		with symptoms of late-onset infections (n = 180). Fingerprint samples of 21
		healthcare workers as well as 330 random environmental samples were also taken
		"from the unit. Isolates from neonates, environment and fingerprints were"
		subjected to protein electrophoresis followed by sequencing to detect genetic
		"similarities. Almost half of neonatal samples were culture positive (91/180,"
		"50.6%), out of which 72% of bacterial isolates (49/68) were multi-drug resistant."
		Klebsiella pneumoniae (32.6%) and Candida spp. (28.4%) were the commonest
		neonatal isolates. A cluster of two homologous Klebsiella pneumoniae strains was
		"isolated from a neonate and an examining bed, while another homologous cluster"
		was from a neonatal sample and a portal incubator. A third cluster was isolated
		from hands and three neonatal samples. This cluster (caused by Klebsiella
		pneumoniae strain NH54 chromosome) was found to perpetuate over the 4 months of
		the study. All three clusters were multi-drug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. A
		homologous pair of each of Candida tropicalis and Candida glabrata was isolated
		"from the blood of two neonates, and one neonatal and a crash cart sample,"
		"respectively. Overall, 8.8% (8/91) of neonatal samples were found to be"
		"homologous to other neonatal/environmental/hand isolates, denoting perpetuation"
		of pathogens between neonates themselves and also other reservoirs of
		"infections.Conclusion: The hands of HCWs, crash carts and incubators are"
		reservoirs of pathogens and can lead to nosocomial infections. Clusters of
		multi-drug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and Candida spp. were the predominant
		neonatal pathogens in this NICU. What is Known: • The role of hands and the
		environment in transmission of infections to neonates is a subject of debate. •
		Genetic sequencing provides solid evidence for detecting homologous strains. What
		"is New: • K. pneumoniae was the most frequently isolated pathogen, and"
		concomitant isolation was found in two cases from the neonatal surroundings
		(bed/incubator) and hands. • Candida spp. with homology were also found in
		different neonates and environmental samples suggesting risk of transmission.

PG	-	13-Sep
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: In total, 4502 units of cord blood (CB) were collected during a"
		2-year period from 2005 to 2006 by the Buddhist Tzu-Chi Stem Cells Center. The
		aim of this study was to analyze the incidence of microbial contamination and
		type of organism present in the cord blood. The clinical impact of microbial
		contamination on hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) grafts used for HPC
		transplantation is also discussed. METHODS: First and second specimens were
		obtained for microbial assessment. These were collected in laboratory after cord
		"blood collection and after cord blood unit manipulation, respectively. The"
		samples were cultured and the results reviewed. RESULTS: The overall incidence of
		microbiological contamination was 1.8% (82/4502). Three CB units were
		contaminated with two different organisms. Infectious organisms comprised 9.4%
		(8/85) of total isolated microbes. These infectious microorganisms were
		"beta-Streptococci group B, Candida tropicalis and Staphylococcus aureus which"
		"were isolated in 6, 1 and 1 of CB units respectively. Escherichia coli,"
		"Bacteroides fragilis, Lactobacillus spp., Enterococcus, beta-Streptococcus Group"
		"B, Bacteroides valgatus, Corynebacterium spp., Klebsiella pneumonia and"
		Peptococcus spp. were the most frequently encountered microorganisms. A higher
		contamination rate of the CB units was noted after vaginal delivery (2.16%)
		compared to caesarian section (0.85%) (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Extensive training
		"in CB collection, good procedures and good protocols can decrease the rate of"
		microbial contamination. The use of a closed collecting system and an ex utero
		"method have the advantage of a lower contamination rate. In our cord blood bank,"
		"we use a closed system but an in utero method. Similar to other studies, most of"
		microorganisms reported here as contaminants are non-pathogenic.

AB	-	This study aimed to investigate the epidemiology and microbiology of bloodstream
		infections (BSIs) in patients with haematological malignancies. Clinical
		characteristics and microbiology of 2083 patients with haematological malignancy
		who were treated for BSI from 2008 to 2013 at a medical centre in Taiwan were
		"retrospectively reviewed. Lymphoma (38.1%) was the most common, followed by acute"
		"myeloid leukaemia (30.9%). Of the 2090 non-duplicate BSI isolates, 1310 (62.7%)"
		"were recovered from patients with neutropenia. Of the Gram-negatives (53.7%),"
		"Escherichia coli was predominant (13.8%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae"
		"(9.5%), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii (ACB) complex (5.7%) and"
		"Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.0%). Of the Gram-positives (40.2%), coagulase-negative"
		"staphylococci were the most common (20.5%), followed by Enterococcus faecium"
		(5.6%). Candida tropicalis (2.0%) was the most commonly encountered yeast (5.0%).
		Multidrug resistance (MDR) was identified in 21.8% of ACB complex isolates. Among
		"the 57 Staphylococcus aureus isolates, 24 (42.1%) were resistant to oxacillin"
		"(MRSA), and among the 118 E. faecium isolates, 55 (46.6%) were resistant to"
		vancomycin (VRE). The overall 14-day mortality rate was 12.9% (n = 269). There
		was no significant difference in 14-day mortality among patients with (13.4%) and
		without (11.9%) neutropenia (P = 0.315). Multivariate analysis revealed that age
		"≥60 years, prior allogeneic transplantation, BSI due to VRE (E. faecium) and"
		shock were independent predictors of 14-day mortality. Gram-negative organisms
		continued to be the most common cause of BSI in patients with haematological
		malignancies during the period 2008-2013. There was a significant increase in the
		prevalence of VRE (E. faecium) and MDR-ACB complex isolates.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: A disintegrin and metalloprotein-33 (ADAM33) participates in the
		"bronchial remodeling process in asthma, and genetic analyses pointed it out as a"
		candidate gene in asthma. METHODS: To analyze the association between ADAM33 and
		asthma and total and mite-specific IgE levels in a population of the Caribbean
		"Coast of Colombia, we genotyped 6 single-nucleotide polymorphisms of ADAM33 in"
		"429 asthmatics, 401 controls and 116 family trios using fluorogenic probes. Total"
		and specific IgE against Blomia tropicalis and Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus
		were determined by ELISA. Case-control and family-based analyses were performed.
		Case-control association analyses were corrected by population stratification
		using a set of 52 ancestry-informative markers. RESULTS: Eight common haplotypes
		"were identified; among them, H4 (GCAGGG) was associated with asthma in the family"
		"group (Z score: -2.049, p = 0.04). We also found an association between the TT"
		genotype of ST+7 and asthma in the case-control study (p = 0.05) that disappeared
		"after correcting for multiple testing. In the family-based analysis, this"
		"genotype was a risk factor for asthma (p = 0.01), high total IgE (Z score: 2.546,"
		p = 0.01) and high specific IgE against B. tropicalis (p = 0.02) and D.
		"pteronyssinus (Z score: 2.414, p = 0.01). V4 was associated with specific IgE"
		"against B. tropicalis (p = 0.03); T2 with asthma (p = 0.03), high total IgE (p ="
		0.02) and IgE against D. pteronyssinus (p = 0.03) and T1 with high total IgE (p =
		0.04). None of these associations was maintained after correction for multiple
		testing. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a relevant role of ADAM33 in
		thepathogenesis of asthma in this population.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Persistent Candida from fungal cultures of respiratory secretions are
		often ignored and not treated due to assumptions concerning benign colonization.
		OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical course of patients with chronic sputum and
		"fungi on culture, including response to antifungal treatment. METHODS: All"
		patients seen at a single long term acute care hospital (LTAC) between May 2009
		and September 2010 with at least two months of daily sputum and fungus on more
		"than one sputum culture were identified. LTAC, inpatient, and outpatient records"
		through June 2011 were reviewed to assess clinical features and response to
		"therapy or to cessation of therapy. RESULTS: Eleven patients were identified,"
		"having sputum duration of 5 months to 28 years, and respiratory cultures growing"
		"Candida species. Fungi included C albicans (8 patients), C glabrata (2), C krusei"
		"(2), C tropicalis (1), C parapsilosis (1), Aspergillus fumigatus (1), Aspergillus"
		"terreus (1), and Scedosporium (1), the latter 3 in conjunction with Candida"
		"species. All had abnormal chest CT scans, often with bronchiectasis and sometimes"
		"atelectasis or consolidation, and ten of 11 patients were on chronic steroids"
		"(inhaled and/or systemic). Antifungal therapy, mostly oral voriconazole and"
		"nebulized amphotericin, led to improved respiratory symptoms and sputum within 3"
		weeks in 10 of 10 treated patients. Lack of antifungal therapy or early cessation
		of treatment was associated with progressive or recurrent symptoms and death of
		one patient. CONCLUSIONS: This case series suggests that chronic candidal
		bronchitis is associated with significant morbidity and responds well to
		treatment. Such patients may benefit from extended antifungal therapy. Guidelines
		for the treatment of Candida in pulmonary secretions should be reevaluated.

		the difference in infection patterns between the burn intensive care unit (BICU)
		and burn common wards (BCW) have not been clearly investigated. The present study
		"aimed to compare the infection profile, antimicrobial resistance, and their"

		"analyzed between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2019, in the Institute of Burn"
		"Research in Southwest China. The patient information, pathogen distribution,"
		"sources, and antimicrobial resistance were retrospectively collected. A total of"
		"3457 and 4219 strains were detected in BICU and BCW, respectively. Wound"
		"secretions accounted for 86.6% and 44.9% in BCW and BICU, respectively. Compared"
		"with samples in BCW, samples in BICU had more fungi (11.8% vs. 8.1%), more"
		"Gram-negative bacteria (60.0% vs. 50.8%), and less Gram-positive bacteria (28.2%"
		"vs. 41.1%). Acinetobacter baumannii were the most common pathogen in BICU,"
		compared with Staphylococcus aureus in BCW. S. aureus was the most frequent
		"pathogen in wound secretions and tissues from both BICU and BCW. However, A."
		"baumannii were the first in blood, sputum, and catheter samples from BICU."
		"Overall, the multidrug-resistance (MDR) rate was higher in BICU than in BCW."
		"However, the gap between BICU and BCW gradually shortened from 2011 to 2019. The"
		"prevalence of MDR A. baumannii and Klebsiella pneumonia significantly increased,"
		"especially in BCW. Furthermore, Carbapenem resistance among K. pneumoniae"
		significantly increased in BICU (4.5% in 2011 vs. 40% in 2019) and BCW (0 in 2011
		"vs. 40% in 2019). However, the percentage of MDR P. aeruginosa sharply dropped"
		from 85.7% to 24.5% in BICU. The incidence of MRSA was significantly higher in
		BICU than in BCW (94.2% vs. 71.0%) and stayed at a high level in BICU (89.5% to
		96.3%). C. tropicalis and C. albicans were the two most frequent fungi. No
		resistance to Amphotericin B was detected. Our study shows that the infection
		"profile is different between BICU and BCW, and multidrug resistance is more"
		"serious in BICU than BCW. Therefore, different infection-control strategies"
		should be emphasized in different burn populations.

		with nosocomial urinary tract infections.
PG	-	541-546
LID	-	10.1111/ggi.13661 [doi]
AB	-	AIM: The aim of the present study was to investigate predominant pathogens and
		predictors of 28-day mortality of older Chinese patients with nosocomial urinary
		tract infections (NUTI). METHODS: We retrospectively studied 1122 older patients
		"(aged ≥60 years) with culture-positive NUTI in Guangdong General Hospital,"
		"Guangzhou, China, from January 2009 to December 2014. The clinical features,"
		microbial distributions and outcomes of these patients were recorded and compared
		between survival and death patients. Multivariate logistic regression was carried
		out to identify independent predictors of 28-day mortality. RESULTS: The present
		"results showed the all-cause mortality was 8.3%, and NUTI mortality was 1.43%."
		"The proportions of Candida albicans (P = 0.004), Acinetobacter baumannii (P"
		= 0.045) and Candida tropicalis (P < 0.001) in the death group were significantly
		higher than those in the survival group. Multivariate analysis showed two novel
		"risk factors for mortality of older patients with NUTI, which were higher"
		"Charlson Comorbidity Index (odds ratio [OR] 1.205, 95% confidence interval (CI)"
		"1.088-1.334] and lower level of serum prealbumin (OR 0.995, 95% CI 0.990-0.999)."
		"Furthermore, previous use of antibiotics (OR 1.984, 95% CI 1.106-3.559),"
		"inappropriate antimicrobial therapy (OR 1.883, 95% CI 1.144-3.098), intensive"
		"care unit stay (OR 4.082, 95% CI 2.469-6.749) and higher concentration of serum"
		"C-reactive protein (OR 1.005, 95% CI 1.001-1.010) were independent prognostic"
		factors for 28-day mortality in older patients with NUTI. CONCLUSIONS: NUTI is
		associated with a high 28-day in-hospital mortality rate in older patients. We
		"should evaluate the comorbidity, nutritional status, inflammatory markers,"
		"department staying and drug sensitivity test, and choose systematic therapy"
		strategies for these older patients with NUTI. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2019; 19:
		541-546.

		"part of the protocol, without ocular discomfort. In the fundoscopic examination,"
		a whitish chorioretinal lesion was found in the left eye in relation to
		"subretinal abscess, which correlated with retinal angiography and optical"
		coherence tomography. The patient was treated with systemic antifungals with a
		favourable resolution of the lesion.

		agents.
PG	-	725-732
LID	-	10.1093/mmy/myw030 [doi]
AB	-	This paper presents data on fungal peritonitis (FP) in patients undergoing
		"peritoneal dialysis (PD) at the University Hospital of Botucatu Medical School,"
		"São Paulo, Brazil. In a total of 422 patients, 30 developed FP, from which the"
		medical records and the fungal isolates of 23 patient cases were studied. All
		"patients presented abdominal pain, cloudy peritoneal effluent, needed"
		"hospitalization, had the catheter removed and were treated with fluconazole or"
		fluconazole plus 5-flucitosine; six of them died due to FP. Concerning the
		"agents, it was observed that Candida parapsilosis was the leading species (9/23),"
		"followed by Candida albicans (5/23), Candida orthopsilosis (4/23), Candida"
		"tropicalis (3/23), Candida guilliermondii (1/23), and Kodamaea ohmeri (1/23). All"
		"the isolates were susceptible to amphotericin B, voriconazole and caspofungin"
		whereas C. albicans isolates were susceptible to all antifungals tested.
		"Resistance to fluconazole was observed in three isolates of C. orthopsilosis, and"
		dose-dependent susceptibility to this antifungal was observed in two isolates of
		C. parapsilosis and in the K. ohmeri isolate. Biofilm production estimates were
		"high or moderate in most isolates, especially in C. albicans species, and low in"
		"C. parapsilosis species, with a marked variation among the isolates. This"
		"Brazilian study reinforces that FP in PD is caused by a diverse group of yeasts,"
		"most prevalently C. parapsilosis sensu stricto species. In addition, they present"
		"significant variation in susceptibility to antifungals and biofilm production,"
		thus contributing to the complexity and severity of the clinical features.

TI	-	Evaluating the effect of soft lining materials on the growth of yeast.
PG	-	404-9
AB	-	STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Soft lining materials continue to have a place in clinical
		"removable prosthodontics. However, there is an increased probability of yeast"
		colonization on soft lining materials. PURPOSE: This study (1) assessed a method
		of evaluating the effect of long-term soft lining materials on the growth of
		yeast and (2) investigated the effect five soft lining materials had on the
		"growth of three species of yeast. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Coe Supersoft, Novus, and"
		three experimental soft lining materials were investigated together with Candida
		"albicans, Candida tropicalis, and Issatchenkia orientalis (formerly Candida"
		krusei) yeasts. Strips of soft lining material incubated on blood agar plates
		were examined for inhibition of the growth of yeast. Soft lining materials soaked
		in sterile trypticase soya broth or water were inoculated with yeast and
		incubated. The change in colony forming units per milliliter from the initial
		load of yeast at 3 days was measured. Statistical analysis was performed with an
		independent paired Student t test. RESULTS: Inhibition of yeast growth occurred
		for two soft lining materials. Despite the presence of sufficient viable
		"organisms, differences between the initial load of yeast and the 3-day results"
		"were mostly small, both for the test and control groups, suggesting that the"
		material does not support the growth of the tested yeast during this period.
		CONCLUSIONS: The often described increased prevalence of yeast associated with
		soft lining materials in the oral environment is likely related to readily
		available nutrients in the mouth and the difficulty in maintaining and cleaning
		these materials.

TI	-	High Incidences of Invasive Fungal Infections in Acute Myeloid Leukemia Patients
		Receiving Induction Chemotherapy without Systemic Antifungal Prophylaxis: A
		Prospective Observational Study in Taiwan.
PG	-	e0128410
LID	-	10.1371/journal.pone.0128410 [doi]
LID	-	e0128410
AB	-	Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) is an important complication for acute myeloid
		"leukemia (AML) patients receiving induction chemotherapy. However, the"
		"epidemiological information is not clear in Southeastern Asia, an area of"
		"potential high incidences of IFIs. To clarify it, we enrolled 298 non-M3 adult"
		AML patients receiving induction chemotherapy without systemic anti-fungal
		"prophylaxis from Jan 2004 to Dec 2009, when we applied a prospective diagnostic"
		"and treatment algorithm for IFIs. Their demographic parameters, IFI characters,"
		and treatment outcome were collected for analysis. The median age of these
		patients was 51 years. Standard induction chemotherapy was used for 246 (82.6%)
		"patients, and 66.8% of patients achieved complete remission (CR) or partial"
		"remission. The incidence of all-category IFIs was 34.6% (5.7% proven IFIs, 5.0%"
		probable IFIs and 23.8% possible IFIs). Candida tropicalis was the leading
		"pathogen among yeast, and lower respiratory tract was the most common site for"
		"IFIs (75.4%, 80/106). Standard induction chemotherapy and failure to CR were"
		identified as risk factors for IFIs. The presence of IFI in induction
		"independently predicted worse survival (hazard ratio 1.536 (1.100-2.141), p value"
		"= 0.012). Even in those who survived from the initial IFI insults after 3 months,"
		the presence of IFIs in induction still predicted a poor long-term survival. This
		"study confirms high incidences of IFIs in Southeastern Asia, and illustrates"
		potential risk factors; poor short-term and long-term outcomes are also
		demonstrated. This epidemiological information will provide useful perspectives
		"for anti-fungal prophylaxis and treatment for AML patients during induction, so"
		that best chances of cure and survival can be provided.

AB	-	Vertebral osteomyelitis also known as discitis/pyogenic spondylitis refers to
		inflammation of the vertebral disc space. It is commonly seen in men and adults
		more than 50 years of age. Fungal osteomyelitis is a rare scenario compared to
		its bacterial counterpart. Spinal epidural abscess is a dangerous complication
		"associated with vertebral osteomyelitis. Here, we report two cases of vertebral"
		osteomyelitis caused by Candida tropicalis in patients with renal disorders
		(stage 5 chronic kidney disease and nephropathy). One of the case discussed here
		presented with spinal epidural abscess. Both the patients were started on
		antifungal therapy. One patient responded to treatment while the other was lost
		to follow up.

AB	-	Dengue is the major cause of arthropod-borne viral disease in the world. It
		"presents with high fever, headache, rash, myalgia, and arthralgia and it is a"
		self-limiting illness. Severe dengue can occur in some cases resulting in dengue
		hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). We present a case of a
		"32-year-old male patient of high-grade fever, bilateral subconjunctival"
		"hemorrhages, swelling on hands and lips, and nasal bleeding. After"
		"investigations, he was diagnosed with dengue fever and it was observed that he"
		developed systemic fungal infection secondary to Candida tropicalis infection.
		The patient's bone marrow biopsy showed hemophagocytic activity. He also
		"developed hepatitis E infection while hepatitis A, B, or C serology profile"
		showed no active infection. The bilateral iliopsoas hematoma was also observed on
		CT scan manifested by decreased power in bilateral lower limbs and pain in the
		right leg. The patient was treated in the hospital with antibiotics (ceftriaxone
		2 g once daily for 14 days) and antifungal (fluconazole 200 mg per oral initially
		"for one day then 100 mg daily for 13 days) medicines, and his condition improved"
		on discharge. There is evidence of variable presentations of dengue fever after
		"the disease burden is increased, and thus, diagnosing with such manifestations"
		can be very challenging.

		who received caspofungin 35-50 mg/day for up to 100 days after transplantation as
		"primary antifungal prophylaxis between January 1, 2002, and June 30, 2005."
		MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Data were collected on host and transplant
		"characteristics such as transplant type, neutropenia, graft-versus-host disease"
		"(GVHD), and corticosteroid use, as well as evidence of breakthrough invasive"
		"fungal infections. Of the 123 patients, 117 (95.1%) were allogeneic recipients,"
		and the median time to engraftment was 12 days (range 6-26 days). Fifty (40.7%)
		of the patients developed GVHD of grade 2 or greater and received corticosteroids
		for more than 21 days. Median duration of caspofungin prophylaxis was 73 days
		(range 10-100 days). Nine patients (7.3%) developed breakthrough invasive fungal
		infections (two cases of mixed Aspergillus species and one each of Aspergillus
		"terreus, Rhizopus, Exserohilum, an unspecified mold, Cryptococcus, Candida"
		"glabrata, and Candida tropicalis). Median time to invasive fungal infection"
		development was 65 days (range 12-88 days). Only one case occurred during the
		neutropenic period before engraftment. Multivariate analysis showed that
		Pseudomonas coinfection (p=0.04) and infliximab therapy (p=0.02) were associated
		with breakthrough invasive fungal infections in patients receiving caspofungin.
		"By day 100, there were five (4.1%) deaths, two of which were directly"
		attributable to invasive fungal infections. No caspofungin-related adverse events
		were reported. CONCLUSION: Caspofungin seems to be an effective and
		well-tolerated option for primary antifungal prophylaxis in the highly
		immunosuppressed stem cell transplant patient population.

TI	-	Necrotizing fasciitis following a motor vehicle accident with Candida species as
		the sole organisms.
PG	-	43-6
AB	-	Necrotizing soft-tissue infections exclusively due to Candida species are rare
		and not usually considered in the differential diagnosis of this devastating
		"condition. When documented previously, Candida species are generally proposed to"
		be a saprophytic component of multibacterial synergistic infection often
		associated with streptococcal species. We report a case of a 51-year-old man who
		developed necrotizing fasciitis secondary to Candida infection following a motor
		vehicle accident. His clinical presentation was very similar to that of
		clostridial gas gangrene. The only organisms isolated from tissue culture were
		Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis. Histopathology confirmed yeast forms and
		pseudohyphae within the debrided tissue specimens. No bacteria were identified on
		any of the wound swabs or tissue specimens. Our report is the first that reveals
		Candida as the sole identifiable cause for necrotizing fasciitis following
		trauma. Candida should be considered in the differential diagnosis of causative
		organisms for necrotizing fasciitis and infective myonecrosis.

TI	-	Fungal endophthalmitis: fourteen years' experience from a center in India.
PG	-	1400-7
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: As fungal endophthalmitis is an emerging challenge, the study was"
		carried out to determine the prevalence and the spectrum of fungal agents causing
		"endophthalmitis from a single center, to identify the risk factors, and to"
		correlate clinical course of illness with the agents involved. METHODS: The
		microbiological and clinical records of all fungal endophthalmitis diagnosed
		during January 1992 through December 2005 at a tertiary center in India were
		"reviewed retrospectively. During this period, treatment protocol of the patients"
		"with fungal endophthalmitis was pars plana vitrectomy, instillation of"
		intravitreal amphotericin B (5 microg) and dexamethasone (400 microg).
		"Additionally, oral fluconazole (27 patients) or itraconazole (78 patients) was"
		given in 105 patients. RESULTS: Fungal endophthalmitis was diagnosed in 113
		"patients and they were categorized into: postcataract surgery (53 patients),"
		"posttrauma (48), and endogenous (12) groups. Aspergillus species was the most"
		"common (54.4%) agent isolated, followed by yeasts (24.6%), and melanized fungi"
		"(10.5%). Among Aspergilli, Aspergillus flavus was the most common (24.6%) species"
		whereas Candida tropicalis (8.8%) was in the yeast. Other rare agents isolated
		"include Fonsecaea pedrosoi, Fusarium solani, Paecilomyces lilacinus,"
		"Pseudallescheria boydii, Colletotrichum dematium, Cryptococcus neoformans, and"
		"Trichosporon cutaneum. Visual acuity after therapy remained <20/400 in 77.4%,"
		"64.3%, 50.0%, and 16.7% patients infected with Aspergillus species, yeasts,"
		"melanized fungi and other mycelial fungi, respectively. The outcome was"
		"unfavorable in 52.8%, 66.7%, and 33.3% patients with postoperative, posttrauma,"
		"and endogenous groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the largest"
		series of fungal endophthalmitis from a single center and highlights the fact
		that a vast array of fungi can cause endophthalmitis though Aspergilli are the
		common agents. The combination of pars plana vitrectomy and intravitreal
		amphotericin B with or without fluconazole/itraconazole was the common mode of
		"therapy in such patients. However, the main challenge is suspecting fungal"
		etiology at the time of presentation and accurately diagnosing those patients.

TI	-	Nosocomial breakthrough fungaemia during antifungal prophylaxis or empirical
		antifungal therapy in 41 cancer patients receiving antineoplastic chemotherapy:
		analysis of aetiology risk factors and outcome.
PG	-	373-80
AB	-	Forty-one episodes of breakthrough fungaemia occurring over a 7.5 year period in
		"the National and St Elizabeth's Cancer Institutes in Bratislava, Slovakia, were"
		analysed. Five of them occurred during prophylaxis with fluconazole (one
		"Torulopsis glabrata, one Hansenula anomala, two Candida krusei and one Candida"
		"parapsilosis), ten with itraconazole (three Trichosporon pullulans, one"
		"Trichosporon beigelii, one Cryptococcus laurentii, three Candida albicans and two"
		"T. glabrata), 11 during prophylaxis with ketoconazole (one Candida norvegenesis,"
		"one C. parapsilosis, one C. krusei, one Candida tropicalis, five C. albicans, one"
		Candida stellatoidea and one C. laurentii and 15 during empirical therapy with
		"amphotericin B (ten C. albicans, two T. beigelii and three Candida lusitaniae)."
		"The most frequent risk factors for breakthrough fungaemia were neutropenia,"
		previous therapy with multiple antibiotics and recent catheter insertion.
		Comparing these episodes with 38 non-breakthrough fungaemias (appearing at the
		same institute in the same period) differences in certain risk factors were
		noted: breakthrough fungaemias were more frequently observed in patients with
		"acute leukaemia (39.0% vs 5.2%, P < 0.001), mucositis (34.2% vs 13.1%, P < 0.05),"
		"prophylaxis with quinolones (58.5% vs 15.8%, P < 0.0001) and catheter-associated"
		"infections (29.3% vs 2.6%, P < 0.003). In this subgroup overall mortality (36.6%"
		vs 28.8%) or early attributable mortality (22.0% vs 23.6%) were not significantly
		different.

TI	-	Sequential endoscopic and robot-assisted surgical solutions for a rare fungal
		"spondylodiscitis, secondary lumbar spinal stenosis, and subsequent discal"
		pseudocyst causing acute cauda equina syndrome: a case report.
PG	-	34
LID	-	10.1186/s12893-022-01493-3 [doi]
LID	-	34
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Fungal spondylodiscitis is a rare infectious disease. The secondary
		lumbar spinal stenosis and postoperative discal pseudocyst were even rarer. The
		"surgical interventions were disputed, yet endoscopic and robot-assisted"
		techniques may be helpful under different circumstances. CASE PRESENTATION: A
		62-year-old female was diagnosed as infectious spondylodiscitis at the L4/5 level
		and a posterolateral endoscopic debridement was performed after invalid
		"conservative therapy. Causative organism culture revealed a rare fungus, Candida"
		tropicalis. A secondary spinal stenosis with refractory radiculopathy occurred
		almost 3 years after the first surgery and a successful endoscopic surgery was
		"implemented aiming to decompress the nerve in a minimally invasive way. However,"
		"2 months later, the patient manifested severe acute cauda equina syndrome and"
		radiological examinations suggested a rare postoperative discal pseudocyst. A
		laminectomy followed by a pseudocystectomy was applied to achieve thorough
		decompression. An innovative double trajectory system (simultaneous traditional
		pedicle screw and cortical bone trajectory screw) accompanied by posterolateral
		fusion was designed and executed by the professional robot-assisted system.
		CONCLUSION: Endoscopic and robot-assisted techniques may provide alternative
		solutions for fungal spondylodiscitis and accompanied sequelae.

TI	-	Candida meningitis in children: report of two cases.
PG	-	339-44
AB	-	Candida meningitis is rare in children. However reports have been increasing
		recently. We report two cases of meningitis caused by Candida species. The first
		case was a term male infant who was admitted at 14 days of age with the diagnosis
		of possible sepsis. He had received multiple courses of antibiotics without
		improvement. Later his cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture grew Candida tropicalis.
		The damage done by the infection was severe and the patient died. The second case
		was a 2-month old girl who was born at 34 weeks of gestation. She was admitted to
		the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) and given antibiotics as prophylaxis.
		Despite this she developed recurrent episodes of fever that required multiple
		"courses of antibiotics. After discharging her, she continued to have fever. Upon"
		"investigation, her blood and CSF grew Candida albicans. She was treated and"
		responded to therapy.

TI	-	Infectious complications in left ventricular assist device recipients.
PG	-	18-23
AB	-	The left ventricular assist device (LVAD) has revolutionized the care of patients
		with heart failure who are awaiting transplantation. Despite reports of
		"significant infection rates associated with LVAD implantation, few data are"
		available concerning the management of LVAD-related infections and their impact
		on transplantation. Eight (40%) of our first 20 LVAD recipients developed
		infections. LVAD-related bloodstream infection occurred in three (15%) patients;
		"infection was due to Staphylococcus aureus in one case, coagulase-negative"
		"staphylococci in the second case, and S. aureus and Candida tropicalis in the"
		third case. All three patients were treated with courses of antibiotics that were
		appropriate for prosthetic valve endocarditis and received antibiotics for at
		least 6 weeks. All infected patients underwent successful transplantation and had
		no evidence of recurrence of infection up to 16 months postoperatively. Our
		experience suggests that LVAD infections can be successfully treated without
		device removal and that cardiac transplantation can be performed in individuals
		with LVAD-related bloodstream infection.

		gynecological problem but hemoperitoneum due to endometriosis has been reported
		to be extremely rare in hemodialysis (HD) patients. A 25-year-old female HD
		"patient was admitted to our clinic with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and"
		weight loss for last 3 months. Candida tropicalis and Candida glabrata were
		isolated in the fungal cultures from peritoneal fluid. Her abdominal computerized
		"tomography scan has shown irregular peritoneal calcifications, diffuse peritoneal"
		"thickening, dilatation of the small bowel loops, and cocoon formation which all"
		were typical for EPS. Hemoperitoneum was reported to recur for four times with
		"intervals suggesting menstrual cycles. Her peritoneal biopsy, along with the"
		"signs of EPS, has also revealed the presence of endometriosis. The patient died"
		with symptoms of septic shock in the first year of EPS diagnosis.

PG	-	3544-3548
LID	-	10.1016/j.radcr.2021.08.052 [doi]
AB	-	"Sepsis and bleeding can lead to life-threatening complications, such as"
		"stent-graft infection and pseudoaneurysm, after stent-graft implantation. An 83"
		year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for sepsis 14 months after treatment
		with a balloon-expandable stent-graft for an arterio-ureteral fistula (AUF)
		between the right external iliac artery and the right ureter. Blood cultures were
		positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Candida tropicalis.
		A giant infectious pseudoaneurysm (44 × 70 mm) at the distal edge of the
		stent-graft was suspected of having caused the sepsis. Although endovascular
		"therapy (EVT) was planned to correct the pseudoaneurysm, the right iliac artery"
		spontaneously became occluded from the ostium of the right common iliac artery to
		"the common femoral artery 5 days after diagnosing the pseudoaneurysm; hence, EVT"
		"was not performed. Antibiotic administration was continued, and blood culture"
		"results were negative. Although EVT using a stent graft for AUFs is effective,"
		"data on the chronic phase outcomes are limited. Therefore, patients with AUFs"
		treated using stent-grafts should be carefully followed up.

TI	-	Idiopathic ileal volvulus with multiple concomitant infections in a starving man.
PG	-	81-85
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Small bowel volvulus is defined as the torsion of the small
		"intestine, potentially leading to bowel obstruction, gangrene and perforation. It"
		"is a rare condition, especially in adults. CASE PRESENTATION: A 30-year-old man"
		was retrieved from the jungle with severe weight loss and abdominal symptoms. He
		succumbed to death despite 22 days of intensive medical treatment. An autopsy
		revealed a ruptured gangrenous ileal volvulus with peritonitis and
		subdiaphragmatic abscess. Further laboratory analysis detected systemic Candida
		"tropicalis and intestinal gramnegative bacterial sepsis, systemic Zika virus"
		"viremia, leptospirosis complicating rhabdomyolysis and disseminated intravascular"
		"coagulopathy, Type I Herpes Simplex virus infection of the tongue and upper"
		"gastrointestinal tract. The cause of death was the ruptured ileal volvulus,"
		complicated with upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to Herpes simplex virus
		esophagitis in a malnourished patient with resolving leptospirosis and underlying
		Zika virus co-infection. CONCLUSION: Rare clinical scenarios of adult-onset
		intestinal volvulus with concomitant multiple infections precludes clinical
		"diagnosis and early treatment, leading to devastating consequences of clinical"
		outcome. The positive clinical and postmortem correlation is a good learning
		lesson in many disciplines of medicine and science.

		Report and Literature Review of Candida-Associated Longitudinal Melanonychia
		Striata.
PG	-	e14248
LID	-	10.7759/cureus.14248 [doi]
LID	-	e14248
AB	-	"Longitudinal melanonychia striata, presenting as a black linear vertical band of"
		"the nail plate, can be caused by pigmented lesions and non-pigmented etiologies."
		"A fungal infection of the nail plate, also referred to as onychomycosis or tinea"
		"unguim, can result from dermatophytes, non-dermatophyte molds, and Candida."
		"Albeit rare, Candida-associated fungal melanonychia can present as a longitudinal"
		black nail plate streak. The case of a 79-year-old man who developed a solitary
		linear black streak on his right fourth fingernail after a prior history of
		recent trauma to the digit's nail folds is described; the fungal culture grew
		"Candida parapsilosis. Including our patient, Candida-associated longitudinal"
		melanonychia striata has been described in four women and two men ranging in age
		"from 40 to 79 years (median, 70 years) at diagnosis. The black streak, present"
		"from one month to one year (median, seven months), affected either a hand digit"
		(five patients) or the great toe (one patient). Fungal organisms were visualized
		"on either a potassium hydroxide preparation (one patient), pathologic evaluation"
		"of a nail plate specimen (three patients), or both (one patient). Culture grew"
		"Candida parapsilosis (two patients), Candida species (two patients), Candida"
		"albicans (one patient), and Candida tropicalis (one patient). All of the patients"
		experienced clinical improvement after treatment. Topical treatment (5%
		amorolfine hydrochloride nail lacquer for two patients or modified Castellani
		paint and 1% clotrimazole cream for one man) or oral itraconazole (either as
		monotherapy for two women or combined with 5% amorolfine hydrochloride nail
		lacquer for one woman) was successfully used. Although the clinical presentation
		of fungal melanonychia can mimic subungual melanoma when it appears as a solitary
		"black linear vertical nail plate streak, investigative studies--such as a"
		"potassium hydroxide preparation, nail plate pathology, nail matrix biopsy, and/or"
		fungal culture--can be used to establish the diagnosis of Candida-associated
		longitudinal melanonychia striata and exclude the diagnosis of a pigmented
		melanocytic tumor.

TI	-	Pure distraction injury of T1-2 with quad fever.
PG	-	1044-1050
LID	-	10.1007/s00586-017-5232-2 [doi]
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: We report a pure distraction injury of the upper thoracic spine and
		uncontrolled hyperthermia without an infectious cause. Quad fever appears in the
		first several weeks to months after a cervical or upper thoracic SCI and is
		characterized by an extreme elevation in body core temperature beyond 40 °C
		without an infectious cause. Discriminating between infectious and noninfectious
		"causes is important, and a thorough clinical assessment is required. MATERIALS"
		AND METHODS: A 52-year-old male visited the emergency room complaining of back
		pain with complete paralysis [American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) A] of
		both lower extremities after a pedestrian-motor vehicle accident. He had trouble
		breathing due to a hemothorax and flail chest caused by fractures of the right
		second to eleventh and left fourth to seventh ribs. A computed tomography scan
		revealed severe distraction of the T1-2 intervertebral space. A magnetic
		resonance image showed signal changes in the spinal cord and a clean-cut margin
		between the T1-2 disc and T2 body. The neurological level of injury was C8 upon
		the initial neurological assessment. Emergency surgery was performed. C6-T3
		posterior instrumentation and an autologous iliac bone graft were performed.
		"RESULTS: After surgery, the core temperature increased gradually to above 38.0 °C"
		on post-trauma day 4 and increased to 40.8 °C on post-trauma day 7. None of the
		"repeated aerobic, anaerobic, or fungal cultures of the blood, tracheal aspirate,"
		"line tips, urine, or stool was positive until post-trauma day 21, when Candida"
		"tropicalis was identified in the urine culture. On post-trauma day 63, the blood"
		"pressure, pulse, and body temperature stabilized and the patient was transferred"
		"to the general ward. At post-trauma year 6, the injury state was still complete"
		and the neurological level of injury was changed to C4. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the
		"Grand Round case and relevant literature, we discuss the case of pure distraction"
		injury of T1-2 with quad fever. Spinal surgeons should be knowledgeable regarding
		quad fever as well as the differential diagnoses and treatment strategies.
