AB	-	BACKGROUND: Despite the adoption of strict infection prevention and control
		"measures, many hospitals have reported outbreaks of multidrug-resistant organisms"
		(MDRO) during the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Following an outbreak of
		"carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) in our institution, we sought"
		"to systematically analyse characteristics of MDRO outbreaks in times of COVID-19,"
		focussing on contributing factors and specific challenges in controlling these
		outbreaks. METHODS: We describe results of our own CRAB outbreak investigation
		and performed a systematic literature review for MDRO (including Candida auris)
		outbreaks which occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic (between December 2019 and
		March 2021). Search terms were related to pathogens/resistance mechanisms AND
		COVID-19. We summarized outbreak characteristics in a narrative synthesis and
		contrasted contributing factors with implemented control measures. RESULTS: The
		CRAB outbreak occurred in our intensive care units between September and December
		2020 and comprised 10 patients (thereof seven with COVID-19) within two distinct
		genetic clusters (both ST2 carrying OXA-23). Both clusters presumably originated
		"from COVID-19 patients transferred from the Balkans. Including our outbreak, we"
		"identified 17 reports, mostly caused by Candida auris (n = 6) or CRAB (n = 5),"
		with an overall patient mortality of 35% (68/193). All outbreaks involved
		intensive care settings. Non-adherence to personal protective equipment (PPE) or
		"hand hygiene (n = 11), PPE shortage (n = 8) and high antibiotic use (n = 8) were"
		"most commonly reported as contributing factors, followed by environmental"
		"contamination (n = 7), prolonged critical illness (n = 7) and lack of trained HCW"
		"(n = 7). Implemented measures mainly focussed on PPE/hand hygiene audits (n = 9),"
		environmental cleaning/disinfection (n = 9) and enhanced patient screening
		"(n = 8). Comparing potentially modifiable risk factors and control measures, we"
		found the largest discrepancies in the areas of PPE shortage (risk factor in 8
		"studies, addressed in 2 studies) and patient overcrowding (risk factor in 5"
		"studies, addressed in 0 studies). CONCLUSIONS: Reported MDRO outbreaks during the"
		COVID-19 pandemic were most often caused by CRAB (including our outbreak) and C.
		"auris. Inadequate PPE/hand hygiene adherence, PPE shortage, and high antibiotic"
		use were the most commonly reported potentially modifiable factors contributing
		to the outbreaks. These findings should be considered for the prevention of MDRO
		outbreaks during future COVID-19 waves.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candida auris is an emerging and multidrug-resistant pathogen. Here
		we report the epidemiology of a hospital outbreak of C. auris colonization and
		infection. METHODS: After identification of a cluster of C. auris infections in
		"the neurosciences intensive care unit (ICU) of the Oxford University Hospitals,"
		"United Kingdom, we instituted an intensive patient and environmental screening"
		program and package of interventions. Multivariable logistic regression was used
		to identify predictors of C. auris colonization and infection. Isolates from
		patients and from the environment were analyzed by whole-genome sequencing.
		RESULTS: A total of 70 patients were identified as being colonized or infected
		"with C. auris between February 2, 2015, and August 31, 2017; of these patients,"
		66 (94%) had been admitted to the neurosciences ICU before diagnosis. Invasive C.
		auris infections developed in 7 patients. When length of stay in the
		neurosciences ICU and patient vital signs and laboratory results were controlled
		"for, the predictors of C. auris colonization or infection included the use of"
		"reusable skin-surface axillary temperature probes (multivariable odds ratio,"
		"6.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.96 to 15.63; P<0.001) and systemic"
		"fluconazole exposure (multivariable odds ratio, 10.34; 95% CI, 1.64 to 65.18;"
		"P=0.01). C. auris was rarely detected in the general environment. However, it was"
		"detected in isolates from reusable equipment, including multiple axillary"
		skin-surface temperature probes. Despite a bundle of infection-control
		"interventions, the incidence of new cases was reduced only after removal of the"
		temperature probes. All outbreak sequences formed a single genetic cluster within
		the C. auris South African clade. The sequenced isolates from reusable equipment
		were genetically related to isolates from the patients. CONCLUSIONS: The
		transmission of C. auris in this hospital outbreak was found to be linked to
		"reusable axillary temperature probes, indicating that this emerging pathogen can"
		persist in the environment and be transmitted in health care settings. (Funded by

AB	-	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
		"infects intestinal cells, and might affect the intestinal microbiota. We"
		investigated changes in the fecal fungal microbiomes (mycobiome) of patients with
		SARS-CoV-2 infection during hospitalization and on recovery. METHODS: We
		performed deep shotgun metagenomic sequencing analysis of fecal samples from 30
		"patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hong Kong, from February 5"
		"through May 12, 2020. Fecal samples were collected 2 to 3 times per week from"
		time of hospitalization until discharge. We compared fecal mycobiome compositions
		of patients with COVID-19 with those from 9 subjects with community-acquired
		pneumonia and 30 healthy individuals (controls). We assessed fecal mycobiome
		profiles throughout time of hospitalization until clearance of SARS-CoV-2 from
		nasopharyngeal samples. RESULTS: Patients with COVID-19 had significant
		"alterations in their fecal mycobiomes compared with controls, characterized by"
		"enrichment of Candia albicans and a highly heterogeneous mycobiome configuration,"
		at time of hospitalization. Although fecal mycobiomes of 22 patients with
		COVID-19 did not differ significantly from those of controls during times of
		"hospitalization, 8 of 30 patients with COVID-19 had continued significant"
		"differences in fecal mycobiome composition, through the last sample collected."
		The diversity of the fecal mycobiome of the last sample collected from patients
		with COVID-19 was 2.5-fold higher than that of controls (P < .05). Samples
		collected at all timepoints from patients with COVID-19 had increased proportions
		"of opportunistic fungal pathogens, Candida albicans, Candida auris, and"
		Aspergillus flavus compared with controls. Two respiratory-associated fungal
		"pathogens, A. flavus and Aspergillus niger, were detected in fecal samples from a"
		"subset of patients with COVID-19, even after clearance of SARS-CoV-2 from"
		nasopharyngeal samples and resolution of respiratory symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: In a
		"pilot study, we found heterogeneous configurations of the fecal mycobiome, with"
		"enrichment of fungal pathogens from the genera Candida and Aspergillus, during"
		hospitalization of 30 patients with COVID-19 compared with controls. Unstable gut
		mycobiomes and prolonged dysbiosis persisted in a subset of patients with
		COVID-19 up to 12 days after nasopharyngeal clearance of SARS-CoV-2. Studies are
		needed to determine whether alterations in intestinal fungi contribute to or
		"result from SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the effects of these changes in disease"
		progression.

PG	-	643-649
LID	-	10.1111/myc.13443 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candida auris a frequently multidrug-resistant yeast species that
		poses a global health threat due to its high potential for hospital outbreaks.
		"While C. auris has become endemic in parts of Asia and Africa, transmissions have"
		so far rarely been reported in Western Europe except for Great Britain and Spain.
		We describe the first documented patient-to-patient transmission of C. auris in
		Germany in a COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU) and infection control measures
		implemented to prevent further spread of the pathogen. METHODS: Identification of
		C. auris was performed by MALDI-TOF and confirmed by internal transcribed spacer
		(ITS) sequencing. Antifungal susceptibility testing was carried out. We conducted
		repeated cross-sectional examinations for the presence of C. auris in the
		patients of the affected ICU and investigated possible routes of transmission.
		RESULTS: The index patient had been transferred to Germany from a hospital in
		Northern Africa and was found to be colonised with C. auris. The contact patient
		developed C. auris sepsis. Infection prevention and control (IPC) measures
		included strict isolation of the two C. auris patients and regular screening of
		non-affected patients. No further case occurred during the subsequent weeks.
		Reusable blades used in video laryngoscope-guided intubation were considered as
		the most likely vehicle of transmission. CONCLUSIONS: In view of its high risk of
		"transmission, vigilance regarding C. auris colonisation in patients referred from"
		endemic countries is crucial. Strict and immediate IPC measures may have the
		potential to prevent C. auris outbreaks.

TI	-	Case-Case Comparison of Candida auris Versus Other Candida Species Bloodstream
		Infections: Results of an Outbreak Investigation in Colombia.
PG	-	917-923
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-020-00478-1 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candida auris is an emerging multidrug-resistant yeast that causes
		"outbreaks in healthcare settings around the world. In 2016, clinicians and public"
		health officials identified patients with C. auris bloodstream infections (BSI)
		in Colombian healthcare facilities. To evaluate potential risk factors and
		"outcomes for these infections, we investigated epidemiologic and clinical"
		features of patients with C. auris and other Candida species BSI. METHODS: We
		performed a retrospective case-case investigation in four Colombian acute care
		"hospitals, defining a case as Candida spp. isolated from blood culture during"
		January 2015-September 2016. C. auris BSI cases were compared to other Candida
		"species BSI cases. Odds ratio (OR), estimated using logistic regression, was used"
		to assess the association between risk factors and outcomes. RESULTS: We analyzed
		"90 patients with BSI, including 40 with C. auris and 50 with other Candida"
		species. All had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). No significant
		demographic differences existed between the two groups. The following variables
		were independently associated with C. auris BSI: ≥ 15 days of pre-infection ICU
		"stay (OR: 5.62, CI: 2.04-15.5), evidence of severe sepsis (OR: 3.70, CI"
		"1.19-11.48), and diabetes mellitus (OR 5.69, CI 1.01-31.9). CONCLUSION: Patients"
		with C. auris BSI had longer lengths of ICU stay than those with other
		"candidemias, suggesting that infections are acquired during hospitalization. This"
		"is different from other Candida infections, which are usually thought to result"
		from autoinfection with host flora.

LID	-	6007607
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: C. auris has been associated not only with a variety of invasive
		"fungal infections, including candidemia, sometimes related to central venous"
		"catheter, but also with pericarditis and respiratory tract and urinary tract"
		infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We describe the case of a patient with
		"persistent fever despite antibiotics, who presented with Candida isolation in"
		"blood cultures, typified as Candida auris species. RESULTS: A 57-year-old male"
		receiving peritoneal dialysis underwent kidney transplantation which was
		complicated by primary nonfunction due to arterial thrombosis necessitating graft
		"nephrectomy. During the postoperative period, he presented with Pseudomonas"
		aeruginosa pneumonia that was treated with levofloxacin and catheter-related
		Enterococcus faecalis bacteremia treated with linezolid. After hospital
		"discharge, he then presented with herpes zoster infection treated with"
		"valacyclovir. Ten days later, he developed peritonitis and exit site infection"
		with multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa treated with intraperitoneal
		aztreonam and peritoneal dialysis catheter removal. Despite broad-spectrum
		"antibiotic therapy, the patient remained febrile. All microbiology laboratory"
		"tests were negative, so it was decided to stop antibiotic therapy for 48 hours"
		and repeat cultures in order to avoid possible false negatives. In new blood
		"cultures performed after suspension of antibiotic therapy, candidemia was"
		"observed, later typified as Candida auris species. After completing antifungal"
		treatment (three weeks with intravenous amphotericin B 100 mg qd and two weeks of
		"intravenous anidulafungin 100 mg qd), microbiological cultures remained negative"
		and the patient made uneventful recovery. CONCLUSION: Candida auris invasive
		infection has been mainly described in patients with severe underlying
		comorbidities and immunocompromise. Multidrug-resistant clusters of Candida auris
		are increasingly emerging.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Patients undergoing cardiac surgery can have
		"post-operative complications, including infections. The aim of this article was"
		"to study the incidence, severity and risk factors of invasive candidiasis in"
		"these patients, based on the hypothesis that several factors (multiple"
		transfusions and time on extracorporeal circulation) are related to invasive
		candidiasis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included a prospective analysis of
		669 patients undergoing scheduled cardiac surgery from April 2016 to December
		2017. Control cultures were collected on admittance to the Surgical Intensive
		"Care Unit. RESULTS: The incidence of invasive candidiasis was 2.69%, being"
		confirmed in 1.79% of cases. The most frequently isolated Candida species was
		Candida auris. Mortality rate in the invasive candidiasis group was 11% in the
		"immediate post-operative period and 22% at 30 days. After the univariate study, a"
		statistically significant relationship was found between invasive candidiasis and
		multiple transfusions (OR 15.86; 95% CI: 5.15-69.4; p<.001). A statistically
		significant relationship was also found with other known risk factors in
		hospitalised patients. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple transfusions are associated with an
		increased risk of invasive candidiasis. Surveillance measures for fungal
		infection in patients with risk factors undergoing cardiac surgery should be
		implemented in hospitals with a high incidence of candidiasis.

		"Retrospective, case control study at a tertiary South African Hospital. Clinical"
		and laboratory features of patients with positive C. auris clinical cultures from

		cultures were identified. The median age was 32 years (IQR = 26-46). The median
		duration of hospital stay was 64 days (IQR = 39-88) and median time from
		admission to diagnosis 35 days (IQR = 21-53). Indwelling devices and previous
		antibiotic exposure were found to be significant risk factors. All C. auris
		isolates were susceptible to amphotericin B and micafungin. Patients treated with
		"amphotericin B alone, had a higher mortality (73.33%, n = 11/15) than patients"
		"treated with an echinocandin (54.55%, n = 6/11), however this was not"
		statistically significant. All C. auris isolates were healthcare associated with
		80% (n = 36/45) acquired in ICU. The 30-day all-cause in-patient mortality was
		"42% (n = 19/45) for C. auris, 36% (n = 16/45) for C. albicans and 53% (n = 24/45)"
		for C. glabrata. CONCLUSIONS: C. auris is an emerging multi drug resistant threat
		in South Africa. Improved access to echinocandins and improvement of infection
		prevention and control strategies are imperative to prevent further morbidity and
		mortality due to this pathogen.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candida auris infections have been reported worldwide since the
		pathogen was isolated in 2009. AIM: To analyse the incidence of cutaneous and
		"intestinal colonization, and connection with infections by the organism, in a"
		hospital setting of a C. auris epidemic. METHODS: This was a retrospective study
		in intensive care units (ICUs) at a 1200-bed Italian hospital. The incidence of
		"cutaneous positive swabs, and cutaneous carriers, for C. auris was compared to"
		"that of rectal positive swabs, and intestinal carriers, and both were correlated"
		with C. auris infections. FINDINGS: A total of 399 patients were included.
		Seventy-seven patients were infected by C. auris. The ratio of C. auris positive
		skin swabs from screening in ICUs was 24%. The ratio obtained from infected
		"patients and intestinal C. auris carriers was 49.1%, likewise rectal swabs from a"
		"similar cohort of patients (P = 0.373). Of this cohort, 39.7% and 5.5% were"
		"colonized only in skin and in rectum, respectively, while 54.8% was colonized in"
		"both sites. Of skin swabs, 12.3% and 83.6%, respectively, were always positive"
		"and variable over time in single subjects, while 31.5% and 41.1% of rectal swabs"
		were always positive and variable (P = 0.000). Intestinal colonization was
		associated with increased risk for C. auris urinary infections (P = 0.006).
		"CONCLUSION: C. auris intestinal carriers were fewer than cutaneous carriers, but"
		more continuously colonized. Rectal and skin swabs can be good tools for
		"surveillance, respectively, of colonization and of hygiene measures"
		effectiveness. Urinary tract infections by C. auris appeared to increase along
		with gastrointestinal presence of the yeast.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candida auris was first described in Japan in 2009 and has since been
		"detected in over 40 countries. The yeast is concerning for multiple reasons,"
		primarily: (1) challenges with accurate identification; (2) reported multidrug
		resistance; (3) published mortality rates of 30%-60%; and (4) persistence in the
		environment associated with human transmission. We report the emergence of a
		healthcare-associated cluster in the Greater Vancouver area in 2018 and describe
		the measures implemented to contain its transmission. METHODS: Cases were
		identified through passive and ring surveillance of affected wards. Positive
		isolates were sent to provincial and national reference laboratories for
		confirmation and genomic characterization. Extensive infection control measures
		were implemented immediately after the initial case was identified. RESULTS: Four
		"cases were identified during the outbreak. In a 4-month period, over 700 swabs"
		were collected in order to screen 180 contacts. Whole genome sequencing concluded
		that all isolates clustered together and belonged to the South Asian clade. No
		isolates harbored FKS gene mutations associated with resistance to echinocandins.
		"Infection control measures, including surveillance, education, cleaning and/or"
		"disinfection, patient cohorting, isolation, and hand hygiene, effectively"
		contained the outbreak; it was declared over within 2 months. CONCLUSIONS: The
		spread of C auris in healthcare facilities has not spared Canadian institutions.
		Our experience demonstrates that strict infection control measures combined with
		microbiological screening can effectively halt transmission in healthcare
		centers. The necessity of active prospective screening remains unclear.

PG	-	107-119
LID	-	10.1007/s10123-018-0014-1 [doi]
AB	-	Recent changes in the aetiology and epidemiology of invasive candidiasis have
		"serious implications for current and future diagnosis, treatment and prognosis."
		The aim of the current review was to discuss the epidemiology of invasive
		"candidiasis, the distribution of Candida species in different regions of the"
		"world, the medical concerns of the changing aetiology and the emergence of"
		"antifungal resistance. Overall burden of invasive candidiasis remains high,"
		"especially in vulnerable persons, such as the elderly, immunosuppressed or"
		"debilitated patients. Moreover, there is a progressive shift in the aetiology of"
		"invasive candidiasis from Candida albicans to other species of Candida, probably"
		related to the increased use of azole drugs with a clear trend towards increased
		"antifungal resistance. Finally, the emergence and rise of multiresistant species,"
		"such as Candida auris or Candida glabrata, is a major threat making necessary"
		invasive candidiasis worldwide surveillances. These changes have serious
		"implications for the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of invasive candidiasis."
		Updated knowledge of the current local epidemiology of invasive candidiasis is
		critical for the clinical management.

		endogenous panophthalmitis. Two separate ocular specimens confirmed simultaneous
		Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida auris involvement. Histopathological analysis
		demonstrated fulminant polymorphonuclear infiltration of all ocular tissue
		layers. Despite aggressive management including two intravitreal injections and
		"enucleation, the patient died, ultimately after receiving care at four"
		neighboring urban medical centers. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPORTANCE: Candida auris has
		been a recently and increasingly described pathogen leading to mortality in
		"metropolitan hospitals worldwide. To the authors' knowledge, Candida auris has"
		not previously been reported with endophthalmitis or panophthalmitis. Future
		cases may be expected with the reported rise in Candida auris. A high suspicion
		of its contribution to panophthalmitis could be warranted early in the evaluation
		"and management of profoundly immunocompromised patients, particularly those who"
		have had sequential care at multiple neighboring metropolitan hospitals.

AB	-	Candida auris is an emerging multidrug-resistant yeast that can cause severe
		"infections and spread easily between hospitalized patients, leading to outbreaks"
		"in hospital. Here, we report the first four cases of colonization and invasive"
		infection with C. auris reported in the Indian Ocean region. All cases were
		"observed in the French overseas Reunion Island, a very popular destination for"
		"European travelers. Three patients had urinary tract or skin colonization, and"
		"one had a fatal invasive infection. In three cases, including that of the"
		"infected patient, the yeast was not initially identified as C. auris, preventing"
		specific hygiene measures to be implemented as suggested in the December 2016
		clinical alert to European healthcare facilities. The infected patient likely
		acquired C. auris in the intensive care unit from the first colonized patient.
		This is the first case of C. auris infection and the first potential case of
		nosocomial transmission of the pathogen to be reported in the French overseas
		Reunion Island.

PG	-	452-460
LID	-	10.5578/mb.20219814 [doi]
AB	-	Candida auris is a fungal pathogen that was first identified in 2009. Since its
		"definition, it has spread globally and has caused life-threatening nosocomial"
		"infections. Increases in the number of immunocompromised individuals, empirical"
		use of broad-spectrum antimicrobials and widespread use of catheterizations are
		the predisposing factors in the development of infection. There are problems for
		"the identification of C.auris with the routine methods. In this case report,"
		"infections with C.auris, isolated for the first time from three patients in our"
		"hospital's intensive care units (ICU) between November 2020-January 2021, were"
		presented. The first case was a 46-year-old male patient with laryngeal carcinoma
		who developed cardiopulmonary arrest during anesthesia induction in the tumor
		"operation, and was followed up in the ICU. C.auris growth was detected in the"
		blood and intravenous (IV) catheter tip cultures on the 66th day of admittance.
		Cure achieved on the 24th day under caspofungin treatment as no growth was
		determined. Second case was a 71-year-old female patient admitted to the
		emergency department with shortness of breath and general condition disorder that
		developed after COVID-19 infection and hospitalized in ICU with the diagnosis of
		pneumonia and acute renal failure. In the 16th day of admittance C.auris growth
		was detected in blood and from catheter tip cultures and the patient died in the
		"18th day. The third case was a 49-year-old male patient, followed up in ICU with"
		the diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage after he admitted to the emergency
		"department with confusion. In the 35th day of admittance, 100000 CFU/ mL C auris"
		growth was detected in urine culture. The patient was accepted as asymptomatic
		fungiuria and followed up in the ICU. It was determined that the three patients
		"were intubated, had urinary and femoral venous catheters and were being followed"
		under wide spectrum antibiotherapy when the growth of C.auris was detected.
		Isolates identified as C.auris by MALDI-TOF Microflex LT/SH Smart MS in the
		Medical Microbiology Laboratory were then confirmed by conventional methods and
		DNA sequencing in the National Mycology Reference Laboratory. Antifungal
		susceptibility tests were performed by broth microdilution method. Fluconazole
		MIC values were >256 mg/ml for all cases. Long-term survival in hospital
		"environments, colonization on skin, resistance to disinfectants of C.auris,"
		facilitate the spread of the fungi and resistance to antifungals lead to
		"treatment failures. In this case report, it was aimed to draw attention to the"
		"infections with C.auris, its diagnosis and risk factors."

PG	-	101-105
LID	-	10.1111/myc.12886 [doi]
AB	-	Candida auris is a multidrug-resistant yeast emerging in immunocompromised and in
		otherwise healthy individuals. Due to difficulties in microbiological
		identification of C. auris because of the lack of available laboratory technology
		"in developing countries, the number of patients affected is most likely"
		underestimated. We report the first case of C. auris otitis which now adds Iran
		"as the fifth country around the Persian Gulf, in addition to Kuwait, Oman, United"
		Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. Candida auris is an unknown pathogen in routine
		laboratories in Iran because most Candida isolates are probably misdiagnosed.
		Otomycosis seems to be a different clinical presentation of C. auris mainly
		involving isolates from the East-Asian clade. We compared the mycological and
		clinical details of the Iranian patient with other cases of otitis reported since
		the last review of C. auris otomycosis in 2017.

AB	-	Objective and importance: Candida auris is a relatively new yeast species and an
		"emerging opportunistic pathogen. It was first reported in 2009 in East Asia, as a"
		difficult-to-identify Candida species of uncertain clinical relevance. In recent
		"years, it has appeared globally as a cause of invasive infections, not"
		infrequently eliciting nosocomial outbreaks. Species identification in clinical
		"laboratories has been challenging, as traditional phenotypic and biochemical"
		methods have been generally unreliable. Clinical management is often complicated
		"by multidrug resistance in many isolates. Additionally, C. auris has demonstrated"
		an unusual ability for persistence in the hospital environment and in
		asymptomatic patients. We present the first Belgian case of C. auris infection
		along with a brief review of the literature.Clinical presentation: A patient was
		referred from Kuwait for surgical treatment after a complicated bariatric
		"procedure. Few days after transferral, she developed a catheter-related blood"
		stream infection with C. auris. We obtained a low-confidence identification of C.
		"auris with the Bruker Biotyper MALDI-TOF MS system (Bruker Corporation,"
		"Billerica, MA, U.S.A.), and of Candida haemulonii with the Vitek YST"
		"identification system, version 7.01 (bioMérieux, Marcy-L'Etoile, France)."
		Definite identification was obtained using Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS)
		"sequencing. As most C. auris isolates, our strain was resistant to fluconazole,"
		and the patient was eventually treated with catheter removal and anidulafungin
		therapy. We documented persistence of C. auris clones with acquired echinocandin
		resistance in our patient up to 18 months after the infection.Conclusion:
		"Clinicians and microbiologists should be aware of this globally emerging yeast,"
		"that poses important challenges in identification, treatment and hospital"
		infection control.

AB	-	Candida auris is an emerging yeast that causes healthcare-associated infections.
		It can be misidentified by laboratories and often is resistant to antifungal
		medications. We describe an outbreak of C. auris infections in healthcare
		"facilities in New York City, New York, USA. The investigation included laboratory"
		"surveillance, record reviews, site visits, contact tracing with cultures, and"
		environmental sampling. We identified 51 clinical case-patients and 61 screening
		"case-patients. Epidemiologic links indicated a large, interconnected web of"
		affected healthcare facilities throughout New York City. Of the 51 clinical
		"case-patients, 23 (45%) died within 90 days and isolates were resistant to"
		"fluconazole for 50 (98%). Of screening cultures performed for 572 persons (1,136"
		"total cultures), results were C. auris positive for 61 (11%) persons."
		Environmental cultures were positive for samples from 15 of 20 facilities.
		Colonization was frequently identified during contact investigations;
		environmental contamination was also common.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Candida auris is an emerging, multidrug-resistant yeast causing"
		hospital outbreaks. This study describes the first 24 months of the ongoing C.
		auris outbreak in our hospital and analyzes predisposing factors to C. auris
		"candidemia/colonization. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A 12-month prospective,"
		case-controlled study was performed including a total of 228 patients (114
		colonized/candidemia and 114 controls). Data from the first 79 candidemia
		episodes and 738 environmental samples were also analyzed. Definitive C. auris
		identification was performed by ITS sequencing. Antifungal susceptibility was
		"carried out by EUCAST methodology. RESULTS: Polytrauma (32%), cardiovascular"
		"disease (25%), and cancer (17%) were the most common underlying condition in"
		"colonized/candidemia patients. Indwelling CVC (odds ratio {OR}, 13.48),"
		"parenteral nutrition (OR, 3.49), and mechanical ventilation (OR, 2.43) remained"
		significant predictors of C. auris colonization/candidemia. C. auris was most
		"often isolated on sphygmomanometer cuffs (25%) patient tables (10.2%), keyboards"
		"(10.2%), and infusion pumps (8.2%). All isolates were fully resistant to"
		fluconazole (MICs >64 mg/L) and had significantly reduced susceptibility to
		"voriconazole (GM, 1.8 mg/L). CONCLUSIONS: Predictor conditions to C. auris"
		colonization/candidemia are similar to other Candida species. C. auris colonizes
		multiple patient's environment surfaces. All isolates are resistant to
		fluconazole and had significant reduced susceptibility to voriconazole.

		"During 2015-2016, health authorities in Colombia detected an outbreak of C."
		"auris. We conducted an investigation to characterize the epidemiology,"
		"transmission mechanisms, and reservoirs of this organism. We investigated 4"
		hospitals with confirmed cases of C. auris candidemia in 3 cities in Colombia. We
		abstracted medical records and collected swabs from contemporaneously
		hospitalized patients to assess for skin colonization. We identified 40 cases;
		median patient age was 23 years (IQR 4 months-56 years). Twelve (30%) patients
		"were <1 year of age, and 24 (60%) were male. The 30-day mortality was 43%. Cases"
		clustered in time and location; axilla and groin were the most commonly colonized
		sites. Temporal and spatial clustering of cases and skin colonization suggest
		person-to-person transmission of C. auris. These cases highlight the importance
		of adherence to infection control recommendations.

AB	-	PURPOSE: A systematic epidemiological study on intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired
		"candidemia across India. METHOD: A prospective, nationwide, multicentric,"
		observational study was conducted at 27 Indian ICUs. Consecutive patients who
		acquired candidemia after ICU admission were enrolled during April 2011 through
		September 2012. Clinical and laboratory variables of these patients were
		recorded. The present study is an analysis of data specific for adult patients.
		"RESULTS: Among 1,400 ICU-acquired candidemia cases (overall incidence of 6.51"
		"cases/1,000 ICU admission), 65.2 % were adult. Though the study confirmed the"
		"already known risk factors for candidemia, the acquisition occurred early after"
		"admission to ICU (median 8 days; interquartile range 4-15 days), even infecting"
		patients with lower APACHE II score at admission (median 17.0; mean ± SD 17.2 ±
		5.9; interquartile range 14-20). The important finding of the study was the vast
		spectrum of agents (31 Candida species) causing candidemia and a high rate of
		isolation of Candida tropicalis (41.6 %). Azole and multidrug resistance were
		seen in 11.8 and 1.9 % of isolates. Public sector hospitals reported a
		significantly higher presence of the relatively resistant C. auris (8.2 vs. 3.9
		%; p = 0.008) and C. rugosa (5.6 vs. 1.5 %; p = 0.001). The 30-day crude and
		"attributable mortality rates of candidemia patients were 44.7 and 19.6 %,"
		respectively. Logistic regression analysis revealed significant independent
		"predictors of mortality including admission to public sector hospital, APACHE II"
		"score at admission, underlying renal failure, central venous catheterization and"
		steroid therapy. CONCLUSION: The study highlighted a high burden of candidemia in
		"Indian ICUs, early onset after ICU admission, higher risk despite less severe"
		physiology score at admission and a vast spectrum of agents causing the disease
		with predominance of C. tropicalis.

AB	-	Candida blood steam infection is a life-threatening disease that seems to be
		under estimated. Understanding epidemiology of such disease is crucial for
		"improved diagnosis, optimized treatment, and better outcome. Through this"
		"retrospective study, we aimed to determine the incidence of candidemia in a"
		"secondary care hospital, and to describe the epidemiology and outcome of"
		candidemia among adult patients. The incidence of candidemia for all age groups
		"was 0.24, 0.16 and 0.15 cases/1000 patient-days in 2014, 2015 and 2016"
		"respectively. Among adult patients, 82 cases were identified. The patients had"
		"the following clinical characteristics with varying proportions: old age,"
		"diabetes, antibiotic exposure, use of vascular catheter, abdominal surgery, ICU"
		"hospitalization, haemodialysis, and total parenteral nutrition. All-cause 30-day"
		mortality was 54% and ICU hospitalization was a recognized risk factor for death.
		"The leading causative agents were Candida albicans (32%), and Candida"
		"parapsilosis (32%), followed by Candida tropicalis (20%), Candida glabrata (13%)"
		"and one each by Candida dubliniensis, Candida famata, and Candida auris. Almost"
		all tested isolates were susceptible to caspofungin and amphotericin B. With
		"regard to fluconazole, C. glabrata showed variable susceptibility. Other species"
		"were susceptible except one isolate, each of C. parapsilosis and C. auris. The"
		study highlights the growing importance of non-C. albicans Candida species in the
		etiology of candidemia. Emergence of C. auris is a warning sign and needs to be
		closely monitored.

		Follow-up at 1 Ventilator-Capable Skilled Nursing Facility.
PG	-	e718-e725
LID	-	10.1093/cid/ciaa435 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Since the identification of the first 2 Candida auris cases in
		"Chicago, Illinois, in 2016, ongoing spread has been documented in the Chicago"
		"area. We describe C. auris emergence in high-acuity, long-term healthcare"
		facilities and present a case study of public health response to C. auris and
		carbapenemase-producing organisms (CPOs) at one ventilator-capable skilled
		nursing facility (vSNF-A). METHODS: We performed point prevalence surveys (PPSs)
		to identify patients colonized with C. auris and infection-control (IC)
		assessments and provided ongoing support for IC improvements in Illinois acute-
		"and long-term care facilities during August 2016-December 2018. During 2018, we"
		initiated a focused effort at vSNF-A and conducted 7 C. auris PPSs; during 4
		"PPSs, we also performed CPO screening and environmental sampling. RESULTS: During"
		"August 2016-December 2018 in Illinois, 490 individuals were found to be colonized"
		or infected with C. auris. PPSs identified the highest prevalence of C. auris
		"colonization in vSNF settings (prevalence, 23-71%). IC assessments in multiple"
		vSNFs identified common challenges in core IC practices. Repeat PPSs at vSNF-A in
		2018 identified increasing C. auris prevalence from 43% to 71%. Most residents
		screened during multiple PPSs remained persistently colonized with C. auris.
		"Among 191 environmental samples collected, 39% were positive for C. auris,"
		"including samples from bedrails, windowsills, and shared patient-care items."
		CONCLUSIONS: High burden in vSNFs along with persistent colonization of residents
		and environmental contamination point to the need for prioritizing IC
		interventions to control the spread of C. auris and CPOs.

AB	-	Candidemia is one of the significant causes of mortality amongst critically ill
		patients in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). This study aimed to assess the
		"incidence, risk factors and antifungal susceptibility pattern in candidemia cases"
		"admitted in ICU in a tertiary care hospital in Jaipur, Rajasthan from June 2021"
		to November 2021. Candida species isolated from blood culture of clinically
		suspected patients of sepsis were defined as candidemia cases. Blood culture and
		antifungal susceptibility testing were performed as per standard laboratory
		protocol. Analyses of risk factors was done between candidemia cases and matched
		controls in a ratio of 1 : 3. Forty-six candidemic cases and 150 matched controls
		were included in the study. C. tropicalis was the most prevalent species (22/46;
		48%) followed by C. auris (8/46; 17%) and C. albicans (7/46; 15%). Candida

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Transmission of multidrug-resistant Candida auris infection has been
		reported in the USA. To better understand its emergence and transmission dynamics
		"and to guide clinical and public health responses, we did a molecular"
		epidemiological investigation of C auris cases in the USA. METHODS: In this
		"molecular epidemiological survey, we used whole-genome sequencing to assess the"
		genetic similarity between isolates collected from patients in ten US states
		"(California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts,"
		"New Jersey, New York, and Oklahoma) and those identified in several other"
		"countries (Colombia, India, Japan, Pakistan, South Africa, South Korea, and"
		"Venezuela). We worked with state health departments, who provided us with"
		isolates for sequencing. These isolates of C auris were collected during the
		normal course of clinical care (clinical cases) or as part of contact
		investigations or point prevalence surveys (screening cases). We integrated data
		"from standardised case report forms and contact investigations, including travel"
		"history and epidemiological links (ie, patients that had shared a room or ward"
		"with a patient with C auris). Genetic diversity of C auris within a patient, a"
		"facility, and a state were evaluated by pairwise differences in single-nucleotide"
		"polymorphisms (SNPs). FINDINGS: From May 11, 2013, to Aug 31, 2017, isolates that"
		corresponded to 133 cases (73 clinical cases and 60 screening cases) were
		"collected. Of 73 clinical cases, 66 (90%) cases involved isolates related to"
		"south Asian isolates, five (7%) cases were related to South American isolates,"
		"one (1%) case to African isolates, and one (1%) case to east Asian isolates. Most"
		(60 [82%]) clinical cases were identified in New York and New Jersey; these
		"isolates, although related to south Asian isolates, were genetically distinct."
		Genomic data corroborated five (7%) clinical cases in which patients probably
		acquired C auris through health-care exposures abroad. Among clinical and
		"screening cases, the genetic diversity of C auris isolates within a person was"
		similar to that within a facility during an outbreak (median SNP difference three
		"SNPs, range 0-12). INTERPRETATION: Isolates of C auris in the USA were"
		"genetically related to those from four global regions, suggesting that C auris"
		was introduced into the USA several times. The five travel-related cases are
		examples of how introductions can occur. Genetic diversity among isolates from
		"the same patients, health-care facilities, and states indicates that there is"
		local and ongoing transmission. FUNDING: US Centers for Disease Control and
		Prevention.

TI	-	Clinical spectrum and factors impacting outcome of Candida auris: a single center
		study from Pakistan.
PG	-	384

AB	-	BACKGROUND: An outbreak of Candida auris began globally in 2014 including
		Pakistan and since then it has emerged as a nosocomial multi-drug resistant
		pathogen. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical spectrum and outcome
		"of patients, from a single center in Pakistan, in whom C. auris was isolated."
		METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on 92 patients; ≥16 years with at
		"least one culture positive for C. auris, at the Aga Khan University Hospital"
		"Karachi, Pakistan from Sept 2014-Mar 2017.Demographics, clinical history,"
		management and outcome were studied. A logistic regression model was used to
		identify the risk factors for mortality. RESULTS: We identified 92 patients with
		"C. auris (193 isolates), of whom 52.2% were males. Mean age was"
		54.14 ± 20.4 years. Positive cultures were obtained after a median hospital stay
		"of 14 days. Most patients had a history of surgery (57.6%), antibiotic use"
		"(95.6%), ICU stay (44.6%), indwelling lines (88.04%) and isolation of another"
		multi-resistant organism (52.2%).Most patients were symptomatic (70.7%). Amongst
		"these, 38 had candidemia while 27 had non-candidemia infections. Sites of"
		"infection included central lines (35), urinary tract (19), peritonitis (4),"
		"nosocomial ventriculitis (1), empyema (1), fungal keratitis (1) otitis externa"
		(1) and surgical site (1). Fluconazole resistance was 100% while 28.5 and 7.9%
		were Voriconazole and Amphotericin resistant respectively. Overall crude
		mortality was 42.4% while 14-day mortality was 31.5%. Both infected and colonized
		cases shared similar mortality (46.2% vs 33.3%; p-value = 0.25). Among infected
		cases mortality was high in candidemia compared to non-candidemia (60.5% vs
		25.9%) in which deaths related to C. auris were 34.2% vs 22.2% respectively. On
		"multivariate analysis candidemia (AOR 4.2, 95% CI: 1.09-16.49; p-value = 0.037)"
		was associated with greater mortality with source control being the only
		"protective factor for mortality (AOR 0.22, 95% CI: 0.05-0.92; p-value0.038] while"
		"ICU stay, rapidity of blood culture clearance, DM, malignancy and MDR"
		co-infection had no impact. CONCLUSION: Patients with C.auris from a single
		center in Pakistan have a wide clinical spectrum with line associated infection
		being the predominant site of infection. Candidemia leads to high mortality while
		source control improves outcome.

		"especially due to its multidrug resistance profile, besides the difficulties in"
		establishing the correct identification by conventional laboratory methods and
		its capacity of causing outbreaks in healthcare settings. The limited arsenal of
		"available antifungal drugs, coupled with the lack of momentum for the development"

TI	-	Evaluating the measures taken to contain a Candida auris outbreak in a tertiary
		care hospital in South India: an outbreak investigational study.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candida auris infections are an emerging global threat with poor
		"clinical outcome, high mortality rate, high transmission rate and outbreak"
		potential. The objective of this work is to describe a multidisciplinary approach
		towards the investigation and containment of a Candida auris outbreak and the
		preventive measures adopted in a resource limited setting. METHODS: This outbreak
		investigational study was conducted at a 1300-bedded tertiary care academic
		hospital in South India. The study included 15 adult inpatients with laboratory
		confirmed Candida auris isolates. The outbreak cluster was identified in adult
		patients admitted from September 2017 to 2019. The system response consisted of a
		critical alert system for laboratory confirmed Candida auris infection and
		multidisciplinary 'Candida auris care team' for patient management. The team
		implemented stringent Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) measures including
		"patient cohorting, standardized therapy and decolonization, staff training,"
		prospective surveillance and introduction of Candida auris specific care bundle.
		RESULTS: Two outbreak clusters were identified; first cluster occurring between
		October and November 2017 and the second cluster in May 2018. The cohorts
		consisted of 7 and 8 Candida auris positive patients in the first and second
		waves of the outbreak respectively with a total survival rate of 93% (14/15).
		Deployment of containment measures led to gradual decline in the incidence of
		adult Candida auris positive cases and prevented further cluster formation.
		CONCLUSIONS: The sustained implementation of guideline and evidence-based IPC
		measures and training of healthcare workers for improving awareness on
		systematically following standardized protocols of Candida auris related IPC
		practices successfully contained Candida auris outbreaks at our hospital. This
		demonstrates the feasibility of establishing a multidisciplinary model and
		bundling of practices for preventing Candida auris outbreaks in a Low- and
		Middle-income country.

AB	-	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection causes a
		disease (COVID-19) with multisystem involvement. The world is now entering a
		phase of post-COVID-19 manifestations in this pandemic. Secondary hemophagocytic
		lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) is a life-threatening hyperinflammatory event
		"triggered by viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2. Both Multisystem"
		Inflammatory Syndrome-Adults (MIS-A) and Cytokine Storm Syndrome (CSS) are
		considered close differentials of sHLH and add to the spectrum of Post-acute
		"COVID-19 syndrome (PACS). In this report, we presented the case of a middle-aged"
		Asian man who was initially discharged upon recovery from severe COVID-19
		infection after 17 days of hospitalization to a private institute and later came
		"to our hospital 13 days post-discharge. Here, he was diagnosed with sHLH,"
		"occurring as an extension of CSS, with delayed presentation falling within the"
		spectrum of PACS. The diagnosis of sHLH was made holistically with the HLH-2004
		criteria. Our patient initially responded to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)
		"and dexamethasone, later complicated by disseminated Candida auris infection and"
		had a fatal outcome. Though many cases of HLH during active COVID-19 and a few
		"cases post COVID-19 recovery have been reported, based on H-score, which has"
		limitations as a diagnostic tool. We report the first case report of
		"post-COVID-19 sHLH using the HLH-2004 criteria, complicated by disseminated"
		"Candidemia, emphasizing that the care of patients with COVID-19 does not conclude"
		at the time of hospital discharge. We highlight the importance of surveillance in
		the post-COVID phase for early detection of sHLH which may predispose to fatal
		opportunistic infections (OIs).

TI	-	South Asian (Clade I) Candida auris meningitis in a paediatric patient in Iran
		with a review of the literature.
PG	-	134-139
LID	-	10.1111/myc.13396 [doi]
AB	-	Candida meningitis is a rare life-threatening yeast infection mostly involving
		immunocompromised or paediatric patients undergoing neurosurgical procedures or
		shunt placement. Due to difficulties in diagnosis because of diverse clinical
		"manifestations, the number of patients affected is most likely underestimated."
		"Therefore, the correct diagnosis may be delayed for months, and accurate species"
		identification is highly recommended for administering appropriate antifungal
		therapy. We report the first case of fluconazole-resistant Candida auris
		"meningitis in a paediatric patient in Iran. This strain was probably imported, as"
		"it genotypically belonged to Clade I from South Asia. Furthermore, we include a"
		"literature review of C auris meningitis cases, as the number of cases with"
		"C auris meningitis has increased with reports from the United Kingdom, India and"
		Iran. This problem might increase further in the era of COVID-19 due to attrition
		of experienced healthcare personnel and a high workload of hospital healthcare
		workers. To understand the precise prevalence of this emerging multidrug
		"resistance pathogen, epidemiological surveillance studies are urgently warranted."

AB	-	Candida auris has been identified as an invasive fungal organism of outbreaks
		globally. Due to its striking ability to colonize the skin and readily transmit
		"from person-to-person, it is being categorized as a public health threat."
		"Infected patients are not only characteristically critically ill, but delayed"
		identification along with limited options for effective antifungals makes this
		nosocomial infection worrisome for clinicians. The risk of persistence of fungus
		as a contaminant in hospital rooms and on medical equipment is also a concern for
		"health care facilities. In this case report, we described fungemia with Candida"
		"auris secondary to pyelonephritis in a patient, which escalated to septic shock"
		and was treated with micafungin. The unique feature about this case was the
		patient presented from home with no history of recent hospitalization and no
		"evident predisposing risk factors such as immunosuppression, indwelling or"
		central venous catheters at the time of admission.

PG	-	e15240
LID	-	10.7759/cureus.15240 [doi]
LID	-	e15240
AB	-	Candida auris is a relatively new species of the Candida genus that is rapidly
		spreading in healthcare institutions across the globe. It is exceedingly
		difficult to identify with standard laboratory procedures and is challenging to
		"treat due to its resistance to most antifungals. Moreover, it quickly colonizes"
		"on the surfaces in hospitals and ICUs and causes repeated infections, despite"
		regular hospital disinfection. This grim occurrence of multidrug-resistant yeast

TI	-	First Candida auris Outbreak during a COVID-19 Pandemic in a Tertiary-Care Center
		in Lebanon.
LID	-	10.3390/pathogens10020157 [doi]
LID	-	157
AB	-	Candida auris is an emerging fungal pathogen considered as a global health
		"threat. Recently there has been growing concern regarding drug resistance,"
		"difficulty in identification, as well as problems with eradication. Although"
		outbreaks have been reported throughout the globe including from several Arab
		"countries, there were no previous reports from Lebanon. We herein report the"
		first cases of C. auris infection from the American University of Beirut Medical
		"Center, a tertiary care center in Lebanon describing the clinical features of the"
		affected patients in addition to the infection control investigation and applied
		interventions to control the outbreak. Fourteen patients with C. auris
		infection/colonization identified using MALDI-TOF and VITEK 2- Compact system
		were reported over a period of 13 weeks. Patients were admitted to four separate
		critical care units. All of them came through the emergency room and had comorbid
		conditions. Half of the patients were infected with COVID-19 prior to isolation
		"of the C. auris. C. auris was isolated from blood (two isolates), urine (three"
		"isolates), respiratory tract (10 isolates) and skin (one isolate). All the"
		patients had received broad spectrum antibiotics prior to isolation of C. auris.
		"Six patients received antifungal treatment, while the remaining eight patients"
		were considered colonized. Environmental cultures were taken from all four units
		and failed to isolate the organism from any cultured surfaces. A series of
		interventions were initiated by the Infection Prevention and Control team to
		contain the outbreak. Rapid detection and reporting of cases are essential to
		prevent further hospital transmission. A national standardized infection control
		registry needs to be established to identify widespread colonization.

AB	-	PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence of Candida auris candidaemia in our ICU
		patients and its molecular epidemiology. METHODS: A prospective observational
		study was conducted on candidaemia in our ICU patients over 18 months during
		"2016-2017. Demographics, underlying disease, risk factors, antifungal therapy and"
		outcome were studied. Risk factors of C. auris and non-auris candidaemia were
		"compared. RESULTS: During the study period, among 108 candidaemia cases recorded,"
		"the incidence was 6.75/1000 ICU bed days. C. auris topped the list (n = 42,"
		"39.9%), followed by C. tropicalis (34.3%), and C. parapsilosis (15.7%). On"
		"bivariate analysis prior antibiotic therapy, long central line days, mechanical"
		ventilation and length of ICU stay were significant risk factors for C. auris
		candidaemia compared to non-auris candidaemia. Multivariate analysis showed
		underlying respiratory and neurological diseases as significantly associated with
		"risk of C. auris candidaemia. Fluconazole, amphotericin B, and caspofungin"
		"resistance were noted in 97.0%, 93.7% and 3% of C. auris isolates respectively."
		"CONCLUSION: Longer duration of central line days, prior antibiotic use,"
		mechanical ventilation and prolonged ICU stay were important risk factors
		associated with C. auris candidaemia along with underlying respiratory or
		"neurological disease. The isolates are non-clonal in origin, but they belong to a"
		single clade.

		outbreak among COVID-19 patients in Brazil.
PG	-	1062-1072
LID	-	10.1111/myc.13320 [doi]
AB	-	"OBJECTIVES: To describe the first outbreak of Candida auris in Brazil, including"
		"epidemiological, clinical and microbiological data. METHODS: After the first"
		Candida auris-colonised patient was diagnosed in a COVID-19 ICU at a hospital in
		"Salvador, Brazil, a multidisciplinary team conducted a local C. auris prevalence"
		"investigation. Screening cultures for C. auris were collected from patients,"
		healthcare workers and inanimate surfaces. Risk factors for C. auris colonisation
		"were evaluated, and the fungemia episodes that occurred after the investigation"
		were also analysed and described. Antifungal susceptibility of the C. auris
		"isolates was determined, and they were genotyped with microsatellite analysis."
		"RESULTS: Among body swabs collected from 47 patients, eight (n = 8/47, 17%)"
		samples from the axillae were positive for C. auris. Among samples collected from
		"inanimate surfaces, digital thermometers had the highest rate of positive"
		"cultures (n = 8/47, 17%). Antifungal susceptibility testing showed MICs of 0.5 to"
		"1 mg/L for AMB, 0.03 to 0.06 mg/L for voriconazole, 2 to 4 mg/L for fluconazole"
		and 0.03 to 0.06 mg/L for anidulafungin. Microsatellite analysis revealed that
		all C. auris isolates belong to the South Asian clade (Clade I) and had different
		"genotypes. In multivariate analysis, having a colonised digital thermometer was"
		the only independent risk factor associated with C. auris colonisation. Three
		"episodes of C. auris fungemia occurred after the investigation, with 30-day"
		"attributable mortality of 33.3%. CONCLUSIONS: Emergence of C. auris in Salvador,"
		"Brazil, may be related to local C. auris clade I closely related genotypes."
		Contaminated axillary monitoring thermometers may facilitate the dissemination of
		C. auris reinforcing the concept that these reusable devices should be carefully
		cleaned with an effective disinfectant or replaced by other temperature
		monitoring methods.

AB	-	AIM: Our aim was to identify the clinical features and outcome of multidrug
		resistant Candida auris (CA) infection in neonates. METHODS: This is a
		retrospective case cohort study of 17 neonates who developed sepsis caused by CA
		infection in a tertiary care neonatal intensive care unit over 3 years. The risk
		"factors, clinical features, treatment and outcome were studied. RESULTS: The mean"
		gestation was 32.4 ± 4.9 weeks with overall mortality of 41%. Clinical features
		were indistinguishable from other causes of sepsis. CA was sensitive to
		micafungin but resistant to fluconazole and had variable sensitivity to
		voriconazole and amphotericin. Survival improved to 83% when infants were treated
		with a combination of micafungin and amphotericin. Non-survivors were of lower
		birthweights and had other risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: The management guidelines
		and infection control measures are described in this largest series of neonatal
		CA infection. Treatment with a combination of amphotericin and micafungin
		improved the outcome.

		Candida auris Exhibiting Reduced Susceptibility to Echinocandins and Carrying a
		Novel Mutation in Hotspot-1 of FKS1.
LID	-	10.3390/jof8030267 [doi]

AB	-	Candida auris is an emerging yeast pathogen that has recently caused major
		outbreaks in healthcare facilities worldwide. Clinical C. auris isolates are
		usually resistant to fluconazole and readily develop resistance to echinocandins
		and amphotericin B (AMB) during treatment. We describe here an interesting case
		of C. auris infection in an immunocompromised patient who had previously received
		"AMB and caspofungin treatment. Subsequently, C. auris was isolated from tracheal"
		(tracheostomy) secretions and twice from urine and all three isolates were
		susceptible to AMB and micafungin. The patient received a combination therapy
		"with AMB and caspofungin. Although the C. auris was cleared from the urine, the"
		patient subsequently developed breakthrough candidemia and the bloodstream
		isolate exhibited a reduced susceptibility to micafungin and also showed the
		"presence of a novel (S639T) mutation in hotspot-1 of FKS1. Interestingly, C."
		auris from the tracheal (tracheostomy) secretions recovered one and four days
		later exhibited a reduced susceptibility to micafungin and S639Y and S639T
		"mutations in hotspot-1 of FKS1, respectively. Although the treatment was changed"
		"to voriconazole, the patient expired. Our case highlights a novel FKS1 mutation"
		and the problems clinicians are facing to treat invasive C. auris infections due
		to inherent or developing resistance to multiple antifungal drugs and limited
		antifungal armamentarium.

AB	-	Candida auris is a species of fungus that has gained importance in recent years
		"owing to its ability to cause hospital infections and epidemics, resistant to"
		antifungal agents and disinfection processes and frequently misidentified by
		commercial systems. Hospital outbreaks caused by C.auris have been reported from
		some countries. It has been determined that C.auris has lower virulence than
		"Candida albicans; however, it is associated with high mortality rates in"
		immunocompromised individuals. An increase in the incidence of invasive fungal
		"infections which can lead to serious complications and death, has been identified"
		in severe coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) patients or immunocompromised individuals
		with underlying disease. Studies demonstrated an increase in the frequency of
		"C.auris isolation in COVID-19 patients with candidemia. In this report, the first"
		case of COVID-19 positive C.auris fungemia detected in Turkey was presented. A
		"71-year-old male patient with a history of myocardial infarction, diabetes"
		"mellitus, donation of a single kidney and lobectomy surgery due to lung cancer"
		was hospitalized in the pandemic thoracic surgery service due to the findings
		consistent with viral pneumonia on thoracic computed tomography. Favipiravir 2 x
		600 mg and intravenous dexamethasone 1 x 6 mg therapy was administered. The
		"patient tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction, and severe"
		involvement of the left lung was detected in the following days. Antibiotics were
		"administered, followed by insertion of a right jugular vein catheter and"
		initation of tocilizumab. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit
		due to increased respiratory distress. Yeast growth was detected in the patient's
		hemoculture. The yeast strain could not be identified using API ID 32C
		"(bioMerieux, France) (Sacchromyces kluyveri, Candida sake, unacceptable profile),"
		"but was identified as C.auris using the VITEK MALDI TOF MS (bioMerieux, France)"
		(99.9%) system and confirmed by sequencing. The minimum inhibitor concentration
		values were detected as 3 µg/ml for amphotericin B; > 256 µg/ml for fluconazole;
		0.19 µg/ml for voriconazole; 0.19 µg/ml for itraconazole; 0.016 µg/ml for
		posaconazole; 1 µg/ml for caspofungin and 0.094 µg/ml for anidulafungin by using
		the antibiotic gradient method. The patient's initial treatment comprised
		"meropenem 3 x 1 g, vancomycin 2 x 1 g, caspofungin 1 x 70 mg, and continued as"
		"caspofungine 1 x 50 mg after the loading dose, and vancomycin 1 x 1 g/48 hours"
		from the third day of treatment. The patient died on the ninth day after
		developing candidemia. The present case is the first case of fungemia caused by
		"C.auris in a COVID-19 positive patient in Turkey, and it emphasizes the need of"
		caution for fungemia due to C.auris in intensive care units in our country which
		has a high COVID-19 incidence.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candida auris is an emerging superbug which was recently discovered
		and has spread widely across the world. With a steady rise in incidence involving
		"multisystems, this presents a unique challenge to caregivers. CASE DESCRIPTION: A"
		"50-year-old man with sickle cell disease, diabetes mellitus, and multiple"
		surgeries presented with progressive low back pain radiating to bilateral limbs
		and intact neurology. Radiologic and laboratory investigations suggested
		"spondylodiscitis with epidural collection, which was operated with posterior"
		"decompression and stabilization. The tissue analysis was reported as C. auris,"
		which was accordingly treated with caspofungin. Magnetic resonance imaging at 4
		months showed resolution of infection with return of inflammatory markers to
		"normal. CONCLUSIONS: C. auris appears to be an emerging superbug, which is"
		hospital-acquired. All practitioners must be aware of its existence and
		"presentation. Given the low incidence, high mortality, and no clear guidelines of"
		"management so far, formulation of any such strategies is complicated. Further"
		studies and research are needed for this superbug.

		intensive care unit.
PG	-	3673-3679
LID	-	10.1111/ajt.16144 [doi]
AB	-	Candida auris is a yeast that is difficult to eradicate and has caused outbreaks
		in health care facilities. We report a cluster of 5 patients in 1 intensive care
		unit who were colonized or infected in 2017. The initial 2 patients were
		recipients of liver transplants who had cultures that grew C auris within 3 days
		of each other in June 2017 (days 43 and 30 posttransplant). Subsequent screening
		cultures identified 2 additional patients with C auris colonization. Respiratory
		and urine cultures from a fifth patient yielded C auris. All isolates were
		fluconazole resistant but susceptible to echinocandins. Whole genome sequencing
		"showed the strains were clonal, suggesting in-hospital transmission, and related"
		"but distinct from New York/New Jersey strains, consistent with a separate"
		"introduction. However, no source or contact was found. Two of the 5 patients"
		died. C auris infection likely contributed to 1 patient death by infecting a
		vascular aneurysm at the graft anastomosis. Strict infection control precautions
		were initiated to control the outbreak. Our experience reveals that although
		"severe disease from C auris can occur in transplant recipients, outbreaks can be"
		controlled using recommended infection control practices. We have had no further
		patients infected with C auris to date.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candida auris is a recently reported Candida species that is
		phenotypically similar to Candida haemulonii and related to hospital outbreaks.
		"This organism can be misidentified as Candida haemulonii, Candida famata, Candida"
		"catenulata, or Rhodotorula glutinis by phenotypic approaches. Matrix-assisted"
		laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and
		DNA sequence analysis using internal transcribed spacer rDNA bar-coding provide
		an accurate identification. CASE REPORTS: Three cases of C. auris infection in
		patients with risk factors for fungal infection (one admitted to the intensive
		"care unit, one with lymphoma, and one with HIV; all three with previous"
		antibiotic use) are reported; these infections were not epidemiologically
		"related. Yeast isolates were recovered from blood, ocular secretion, and"
		bronchoalveolar lavage and were misidentified as C. catenulata and Candida
		albicans by the phenotypic MicroScan method. The isolates were confirmed to be C.
		auris by means of MALDI-TOF MS and DNA sequence analysis. Antifungal
		"susceptibility testing was performed on these C. auris isolates, which exhibited"
		high minimum inhibitory concentrations to triazoles and amphotericin B. One
		patient survived and the other two died. Only one of these deaths was related to
		fungemia. CONCLUSIONS: C. auris is an emerging and opportunistic
		multidrug-resistant human pathogen. It is necessary to strengthen measures to
		achieve an accurate and quick identification and also to avoid its dissemination.
		"This will require improvements in health and infection control measures, as well"
		as the promotion of antifungal stewardship in healthcare facilities.

PG	-	293-298
LID	-	10.25100/cm.v50i4.4248 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candida auris is an emerging yeast frequently reported as resistant
		to multiple antifungal drugs commonly used to treat Candida infections. This
		specie can colonize the patient's skin and has great ability for producing
		outbreaks in hospitals. C. auris is phylogenetically related to other Candida
		"species, can be misidentified using conventional biochemical or commercial"
		methods and requires specific technology for its identification. CASE REPORT: We
		"report the first isolate of C. auris in Cali, Colombia, from a central venous"
		catheter in a 37-year-old patient with rheumatoid arthritis and endocarditis who
		did not have symptoms of sepsis. The yeast was initially misidentified as C.
		haemulonii using the Phoenix system and subsequently identified as C. auris by
		matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry
		(MALDI-TOF MS). The broth microdilution method was used to determine the minimum
		"inhibitory concentration; the isolate was susceptible to fluconazole,"
		"itraconazole, voriconazole and amphotericin B. CONCLUSIONS: This report"
		contributes to knowledge of the epidemiology of C. auris infections in
		individuals with underlying disease and describes an isolate with a behavior
		different from what is usually reported.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Bloodstream Candida infection is a life-threatening event among ICU
		admitted patients. This infection is caused by a diverse range of Candida species
		having varied minimum inhibitory concentrations. OBJECTIVES: To identify Candida
		species causing bloodstream infections with their antifungal susceptibility
		determination. METHODS: Candida species isolated from the blood of ICU admitted
		patients were identified by phenotypic as well as by molecular methods including
		PCR-RFLP using MspI restriction enzyme and MALDI TOF MS. The minimum inhibitory
		"concentration of fluconazole, voriconazole, amphotericin B and caspofungin was"
		determined against isolated Candida species by CLSI M27A(3) guidelines. RESULTS:
		"A total of 119 Candida species were isolated. Among them, C. tropicalis(n=29) was"
		"the predominant isolate followed by C. parapsilosis(n=18), C. glabrata (n=12), C."
		krusei (n=11) and C. albicans(n=11). Uncommon Candida species isolated were;
		"Wickerhamomyces anomalus(n=15), Kodaemia ohmeri(n=8), C. lusitaniae (n=5) and C."
		auris (n=2). A varied antifungal MIC values were observed. Caspofungin had the
		lowest MIC among the tested antifungals. Increased fluconazole MIC was observed
		against the isolated Candida species including C. tropicalis. All the isolated C.
		lusitaniae and C. auris strains have ≥1mcg/ml amphotericin B MIC. In comparison
		"to fluconazole, voriconazole was more effective when tested in vitro. CONCLUSION:"
		Emergence of uncommon Candida species having varied antifungal MIC warns the
		"physicians to have a prompt, accurate identification with antifungal MIC"
		determination in each case of bloodstream Candida infections.

		Arabia.
PG	-	71-74
LID	-	10.4103/sjmms.sjmms_449_19 [doi]
AB	-	Candida auris is an opportunistic multidrug-resistant pathogen that was first
		isolated in 2009 and has since been reported from about 30 countries. In Saudi
		"Arabia, only four cases of C. auris have previously been reported; here, we"
		report two new cases of this infection. Both patients were polymorbid and had
		long hospitalization periods with recurrent intensive care unit (ICU) admissions.
		The findings of the tissue/blood cultures and antimicrobial therapy protocols are
		explained in the case report. Urine culture in both cases was positive for C.
		"auris, and the colonies grew well at 42°C. The fungal isolates were confirmed by"
		matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The
		"first patient was treated with the recommended dose of caspofungin, but he passed"
		"away. The second patient was also planned to be treated with caspofungin, but he"
		passed away before the treatment could be initiated. The present cases further
		corroborate signs of a growing number of reports of C. auris in patients with
		"high-risk factors, such as hospitalization in ICU, multiple chronic conditions"
		and prolonged antimicrobial treatment exposure. It also highlights the need for
		hospitals to further improve their infection control practices to prevent
		nosocomial infections such as C. auris.

		"with Candida tropicalis, isolated from the blood of a neutropenic patient."
		Identification of both isolates was confirmed by amplification and sequencing of
		internal transcribed spacer and D1/D2 domain of large subunit in rRNA gene.
		Antifungal susceptibility test by E-test method revealed that C. auris was
		"resistant to amphotericin B, anidulafungin, caspofungin, fluconazole,"
		"itraconazole and voriconazole. On the other hand, C. tropicalis was sensitive to"
		all antifungal tested. The use of chromogenic agar as isolation media is vital in
		detecting mixed candidemia.

AB	-	Routine identification of fungal pathogens from positive blood cultures by
		"culture-based methods can be time-consuming, delaying treatment with appropriate"
		antifungal agents. The GenMark Dx ePlex investigational use only blood culture
		identification fungal pathogen panel (BCID-FP) rapidly detects 15 fungal targets
		simultaneously in blood culture samples positive for fungi by Gram staining. We
		aimed to determine the performance of the BCID-FP in a multicenter clinical
		study. Blood culture samples collected at 10 United States sites and tested with
		BCID-FP at 4 sites were compared to the standard-of-care microbiological and
		"biochemical techniques, fluorescence in situ hybridization using peptide nucleic"
		acid probes (PNA-FISH) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of
		flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Discrepant results were analyzed by
		bi-directional PCR/sequencing of residual blood culture samples. A total of 866
		"clinical samples, 120 retrospectively and 21 prospectively collected, along with"
		725 contrived samples were evaluated. Sensitivity and specificity of detection of
		"Candida species (C. albicans, C. auris, C. dubliniensis, C. famata, C. glabrata,"
		"C. guilliermondii, C. kefyr, C. krusei, C. lusitaniae, C. parapsilosis, and C."
		"tropicalis) ranged from 97.1 to 100% and 99.8 to 100%, respectively. For the"
		"other organism targets, sensitivity and specificity were as follows: 100% each"
		"for Cryptococcus neoformans and C. gattii, 98.6% and 100% for Fusarium spp., and"
		"96.2% and 99.9% for Rhodotorula spp., respectively. In 4 of the 141 clinical"
		"samples, the BCID-FP panel correctly identified an additional Candida species,"
		undetected by standard-of-care methods. The BCID-FP panel offers a faster
		turnaround time for identification of fungal pathogens in positive blood cultures
		"that may allow for earlier antifungal interventions and includes C. auris, a"
		highly multidrug-resistant fungus.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candida auris is an emerging multidrug-resistant yeast that can cause
		invasive infections and is associated with high mortality. It is typically
		"resistant to fluconazole and voriconazole and, some cases, also to echinocandins"
		"and amphotericin B. This species, phylogenetically related to Candida haemulonii,"
		is frequently misidentified by commercial identification techniques in clinical
		"laboratories; therefore, the real prevalence of C. auris infections may be"
		underestimated. AIMS: To describe the clinical and microbiological features of
		the first four cases of C. auris fungemia episodes observed in the European
		continent. METHODS: The four patients were hospitalized in the adult surgical
		intensive care unit. A total of 8 isolates (two per patient) from blood and
		catheter tip were analyzed. RESULTS: All isolates were misidentified as
		"Saccharomyces cerevisiae by AuxaColor 2, and as Candida sake by API ID20C. VITEK"
		"MS technology misidentified one isolate as Candida lusitaniae, another as C."
		haemulonii and could not identify the other six. C. auris identification was
		confirmed by ITS rDNA sequencing. All isolates were fluconazole (MIC >256mg/l)
		"and voriconazole (MIC 2mg/l) resistant and susceptible to posaconazole,"
		"itraconazole, echinocandins and amphotericin B. CONCLUSIONS: C. auris should be"
		"regarded as an emerging pathogen, which requires molecular methods for definitive"
		identification. Our isolates were highly resistant to fluconazole and resistant
		"to voriconazole, but susceptible to the other antifungals tested, which"
		emphasizes the importance of accurately identifying this species to avoid
		therapeutic failures.

		tissues and corneas. No recipient case of infection transmission by Candida
		species was observed (organs and cornea). The implementation of active
		surveillance protocol for C. auris detection in critical care units (as source of
		tissue donors) has been suggested as a part of our hospitals' infection control
		policy.

		Hospitalization in Kenya.
PG	-	664-666

AB	-	Candida auris is an emerging drug-resistant yeast that causes outbreaks in health
		care facilities; cases have been reported from approximately 30 countries. U.S.
		cases of C. auris are likely the result of importation from abroad followed by
		extensive local transmission in health care settings (1). Early detection of
		Candida auris is key to preventing its spread. C. auris frequently co-occurs with
		"carbapenemase-producing organisms (CPOs), like carbapenem-resistant"
		"Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), organisms for which testing and public health response"
		"capacity substantially increased beginning in 2017. In September 2018, the"
		Maryland Department of Health (MDH) was notified of a hospitalized resident with

AB	-	This is a case report of the first two cases of Candida auris in Denmark. Patient
		1 was known to be colonized with C. auris when transferred from a foreign
		hospital to a Danish hospital. The patient was isolated during the entire
		hospitalization and the room was thoroughly cleaned after discharge. Patient 2
		who had no travel history spent five hours in the room of Patient 1 after
		"disinfection. One month later, C. auris was found in the blood of Patient 2."
		Transmission from Patient 1 to Patient 2 must be suspected.

		Single-centre experience in Saudi Arabia.
PG	-	452-460
LID	-	10.1111/myc.13065 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candida auris is a difficult-to-diagnose multidrug-resistant yeast
		"that can cause invasive infections with high mortality. Since emerging in 2009,"
		this pathogen has been associated with numerous outbreaks around the world. Whole
		genome sequencing (WGS) is instrumental for understanding the emergence and local
		"transmission of this pathogen. OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical, molecular"
		characteristics of Candida auris infection and clinical outcome in our centre.
		PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with positive cultures for Candida auris were
		identified in a microbiology database. Clinical characteristics and antifungal
		susceptibility were obtained. Isolates were sent to the US CDC for whole genome
		sequencing. RESULTS: Seven unique patients with eight different isolates were
		identified. Seven isolates were sent to the US CDC for whole genome sequencing.
		None of the patients had bloodstream infection. Thirty-day mortality was higher
		in infected patients compared with those who were colonised. Seven of the eight
		"isolates were resistant to both fluconazole, and five were resistant to"
		amphotericin B. WGS analysis demonstrated that the seven isolates belonged to the
		South Asian clade but formed two distinct subclades suggesting two independent
		introductions and ongoing transmission within the facility. CONCLUSIONS: Candida
		auris is associated with a high mortality rate in infected patients. Strict
		infection control measures and surveillance for asymptomatic cases are warranted
		to halt ongoing transmission.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant Candida auris infection has been reported from
		five continents in recent years. The prevalence of C. auris invasive infection
		has been estimated at 5.3% for intensive-care-acquired candidaemia in India. The
		transmission of the organism between the patients and from environment to
		patients is rapid. AIM: To understand the intra-hospital dynamics of C. auris
		transmission and to determine the possible interventions to prevent its spread.
		METHODS: Surveillance of intensive care units was carried out to assess patient
		"colonization, environmental contamination and hand carriage of the yeast among"
		healthcare workers. Interventions including chlorhexidine washing of patients and
		decontamination of environmental surfaces with stabilized hydrogen peroxide
		disinfectant (Ecoshield) were undertaken. We further evaluated the effectiveness
		of frequently used disinfectants in the hospital against C. auris on various
		"inanimate surfaces, and its persistence on hospital fabrics. FINDINGS: Three"
		cases of C. auris bloodstream infection were detected over a period of three
		"months. Many patients admitted at the same time, in the same area, were colonized"
		by C. auris. Surveillance detected C. auris contamination of environmental
		surfaces and hands of healthcare workers. Interventions such as chlorhexidine
		washing and appropriate use of disinfectants could eradicate C. auris from
		patients and hospital environment. CONCLUSION: The frequently used disinfectants
		in our hospital and current hand hygiene practices were efficient against
		C. auris if proper contact time and procedures were followed. Evaluation of
		possible persistence of C. auris on dry fabrics showed that they can persist for
		up to seven days.

		considered globally a cause of concern for public health. This report describes
		the first case of C. auris fungemia from a tertiary care hospital in the hilly
		state of Uttarakhand in India. CASE REPORT: The patient was a 37-year-old female
		who underwent a Whipple procedure for the carcinoma of the head of the pancreas.
		She developed fever 12 days after the operation while recovering from surgery in
		the hospital. Blood culture yielded C. auris which was identified by the
		matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry
		"(Bruker Daltonics, Germany). The patient was successfully treated with"
		"caspofungin. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, C. auris is potentially multidrug"
		"resistant, resulting in nosocomial outbreaks and sporadic infections which can be"
		potentially prevented when identified early by implementing contact precautions.

AB	-	"In view of the new viral COVID-19 pandemic, the fungal Candida auris epidemic"
		still in progress worldwide highlights non-Candida albicans candidal infections.
		We describe an immunocompetent woman with a cutaneous manifestation of Candida
		"parasilopsis fungemia, a prominent eschar, which proved to be the nidus for the"
		candidemia. We stress the value of selectively removing eschars. C. parasilopsis
		and C. auris are increasingly important causes of sepsis and wound infections. We
		emphasize that commercially available biochemical-based tests may misidentify C.
		"auris as C. parapsilosis, and stress the added danger of C. auris to critically"
		ill-hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Any health care facility with evidence of
		"infection or colonization with C. auris requires very close monitoring, since"
		this fungus is a nosocomial threat comparable to SARS-CoV-2 in its mortality and
		fomite adhesiveness! Both organisms have the potential to be transmitted as
		nosocomial pathogens; health care workers need to follow strict CDC guidelines.
		"During this COVID-19 pandemic, every health care facility should closely monitor"
		for the possible deadly combination of the SARS-CoV-2 and C. auris. The
		identification of C. auris necessitates use of sophisticated technology not
		readily available to make this essential diagnosis since C. auris is multi-drug
		resistant and isolation precautions would become paramount.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is an inflammatory response of the
		urothelium to bacterial invasion and is a common complication in patients with
		"cutaneous ureterostomy (CU). For such patients, accurate and efficient"
		identification of pathogens remains a challenge. The aim of this study included
		exploring utility of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) in assisting
		"microbiological diagnosis of UTI among patients undergoing CU, identifying"
		"promising cytokine or microorganism biomarkers, revealing microbiome diversity"
		change and compare virulence factors (VFs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs)
		after infection. METHODS: We performed a case-control study of 50 consecutive CU
		patients from December 2020 to January 2021. According to the clinical diagnostic
		"criteria, samples were divided into infected group and uninfected group and"
		"difference of urine culture, cytokines, microorganism, ARGs and VFs were compared"
		between the two groups. RESULTS: Inflammatory responses were more serious in
		"infected group, as evidenced by a significant increase in IFN-α (p=0.031), IL-1β"
		(0.023) and IL-6 (p=0.018). Clinical culture shows that there is higher positive
		"rate in infected group for most clinical pathogens like Escherichia coli,"
		"Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida auris etc. and the top"
		"three pathogens with positive frequencies were E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and"
		"Enterococcus faecalis. Benchmarking clinical culture, the total sensitivity is"
		"91.4% and specificity is 76.3% for mNGS. As for mNGS, there was no significant"
		difference in microbiome α- diversity between infected and uninfected group.
		"Three species biomarkers including Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella oxytoca, and"
		Enterobacter cloacae are enriched in infected group based on Lefse. E. cloacae
		were significantly correlated with IL-6 and IL-10. K. oxytoca were significantly
		"correlated with IL-1β. Besides, the unweighted gene number and weighted gene"
		"abundance of VFs or ARGs are significantly higher in infected group. Notablely,"
		"ARGs belonging to fluoroquinolones, betalatmas, fosfomycin, phenicol, phenolic"
		compound abundance is significantly higher in infected group which may have bad
		"effect on clinical treatment for patients. CONCLUSION: mNGS, along with urine"
		"culture, will provide comprehensive and efficient reference for the diagnosis of"
		UTI in patients with CU and allow us to monitor microbial changes in urine of
		"these patients. Moreover, cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β, and IFN-a) or microorganisms"
		"like C. freundii, K. oxytoca or E. cloacae are promising biomarkers for building"
		effective UTI diagnostic model of patients with CU and seriously the VFs and ARGs
		abundance increase in infected group may play bad effect on clinical treatment.

		admitted to a large university hospital.
PG	-	138-143
LID	-	10.1111/myc.13533 [doi]
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Candida auris is an emerging pathogen in health care-associated
		"infections. In contrast to many other countries with rising numbers of C. auris,"
		"only seven cases have been reported in Germany from 2015 to 2017, mostly from"
		patients who received prior medical treatment abroad. We therefore established a
		mandatory screening for C. auris colonisation at our tertiary care centre for all
		patients who were admitted as international patients or previously hospitalised
		in a foreign country within the past 6 months. METHODS: Colonisation of patients
		was assessed using a previously established screening protocol for multidrug
		"resistant bacteria. Since 2017, all screening samples were additionally analysed"
		"for C. auris using CHROMagar Candida (CHROMagar, Paris, France). Yeast isolates"
		were identified using matrix-assisted laser ionisation time-of-flight (MALDI
		"TOF), except for C. albicans (identified by the typical green colour on"
		chromogenic agar). Data were analysed retrospectively. RESULTS: Our study cohort
		included 655 patients and an overall number of 1399 samples. Fifty-three patients
		"were colonised with Candida species (C. albicans, n = 37; C. glabrata, n = 14;"
		others n = 9). No case of C. auris was detected. Candida spp. were mainly
		detected from respiratory samples (5.4% positive) and gastrointestinal specimen
		"(5.2%). Laboratory costs were 14,689 € and analyses resulted in 98.7 h of"
		additional technician's work. CONCLUSION: No colonisation with C. auris was
		detected among patients with previous hospitalisation abroad. Universal C. auris
		screening of patients with any contact to foreign health care does not seem to be
		cost-effective in our setting and more targeted screening strategies have to be
		developed.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Candida haemulonii is an emergent, multi-resistant opportunistic"
		"pathogenic yeast that like Candida auris, can be misidentified when conventional"
		diagnostic methods are used. Timely molecular identification using DNA sequence
		"analysis variation in the internal transcriber spacer region, ITS1-ITS4 and the"
		"28S ribosomal DNA gene (28S rDNA), and in vitro antifungal susceptibility"
		assessment can lead to rapid therapeutic success. CASE REPORT: A case of Candida
		haemulonii candidiasis suffered by a male paediatric patient attended at Federico
		Gómez Children's Hospital of México City in September 2016 is reported. The
		isolate was yielded from peripheral blood and central catheter blood specimens.
		"From in vitro antifungal susceptibility data, caspofungin was administered to the"
		"patient, who showed clear improvements at the end of antimicrobial"
		"administration, and the removal of the central venous catheter. Using a molecular"
		"phylogenetic approach, we identified the clinical isolate as C. haemulonii. The"
		clinical isolate has been named as Candida haemulonii ENCB-87 from now on. C.
		"haemulonii ENCB-87 grew well between the temperatures, 28 °C and 35 °C but not at"
		"37 °C in YPD culture medium. The clinical isolate was susceptible to caspofungin,"
		which resulted in therapeutic success for the patient. CONCLUSIONS: C. haemulonii
		"is an emergent, opportunistic pathogen, closely related to C. auris, therefore,"
		the timely and accurate identification and antifungal susceptibility assessments
		are paramount in generating a robust epidemiology of this emerging Candida
		species.

TI	-	Candidaemia in a tertiary care centre of developing country: Monitoring possible
		change in spectrum of agents and antifungal susceptibility.
PG	-	110-116
LID	-	10.4103/ijmm.IJMM_20_112 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: Candidaemia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality of hospitalised
		"patients, especially in developing countries. This study was conducted to monitor"
		any change in species distribution and antifungal susceptibility pattern of
		Candida species causing candidaemia over the last 20 years. MATERIALS AND
		METHODS: The candidaemia cases reported during January 1999 and December 2018 at
		our centre were reviewed. The yeasts were identified by phenotypic characters
		(during 1999-2014) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation-time of flight
		mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) (during 2014-2018). Antifungal susceptibility
		testing (AFST) was performed in accordance with the Clinical and Laboratory
		"Standards Institute guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 602,963 blood samples from"
		patients with suspected sepsis were processed. Candidaemia was diagnosed in 7927
		(1.31%) cases. The frequency of cases rose significantly (P = 0.000) in the last
		"quarter of the study. Candida tropicalis (40.1%) was the most common species,"
		"followed by Candida albicans (15.2%), Wickerhamomyces anomalus (13.1%), Candida"
		"krusei (6.6%), Candida parapsilosis (4.7%) and others. Rare species such as"
		"Candida auris, Candida lambica, Candida orthopsilosis, Candida vishwanathii were"
		identified after the introduction of MALDI-TOF. The minimum inhibitory
		concentrations of amphotericin B rose significantly from the first to last
		quarter (0.5%-4.9%). Fluconazole resistance was fairly constant at 7.4%-8.8%.
		CONCLUSION: Local epidemiology of candidaemia at our centre was distinct
		regarding prevalence and change of spectrum of species. The identification of
		rare species was possible after the introduction of MALDI-TOF. With the emergence
		"of multidrug-resistant C. auris and resistance in other species, routine AFST has"
		become imperative.

AB	-	Candida auris has emerged as the multi-drug resistant non-albican candida species
		in critically ill patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU) causing
		bloodstream and other infections. It has often been misidentified as Candida
		"famata, Candida sake, Rhodotorula glutinis, or Saccharomyces cerevisiae and"
		"Candida haemulonii by automated identification systems. We, in this study,"
		discuss three patients who acquired Candida auris infection after 15 to 20days of
		"their stay in medical ICU. Medical equipment, use of multiple antibiotics, and"
		poor hand hygiene are the most probable predisposing factors attributing to its
		colonization at multiple anatomical sites leading to bloodstream infection.
		Candida auris might substantially contaminate the environment of colonized or
		infected patients making its eradication difficult. Patient screening for Candida
		"auris, especially during prolonged ICU stays, along with strict infection"
		prevention and control strategies needs to be adopted to break its persistence.

		"clinicians, laboratorians, infection control practitioners, and public health"
		authorities about C. auris and requesting that C. auris cases be reported to
		state and local health departments and CDC (8). This report describes the first
		"seven U.S. cases of C. auris infection reported to CDC as of August 31, 2016."
		Data from these cases suggest that transmission of C. auris might have occurred

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: Characterization of a hospital outbreak of Candida auris candidemia
		that involved 18 critically ill patients in Venezuela. METHOD: Bloodstream
		isolates of C. auris obtained from 18 patients admitted at a medical center in
		"Maracaibo, between March, 2012 and July, 2013 were included. Species"
		identification was confirmed by ITS rDNA sequencing. Isolates were subsequently
		typed by amplified fragment length polymorphism fingerprinting (AFLP).
		Susceptibility testing was performed according to CLSI. Clinical data were
		collected from all cases by using a standard clinical form. RESULTS: A total of
		"13 critically ill pediatric and 5 adult patients, with a median age of 26 days,"
		were included. All were previously exposed to antibiotics and multiple invasive
		medical procedures. Clinical management included prompt catheter removal and
		antifungal therapy. Thirteen patients (72%) survived up to 30 days after onset of
		candidemia. AFLP fingerprinting of all C. auris isolates suggested a clonal
		"outbreak. The isolates were considered resistant to azoles, but susceptible to"
		anidulafungin and 50% of isolates exhibited amphotericin B MIC values of
		>1 μg/ml. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated that C. auris is a multiresistant
		yeast pathogen that can be a source of health-care associated infections in
		tertiary care hospitals with a high potential for nosocomial horizontal
		transmission.

AB	-	Candida auris is an emerging multidrug-resistant yeast with high mortality. We
		report the sentinel C. auris case on the United States West Coast in a patient
		who relocated from India. We identified close phylogenetic relatedness to the
		South Asia clade and ERG11 Y132F and FKS1 S639Y mutations potentially explaining
		antifungal resistance.
