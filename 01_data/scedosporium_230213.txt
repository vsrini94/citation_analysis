TI	-	The Changing Epidemiology of Invasive Fungal Infections.
PG	-	17-65
AB	-	Invasive fungal infections (IFI) are an emerging problem worldwide with invasive
		candidiasis and candidemia responsible for the majority of cases. This is
		predominantly driven by the widespread adoption of aggressive immunosuppressive
		"therapy among certain patient populations (e.g., chemotherapy, transplants) and"
		the increasing use of invasive devices such as central venous catheters (CVCs).
		The use of new immune modifying drugs has also opened up an entirely new spectrum
		of patients at risk of IFIs. While the epidemiology of candida infections has
		"changed in the last decade, with a gradual shift from C. albicans to non-albicans"
		"candida (NAC) strains which may be less susceptible to azoles, these changes vary"
		between hospitals and regions depending on the type of population risk factors
		"and antifungal use. In certain parts of the world, the incidence of IFI is"
		strongly linked to the prevalence of other disease conditions and the ecological
		niche for the organism; for instance cryptococcal and pneumocystis infections are
		particularly common in areas with a high prevalence of HIV disease. Poorly
		controlled diabetes is a major risk factor for invasive mould infections.
		Environmental factors and trauma also play a unique role in the epidemiology of
		"mould infections, with well-described hospital outbreaks linked to the use of"
		contaminated instruments and devices. Blastomycosis is associated with
		"occupational exposure (e.g., forest rangers) and recreational activities (e.g.,"
		camping and fishing).The true burden of IFI is probably an underestimate because
		of the absence of reliable diagnostics and lack of universal application. For
		"example, the sensitivity of most blood culture systems for detecting candida is"
		typically 50 %. The advent of new technology including molecular techniques such
		as 18S ribosomal RNA PCR and genome sequencing is leading to an improved
		understanding of the epidemiology of the less common mould and dimorphic fungal
		infections. Molecular techniques are also providing a platform for improved
		"diagnosis and management of IFI.Many factors affect mortality in IFI, not least"
		"the underlying medical condition, choice of therapy, and the ability to achieve"
		"early source control. For instance, mortality due to pneumocystis pneumonia in"
		HIV-seronegative individuals is now higher than in seropositive patients. Of
		significant concern is the progressive increase in resistance to azoles and
		"echinocandins among candida isolates, which appears to worsen the already"
		significant mortality associated with invasive candidiasis. Mortality with mould
		"infections approaches 50 % in most studies and varies depending on the site,"
		underlying disease and the use of antifungal agents such as echinocandins and
		"voriconazole. Nevertheless, mortality for most IFIs has generally fallen with"
		"advances in medical technology, improved care of CVCs, improved diagnostics, and"
		more effective preemptive therapy and prophylaxis.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To further characterize the histomorphology and clinicopathologic
		features of colonization and invasive disease by Scedosporium and Lomentospora.
		METHODS: We conducted a 20-year retrospective study. Patients with at least 1
		"histopathology specimen and concurrent culture were included. Clinical features,"
		"histopathology, microbiology, and outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: Eighteen"
		"patients were identified, and all were immunocompromised. Eight patients had"
		"colonization, while 10 had invasive disease (pneumonia [n = 3], skin and"
		"soft-tissue infections [n = 3], disseminated disease [n = 4]). Scedosporium"
		"apiospermum was identified in 15 patients, Lomentospora prolificans in 2"
		"patients, and Scedosporium ellipsoideum in 1 patient. Fungal elements were"
		"identified histologically in 11 patients. Granulomatous, suppurative, and"
		necrotizing inflammation with irregular branching hyphae and characteristic
		microconidia were observed in 9 cases; conidiogenous cells were identified in 4
		"cases. Seven patients died of invasive disease despite therapy, and 3 recovered"
		after treatment. No deaths were observed in patients with colonization.
		"CONCLUSIONS: Scedosporium and Lomentospora are rare, virulent opportunistic"
		"fungal pathogens. Fungal morphology may overlap with other hyaline molds, but"
		identification of obovoid conidia should allow a diagnosis of non-Aspergillus
		hyalohyphomycosis and consideration of Scedosporium and Lomentospora.
		Histopathologic correlation with culture and polymerase chain reaction is
		critical for diagnosis and treatment.

		of Scedosporium species identification.
PG	-	486-497
LID	-	10.1093/mmy/myaa086 [doi]
AB	-	Scedosporiosis/lomentosporiosis is a devastating emerging fungal infection. Our
		objective was to describe the clinical pattern and to analyze whether taxonomic
		grouping of the species involved was supported by differences in terms of
		clinical presentations or outcomes. We retrospectively studied cases of invasive
		scedosporiosis in France from 2005 through 2017 based on isolates characterized
		"by polyphasic approach. We recorded 90 cases, mainly related to Scedosporium"
		"apiospermum (n = 48), S. boydii/S. ellipsoideum (n = 20), and Lomentospora"
		"prolificans (n = 14). One-third of infections were disseminated, with"
		unexpectedly high rates of cerebral (41%) and cardiovascular (31%) involvement.
		"In light of recent Scedosporium taxonomic revisions, we aimed to study the"
		clinical significance of Scedosporium species identification and report for the
		first time contrasting clinical presentations between infections caused S.
		"apiospermum, which were associated with malignancies and cutaneous involvement in"
		"disseminated infections, and infections caused by S. boydii, which were"
		"associated with solid organ transplantation, cerebral infections, fungemia, and"
		early death. The clinical presentation of L. prolificans also differed from that
		"of other species, involving more neutropenic patients, breakthrough infections,"
		"fungemia, and disseminated infections. Neutropenia, dissemination, and lack of"
		antifungal prescription were all associated with 3-month mortality. Our data
		support the distinction between S. apiospermum and S. boydii and between L.
		prolificans and Scedosporium sp. Our results also underline the importance of the
		"workup to assess dissemination, including cardiovascular system and brain."

TI	-	Scedosporium apiospermum and Lomentospora prolificans in lung transplant patients
		- A single center experience over 24 years.
PG	-	e13546
LID	-	10.1111/tid.13546 [doi]
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Scedosporium apiospermum and Lomentospora prolificans
		"(Scedosporium/Lomentospora) species are emerging, multi-resistant pathogens that"
		cause life-threatening illnesses among lung transplant (LTx) recipients. The
		current epidemiology and management in LTx are unknown. METHODS: We performed a
		retrospective single center audit of all sputum/bronchoscopy samples for
		Scedosporium/Lomentospora species in LTx patients over a 24-year period
		(1995-2019). Patients were diagnosed as colonized or with invasive fungal
		"disease. RESULTS: From a cohort of 962 LTx recipients, 30 patients (3.1%)"
		"cultured Scedosporium/Lomentospora (1.2%, 1.9%, respectively). There were no"
		"isolates from 1995 to 2013, with multiple yearly isolates thereafter. Nineteen"
		"(63%) cases were classified as IFD, and 11 (37%) as colonization. The median time"
		to first culture from transplantation was 929 days (Interquartile-range [IQR]
		263-2960). Most patients (63%) had received antifungals prior to the first
		positive culture of Scedosporium/Lomentospora for other fungal infection. The
		most common antifungal used for treatment of Scedosporium/Lomentospora was
		posaconazole (n = 16; 53%). Median duration of therapy was 364 days (IQR
		164-616). Treatment was associated with improved lung function over 6 months
		(median FEV1 increased from 1.3L[IQR 0.9-1.8L] to 1.8L[IQR 1.1-2.3] P = .05). Six
		"patients cultured Scedosporium/Lomentospora prior to transplantation, and no"
		survival disadvantage was seen as compared to our whole LTx cohort (P = .8).
		CONCLUSION: Our single center 24-year experience suggests that the incidence of
		Scedosporium/Lomentospora is increasing. Scedosporium/Lomentospora is typically
		"isolated several years after LTx, and requires prolonged anti-fungal treatment"
		that is usually associated with improved in lung function. Culture of
		Scedosporium/Lomentospora prior to LTx did not pose a survival disadvantage.
		Further surveillance is required to fully characterize implications of these
		organisms for LTx recipients.

PG	-	36
LID	-	10.1186/s12879-016-1372-y [doi]
LID	-	36
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Lomentospora prolificans (formally Scedosporium prolificans) is an
		environmental mould with a global distribution. Endocarditis caused by L.
		prolificans is a rare but serious emerging disease in immunocompromised patients.
		Prior to this case there have only been eight cases reported in the literature.
		Diagnosis can be challenging and there are no evidence-based guidelines for
		treatment. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 75-year-old woman with ovarian
		carcinoma who presented with fever after chemotherapy. Repeated sterile site
		"cultures remained negative until day 22 of admission, when Lomentospora"
		"prolificans was isolated from blood cultures. Following extensive investigations,"
		including Fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and
		"transoephageal echocardiography (TOE), the patient was diagnosed with"
		endocarditis complicated by cerebral emboli. The patient was considered
		unsuitable for surgical intervention and passed away five days after the fungus
		was isolated. CONCLUSION: Endocarditis caused by Lomentospora prolificans is a
		"rare but emerging condition, with limited treatment options and a high mortality."
		"Awareness of the increasing incidence of Lomentospora prolificans infection,"
		"diagnosed often at an advanced stage, with potential for endocarditis may prompt"
		earlier echocardiography or FDG-PET imaging. Further studies are needed to
		"determine the optimal combination and duration of anti-fungal agents, used in"
		conjunction with aggressive surgical excision where feasible.

		and review of the literature.
PG	-	979-985
LID	-	10.1017/S0022215122000202 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To present our case series and management of Scedosporium apiospermum
		"infections of the middle ear and mastoid, and review the current literature on"
		this rare yet potentially life-threatening condition. METHODS: Medical records of
		patients treated at the Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital for S apiospermum
		middle ear and mastoid infections between 2009 and 2019 were reviewed. A
		"literature search was conducted using PubMed, Medline and Cochrane Library"
		databases. RESULTS: Two patients were identified in our institution: a
		"62-year-old diabetic woman with otogenic skull base osteomyelitis, and a"
		12-year-old boy with unilateral chronic suppurative otitis media which developed
		after tympanostomy tube insertion. The persistence of otalgia and otorrhoea
		despite prolonged antibiotic treatment characterised these cases. Both patients
		"received voriconazole, and achieved disease resolution without complications. Ten"
		"relevant cases were identified after review of the literature. Despite treatment,"
		"there were three patient deaths, and four patients with otological or"
		neurological complications. CONCLUSION: The presence of a middle ear or mastoid
		infection refractory to appropriate topical and systemic antibiotics should
		prompt clinicians to consider a fungal infection. The role of surgical
		debridement in the treatment of S apiospermum infection of the middle ear and
		mastoid is equivocal.

AB	-	The clinical and microbiological characteristics of infections caused by
		Scedosporium/ Lomentospora species in 21 patients are described. We searched
		retrospectively the records for Scedosporium/ Lomentospora species seen at the
		"University Hospital Virgen de las Nieves from 2006 to 2017. Out of them, 16 were"
		male; mean age at diagnosis was 57.8 (±SD 15) years; all patients had risk

		"treatment in 18 (85.7%) patients, pulmonary diseases in seven (33.3%) cases,"
		"hematological malignancies in six (28.5%), and organ transplantation in three"
		(14.2%) patients. Most patients had infection in the lung/pleura (17/80.9%);
		"cough was present in 12 patients and dyspnea in another 12, and the mean interval"
		until diagnosis was 13.6 days. The most frequent species was S. apiospermum/S.
		"boydii in 14 patients (66.6%), followed by L. prolificans in seven. The diagnosis"
		"was obtained from sputum in 12 (57.1%) cases, followed by pleural fluid and"
		bronchoalveolar lavage in two of each. The most frequently used antifungals were
		"voriconazole and amphotericin B, but combination of more than one antifungal drug"
		"was only used in three patients. Ten patients were cured, and six patients died"
		as a consequence of the infection; three patients had chronic infection. In
		"general, infections caused by Scedosporium/Lomentospora species are rare,"
		"serious, and difficult to diagnose and treat, having a high index or mortality"
		especially in those caused by L. prolificans.

PG	-	3251-3260
LID	-	10.12998/wjcc.v10.i10.3251 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Scedosporium apiospermum (S. apiospermum) is a clinically rare and
		"aggressive fungus mainly found in contaminated water, wetlands, decaying plants,"
		"stagnant water, and potted plants in hospitals. The lung, bone, joint, eye,"
		"brain, skin, and other sites are easily infected, and there is a marked risk of"
		misdiagnosis. There have been few case reports of infection by S. apiospermum of
		the lumbar vertebrae; most reports have focused on infection of the lung. CASE
		SUMMARY: An otherwise healthy 60-year-old man presented with a 4-mo history of
		"lumbosacral pain, stooping, and limited walking. The symptoms were significantly"
		"aggravated 10 d prior to hospitalization, and radiating pain in the back of his"
		"left lower leg developed, which was so severe that he could not walk. Movement of"
		"the lumbar spine was significantly limited, anterior flexion was about 30°;"
		"backward extension, right and left lateral curvature, and rotational mobility"
		were about 10°; tenderness of the spinous processes of the lumbar 3-5 vertebrae
		"was evident, and the muscle strength of both lower limbs was grade IV. Imaging"
		"suggested bony destruction of the lumbar 3, 4, and 5 vertebrae and sacral 1"
		"vertebra; in addition, the corresponding intervertebral spaces were narrowed and"
		the lumbar 5 vertebra was posteriorly displaced and unstable. Lumbar vertebral
		"infection was also noted, and the possibility of lumbar tuberculosis was"
		considered. We first performed surgical intervention on the lesioned lumbar
		"vertebrae, cleared the infected lesion, and performed stable fixation of the"
		"lesioned vertebral body using a lumbar internal fixation device, which restored"
		the stability of the lumbar vertebrae. Cytological and pathological examination
		of the lesioned tissue removed during surgery confirmed S. apiospermum infection
		"of the lumbar vertebrae; on this basis, the patient was administered"
		"voriconazole. At the 6-mo follow-up, efficacy was significant, no drug-related"
		"side effects were observed, and imaging examination showed no evidence of"
		recurrence. CONCLUSION: S. apiospermum infection can occur in immunocompetent
		individuals with no history of near drowning. Voriconazole is effective for the
		treatment of S. apiospermum infection of the lumbar vertebrae for which it is
		suitable as the first-line therapy.

AB	-	The use of multi-locus DNA sequence analysis has led to the description of
		"previously unknown 'cryptic' Aspergillus species, whereas classical"
		morphology-based identification of Aspergillus remains limited to the section or
		species-complex level. The current literature highlights two main features
		"concerning these 'cryptic' Aspergillus species. First, the prevalence of such"
		species in clinical samples is relatively high compared with emergent filamentous
		"fungal taxa such as Mucorales, Scedosporium or Fusarium. Second, it is clearly"
		important to identify these species in the clinical laboratory because of the
		high frequency of antifungal drug-resistant isolates of such Aspergillus species.
		Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry
		(MALDI-TOF MS) has recently been shown to enable the identification of
		filamentous fungi with an accuracy similar to that of DNA sequence-based methods.
		"As MALDI-TOF MS is well suited to the routine clinical laboratory workflow, it"
		facilitates the identification of these 'cryptic' Aspergillus species at the
		routine mycology bench. The rapid establishment of enhanced filamentous fungi
		identification facilities will lead to a better understanding of the epidemiology
		and clinical importance of these emerging Aspergillus species. Based on routine
		"MALDI-TOF MS-based identification results, we provide original insights into the"
		key interpretation issues of a positive Aspergillus culture from a clinical
		sample. Which ubiquitous species that are frequently isolated from air samples
		are rarely involved in human invasive disease? Can both the species and the type
		"of biological sample indicate Aspergillus carriage, colonization or infection in"
		a patient? Highly accurate routine filamentous fungi identification is central to
		"enhance the understanding of these previously unknown Aspergillus species, with a"
		vital impact on further improved patient care.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: Detection of hyphomycetes of the Scedosporium apiospermum complex and
		Lomentospora prolificans (Sac-Lp) is not yet standardized. Prevalence rates in
		patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and the resistance pattern of these pathogens
		in Germany are unknown. METHODS: In a one-year prospective study 11 laboratories
		"used a selective medium for isolation of Sac-Lp, examining >11,600 respiratory"
		samples from 2346 patients with CF. Isolates were identified by molecular methods
		and tested for susceptibility to antifungal drugs. RESULTS: The prevalence of
		Sac-Lp in patients with CF in Germany varied from 0.0 to 10.5% (mean: 3.1%) among
		the clinical centres. The benefit of the selective medium SceSel(+) compared to
		standard media for fungi was documented for >5000 samples. High antifungal
		"resistance was detected in the S. apiospermum complex, and the multiresistance of"
		L. prolificans was confirmed. CONCLUSION: Microbiology laboratories should be
		aware of these resistant species in patients with CF and consider using a
		selective medium.

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: Invasive fungal infections caused by Lomentospora prolificans are
		associated with very high mortality rates and can be challenging to treat given
		pan-drug resistance to available antifungal agents. The objective of this study
		was to describe the clinical presentation and outcomes in a cohort of patients
		with invasive L prolificans infections. METHODS: We performed a retrospective
		review of medical records of patients with invasive L prolificans infection in
		the FungiScope(®) registry of rare invasive fungal infections. Patients diagnosed
		between 01 January 2008 and 09 September 2019 were included in for analysis.
		RESULTS: The analysis included 41 patients with invasive L prolificans infection
		from eight different countries. Haematological/oncological malignancies were the
		"most frequent underlying disease (66%), disseminated infection was frequent"
		"(61%), and the lung was the most commonly involved organ (44%). Most infections"
		(59%) were breakthrough infections. Progression/deterioration/treatment failure
		"was observed in 23/40 (58%) of patients receiving antifungal therapy. In total,"
		"21/41 (51%) patients, and 77% of patients with underlying"
		"haematological/oncological malignancy, had a fatal outcome attributed to invasive"
		fungal infection. Combination antifungal therapy was frequent (24/40) and
		"associated with improved survival. In particular, treatment regimens including"
		terbinafine were significantly associated with higher treatment success at final
		"assessment (P = .012), with a positive trend observed for treatment regimens that"
		included voriconazole (P = .054). CONCLUSIONS: Lomentospora prolificans
		infections were associated with mortality rates of 77% and above in patients with
		underlying haematological/oncological malignancies and those with disseminated
		"infections. While combination therapy is the preferred option for now, the hope"
		lies with novel antifungals currently under development.

AB	-	A case of localized lung scedosporiosis is reported here that mimicked
		aspergilloma in an immunocompetent host. Through this case the importance of
		considering Scedosporium spp. in differential diagnosis of locally invasive lung
		infections and fungal ball is highlighted. As it is difficult to differentiate
		"Scedosporium from Aspergillus on clinical grounds, microscopy, radiology and"
		"histopathology, this case is further emphasizing the significance of the"
		definitive etiological characterization of Scedosporium through culture or
		"molecular diagnostic tools. Accurate identification of Scedosporium, surgical"
		resection and high-dose voriconazole has been associated with favorable outcome
		in most reported cases of scedosporiosis.

AB	-	"We retrospectively analyzed 542 proven/probable mould infections registered, in"
		"the course of 2 studies, in 8,633 patients with acute leukemia, focusing on"
		scedosporiosis. We aimed to define scedosporiosis incidence and mortality rate
		"over a 15-year period. Only 5 cases of scedosporiosis were identified, all of"
		them involving patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We also reviewed all
		cases of Scedosporium spp. infections in acute leukemia reported to date in the
		international literature. The 52 cases analyzed confirmed that acute myeloid
		leukemia is the category with the highest risk of scedosporiosis. Clinical
		features of scedosporiosis were extremely variable and closely related to patient
		immune status. Infection disseminated to multiple sites in a very high percentage
		of patients and outcome was confirmed to be very poor. In our surveys all
		"patients died, in spite of Amphotericin B compounds or voriconazole"
		administration. Our review of literature found scedosporiosis attributable
		"mortality rate (AMR) to be 77%. In conclusion, scedosporiosis, although extremely"
		"rare, represents a big problem for clinicians because of its aggressive clinical"
		presentation and the lack of an effective therapy. New drugs with in vitro
		"activity against Scedosporium spp (voriconazole, posaconazole) should be"
		"considered. However, their clinical activity should be more widely demonstrated."

AB	-	Infections caused by the Scedosporium genus have become recognized as a fatal
		"complication after lung transplantation in Europe and Australia, but the reports"
		have been rare from Asian countries including Japan. We present a case of
		pneumonia caused by a mixed infection of Scedosporium apiospermum (SA) and
		Lomentospora prolificans (LP) that developed after augmentation of
		immunosuppression for chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) after lung
		transplantation. A 13-year-old man underwent bilateral lung transplantation for
		"pulmonary hypertension. One year after surgery, he was treated with a series of"
		augmented immunosuppressive therapy for severe acute rejection and subsequent
		"CLAD. Three months following the first steroid pulse therapy, his serum"
		β-D-glucan elevated without any sign of fungal infection by other tests. The
		serum β-D-glucan once returned to a normal level by empirical administration of
		"micafungin; however, the patient's condition worsened again by discontinuation of"
		"it. He did not recover by restarting micafungin, and computed tomography (CT)"
		scans eventually demonstrated new infiltrates in his lung field 6 weeks after the
		elevation of serum β-D-glucan. Microscopic findings of transbronchial lung biopsy
		"specimens showed filamentous fungi, and the culture of bronchoalveolar lavage"
		fluid revealed the growth of SA and LP. Despite subsequent voriconazole
		"administration, he died 14 days after the start of voriconazole. Early and"
		aggressive inspection including bronchoscopy should be performed for the
		"diagnosis of Scedosporium infection in immunocompromised patients, even if CT"
		scans and sputum culture show no evidence of infection.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Scedosporium apiospermum, an opportunistic and filamentous fungus, is"
		a rarely seen ocular entity that is difficult to identify and heal. We report a
		challenging case of S. apiospermium keratitis and discuss the treatment
		modalities in light of previous studies. CASE PRESENTATION: A 30-year-old Turkish
		farmer with a history of contact lens misuse presented to our clinic with a
		painful corneal abscess and severe vision loss in his left eye. S. apiospermum
		was identified by spectrophotometric analysis. The patient was successfully
		"treated with therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty, but was resistant to"
		fluconazole and amphotericin B and susceptible but unresponsive to voriconazole.
		CONCLUSION: S. apiospermum keratitis should be considered in the differential
		diagnosis of immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients with history of
		"ocular trauma and contact lens use, especially those who do not respond to"
		treatment.

AB	-	Scedosporium apiospermum is an ubiquitous fungus responsible for various
		infections in immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients. Ear infections are
		infrequent. We report an exceptional case of S. apiospermum external otitis
		complicated by temporomandibular joint arthritis. After 6 months of
		"antibiotherapy, diagnosis was established by mycological analysis of external"
		auditory canal and infratemporal fossae needle sampling. A satisfactory outcome
		was obtained after 2 months of voriconazole alone. We have reviewed 15 cases of
		S. apiospermum otitis. Seven of these patients were immunocompromised. Most
		common clinical presentation included a chronic external otitis lasting months or
		years before complication stage. Most common clinical features included recurrent
		unilateral otalgia (11/15) and purulent otorrhea (13/15). Diagnosis was often
		made at later stage (12/15) with local extension to bones and/or soft tissues
		(9/15) or cerebral lethal dissemination (3/15).The extremely low incidence of S.
		apiospermum otomycosis and its non-specific presentation results in a frequent
		diagnosis delay. A mycological investigation should be performed in case of
		persistent external otitis and/or osteolysis despite prolonged antibiotic
		treatment to prevent further extension of the disease.

		in Kenya.
PG	-	798
LID	-	10.1186/s12879-022-07782-9 [doi]
LID	-	798
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is a significant risk factor for fungal
		infection. The cavitary lesions post PTB serves as a good reservoir for fungal
		"colonization and subsequent infection. Furthermore, the severe immunosuppression"
		associated with HIV and TB co-infection is another predisposition. The inadequate
		capacity to investigate and manage fungal infection in PTB patients increases
		their morbidity and mortality. The study aimed to provide serological evidence of
		"chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) among PTB patients in Kenya. Towards this,"
		we analysed 234 serum samples from patients presenting with persistent clinical
		features of PTB infections despite TB treatment in four referral hospitals.
		METHODS: This was a cross sectional laboratory based study and patients were
		recruited following an informed consent. Serological detection of Aspergillus
		fumigatus IgG was done using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Bordier Affinity
		Products SA). Sputum samples were subjected to microscopy and standard fungal
		culture. The isolated fungi were subjected to macro and micro morphological
		"identifications and confirmed by sequence analysis of calmadulin, betatubilin and"
		ITS genes. RESULTS: Serological evidence of CPA or fungal sensitization was
		46(19.7%) and equivocal or borderline was 14(6.0%). Mycological investigations of
		sputum resulted in 88(38%) positive for fungal culture. Aspergillus spp.
		"accounted for 25(28%) of which A. fumigatus was 13(14.8%), A. niger 8(9.1%), A."
		"terreus, A. flavus, A. candidus and A. clavatus 1 (1.1%) each. This was followed"
		"by Penicillium spp. 10 (11.4%), Scedosporium spp. 5 (5.7%) and Rhizopus spp. 3"
		(3.4%). Among the yeasts; Candida albicans accounted for 18(20.5%) followed by C.
		glabrata 5(5.7%). Cryptococcus spp. was isolated from 3(3.4%) of the samples
		while 13(14.8%) were other yeasts. CONCLUSION: Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis is
		a significant co-morbidity in PTB patients in Kenya that could be misdiagnosed as
		relapse or treatment failures in the absence of reliable diagnostic and clinical
		management algorithm. It could be the cause of persistent clinical symptoms
		despite TB treatment often misdiagnosed as TB smear/GeneXpert MTB/RIF® negative
		or relapse. We recommend that all patients with persistent clinical symptoms
		despite TB treatment should be subjected to fungal investigations before
		retreatment.

LID	-	340
AB	-	BACKGROUND: We present a case of fungal keratitis caused by
		"Scedosporium apiospermum, which is a rare agent. Case description A 34-year-old"
		Caucasian male patient was admitted to our clinic with complaints of pain and
		blurred vision in the left eye. The patient had a history of wearing contact
		"lenses for 3 years. According to the Snellen chart, the patient's visual acuity"
		"was 20/20 and counting fingers at 30 cm, for right and left eyes, respectively. A"
		3 × 3 mm corneal abscess at the center of the cornea with hypopyon in the
		"patient's left eye was observed. After the patient was hospitalized, fortified"
		gentamicin and fortified cefazolin drops were started 24 times per day.
		"Intravenous fluconazole 1 × 800 mg loading, 1 × 400 mg maintenance dose,"
		intravenous vancomycin 4 × 500 mg and intravenous cefoperazone + sulbactam
		2 × 2 g treatments were started. We observed S. apiospermum in the corneal
		"scraping sample, which the identification was performed by combined phenotypic"
		characteristics and matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization time-of-flight
		mass spectrometry on the sixth day of treatment. The drops were revised as
		"fortified vancomycin, ceftazidime, and voriconazole drops 24 times per day."
		Intravenous voriconazole 2 × 6 mg/kg loading and 2 × 4 mg/kg maintenance dose
		"treatments were started. Three weeks later, left eye visual acuity increased to"
		"20/40, and the corneal abscess regressed. On second-year follow-up, his visual"
		acuity increased to 20/25 for the left eye and the cornea was transparent.
		CONCLUSION: Scedosporium group is an opportunistic filamentous fungus that is
		"very rarely seen and causes severe keratitis infections. In the literature, to"
		"the best of our knowledge, three cases of keratitis due to S. apiospermum after"
		"contact lenses were reported, and all were treated with penetrating keratoplasty."
		"In this case, unlike the others, only medical treatment was applied. In cases"
		"with suspected fungal keratitis, medical treatment should be started without"
		"waiting for the culture result, the findings should be followed and penetrating"
		keratoplasty should be performed in the case of no response to treatment.

LID	-	10.1093/jac/dks210 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Scedosporium species are increasingly recognized as a cause of
		"invasive mould disease in haematology patients, but little is known about the"
		hospitalization costs and outcomes attributable to invasive scedosporiosis
		(SCEDO). METHODS: A retrospective case-control study was undertaken during
		"2002-10 to determine the attributable inpatient costs, length of stay (LOS) and"
		mortality associated with SCEDO in haematology patients. Case patients with SCEDO
		(n = 30) were matched 1 : 2 to controls (n = 60) according to haematological
		"diagnosis, admission year and age. Diagnostics, antifungal drugs, ward and other"
		SCEDO-related costs were estimated using actual cost data. Median regression
		modelling was used to adjust for variables that were not accounted for in the
		matched-pairs analysis. RESULTS: The crude total median cost of treating SCEDO
		was AU$32 182 per patient versus AU$17 424 per control. In multivariable
		"analysis, SCEDO was associated with median excess costs of AU$23 611 (95%"
		"CI = AU$17 992-AU$29 231; P < 0.001), approximating US$15 509 at purchasing power"
		"parity, with prolonged LOS of 13 days (95% CI = 8.2-17.8 days; P < 0.001)."
		Exclusion of cases and matched pairs with early death further increased the
		"median excess cost and LOS. The cost differential was driven by ward costs (64%,"
		"P = 0.005) and antifungal treatment costs (29%, P < 0.001). The all-cause"
		inpatient mortality was 38 times higher for the SCEDO cases versus the control
		group (63.3% versus 1.7%; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: SCEDO has substantial impact
		"on hospital resource consumption, LOS and mortality in haematology patients. Risk"
		factors and preventative measures for SCEDO should be further studied.

PG	-	1587-1590
LID	-	10.1016/j.radcr.2022.01.078 [doi]
AB	-	Voriconazole is a broad-spectrum triazole antifungal used to treat invasive
		fungal infections. It is commonly used prophylactically in immunocompromized
		"patient cohorts, including transplant recipients. Diffuse periostitis is a very"
		rare complication of chronic voriconazole use. It is associated with diffuse bone
		"pain, elevated serum alkaline phosphatase and fluorine levels. Characteristic"
		"imaging findings include periosteal thickening with a dense, nodular, irregular"
		and often bilateral pattern. We describe the case of a 71-year-old female who
		presented with multifocal bone pain six years following double lung
		transplantation. Her post transplantation course had been complicated by a life
		"threatening episode of sepsis secondary to Scedosporium apiospermum, a rare"
		invasive fungal infection following which lifelong prophylaxis with oral
		Voriconazole was commenced. We discuss the characteristic clinical and imaging
		manifestations of this rare condition.

TI	-	Suppurative Arthritis Induced by Scedosporium apiospermum and Mycobacterium
		fortuitum: a Case Report.
LID	-	10.7754/Clin.Lab.2020.200945 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Suppurative arthritis induced by Scedosporium apiospermum (S.
		"apiospermum) or Mycobacterium fortuitum (MF) was rare, and even more so when"
		"caused by a mixed infection of the two. In this paper, we report the rare case of"
		suppurative arthritis induced by S. apiospermum and MF. METHODS: A 46-year-old
		patient whose left knee was accidentally injured by a rotary tiller. His left
		knee joint was clearly swollen although debridement and suturing had been
		performed twice at a local hospital. Bacterial culture result was MF and S.
		apiospermum after admission. Definitive therapy (debridement combined with
		treatment using three antibiotics) was initiated. RESULTS: Although the fungus
		"reappeared when he tried to discontinue the drug, after the third debridement"
		"combined with treatment using three antibiotics for 8 months, the infection was"
		controlled and did not recur. CONCLUSIONS: This demonstrates that early
		bacteriological examination is essential. Treatment of fungus generally requires
		"a long course. However, course of medication should be related to the patient's"
		specific conditions and the implementation of the operation.

LID	-	10.1111/tid.12792 [doi]
AB	-	Scedosporium species are fungal pathogens increasingly recognized in cystic
		"fibrosis (CF). They can cause multiresistant, life-threatening infections that"
		"are of particular concern in CF patients undergoing lung transplantation, as"
		"optimal treatment remains unclear. Here, we describe our Zurich experience of CF"

AB	-	Non-Aspergillus invasive mould infections (IMIs) are associated with devastating
		morbidity and mortality rates and are increasingly diagnosed in immunocompromised
		hosts. The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology and outcomes of
		"non-Aspergillus IMIs at a university hospital in San Diego, California, USA. A"
		retrospective chart review of the medical records of all patients with cultures
		growing non-Aspergillus moulds at the microbiology laboratory in the Center for
		"Academic Laboratory Medicine, Department of Pathology, University of California,"
		San Diego (UCSD) Health between mid-2014 and mid-2017 (3-year period) was
		"performed. A total of 23 cases of non-Aspergillus IMI were identified, including"
		"10 cases of mucormycosis, 8 cases of lomentosporiosis and 5 cases of fusariosis."
		"Antifungal susceptibility testing was performed for 14 isolates, and 10/11"
		Fusarium and Lomentospora isolates had minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs)
		of >16 µg/mL for voriconazole and/or posaconazole. Overall 180-day mortality was
		significantly lower among those who received combination antifungal therapy than
		among those who received single-agent therapy [3/13 (23%) vs. 9/10 (90%);
		"P = 0.003]. In conclusion, Lomentospora prolificans (35% of non-Aspergillus IMIs)"
		and Fusarium spp. (22%) accounted for high proportions of non-Aspergillus IMIs
		during the study period. Non-Aspergillus IMIs were detected in patients with
		"various underlying diseases and were associated with high mortality rates, which"
		was significantly lower in those who received antifungal combination therapy.

		triamcinolone acetonide injection: a case report and literature review.
PG	-	40

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Ubiquitous fungi of the Scedosporium apiospermum species complex
		(SASC) cause various opportunistic infections. Posterior subtenon triamcinolone
		acetonide (STTA) injection is a standard therapy for intraocular inflammation and
		macular edema. We report a case of Scedosporium apiospermum infectious scleritis
		after a posterior STTA injection. CASE PRESENTATION: A 75-year-old man received a
		"posterior STTA injection to treat macular edema in his left eye. After 3 months,"
		he complained of ocular pain and hyperemia in his left eye. Examination showed a
		subtenon abscess in the site corresponding with the STTA injection. After
		"incising the abscess, the smear revealed numerous conidia-like structures."
		Although we suspected fungal infection and started topical voriconazole (VRCZ)
		"and levofloxacin, the inflammation of the eye worsened. Fungal culture revealed"
		"filamentous fungus growth. Subsequently, we added systemic VRCZ and performed"
		surgical debridement of the infected sclera and Tenon's capsule. Pathology of the
		sclera showed fungal hyphae. The antifungal susceptibility test revealed low
		"minimum inhibitory concentrations for micafungin, VRCZ and miconazole (0.06, 0.25"
		"and 0.5 μg/mL, respectively). After 2 months, the ciliary injection subsided and"
		"VRCZ therapy was stopped. However, subtenon abscess recurred 1 month after"
		discontinuation of topical VRCZ. Surgical debridement and topical VRCZ were
		"resumed, with the eye finally improving after 5 months of management. The fungal"
		species was identified as Scedosporium apiospermum sensu stricto morphologically
		and by DNA sequencing. CONCLUSIONS: This case was successfully treated by topical
		and systemic VRCZ and repeated surgical debridement. Infectious scleritis caused
		by SASC rarely develops after posterior STTA. SASC can produce conidia in the
		enclosed subtenon space. Late-onset infectious scleritis after a posterior STTA
		"injection suggests the presence of a fungal infection, including SASC, thereby"
		requiring extensive and prolonged medical and surgical treatment.

		transplantation.
PG	-	138-42
AB	-	This report concerns the first case of disseminated infection with Scedosporium
		prolificans (S. inflatum) that occurred in a patient who had received an organ
		transplant and was verified at autopsy. The patient underwent single (right)-lung
		transplantation and subsequently died on the 33rd postoperative day in a context
		"of septic shock. S. prolificans was isolated from various specimens, including"
		two cultured blood samples. The organism was associated with Candida albicans in
		some of these specimens. Autopsy revealed the presence of numerous nodular
		"abscesses in the lungs, myocardium, kidneys, spleen, and gall bladder. These"
		abscesses contained mycelial filaments and numerous oval conidia suggestive of
		Scedosporium species but no yeasts. MIC studies demonstrated the resistance of
		"the S. prolificans isolate to amphotericin B, fluctyosine, miconazole,"
		"ketoconazole, and itraconazole, whereas the isolate of C. albicans was"
		"susceptible to amphotericin B, flucytosine, miconazole, and ketoconazole. From"
		the data from our case and six published reports of cases of disseminated S.
		"prolificans infection, it can be concluded that this filamentous fungus is a new"
		agent responsible for the most serious mycoses in both neutropenic patients and
		patients who have undergone organ transplantation.

		"resistant to most antimycotics, Scedosporium apiospermum is usually sensitive to"
		voriconazole and posaconazole. Pharmacokinetics and efficacy of nebulized
		voriconazole have been described in a murine model previously. We report for the
		first time the safe and effective use of nebulized voriconazole for the treatment
		of severe pulmonary infection with Scedosporium apiospermum in an adolescent with
		cystic fibrosis.

AB	-	Infections caused by opportunistic fungal organisms such as Scedosporium spp.
		have been increasingly recognized over the last few decades. Most affected
		"patients are immunocompromised or critically ill, but Scedosporium spp."
		"infections have also been described in immunocompetent patients, such as"
		localized disease from direct inoculation or in near-drowning events. We describe
		a case of a patient with no known underlying immune impairment who experienced
		significant infection with Scedosporium apiospermum at both sites of breast
		"augmentation. Once identified, the choice of therapeutics can be challenging"
		given the intrinsic resistance and variable activity of different antifungal
		"agents; however, other factors also impact the outcome of this infection such as"
		"the host immune status. Thus, both the recognition and treatment of Scedosporium"
		infections can be challenging.

AB	-	Lomentospora prolificans is an emerging pathogen that is difficult to treat due
		to its intrinsic resistance to currently available antifungal agents. Current
		evidence demonstrates synergy between Azoles and Terbinafine against L.
		"prolificans infections, while adjunct use of antifungal agent-loaded bone cement"
		has also shown favourable outcomes. We report a case of an immunosuppressed adult
		with rheumatoid arthritis who developed L. prolificans osteomyelitis in his right
		wrist following trauma and subsequent exposure to commercially available
		fertiliser. The infection was successfully eradicated via a combination of
		"aggressive, staged surgical source control, antifungal therapy using voriconazole"
		"and Terbinafine, and insertion of voriconazole-loaded bone cement into the wrist"
		and carpus. The utility of this approach supports the synergistic effects of
		"voriconazole and Terbinafine and, more broadly, the clinical benefits of"
		"antifungal-loaded bone cement, as demonstrated in previous case reports and in"
		"vitro studies. As such, combination antifungal therapy and voriconazole-loaded"
		bone cement should be considered the therapy of choice in cases of osteomyelitis
		where L. prolificans is proven to be the causative organism.

TI	-	Scedosporium apiospermum infection after near-drowning.
PG	-	412-21
AB	-	Scedosporium apiospermum and its teleomorph (sexual form) Pseudallescheria boydii
		"are ubiquitous saprophytic fungi, which under specific conditions, such as"
		"near-drowning, may cause therapy-refractory and life-threatening infections. We"
		reviewed 22 cases (eight children and 14 adults) of S. apiospermum infection
		after near-drowning reported in the literature including an additional paediatric
		case from our institution. Scedosporiosis after near-drowning was associated with
		"high mortality (16/23, 70%) even in immunocompetent hosts. It affected mainly"
		young (mean age 24 years) and immunocompetent (83% with no apparent immune
		defect) males (male to female ratio 2.5 : 1). Scedosporiosis after near-drowning
		was a slow progressive disease (mean survival time 87 days) involving virtually
		"all body organs. However, central nervous system (CNS) dissemination predominated"
		"(21/23, 91%) presenting mainly as multiple brain abscesses (15/23, 65%). All 23"
		patients showed preceding clinical and/or radiological evidence of lung disease
		indicating the mode of invasion. Diagnosis was delayed (median time to diagnosis
		"28 days) and was made by culture (16/23, 69.5%) or culture and tissue examination"
		"(7/23, 30.5%). The majority of the patients (20/23, 87%) received antifungal"
		treatment and underwent neurosurgery. While the optimal treatment remains
		"undefined, the most recent reports indicated voriconazole as a potentially"
		effective option. Better knowledge of scedosporiosis after near-drowning could
		lead to improved intervention and ultimately to more favourable outcome.

		"and its clinical implications are poorly understood. Clinical, lung function and"
		laboratory data of adult CF patients in Sydney (April 2008-March 2009) were
		prospectively analysed for such risk factors. Expectorated sputa were cultured
		for bacteria and examined for fungi using standard mycological and

		"Scedosporium prolificans, Scedosporium aurantiacum and Pseudallescheria boydii/"
		Scedosporium apiospermum complex [non-S. aurantiacum]) were recovered from 12 of
		69 (17.4%) patients. Samples of 11 of the patients yielded isolates on
		Scedosporium- selective media (vs. 6 [8.7%] by non-selective culture) and one
		"additional patient was noted by PCR. Of these patients, 83.3% were co-colonized"
		"with other moulds, most frequently Aspergillus fumigatus. Colonization was not"
		"associated with best FEV₁/predicted, corticosteroid or antifungal therapies. By"
		"univariate analysis, patients with Scedosporium colonization were significantly"
		"less likely to be colonized with mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P = 0.025), while"
		prior therapy with antistaphylococcal penicillins was a risk factor for
		colonization (P = 0.045). Bacterial colonization and antimicrobial exposure
		"likely influence Scedosporium colonization, which is optimally detected with"
		selective media. Studies are required to confirm independent risk factors for
		Scedosporium colonization and to determine its impact on lung disease.

TI	-	Inhaled antibiotic use is associated with Scedosporium/Lomentospora species
		isolation in cystic fibrosis.
PG	-	133-140
LID	-	10.1002/ppul.24210 [doi]
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Prevalence of fungi has been rising in the cystic fibrosis (CF)
		population. Scedosporium species (spp) is the second most common mold seen in the
		"CF respiratory tract. However, the characteristics associated with Scedosporium"
		isolation and its clinical implications are poorly understood. The goal of this
		study was to determine clinical factors associated with Scedosporium spp to
		better understand the mechanisms that may contribute to the emergence of
		filamentous fungi in CF. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of
		"subjects followed in the CF Foundation Patient Registry between January 1, 2010"
		"and December 31, 2012. Patients under 6 years of age, history of solid organ"
		"transplantation, and insufficient respiratory culture data were excluded. We used"
		a multivariable logistic regression model to determine demographic data and
		"baseline disease characteristics, medications and co-infections associated with"
		"Scedosporium spp recovery in CF sputum. RESULTS: Among 19 023 subjects,"
		"prevalence of Scedosporium spp was 615 (3.2%). Older age (odds ratio [OR] 1.16,"
		"95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07, 1.26) and white race (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.09,"
		2.63) were the demographic factors associated with Scedosporium spp isolation.
		Inhaled antibiotic use had a significant association with Scedosporium isolation
		"(OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.61, 2.52). For every additional course of intravenous"
		"antibiotics, the odds of Scedosporium isolation increased by 8% (OR 1.08, 95% CI"
		"1.03, 1.14). CONCLUSIONS: The association between inhaled antibiotics and"
		Scedosporium informs us that chronic inhaled antibiotics may be playing a role in
		Scedosporium isolation. Further investigation to better characterize this
		relationship is necessary.

TI	-	Scedosporium apiospermum chorioretinitis.
PG	-	540-2
AB	-	PURPOSE: A case of a 24-year-old immunocompetent woman who developed unilateral
		Scedosporium apiospermum chorioretinitis and diffuse cervical lymphadenitis 10
		years after facial steroid injection is described. METHODS: The patient was
		initially treated for the misdiagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis.
		"Contemporaneous to the enlargement of her lymph nodes, she experienced gradual"
		loss of vision in her left eye. She subsequently underwent lymph node biopsy.
		RESULTS: Histopathologic sections stained with Grocott's methenamine silver
		showed branched septate hyphae and cultures on Sabouraud's agar yielded
		Scedosporium apiospermum. The patient received oral itraconazole 200 mg twice
		daily. Lymphadenitis regressed within a year and chorioretinitis scarred within
		two years. CONCLUSION: Scedosporium apiospermum may cause isolated
		chorioretinitis in an immunocompetent individual years after local surgery or
		trauma and result in significant visual morbidity. Treatment may require
		prolonged use of systemic itraconazole.

PG	-	207-9
AB	-	BACKGROUND: The fungus Scedosporium prolificans was first described as a human
		"pathogen in 1984, and has been associated with metastatic endophthalmitis and one"
		previously reported case of sclerokeratitis. METHODS: We report a case of S.
		prolificans sclerokeratitis in the setting of late scleral necrosis complicating
		pterygium surgery with adjunctive beta-irradiation. RESULTS: A poor clinical
		"response to topical natamycin and amphotericin B, and systemic itraconazole and"
		"ketoconazole was encountered. Enucleation was required, with subsequent"
		microbiological cure. Pathological correlation is described. CONCLUSIONS: S.
		prolificans infections often respond poorly to medical therapy. Early surgical
		intervention is indicated in culture-proven scleritis due to Scedosporium
		prolificans.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune disease, in"
		"addition, gut microbiota plays an important role in the etiology of RA. However,"
		our understanding of alterations to the gut fungal microbiota in Chinese
		population with RA is still limited. METHODS: Serum samples were obtained from 62
		"patients with RA, and 39 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HCs). Fecal"
		samples were obtained from 42 RA patients and 39 HCs. Fecal fungal microbiota
		targeting internal transcribed spacer region 2 (ITS2) rRNA genes was investigated
		"using MiSeq sequencing, as well as their associations with some diagnostic"
		biomarkers for RA. RESULTS: Our results showed that the fungal diversity did not
		alter in RA patients but taxonomic composition of the fecal fungal microbiota
		did. The gut mycobiota of RA patients was characterized by decreased abundance of
		"Pholiota, Scedosporium, and Trichosporon. The linear discriminant analysis (LDA)"
		effect size analysis (LEfSe) analysis identified several RA-enriched fungal
		"genera, which were positively correlated with most RA biomarkers. Furthermore,"
		"since RA is an age- and gende-related disease, we classified RA patients into"
		subgroups with age and gender and analyzed the sequencing results. Our data
		demonstrated that Wallemia and Irpex were the most discriminatory against RA
		"patients over 60 years old, while Pseudeurotiaceae was the most discriminatory"
		against female RA patients. CONCLUSIONS: The case-control study presented here
		"confirmed the alterations of gut fungal microbiota in Chinese patients with RA,"
		and we speculated that the fungal dysbiosis may contribute to RA development.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Tetanus has rarely been reported in Thailand since 1982 due to 100%
		"tetanus vaccination coverage during the neonatal period of life. However, the"
		"reemergence of tetanus has been observed in our country during the past decade,"
		mainly due to the increasing number of migrants traveling from neighboring
		countries in search of work. Acupuncture has become an essential part of
		"alternative and complementary medicine. To our knowledge, acupuncture-associated"
		Mycobacterium abscessus and Scedosporium infections superimposed by tetanus have
		never been reported. Case Presentation. A 55-year-old Thai female with
		"schizophrenia was hospitalized due to a 4-day course of trismus, dysphagia, and"
		"back muscle spasms. Upon admission, a clinical diagnosis of tetanus was made,"
		"which included muscle rigidity and reflex muscle spasms, despite a recent history"
		of diphtheria-tetanus (dT) vaccination for tetanus prophylaxis after 2 episodes
		of falling complicated by two lacerations on the left shoulder and head.
		"Endotracheal intubation for airway protection was given, in addition to tetanus"
		"immunoglobulin, metronidazole, and diazepam which were prescribed to the patient."
		"Incision and drainage of the wound on the left shoulder yielded 40 mL of pus,"
		"which subsequently grew Clostridium species, Mycobacterium massiliense, and"
		"Scedosporium on anaerobic bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal cultures,"
		respectively. An incision of an acupuncture wound on the abdominal wall yielded
		"1 mL of pus, which exhibited positive acid-fast bacilli (AFB) on AFB stain."
		Mycobacterial culture finally grew M. massiliense. The organism was susceptible
		"to amikacin and clarithromycin. Amikacin, clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin, and"
		voriconazole were then added. The patient gradually improved and was discharged
		"after one month of hospitalization. The patient was reported to be doing well,"
		"with no neurological sequelae, when last seen one month after discharge."
		"CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first case of acupuncture-associated"
		"M. massiliense and Scedosporium infections superimposed by tetanus. In Thailand,"
		the occurrence of acupuncture by nonqualified individuals and the reemergence of
		"tetanus remain prevalent. Hence, it is not uncommon to see tetanus in association"
		with acupuncture-related nontuberculous mycobacterial/fungal infection.

PG	-	e16891

LID	-	e16891
AB	-	Invasive fungal infections are being increasingly identified recently.
		Scedosporium is a significant cause of non-Aspergillus mold infection. It can
		cause disseminated disease in an immunocompromised host and localized pulmonary
		"infection in immunocompetent ones, especially in those with preformed lung"
		cavities. We present a case of scedosporiosis in an elderly female with
		bronchiectasis who presented with refractory pulmonary symptoms and infiltrates.
		The case emphasizes the need to keep the fungal infection in the differential
		diagnosis of refractory infiltrates in immunocompetent individuals without
		preformed cavities if they have bronchiectasis. Voriconazole monotherapy can be
		used as the first-line in proven cases of scedosporiosis.

AB	-	Scedosporium aurantiacum is one of the emergent opportunistic fungal pathogens
		among immunocompromised hosts. Colonization of S. aurantiacum can also occur in
		patients with underlying lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis. S. aurantiacum is
		"highly resistant to multiple antifungal agents, and management of the infected"
		patients can be very challenging compared to those infected with other species of
		Scedosporium. Clinical cases have been geographically restricted mostly in
		Australia with a small number of cases identified in Europe and Japan. Although
		clinical isolates of S. aurantiacum from the USA have been included in several
		"research studies, no clinical case of S. aurantiacum infection from the USA has"
		been described. We report a case of S. aurantiacum infection acquired in the SA.
		Awareness of S. aurantiacum among healthcare providers and the species-level
		identification for Scedosporium are critically important for appropriate
		selection of antifungal agents and improvement of treatment outcomes.

AB	-	We report a case of subcutaneous Pseudallescheria boydii/Scedosporium apiospermum
		complex infection occurring in a 77-year-old Japanese female farmer suffering
		"from interstitial pneumonia. Seven months prior to the current presentation, she"
		"noticed nodes on her right forearm after pulling up weeds, and the nodes grew"
		"larger. Two soft dome-shaped, protruded nodes ( 15 mm and 30 mm in size ) had"
		"fused together on the extensor surface of the right forearm. Yellowish-white,"
		rice-grain-sized pustules clustered on the surface. Histopathological examination
		of the skin specimen showed large and small abscesses surrounded by epithelioid
		granuloma; separate branching hyphae within the granulation tissue were stained
		"with PAS. No grains were observed. Fungal culture yielded fast-growing,"
		"grayish-white, fluffy colonies which were identified as Scedosporium apiospermum"
		(Clade 4) using sequence analysis of the β-tubulin gene. We also reviewed 28
		previously reported Japanese cases of P. boydii or S. apiospermum infection
		presenting with skin manifestations.

		"Lomentospora prolificans (which was previously named Scedosporium prolificans),"
		after an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). To our
		"knowledge, no cases of Lomentospora meningitis following allo-HSCT have been"

		mycobacteria.
PG	-	e00691
LID	-	10.1002/rcr2.691 [doi]
LID	-	e00691
AB	-	Although tuberculosis is a major underlying cause of pulmonary mycetoma due to
		"Scedosporium apiospermum, little is known about coinfection with nontuberculous"
		mycobacteria (NTM) and S. apiospermum. A 67-year-old man with NTM presented with
		recurrent haemoptysis. Computed tomography of the chest revealed pulmonary
		"mycetoma in the left upper lobe of the lung, and culture of bronchial washing"
		fluid yielded S. apiospermum. Oral voriconazole therapy ameliorated both
		"haemoptysis and mycetoma findings. As far as we are aware, this is the first"
		reported case of S. apiospermum lung disease in a patient with NTM but without
		tuberculosis. The possibility of S. apiospermum infection should thus be
		considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary mycetoma. Although S.
		"apiospermum mycetoma resembles aspergilloma, antifungal strategies for these two"
		"conditions differ, with the collection of culture specimens such as by"
		bronchoscopy being compulsory for accurate diagnosis and appropriate management
		of S. apiospermum infection.

AB	-	This is a case report of a 42-year-old woman who presented to a clinic with a
		history of progressive left foot and ankle swelling. She had a suspected history
		"of myectoma, but had never been officially diagnosed despite repeated cultures"
		and debridements over the course of decades. The inciting event occurred
		approximately 30 years prior in her home country of Belize. Her wound culture
		revealed Scedosporium apiospermum as the causative agent. Treatment included
		surgical debridement and oral antifungal therapy. This case represents an
		"interesting adjunct to the differential diagnosis for military physicians, as"
		mycetomas are prevalent in many of the areas where our forces are deployed and
		may only present after the service member has left active service because of its
		naturally indolent course.

AB	-	Scedosporium apiospermum associated endocarditis is extremely rare. We report a
		case of a disseminated S. apiospermum infection with an invasive right atrial
		"mass in a 52-year-old male, 11 months after heart transplantation, referred to"
		our institution for an endogenous endophthalmitis with a one-month history of
		diffuse myalgias and fatigue. The patient had been supported two times with
		extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) during the first three postoperative
		months. The echocardiography on admission revealed a mass in the right atrium
		attached to a thickened lateral wall. The whole-body [(18)F]FDG PET/CT revealed
		"systemic dissemination in the lungs, muscles, and subcutaneous tissue. Blood"
		cultures were positive on day three for filamentous fungi later identified as S.
		apiospermum. The disease was refractory to a 3-week dual antifungal therapy with
		"voriconazole and anidulafungin in addition to reduced immunosuppression, and"
		palliative care was implemented.

		an acute pneumonia. The infection progressed despite the application of different
		antibiotics. Microscopic examination of tracheal fluid revealed fungal hyphae and
		"therefore treatment with itraconazole was initiated. However, the patient"
		"developed renal failure, required mechanical ventilation and finally died in"
		treatment-resistant septic shock. Post-mortem Scedosporium apiospermum was
		cultured from lung tissue taken during autopsy. This is the fourth case of human
		infection caused by Scedosporium species diagnosed in our laboratory during the
		last 4 years.

AB	-	PURPOSE: To determine the clinical profile and prognosis of Scedosporium
		keratitis. METHODS: All culture-proven cases were retrospectively analyzed for
		"demographics, clinical characteristics, treatment offered, and resolution time"
		with sequel. RESULTS: Among the 1792 culture-proven fungal keratitis cases in the
		"study period, 10 (0.6%) were the result of Scedosporium. The mean age of patients"
		was 44.2 years. Eight patients were male. A history of trauma was present in 8
		"patients. The infiltrate involved the center of the cornea in 5 patients, whereas"
		4 patients had paracentral involvement and 1 patient had limbal involvement. The
		mean maximum diameter of infiltrate was 3.4 mm. Five cases were prescribed
		topical natamycin alone: 4 patients were successfully treated with this
		"monotherapy, whereas 1 patient was lost to follow-up, but the records of the last"
		visit revealed healing. Three patients were treated with a combination therapy of
		topical natamycin and 1% voriconazole: 2 patients showed complete healing of the
		"ulcer, and 1 patient progressed to corneal perforation necessitating penetrating"
		"keratoplasty. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the largest case series on"
		Scedosporium keratitis to date. This is the first study to report successful
		treatment of this infection with topical natamycin monotherapy. The outcome may
		improve if appropriate medical therapy is started early.

		literature.
PG	-	400-409
LID	-	10.1111/myc.12739 [doi]
AB	-	"Scedosporium apiospermum is a ubiquitous filamentous fungus, commonly found in"
		"soil, sewage and polluted waters. It is rarely pathogenic but can cause a broad"
		"spectrum of clinical diseases, which can be localised or disseminate to distant"
		organs. The disseminated form of the disease is mostly seen among
		"immunocompromised patients. However, some rare cases of disseminated disease have"
		been reported in immunocompetent individuals. Treatment of these infections is
		"challenging because of their natural resistance to many antifungal agents. Here,"
		we report the case of a 57-year-old immunocompetent patient diagnosed with
		"femoral pseudarthrosis due to S. apiospermum, despite having no obvious clinical"
		"sign of infection. Previously, the patient had undergone four iterative femoral"
		surgeries following a road traffic accident which occurred 20 years before.
		"During its last surgery for pseudarthrosis, no clinical or biological signs of"
		infection were present. Per operative samples tested positive for S. apiospermum.
		The patient was successfully treated with oral voriconazole during 6 months with
		an excellent tolerance. We also provide a review of literature on bone and joint
		"infections due to Scedosporium spp. (S. apiospermum, Scedosporium boydii and"
		"Scedosporium aurantiacum), discussing the evolution of their management and"
		outcome which seems to improve since the use of voriconazole.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Scedosporium species and Lomentospora prolificans (Sc/Lp) are
		emerging molds that cause invasive disease associated with a high mortality rate.
		"After Aspergillus, these molds are the second filamentous fungi recovered in lung"
		"transplant (LT) recipients. AIMS: Our objective was to evaluate the incidence,"
		risk factors and outcome of Sc/Lp infections in LT recipients at a tertiary care
		hospital with a national reference LT program. METHODS: A nine-year retrospective
		"study was conducted. RESULTS: During this period, 395 LT were performed. Positive"
		cultures for Sc/Lp were obtained from twenty-one LT recipients. Twelve patients
		(incidence 3.04%) developed invasive scedosporiosis (IS). In 66.7% of the
		patients with IS the invasive infection was defined as a breakthrough one. The
		main sites of infection were lungs and paranasal sinuses. Most of the patients
		received combination antifungal therapy. The IS crude mortality rate after 30
		"days was 16.7%, and 33.3% after a year. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights"
		improved survival rates associated with combination antifungal therapy in LT
		recipients and underlines the risk of breakthrough infections in patients with
		allograft dysfunction on nebulized lipidic amphotericin B prophylaxis. In
		"addition to pretransplant colonization, acute or chronic organ dysfunctions seem"
		to be the main risk factors for IS.

AB	-	This is the first report describing co-infection of Scedosporium apiospermum and
		Lichtheimia corymbifera caused by biogas inhalation in two people without
		underlying medical conditions. Two patients fell into the same pig manure pit at
		the same time while rescuing another patient (this person died in a few hours)
		and inhaled biogas. Both patients were diagnosed with pulmonary fungal disease
		and developed acute liver failure around Day 52. Their results were negative for
		"the 1,3-β-d-glucan test and weakly positive for the galactomannan test. They were"
		treated with amphotericin B and/or posaconazole without surgery. The patient in
		case 2 required amphotericin B deoxycholate aerosol inhalation to complete the
		treatment. Both patients recovered completely. For patients with mucormycosis
		"confined to the lungs who cannot tolerate intravenous drip amphotericin B,"
		increasing the dose of nebulised administration maybe a salvage regimen.

AB	-	We present a case of Scedosporium apiospermum otomycosis in an immunocompetent
		62-year-old woman presumably inoculated as a child in Vietnam. She had life-long
		recurrent symptoms of chronic otomastoiditis and otorrhea. The organism was
		identified in an unexpected wound infection after a modified radical
		mastoidectomy done for chronic otitis media. Treatment consisted of local
		"debridement of necrotic tissue, topical wound care, and long-term systemic"
		antifungals.

TI	-	Molecular Identification and Susceptibility Testing of Molds Isolated in a
		Prospective Surveillance of Triazole Resistance in Spain (FILPOP2 Study).
LID	-	10.1128/AAC.00358-18 [doi]
LID	-	e00358-18
AB	-	Antifungal resistance is increasing by the emergence of intrinsically resistant
		species and by the development of secondary resistance in susceptible species. A
		previous study performed in Spain revealed levels of azole resistance in molds of
		"between 10 and 12.7%, but secondary resistance in Aspergillus fumigatus was not"
		detected. We used itraconazole (ITZ)-supplemented medium to select resistant
		strains. A total of 500 plates supplemented with 2 mg/liter of ITZ were sent to
		"10 Spanish tertiary hospitals, and molecular identification and antifungal"
		"susceptibility testing were performed. In addition, the cyp51A gene in those A."
		fumigatus strains showing azole resistance was sequenced. A total of 493 isolates
		were included in the study. Sixteen strains were isolated from patients with an
		"infection classified as proven, 104 were isolated from patients with an infection"
		"classified as probable, and 373 were isolated from patients with an infection"
		"classified as colonization. Aspergillus was the most frequent genus isolated, at"
		"80.3%, followed by Scedosporium-Lomentospora (7.9%), Penicillium-Talaromyces"
		"(4.5%), Fusarium (2.6%), and the order Mucorales (1%). Antifungal resistance was"
		"detected in Scedosporium-Lomentospora species, Fusarium, Talaromyces, and"
		Mucorales Three strains of A. fumigatus sensu stricto were resistant to azoles;
		"two of them harbored the TR(34)+L98H mechanism of resistance, and the other one"
		had no mutations in cyp51A The level of azole resistance in A. fumigatus remains
		"low, but cryptic species represent over 10% of the isolates and have a broader"
		but overall higher range of antifungal resistance.

TI	-	Scedosporium apiospermum brain abscess treated with surgery and voriconazole.
		Case report.
PG	-	83-7
AB	-	Scedosporium apiospermum is a fungus found in the soil and in contaminated water.
		"Common cutaneous manifestations include Madura foot, a painless swelling on the"
		sole of the foot. Invasive infection is usually associated with
		immunosuppression. The authors present a 16-month-old immunocompetent boy who had
		"a near-drowning event. Following this, he was severely disabled with spastic"
		quadriparesis. Early computerized tomography scans revealed diffuse hypoxic
		injury. Magnetic resonance images obtained 3 months after the initial event
		demonstrated multiple ring-enhancing lesions in the brain. Aspiration of the
		"lesion was performed. Scedosporium apiospermum, the asexual form of"
		"Pseudallescheria boydii, was cultured. Conventional antifungal agents were"
		"commenced, with minimal effect. The child was subsequently treated with a new"
		"antifungal agent, voriconazole, a broad-spectrum triazole antifungal agent with"
		"good penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid. The patient improved, with a good"
		radiological outcome and a moderate clinical outcome. The authors review the use
		of voriconazole for central nervous system infections and review the literature
		on S. apiospermum associated with near drowning.

LID	-	e00928
AB	-	Scedosporium apiospermum is ubiquitous in the environment and is considered an
		emerging infection. Immunocompromised hosts can have a wide spectrum of diseases
		"ranging from cutaneous to disseminated disease that may involve pulmonary,"
		"central nervous system, or bone. Disseminated disease in immunocompetent hosts is"
		uncommon. Treatment of deep-seated infections is challenging because of the
		limited susceptibility of the Scedosporium species to all current antifungal
		drugs. We report a case of Scedosporidium apiospermum fungemia with a presumed
		pulmonary involvement in an immunocompetent patient. The fungemia was
		successfully treated with oral voriconazole and terbinafine.

AB	-	"Herein, we describe a fatal case of central nervous system (CNS)"
		"pseudallescheriasis following near-drowning. A 13-year-old boy, who had been"
		"successfully resuscitated after near-drowning, presented with a transient episode"
		of mental confusion during a hospital stay after recovering from severe
		aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
		scan of the brain showed a small brain abscess in the left basal ganglia and
		ventriculitis in the left lateral ventricle. The brain abscess and ventriculitis
		did not respond to 4 weeks of antibiotic treatment and appeared even worse on a
		follow-up MRI. A diagnosis of CNS pseudallescheriasis was only possible with
		invasive stereotactic biopsy and aspiration of the abscess that showed the
		presence of hyphae and Scedosporium apiospermum. CNS pseudallescheriasis did not
		"respond to multiple combinations of antifungal agents, including amphotericin B,"
		"isoconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole. Two ventricular drainages and"
		insertion of Ommaya reservoirs with intraventricular injection of voriconazole
		were insufficient to halt the infection. The patient passed away from sudden
		septic shock 2 months after identification of the brain abscess and
		ventriculitis. The patient's diagnosis was delayed because multiple examinations
		of the cerebrospinal fluid did not show positive cultures and could only be
		obtained from the aspirates of stereotactic biopsy. Physicians should be aware of
		CNS pseudallescheriasis associated with near-drowning because of the difficulty
		of diagnosis and the high mortality rate (70%) owing to poor responses to
		currently available antifungal agents.

		"dehoogii has been reported, but its contamination or colonization might not be"
		precluded due to the absence of pathogenic isolation and/or pathological
		examination. We report the first case to our knowledge of S. dehoogii-induced
		subcutaneous scedosporiosis in a psoriatic patient. A 58-year-old man with 5-year
		history of psoriasis vulgaris and immunosuppressant therapy developed pyrexia and
		multiple subcutaneous abscesses on both knees. Direct microscopy of the yellowish
		pus showed masses of bright green short spores. Skin biopsy revealed some
		branched septate hyphae within the granuloma. Two aspirated pus specimens
		collected at a 1-week interval produced white cottony colonies on Sabouraud
		dextrose agar. Bacterial cultures of one blood and two purulent samples were
		"negative, and fungal culture of blood sample was not performed. The isolate was"
		identified as S. dehoogii using β-tubulin phylogeny and species-specific PCR with
		"primer MSDE1/MSA2. Without addition of antifungal treatment, subcutaneous lesions"
		disappeared spontaneously after immunosuppressant withdrawal and no relapse
		occurred during 64-month follow-up. The spontaneous recovery may result from
		immune reconstitution following immunosuppressant discontinuation.

AB	-	Scedosporium genus as a significant emerging opportunist causes a broad spectrum
		of disease in not only immunosuppressed but also immunocompetent patients. The
		lung is one of the most commonly encountered sites of Scedosporium infection. Due
		"to its very high levels of antifungal resistance, surgery has been recommended as"
		"an important part in the treatment of pulmonary Scedosporium spp infection, even"
		"in immunocompetent cases. However, whether lung surgery could help to reduce the"
		risk of death in immunocompetent patients is not clear.We retrospectively
		retrieved the records of pulmonary infections with Scedosporium species in
		immunocompetent patients through a comprehensive literature search. The
		association of surgery on all-cause mortality was explored using binary logistic
		regression (BLR). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was
		carried out to evaluate the capability of the model.The comprehensive searching
		"strategy yielded 33 case reports and 3 case series in total, with 40 individual"
		patients being included. The overall mortality was 12.50%. The fatality rate was
		9.09% (2/22) in cases with surgery and 16.67% (3/18) in cases without surgery
		"(odds ratio, 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.07-3.38; P = .48). Consistently,"
		BLR analysis identified no statistical association between surgery and reduced
		"mortality (odds ratio, 1.19; 95% confidence interval, 0.09-15.64; P = .89), after"
		"adjusting for age, gender, and antifungal chemotherapy. The area under the ROC"
		curve was 0.88.For immunocompetent patients with pulmonary Scedosporium spp
		"infection, surgical therapy may not be associated with reduced mortality."
		Surgical excision could be considered but is not imperative in this group of
		patients.

AB	-	BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Postoperative fungal spondylodiscitis is a rare infectious
		disease. PURPOSE: We report the first case of postoperative spondylodiscitis
		because of Scedosporium prolificans and review postoperative vertebral infection
		caused by fungi. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Medline search. METHODS: Case report and
		literature review. RESULTS: On reviewing the cases of postoperative fungal
		"spondylodiscitis reported so far in the literature, we found eight were caused by"
		"mold, and five by yeast. Clinically, the disease presents similar to"
		"postoperative vertebral osteomyelitis caused by bacteria, and a high clinical"
		index of suspicion may be required to perform appropriate cultures to establish a
		diagnosis. Our review revealed a significant number of cases that were cured
		after surgical debridement and/or antifungal therapy. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis
		"of this limited assessment, it appears that the clinical course and prognosis of"
		postoperative fungal spondylodiscitis is similar to that reported for
		postoperative pyogenic spondylodiscitis.

		osteomyelitis in a tsunami survivor of the Great East Japan Earthquake. SUMMARY
		OF BACKGROUND DATA: Fungal vertebral osteomyelitis due to Scedosporium
		apiospermum (S. apiospermum) is extremely rare. We describe the case of a
		45-year-old male who developed vertebral osteomyelitis by S. apiospermum 1 month
		after near drowning in the huge tsunami after the Great East Japan Earthquake.
		METHODS: The patient was treated with a combination of percutaneous
		posterolateral endoscopic debridement and antifungal therapy. The case was
		"evaluated with radiography and computed tomography, and his white blood cell"
		count and C-reactive protein level in serum were measured 20 months after
		initiation of treatment. RESULTS: The patient had no low back pain and both white
		blood cell count and C-reactive protein had remained normal. Radiographs and
		computed tomography of lumbar spine demonstrated sclerotic change of endplates
		and spur formation bridging the L3 and L4 vertebral bodies. CONCLUSION: We report
		a rare case of the fungal vertebral osteomyelitis caused by S. apiospermum. If a
		patient develops severe back pain after a near-drowning episode in dirty water
		"such as a swamp or a river, the clinician should be suspicious of the possibility"
		of fungal spondylitis by S. apiospermum.

PG	-	1321-4

AB	-	Scedosporium prolificans is an emerging agent for severe infections. Although
		among the dematiaceous fungi Scedosporium is the most frequently isolated in
		"blood cultures, Scedosporium endocarditis is rarely reported. We show herein a"
		patient with acute leukaemia who developed S. prolificans endocarditis. Twelve
		cases were found in an extensive review of the English literature. In six cases
		"(46%), there was predisposing heart conditions such as a prosthetic valve or an"
		intracavitary device. Only 4 patients (31%) were immunocompromised hosts with
		"haematologic neoplasia, solid-organ transplantation or acquired immunodeficiency"
		syndrome (AIDS). Exposure to Scedosporium was observed in immunocompetent
		patients who developed infection while in the community. Scedosporium
		endocarditis occurred on both sides of the heart. Systemic and pulmonary emboli
		and other metastatic complications were seen in all of these patients. The
		"overall mortality was 77% and, specifically, all of the immunocompromised hosts"
		and 6 out of 7 patients with mitral or aortic valve endocarditis died. Patients
		with right-sided endocarditis associated with a removable intracardiac device
		"exhibited a better prognosis. Scedosporium endocarditis, although still rare, is"
		"an emerging infection with an ominous prognosis. At the present time, valve"
		replacement or the removal of cardiac devices plus combined antifungal treatment
		may offer the best possibility of cure.

TI	-	Disseminated lomentosporiosis in a heart transplant recipient: Case report and
		review of the literature.
PG	-	e13574
LID	-	10.1111/tid.13574 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Lomentospora prolificans (formerly S prolificans) is a saprophyte
		fungi that causes opportunistic infections in solid organ transplant (SOT)
		recipients. Resulting disseminated infections are difficult to treat and have a
		high mortality. Indications for antifungal prophylaxis after heart
		"transplantation (HT) include CMV disease, reoperation, renal replacement therapy,"
		"extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and high environmental exposure to"
		"Aspergillus spores. However, the risk of breakthrough infections, such as"
		"Lomentosporiosis, remains a cause of concern. METHODS: We report the clinical"
		"findings, microbiology, treatment and outcome of a disseminated Lomentosporiosis"
		in a heart transplant recipient with ECMO and antifungal prophylaxis. RESULTS: A
		25-year-old male with complex grown-up congenital heart disease (GUCHD) was
		admitted for HT. He presented severe post-surgical complications including acute
		kidney injury and right heart and respiratory failure requiring
		"venoarterial-ECMO, continuous renal replacement therapy (CCRT) and later on (+14)"
		"a ventricular assist device (VAD). Ganciclovir, cotrimoxazole, and antifungal"
		prophylaxis with anidulafungin at standard doses had been started on day + 3 post
		"HT. The patient presented seizures (+4), pancytopenia with mild neutropenia"
		"(days + 6 to + 11), influenza B (+7), and bacteremic Pseudomonas aeruginosa"
		ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) (+10). On days + 14 to + 16 Lomentospora
		"prolificans was recovered from blood cultures, broncho aspirate, catheter tip,"
		"and skin biopsy. Despite treatment with L-AMB, voriconazole and terbinafine the"
		patients died on day 17 after HT. Necropsy revealed disseminated infection with
		"fungal invasion in central nervous system, heart, lung, cutaneous, and"
		subcutaneous tissue. Broth microdilution tests demonstrated resistance to all
		antifungals. CONCLUSIONS: Lomentosporiosis is a rare complication that may emerge
		as a breakthrough invasive fungal infection in heart transplant recipients on
		ECMO despite antifungal prophylaxis.

TI	-	Scedosporium cerebral abscesses after extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation.
PG	-	671-6
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Scedosporial infections are usually encountered in the
		"immunocompromised patients. However, they are now emerging in the immunocompetent"
		population and have an affinity for the central nervous system. They represent a
		"therapeutic challenge, since they are highly resistant to most antifungal"
		medications. METHODS: We report the case of an immunocompetent patient with
		multiple cerebral abscesses secondary to Scedosporium apiospermum following
		extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and review the literature about this
		challenging cerebral infection. RESULTS: A previously healthy 33-year-old male
		admitted to the hospital for a community-acquired pneumonia requiring ECMO
		subsequently developed multiple cerebral abscesses. He was empirically treated
		"with caspofungin, which was changed to voriconazole once surgical aspiration"
		"revealed Scedosporium apiospermum. Despite multiple aspirations, decompressive"
		"craniectomy to alleviate intracranial pressure, and an appropriate antifungal"
		"agent, the patient did not survive this aggressive infection. CONCLUSION: Brain"
		abscesses with Scedosporium apiospermum present a therapeutic challenge. High
		clinical suspicion leading to early appropriate antifungal therapy and combined
		surgical interventions might improve the prognosis.

		"culture results challenging. In order to develop effective management strategies,"
		a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the airways fungal microbiome
		is required. The study aimed to use DNA sequences from sputum to assess the load
		and diversity of fungi in adults with CF and non-CF bronchiectasis. METHODS: Next
		generation sequencing of the ITS2 region was used to examine fungal community
		composition (n = 176) by disease and underlying clinical subgroups including
		"allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, chronic necrotizing pulmonary"
		"aspergillosis, non-tuberculous mycobacteria, and fungal bronchitis. Patients with"
		no known active fungal disease were included as disease controls. RESULTS: ITS2
		sequencing greatly increased the detection of fungi from sputum. In patients with
		"CF fungal diversity was lower, while burden was higher than those with non-CF"
		bronchiectasis. The most common operational taxonomic unit (OTU) in patients with
		"CF was Candida parapsilosis (20.4%), whereas in non-CF bronchiectasis sputum"
		Candida albicans (21.8%) was most common. CF patients with overt fungal
		"bronchitis were dominated by Aspergillus spp., Exophiala spp., Candida"
		parapsilosis or Scedosporium spp. CONCLUSION: This study provides a framework to
		more accurately characterize the extended spectrum of fungal airways diseases in
		adult suppurative lung diseases.

		"recipients. To investigate the epidemiology of infections with Mucorales,"
		"Fusarium spp., and Scedosporium spp. molds, we analyzed data from the"

		conducted prospective surveillance for invasive fungal infections during
		"2001-2006. We identified 169 infections (105 Mucorales, 37 Fusarium spp., and 27"
		"Scedosporium spp.) in 169 patients; 124 (73.4%) were in HCT recipients, and 45"
		(26.6%) were in SOT recipients. The crude 90-day mortality rate was 56.6%. The
		12-month mucormycosis cumulative incidence was 0.29% for HCT and 0.07% for SOT.
		"Mucormycosis incidence among HCT recipients varied widely, from 0.08% to 0.69%,"
		with higher incidence in cohorts receiving transplants during 2003 and 2004.
		Non-Aspergillus mold infections continue to be associated with high mortality
		rates. The incidence of mucormycosis in HCT recipients increased substantially
		during the surveillance period.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Fungal origin mycotic aneurysms are rare and carry a high mortality
		rate. Scedosporium apiospermum is an ubiquitous fungus which has been described
		to cause devastating infections in immunocompromised hosts. CASE DESCRIPTION: We
		report a case of a 23-year-old patient with Burkitt's lymphoma and
		graft-versus-host disease admitted with intracerebral hemorrhage and sequential
		development of 12 anterior circulation aneurysms from disseminated Scedosporium
		"infection. Despite aggressive surgical and antimicrobial treatment, the patient"
		died 6 months later from multiorgan failure. The notable feature of this case is
		the rapid angioinvasiveness of the infection with new aneurysm formation within
		days of clear angiographic imaging despite the apparent lack of skull base
		osteomyelitis. CONCLUSION: We highlight the difficulties in treating fungal
		mycotic aneurysms and the associated high mortality. While a less aggressive
		"approach might have been appropriate given the known poor outcomes, the age of"
		the patients as well as the family wishes dictated the treatment decisions.

AB	-	The aim of our retrospective study is to report a case series of ocular

		population. Thirteen cases of culture-positive S. apiospermum infections
		diagnosed between January 2011 and March 2016 were included in this study. The
		"parameters evaluated were predisposing factors, treatment and final clinical"
		outcome. The most common mode of presentation was keratitis (84.6%) followed by
		sclerokeratitis (15.3%). The predisposing factors involved were unspecified
		"foreign body injury (30.7%), organic matter injury (15.3%), uncontrolled diabetes"
		"(7.6%), and recent manual small-incision cataract surgery (7.6%). Five cases"
		"(38.46%) had no predisposing factor. Of the 11 keratitis cases, nine (69.2%)"
		responded well to combination medical therapy while one case (7.6%) required
		therapeutic keratoplasty. One case was lost to follow-up. Both cases which
		presented with sclerokeratitis showed no response to medico-surgical treatment
		progressing to panophthalmitis and evisceration.

TI	-	Fungal keratitis caused by Scedosporium apiospermum: report of two cases and
		review of treatment.
PG	-	519-23
AB	-	PURPOSE: We report our experience in treating two cases of Scedosporium
		apiospermum keratitis and provide a review of basic scientific and clinical data
		regarding the treatment of this visually devastating disease. METHOD: We present
		a case report and literature review. RESULTS: A 35-year-old woman and a
		"73-year-old man both reported pain, redness, and a foreign body sensation in the"
		eye after trauma. They were initially treated with antibacterials. When cultures
		"were positive for S. apiospermum, the first patient was treated with fluconazole"
		and amphotericin with good results. The second was treated with fluconazole and
		"natamycin, but the infection persisted and the eye was eventually enucleated."
		Review of the literature showed variable responsiveness of S. apiospermum to
		antifungal treatment. CONCLUSIONS: It is difficult to predict how S. apiospermum
		"keratitis will respond to treatment, but miconazole appears to be useful in"
		conjunction with other antifungals. Voriconazole shows promise as an effective
		alternative.

TI	-	Non-Exenteration Management of Sino-Orbital Fungal Disease.
PG	-	426-429
LID	-	10.1097/IOP.0000000000000812 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: To describe the non-exenteration management of sino-orbital fungal
		"infection, a life-threatening condition for which orbital exenteration is"
		generally considered a first-line treatment. METHODS: A retrospective case series
		is presented of 7 orbits in 6 consecutive patients admitted and treated at 2
		"major metropolitan tertiary teaching hospitals in Sydney, New South Wales,"
		Australia. RESULTS: Seven orbits in 6 consecutive patients with sino-orbital
		fungal infection were treated conservatively with surgical debridement and
		intravenous antifungal agents. Four patients were immunosuppressed and the other
		"2 patients were otherwise healthy. All presented with pain, proptosis, or loss of"
		"vision. Causative organisms found were Mucormycoses, Aspergillus, and"
		Scedosporium prolificans. Exenteration was avoided in all patients as part of
		"their planned management and 5 patients, including 1 with bilateral disease,"
		survived their disease without exenteration. Medical treatment included
		intravenous liposomal amphotericin B or voriconazole. A single immunosuppressed
		"patient deteriorated and as a last resort, exenteration was performed, but this"
		made no difference to his clinical course and in retrospect could have been
		avoided as he died of multiple cerebral metastases diagnosed shortly after his
		deterioration. CONCLUSION: The authors recommend that patients with sino-orbital
		"fungal disease preferably be treated conservatively, without orbital"
		exenteration.

PG	-	274-6
LID	-	10.1111/j.1610-0387.2010.07563.x [doi]
AB	-	Voriconazole is a second-generation triazole antifungal approved for the
		"treatment of invasive fungal infections, particularly with Aspergillus, Candida,"
		"Fusarium, and Scedosporium spp. Frequently reported adverse effects of"
		"voriconazole include visual disturbance (21 %), elevated liver enzymes (15.6 %)"
		"and rashes (7 %), which are largely attributable to drug-induced"
		photosensitivity. We report a case of serious phototoxicity in a 8 year old boy
		who underwent chemotherapy for AML. He received voriconazole for the treatment
		and subsequent re-infection prophylaxis after pulmonary aspergillosis. One year
		after the start of therapy he developed blistering eruptions on his face after
		minimal sunlight exposure. Recent reports about the development of squamous cell
		"carcinoma and melanoma, respectively, in children during and after oral therapy"
		with voriconazole seem to warrant systematic follow-up investigations of all
		voriconazole-treated patients.

TI	-	Disseminated Scedosporium apiospermum infection in a Maremmano-Abruzzese
		sheepdog.
PG	-	372

LID	-	372
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Few cases of scedosporiosis have been reported in animals, but the"
		true prevalence is probably underestimated due to a lack of awareness.
		"Scedosporiosis in dogs has often been associated with localized infection (i.e.,"
		"nasal infection, eumycetoma, or keratomycosis) or, in rare cases, disseminated"
		infections. CASE PRESENTATION: This case report describes the clinical and
		pathological features and the diagnostic process of a rare systemic and fatal
		fungal infection in a dog caused by Scedosporium apiospermum. A 10-month-old
		"female Maremmano-Abruzzese sheepdog showing weakness, lethargy, lateral"
		"decubitus, miosis and muscular rigidity was presented. Rodenticide poisoning was"
		"clinically suspected for the differential diagnosis. However, postmortem"
		examinations revealed the presence of a swollen and soft subcutaneous nodule
		"located near the right inguinal breast, which was associated with massive"
		"enlargement of the inguinal lymph nodes and small disseminated, cream-colored"
		nodules in the kidneys and mesentery. Multiple fungal pyogranulomas were observed
		"upon histological examination. Fungal isolation from the kidneys, breast and"
		inguinal lymph nodes was performed. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS)
		sequences from the fungal colony DNA were searched in BLAST in the NCBI GenBank
		for species identification. The sequences of the fungi isolated from the kidney
		and breast cultures showed 100% sequence identity with sequences from
		Scedosporium apiospermum. CONCLUSIONS: This report shows that Scedosporium
		apiospermum may act as a primary pathogen in young and apparently healthy dogs
		and represents an important pathogen that should be considered during the
		"diagnostic process, particularly when a fungal infection is suspected."

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: Lomentospora prolificans is an emerging cause of serious invasive
		"fungal infections. Optimal treatment of these infections is unknown, although"
		voriconazole-containing treatment regimens are considered the treatment of
		choice. The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of combination
		antifungal therapy for L. prolificans infections. METHODS: We performed a
		retrospective review of medical records of patients with invasive L. prolificans
		infection diagnosed between 1 January 2008 and 9 September 2019 that were
		documented in the FungiScope® registry of rare invasive fungal infections. We
		compared clinical outcomes between antifungal treatment strategies. RESULTS: Over
		"the study period, 41 individuals with invasive L. prolificans infection from"
		"eight different countries were documented in the FungiScope® registry. Overall,"
		17/40 (43%) had treatment response/stable disease and 21/40 (53%) had a fatal
		outcome attributed to invasive fungal infection. Combination antifungal therapy
		was associated with increased 28-day survival (15/24 survived versus 4/16
		receiving monotherapy; p 0.027) and the combination voriconazole plus terbinafine
		"trended to be associated with higher rates of treatment success (10/16, 63%, 95%"
		"CI 35%-85%) compared with other antifungal treatment regimens (7/24, 29%, 95% CI"
		"13%-51%, p 0.053). In Kaplan-Meier survival analysis there was a higher survival"
		probability in individuals receiving the voriconazole/terbinafine combination
		compared with other antifungal regimens (median survival 150 days versus
		"17 days). CONCLUSIONS: While overall mortality was high, combination antifungal"
		"treatment, and in particular combination therapy with voriconazole plus"
		terbinafine may be associated with improved treatment outcomes compared with
		other antifungal regimens for the treatment of invasive L. prolificans
		infections.

		"formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens obtained from patients with"
		histologically proven fungal infection.
PG	-	851-859
LID	-	10.1111/myc.13325 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Although fungi are found relatively easily by microscopic examination
		"of pathological samples, identification of fungal genus and species in"
		pathological samples is not easy because the morphological features of fungi are
		similar among genera and species. OBJECTIVES: A multiple real-time PCR was
		"developed for identification of fungal genus/species, and morphological"
		characterizations of fungi were analysed in pathological samples.
		PATIENTS/METHODS: Seventy-five formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples
		morphologically proven to contain any fungus were examined. A multiple real-time
		PCR system was developed to identify 25 fungal genus/species in pathological
		samples. Morphology of fungus in the specimens was re-reviewed retrospectively
		based on the results of real-time PCR. RESULTS: Real-time PCR identified fungal
		genus/species in 56 of 75 (74.6%) specimens with histologically proven fungal
		"infection. In 53 specimens of filamentous fungi, Aspergillus spp. (22 specimens),"
		"Cladosporium (8), Scedosporium apiospermum (4), Malassezia sympodialis (1) and"
		Candida albicans (1) were identified. Pseudohyphae of Candida were confused with
		filamentous fungus in a case. Morphological observation suggested differences in
		"the presence of septated or non-septated hyphae, the filament size, and the"
		"branch angle among genus/species of filamentous fungi; however, genus/species was"
		not able to be determined by their morphological features. In 22 specimens of
		"yeasts, real-time PCR allowed for the identification of Candida albicans (12"
		"specimens), Candida glabrata (2), Cladosporium (2), Scedosporium apiospermum (2),"
		Pichia kudriavzevii (1) and Aspergillus sydowii (1). CONCLUSIONS: These data
		suggest that it is difficult to identify fungal genus/species by morphological
		features alone. Real-time PCR is useful to identify fungal genus/species in
		pathological samples.

		HIV disease--a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge.
PG	-	e422-9
LID	-	10.1016/j.ijid.2011.03.004 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to highlight the importance of infections
		caused by members of the genera Pseudallescheria/Scedosporium in HIV-positive
		patients. METHODS: We describe a case of a fatal scedosporiosis in a
		treatment-naïve HIV patient and review all previously reported cases of
		pseudallescheriosis/scedosporiosis from a search of the PubMed and Deutsches
		"Institut für Medizinische Dokumentation und Information (DIMDI) databases,"
		"applying the terms 'Pseudallescheria', 'Scedosporium', 'Allescheria',"
		"'Monosporium', 'Petriellidium', 'boydii', 'prolificans', 'inflatum',"
		cross-referenced with 'HIV' and 'AIDS'. RESULTS: Detection of Scedosporium and
		Pseudallescheria species has been reported in 22 HIV-positive patients. Fourteen
		isolates belonged to the Pseudallescheria boydii complex and eight to
		Scedosporium prolificans. Invasive scedosporiosis (IS) was proven in 54.5% of the
		patients. Among them dissemination was observed in 66.7%.
		Pseudallescheria/Scedosporium species were mainly isolated from male individuals.
		Patients with proven IS showed CD4+ cell counts <100/μl and a higher co-infection
		rate as compared to colonized patients. Patients with central nervous system
		(CNS) manifestations showed CD4+ cell counts <50/μl. The mortality rate for
		patients with proven IS was 75% and was 100% for patients with dissemination/CNS
		manifestations. The fatality rate for patients treated with antifungal drugs plus
		surgery was lower compared to patients treated with antimycotic agents alone.
		CONCLUSIONS: IS only occurred in HIV-positive patients with a strongly impaired
		immune system. The survival rates of patients with advanced HIV disease and
		invasive scedosporiosis can be improved by rapid diagnosis by biopsy and requires
		"complex therapy with a combination of active antifungal drugs, surgery and"
		supportive immune augmentation.

PG	-	1032-43
AB	-	"OBJECTIVE: To review the currently available information on the pharmacology,"
		"pharmacokinetics, efficacy, adverse effects, drug interactions, and dosage"
		guidelines of voriconazole. Comparative data for voriconazole and other azole
		antifungal agents are described where available. DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search
		"restricted to English-language articles (1966 to September 1999) was conducted,"
		and an extensive review of journals and meeting abstracts was performed. MeSH
		"headings included itraconazole, fluconazole, voriconazole, UK-109,496, and"
		"amphotericin B. DATA EXTRACTION: The data on pharmacokinetics, adverse effects,"
		and drug interactions were obtained from open-label and controlled studies and
		case reports. Controlled studies and case reports were evaluated to demonstrate
		the efficacy of voriconazole in treatment of various fungal infections. DATA
		SYNTHESIS: Voriconazole is a derivative of fluconazole that demonstrates enhanced
		in vitro activity against existent and emerging fungal pathogens. Limited data
		have revealed a favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profile for the agent.
		"Moreover, select clinical trials and case studies of voriconazole suggest good in"
		"vivo efficacy against several fungal pathogens including Candida, Aspergillus,"
		and Scedosporium. CONCLUSIONS: Voriconazole has shown promise in the treatment of
		"superficial and systemic mycoses. While several unresolved issues remain,"
		voriconazole may be a viable therapeutic alternative for fluconazole-resistant
		mucocutaneous candidiasis and in cases of mild to moderate systemic mycoses
		requiring chronic treatment or that are refractory to currently available agents.

PG	-	859-866
LID	-	10.1093/mmy/myaa003 [doi]
AB	-	An increased prevalence of various filamentous fungi in sputum samples of
		"patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) has been reported. The clinical significance,"
		"however, is mostly unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical"
		relevance of Scedosporium spp. and Exophiala dermatitidis from sputum samples of
		"patients with CF in the Netherlands. In this cross-sectional study, all CF"
		patients of the Dutch national CF registry who were treated at five of the seven
		recognized CF centers during a 3-year period were included. We linked clinical
		data of the national CF registry with the national Dutch filamentous fungal
		database. We investigated the association between clinical characteristics and a
		"positive sputum sample for Scedosporium spp. and E. dermatitidis, using logistic"
		regression. Positive cultures for fungi were obtained from 3787 sputum samples
		from 699 of the 1312 patients with CF. Scedosporium spp. was associated with
		"severe genotype, CF-related diabetes, several microorganisms, and inhaled"
		"antibiotics. E. dermatitidis was associated with older age, female sex, and"
		Aspergillus spp. CF patients with and without Scedosporium spp. or E.
		dermatitidis seemed comparable in body mass index and lung function. This study
		suggests that Scedosporium spp. and E. dermatitidis are probably no major
		pathogens in CF patients in the Netherlands. Greater understanding of
		"epidemiologic trends, risk factors, and pathogenicity of filamentous fungi in the"
		respiratory tracts of patients with CF is needed.

TI	-	Treatment of a chronic Scedosporium apiospermum vertebral osteomyelitis. Case
		report.
PG	-	E9
AB	-	Scedosporium apiospermum is a rare cause of fungal vertebral osteomyelitis that
		may result in chronic infection requiring multiple surgical interventions and
		long-term medical therapy. This case is the seventh one reported in the
		literature and is the first to include salvage surgery of a previous major spinal
		reconstruction. This report is also the first to describe the use of the new
		antifungal agent voriconazole. In treating this case of chronic vertebral
		"osteomyelitis, several principles are emphasized from both the surgical and"
		"medical perspectives. From a surgical perspective, the use of salvage surgery,"
		"temporary avoidance of spinal instrumentation, and an appropriate choice of graft"
		"materials are emphasized. From a medical perspective, confirmation of the"
		"diagnosis, the need for long-term antifungal therapy, the need for long-term"
		"patient compliance, and the use of the new antifungal agent voriconazole are"
		emphasized. Application of these principles has led to an adequate 2-year
		outcome.

AB	-	Infections in transplanted patients are still an important cause of morbidity and
		"mortality. Among them, fungal infections with pathogens have become increasingly"
		more prevalent in the last decade. We report the clinical course and management
		of disseminated Scedosporium apiospermum infection in a kidney transplant
		"recipient, with microbiological isolation of the fungus in cerebrospinal fluid"
		culture. S apiospermum is a fungus that is distributed worldwide and can be grown
		from soil samples or stagnant water. Disseminated infection is the most frequent
		"form of infection, with cerebral involvement in most cases, which leads to a very"
		high mortality (around 75%). Post-transplant renal infections require a thorough
		"evaluation. Specifically, a high suspicion index is necessary, considering"
		Scedosporium infection among the differential diagnosis of invasive fungal
		diseases in renal transplantation patients. It is essential to confirm the
		microbiological diagnosis for an adequate diagnosis and treatment.

AB	-	Scedosporium boydii is considered as emerging opportunists affecting both
		immunocompromised and immunocompetent individuals. Diagnosis and treatment of
		"Scedosporium infections can be challenging, and the outcome is frequently fatal,"
		especially in patients with disseminated infections. Metagenomic next-generation
		sequencing (mNGS) is a promising adjunctive diagnostic approach for uncommon
		"pathogens. Here, we report a rare case of brain abscess caused by S. boydii in a"
		systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patient. This case highlights the importance
		"of mNGS in the early diagnosis of S. boydii. Additionally, the combined"
		application of culture and molecular tools may be promising in the clinical
		diagnosis of fungal disease.

PG	-	867-873
LID	-	10.1093/mmy/myz133 [doi]
AB	-	"In cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, fungal colonization of the respiratory tract is"
		frequently found. Aspergillus fumigatus is the most frequently recorded and is
		associated with loss of pulmonary function and allergic disease (ABPA). The
		knowledge on prevalence rates of filamentous fungi in CF patients in Latin
		America is scarce. One hundred and seventy-six fungal isolates recovered from the
		upper respiratory tract of CF patients from Argentina were identified to species
		"by morphology and DNA sequencing. In total, 90% of CF patients were colonized by"
		"Aspergillus sp., followed by Exophiala sp. (14%) and Scedosporium sp. (10%)."
		"Among Aspergillus, six species complexes (Fumigati, Flavi, Terrei, Nigri, Usti,"
		"and Nidulante) and different cryptospecies were found. Among Scedosporium, three"
		"species were observed (Scedosporium apiospermum, Scedosporium aurantiacum and"
		Scedosporium boydii). All Exophiala isolates were identified as Exophiala
		dermatitidis. Rare filamentous fungi were also found. All cases of ABPA were
		associated to the presence of A. fumigatus. Mixed colonization with other mould
		"or rare fungi was observed in half of them. To our knowledge, this is the first"
		prospective study of mould species in CF using molecular methods in Latin
		"America. This study shows that Aspergillus sp., E. dermatitidis and Scedosporium"
		"sp. have a high frequency in CF patients from Argentina, and by far, A. fumigatus"
		was the most commonly cultured species. Continuous clinical surveillance is
		required to detect the emergence of new fungal pathogens and to detect resistant
		or difficult-to-treat species capable of chronic colonizing the airways and of
		hematogenous dissemination in case of lung transplantation.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Infection remains the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in
		the burns patient population. While candidal infection in burns patients is well
		"described, there is dearth of information regarding non-candidal fungal"
		infections in this setting. METHOD: All adult burns patients who developed
		non-candidal fungal infections over a period of 10 years (between January 2001
		and June 2011) were included. Retrospective data analyzed included patient
		"demographics, organisms cultured, antibiotic susceptibility patterns, treatment,"
		length of stay and overall mortality. RESULTS: The incidence of non-candidal
		fungal infections at our centre over the time period studied was 0.04%. A total
		"of 12 patients had a fungus other than Candida isolated. Of these 12 patients,"
		seven were thought to have clinically significant fungal infections and were
		"treated with targeted anti-fungal therapy. Between them, seven species of fungus"
		"were isolated: Aspergillus fumigatus (n=7), Scedosporium prolificans (n=2),"
		"Fusarium solani (n=2), Mucor spp. (n=2), Absydia corymbifera (n=1), Penicillium"
		"(n=1) and Alternaria spp. (n=1). Of those definitively treated, two died,"
		although fungal infection was not believed to be a contributing factor to these
		deaths. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate a low incidence and attributable mortality of
		non-candidal fungal infections in the setting of early antifungal therapy and
		extensive surgical debridement at our state-wide Burns Service.

AB	-	"AIMS: Because of the paucity of previous data, we report the organisms causing"
		infection in children with injuries from lawnmowers and farm machinery. METHODS:
		Retrospective study of children admitted to the Children's Hospital at Westmead
		for lawnmower and farm machinery-related injuries from 1998 to 2007. RESULTS:
		Twenty-four patients were admitted for lawnmower-related injuries. They had a
		"bimodal age distribution, with peaks at 2-4 years and 14 years. Twenty-one"
		(87.5%) were boys. Positive wound cultures were obtained in 16.7% and included
		Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. Eight patients were admitted for farm
		machinery-related injuries. Two patients (25%) returned positive wound cultures
		"with multiple organisms including bacteria, fungi and mycobacteria and were"
		diagnosed with osteomyelitis caused by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and
		"Scedosporium prolificans, respectively. CONCLUSION: The rate of infection in our"
		small series of children with lawnmower and farm machinery-related injuries was
		"comparable to previous reports. We found a wide range of causative organisms,"
		"often inherently antibiotic resistant, and we add a case of invasive fungal"
		"infection to previous case reports. Because of the wide range of organisms,"
		empirical antibiotic therapy is difficult and our data emphasise the need for
		cultures to direct ongoing therapy.

PG	-	875-7
LID	-	10.1097/ICO.0000000000000172 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to report the first case of polymicrobial
		fungal sclerokeratitis caused by infection with both Scedosporium apiospermum and
		"Aspergillus cibarius, and notify the medical community of the possibility of"
		infection caused by A. cibarius in humans. METHODS: A 78-year-old woman presented
		to a medical practitioner with epiphora and a purulent discharge in her left eye.
		"After concurrent administration of topical antibiotics and systemic steroids, her"
		"symptoms worsened, and she was referred to the Tokushima University Hospital."
		"Because of suspected fungal infection, microscopic examination and cultivation of"
		both corneal and scleral scrapings were performed. RESULTS: Fungi were observed
		"on microscopic examination, and S. apiospermum was isolated only from the sclera"
		in the early stage of the clinical course. Although administration of an adequate
		medication regimen comprising topical and systemic antifungal drugs resulted in
		"an improvement in the sclera, keratitis persisted, and the infected sclera was"
		"melted. After scleral transplantation, administration of systemic caspofungin and"
		high concentrations of voriconazole solution eye drops resulted in a gradual
		improvement in keratitis. A strain of filamentous fungus was isolated from the
		"cornea 6 weeks after the cultivation on a Sabouraud agar plate, and it was"
		identified as A. cibarius. CONCLUSIONS: A. cibarius may infect human tissue.
		Coinfection of the cornea and the sclera with 2 different species of fungi is
		likely to follow a complex clinical course.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Chronic invasive fungal rhinosinusitis (CIFR) is a rare entity
		generally observed in immunodepressed subjects. The pathogen most frequently
		identified is Aspergillus spp. Imaging generally reveals invasive
		pseudoneoplastic features. We report a case of Scedosporium apiospermum
		(S. apiospermum) CIFR with an atypical clinical and radiological presentation.
		"CASE REPORT: A 72-year-old immunocompetent man presented with chronic headache,"
		neck pain and bilateral limitation of lateral gaze. Imaging revealed an isolated
		left sphenoidal lesion with marked bone changes and an extradural abscess over
		the clivus. Large endoscopic sphenoidotomy with type II rhinopharyngectomy was
		performed and the diagnosis of S. apiospermum CIFR was based on histological
		examination and fungal culture. The patient refused all medical treatment and did
		not present any signs of recurrence after 1 year of follow-up. DISCUSSION:
		S. apiospermum is a fungal species rarely isolated in CIFR. The present case was
		revealed by an atypical clinical presentation including isolated sphenoidal
		infection complicated by bilateral abducens nerve paralysis and extradural
		"abscess. Imaging was also unusual, revealing features of fibrous dysplasia or"
		bacterial osteomyelitis rather than the typical pseudoneoplastic appearance. The
		"patient was successfully treated by surgery alone, which may therefore be"
		sufficient treatment in immunocompetent subjects.

		organ transplant recipients in a tertiary medical center and review of the
		literature.
PG	-	333-48
AB	-	(Sca) is a ubiquitous filamentous fungus capable of causing invasive disease. We
		reviewed our electronic microbiology records and the English-language literature.
		Between 1976 and December 1999 we identified 23 solid organ transplant recipients
		"with Sca infection, 7 of which occurred between December 1987 and December 1999"
		"at our institution. Overall incidence was 1 per 1,000 patients, with a trend of"
		higher incidence in patients receiving lung transplants compared with other
		"transplant organs (p = 0.06). The 23 patients included liver (4), kidney (8),"
		"heart (8), lung (2), and heart/lung (1) recipients. Male to female ratio was"
		"19:4, and the mean age was 46 +/- 12 (SD) years. Fungal infection was diagnosed"
		"at a median of 4 months (range, 0.4-156 mo) after transplant. The clinical"
		"presentation included disseminated disease ( 8), skin lesions (3), lung disease"
		"(5), endophthalmitis (1), meningitis (1), brain abscess with or without extension"
		"to eye (3), fungal mycotic aneurysm (1), and sinusitis (1). Seven (30%) patients"
		"had intravascular infection, and 11 (48%) patients had central nervous system"
		involvement. Antifungal therapy was accompanied by surgical debridement in 9
		cases. Three additional patients were found to have airway colonization only and
		"received itraconazole prophylaxis, without evidence of disease. Of 22 patients"
		"with known outcome, 16 (72.7%) died. Five of 6 patients who survived had"
		"localized infections: skin lesions (n = 3), sinus fungus ball (n = 1), and"
		solitary lung nodule (n = 1). All patients with disseminated disease and 10 of 11
		patients with central nervous system disease died. An exception was 1 patient
		"with a brain abscess, successfully treated with voriconazole and surgical"
		drainage. Sca infection is rare but is associated with high mortality. Early
		"diagnosis by culture is important because Sca is resistant to amphotericin B,"
		routinely used in the empiric therapy of invasive fungal infections. Treatment
		with the combination of an antifungal and surgery may have a better outcome.
		Voriconazole promises to be an effective antifungal agent. Cultures positive for
		"Sca should not be ignored, and long-term antifungal prophylaxis in candidates and"
		transplant recipients should be considered.

AB	-	Invasive mold infections (IMIs) are a major source of morbidity and mortality
		"among lung transplant recipients (LTRs), yet information regarding the"
		"epidemiology of IMI in this population is limited. From 2001 to 2006, multicenter"
		prospective surveillance for IMIs among LTR was conducted by the
		Transplant-Associated Infection Surveillance Network. The epidemiology of IMI
		among all LTRs in the cohort is reported. Twelve percent (143/1173) of LTRs under
		surveillance at 15 US centers developed IMI infections. The 12-month cumulative
		incidence of IMIs was 5.5%; 3-month all-cause mortality was 21.7%. Aspergillus
		"caused the majority (72.7%)of IMIs; non-Aspergillus infections (39, 27.3%)"
		"included Scedosporium (5, 3.5%), mucormycosis (3, 2.1%) and ""unspecified"" or"
		"""other"" mold infections (31, 21.7%). Late-onset IMI was common: 52% occurred"
		"within 1 year posttransplant (median 11 months, range 0-162 months). IMIs are"
		common late-onset complications with substantial mortality in LTRs. LTRs should
		be monitored for late-onset IMIs and prophylactic agents should be optimized
		based on likely pathogen.

LID	-	e3102
AB	-	Mycetoma is a chronic granulomatous disease. It is classified into eumycetoma
		caused by fungi and actinomycetoma due to filamentous actinomycetes. Mycetoma can
		be found in geographic areas in close proximity to the Tropic of Cancer. Mexico
		is one of the countries in which this disease is highly endemic. In this
		"retrospective study we report epidemiologic, clinical and microbiologic data of"
		mycetoma observed in the General Hospital of Mexico in a 33 year-period (1980 to
		2013). A total of 482 cases were included which were clinical and microbiology
		confirmed. Four hundred and forty four cases (92.11%) were actinomycetomas and 38
		cases (7.88%) were eumycetomas. Most patients were agricultural workers; there
		was a male predominance with a sex ratio of 3:1. The mean age was 34.5 years old
		(most ranged from 21 to 40 years). The main affected localization was lower and
		upper limbs (70.74% and 14.52% respectively). Most of the patients came from
		"humid tropical areas (Morelos, Guerrero and Hidalgo were the regions commonly"
		reported). The main clinical presentation was as tumor-like soft tissue swelling
		with draining sinuses (97.1%). Grains were observed in all the cases. The
		principal causative agents for actinomycetoma were: Nocardia brasiliensis
		"(78.21%) and Actinomadura madurae (8.7%); meanwhile, for eumycetomas: Madurella"
		mycetomatis and Scedosporium boydii (synonym: Pseudallescheria boydii) were
		"identified. This is a single-center, with long-follow up, cross-sectional study"
		that allows determining the prevalence and characteristics of mycetoma in
		different regions of Mexico.

		"apiospermum, which was treated with a penetrating tectonic keratoplasty and"

		"apiospermum. The isolate was sensitive to amphoterycine B, caspofungin,"
		"voriconazole, and resistant to fluconazole. No clinical improvement was achieved"
		"with topical voriconazole, vancomycin, ceftazidime, and systemic voriconazole. A"
		penetrating tectonic keratoplasty and lensectomy with continuation of anti-fungal

		Western Australia.
PG	-	e13085
LID	-	10.1111/tid.13085 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive fungal infections (IFI) are common after lung
		transplantation with reported incidence of 8.1% to 16% at 12 months
		"post-transplant, and 3-month all-cause mortality after IFI of 21.7%. METHODS: We"
		performed a retrospective study of IFI and fungal colonization in lung
		transplants (LTs) from November 2004 to February 2017. RESULTS: 137 LTs were
		followed for a median 4.1 years (IQR 2.1-6.2 years). In addition to nebulized
		"amphotericin for the transplant admission to all LTs, systemic mold-active azole"
		"was given to 80/130 (61.5%) LTs in the first 6 months post-transplant, 57/121"
		"(47.1%) in the period 6-12 months after transplant, and 93/124 (75%) in the"
		period more than 12 months post-transplant. Mold airways colonization was found
		in 81 (59.1%) LTs before and 110 (80.3%) LTs after transplantation. There were 13
		"IFIs for an overall incidence of 2.1 per 100 person-years, occurring at a median"
		"583 days (IQR 182-1110 days) post-transplant, a cumulative incidence of 3.8% at"
		"1 year, 7.6% at 3 years and 10.1% at 5 years post-transplant. All-cause 3-month"
		mortality after IFI was 7.7%. Aspergillus species followed by Scedosporium
		apiospermum and Cryptococcus species were the commonest fungi causing IFI.
		"CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort the rate of IFI was comparatively low, likely because"
		of comprehensive early antifungal use and preemptive therapy at any time after
		transplant. Prospective studies of fungal colonization late after LT are required
		to determine the risks and benefits of watchful waiting compared to preemptive
		therapy.

		"followed by MALDI-ToF, PCR, and sequencing was performed to accurately identify"
		the species. Susceptibility testing was also performed due to the inherent
		resistance of S. apiospermum to numerous antifungal agents.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate safety and efficacy of oral posaconazole and terbinafine
		for Lomentospora prolificans and Scedosporium apiospermum in children with cystic
		fibrosis. METHODS: Retrospective case review. RESULTS: There were five children
		"(four girls), median age 15.0 years; three had S. apiospermum and two had L."
		prolificans. Treatment duration: median 5 months (range: 5-18 m). In no patient
		"was eradication achieved, with the follow-up range being 6 months to 4 years."
		Effect on lung function was variable but encouraging. No adverse effects were
		"reported, one child had transient elevation of liver enzymes. CONCLUSIONS: While"
		"the combination therapy was well tolerated, it was unsuccessful at eradication."

PG	-	e3743
LID	-	10.7759/cureus.3743 [doi]
LID	-	e3743
AB	-	Orbital apex syndrome (OAS) is a localized orbital cellulitis at the orbital apex
		that can cause vision loss from optic neuropathy and ophthalmoplegia involving
		"multiple cranial nerves. Herein, we report a rare and rapidly progressive case of"
		OAS secondary to fungal pansinusitis caused by Scedosporium apiospermum in an
		immunocompromised patient following the extraction of abscessed teeth. A
		48-year-old man with diabetes mellitus who had failed to adhere to his treatment
		"presented with complaints of a right-sided headache and toothache for two weeks,"
		with nausea and vomiting for two days prior to presentation. The patient was
		treated for septic shock secondary to the dental abscesses. Non-contrast brain
		computed tomography (CT) showed no significant intracranial abnormalities other
		"than pansinusitis. Four days later, dental extraction was performed. The patient"
		reported progressive painless blurring of the vision in his right eye following
		the dental extractions and was referred to the ophthalmology department.
		Subsequent examinations revealed decreased optic nerve function and
		"ophthalmoplegia in his right eye and dental caries in the upper molars, with a"
		mucopurulent discharge from the right sphenoid region. The clinical diagnosis was
		OAS. Pus near the orbital apex was drained surgically. Methicillin-resistant
		Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from the pus and a nasal swab. Tissue culture
		from the septal wall yielded S. apiospermum. The patient's condition
		"deteriorated, despite intensive antibiotic and antifungal treatment and repeated"
		surgical debridement. The disease progressed rapidly to his left eye. Sixty-seven
		"days after the inital presentation, his visual acuity (VA) of both eyes was"
		classified as no perception of light (NPL). The patient discharged himself from
		the hospital (at own risk discharge) and subsequently failed to attend a
		scheduled appointment in the ophthalmology clinic. If immunocompromised patients
		"present with OAS, fungal infections should be ruled out. Prompt and aggressive"
		treatment using a multidisciplinary approach is mandatory in cases of potentially
		life-threatening and vision-threatening fungal infections.

		Alternaria species: a case report.
PG	-	72
LID	-	10.1186/s12879-016-2098-6 [doi]
LID	-	72
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Scedosporium apiospermum, which can usually be isolated from soil,"
		"polluted stream water and decaying vegetation, is increasingly recognized as an"
		opportunistic dematiaceous fungus. The mortality rate of infection in
		immunocompromised hosts is over 50%. S. apiospermum is commonly responsible for
		"dermal and epidermal infections (i.e., mycetoma) after traumatic penetration."
		CASE PRESENTATION: A 73-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital complaining
		of painful swelling and tenderness on the dorsum of the proximal left wrist and
		hand. The symptoms had persisted for approximately 2 months. A physical
		"examination revealed a 4 x 3 cm, poorly defined, erythematous papule, which was"
		"fluctuant, with pustules and crusts on the dorsum of the left hand. CONCLUSIONS:"
		We report a very rare case of tenosynovitis caused by S. apiospermum infection.
		We identified the infectious agent via molecular DNA sequencing. The infectious
		agent was initially misidentified as an Alternaria species by microscopic
		examination with lactophenol cotton blue (LPCB) staining. The infection was
		successfully treated with debridement and adjuvant fluconazole therapy.

AB	-	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Scedosporium spp. is a saprophytic fungus that may cause
		invasive pulmonary infection due to the aspiration of contaminated water in both
		"immunosuppressed and immunocompetent hosts. CASE REPORT: Herein, we report a"
		fatal case of pulmonary infection caused by Scedosporium species associated with
		a car crash and near-drowning in a sewage canal. Scedosporium aurantiacum
		isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage was identified by PCR-sequencing of
		"β-tubulin genes. The minimum inhibitory concentration values for amphotericin B,"
		"itraconazole, posaconazole, isavuconazole were >16 µg/ml, and >8 µg/ml for"
		"anidulafungin, micafungin, and caspofungin. Voriconazole was found to be the most"
		"active agent with a MIC of 1 µg/ml. CONCLUSION: This report, as the first case of"
		"pulmonary scedosporiosis after near-drowning in Iran, highlights the importance"
		"of high suspicion in near-drowning victims, prompt identification of Scedosporium"
		"spp., and early initiation of appropriate antifungal therapy."

AB	-	We report the first case of pulmonary scedosporiosis detected by next-generation
		sequencing (NGS) from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in a 67-year-old male
		with bronchiectasis and hematopoietic failure. Scedosporium apiospermum is a
		ubiquitous organism present in the environment with intrinsic resistance to many
		"antifungal agents. The patient developed respiratory failure, pulmonary"
		"consolidation, and septic shock shortly thereafter, and responded poorly to"
		antifungal therapy. This case highlights the combined application of NGS and
		traditional fungal culture in the clinical diagnosis of pulmonary invasive fungal
		disease. NGS is proposed as an important adjunctive diagnostic approach for
		uncommon pathogens.

		literature.
PG	-	e100590
LID	-	10.1371/journal.pone.0100590 [doi]
LID	-	e100590
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Mycetoma is a chronic granulomatous infection involving cutaneous and
		"subcutaneous tissues. It is endemic in tropical and subtropical areas, but"
		sporadic cases have been reported also in countries of temperate climate. The
		purpose of this paper is to review the cases of mycetoma in European subjects
		"(and presumably acquired in Europe), to give an insight in the main factors"
		"associated with this condition, and to describe two previously unpublished cases"
		observed at our Centre. METHODS AND FINDINGS: PubMed was systematically searched
		for case reports and case series of mycetoma in Europeans reported between 1980
		"and 2014, using specific search strategies. Two further cases diagnosed by the"
		authors are described. Forty-two cases were collected. Eleven cases were caused
		"by Scedosporium apiospermium, mainly in immunosuppressed patients from Bulgaria,"
		"Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain and the United Kingdom."
		"Excluding all patients with immunosuppression, 29 cases remain. Most of them were"
		reported from Bulgaria and in Albanian patients (all diagnosed outside Albania).
		"In the Bulgarian case series many different micro-organisms, both bacteria and"
		"fungi, were isolated, while all the 5 cases from Albania were caused by"
		"Actinomadura spp. Other countries reporting cases were Greece, Italy and Turkey."
		"In general, Actinomadura spp is the most frequent causative agent isolated,"
		followed by Nocardia spp and Madurella mycetomatis. The foot was the most
		"reported site involved. Most patients were medically treated, but unfortunately a"
		long-term follow up (at least one year) was available only in a few cases.
		CONCLUSIONS: Our review and our own cases suggest that Europeans without travel
		history can be affected by Madura foot. The lack of a surveillance system is
		"likely to cause an underreporting of cases. Moreover, the unfamiliarity of"
		"Western doctors with this peculiar infection may cause a mismanagement, including"
		unnecessary amputations.

		the Respiratory Tract of Cystic Fibrosis Patients.
PG	-	1122-1130
LID	-	10.1128/JCM.02182-16 [doi]
AB	-	The prevalence of fungi in the respiratory tracts of cystic fibrosis (CF)
		"patients has risen. However, fungal surveillance is not routinely performed in"
		"most clinical centers in the United States, which may lead to an underestimation"
		of the true prevalence of the problem. We conducted a prospective study comparing
		"the rates of detection for clinically important fungi (CIF), defined as"
		"Aspergillus, Scedosporium, and Trichosporon species and Exophiala dermatitidis,"
		"in CF sputa using standard bacterial and selective fungal culture media,"
		"including Sabouraud dextrose agar with gentamicin (SDA), inhibitory mold agar"
		"(IMA), and brain heart infusion (BHI) agar with chloramphenicol and gentamicin."
		We described the prevalence of these fungi in an adult CF population. A total of
		487 CF respiratory samples were collected from 211 unique participants. CIF were
		detected in 184 (37.8%) samples. Only 26.1% of CIF-positive samples were detected
		"in bacterial culture medium, whereas greater rates of detection for fungi were"
		"found in IMA (65.8%; P < 0.001), in SDA (at 30°C, 64.7%; P = 0.005), and in BHI"
		agar (63.0%; P = 0.001). The prevalences of Aspergillus and Scedosporium species
		"were 40.8% and 5.2%, respectively, which are greater than the nationally reported"
		prevalence numbers of 20.4% and 1.9%. Selective fungal culture media and longer
		incubation periods yielded higher rates of detection for CIF in CF sputum samples
		"compared with that detected in bacterial culture medium, resulting in an"
		underdetection of fungi by bacterial culture alone. The prevalence of fungi in CF
		"may be better estimated by using selective fungal culture media, and this may"
		translate to important clinical decisions.

PG	-	295-308
LID	-	10.7589/2014-06-143 [doi]
AB	-	A wide range of systemic mycoses have been reported from captive and wild marine
		mammals from North America. Examples include regionally endemic pathogens such as
		"Coccidioides and Blastomyces spp., and novel pathogens like Cryptococcus gattii,"
		which appear may have been introduced to North America by humans. Stranding and
		necropsy data were analyzed from three marine mammal stranding and response
		"facilities on the central California coast to assess the prevalence, host"
		"demographics, and lesion distribution of systemic mycoses affecting locally"
		"endemic marine mammals. Between 1 January 1998 and 30 June 2012, >7,000 stranded"
		marine mammals were necropsied at the three facilities. Necropsy and
		histopathology records were reviewed to identify cases of locally invasive or
		systemic mycoses and determine the nature and distribution of fungal lesions.
		"Forty-one animals (0.6%) exhibited cytological, culture- or histologically"
		"confirmed locally invasive or systemic mycoses: 36 had coccidioidomycosis, two"
		"had zygomycosis, two had cryptococcosis, and one was systemically infected with"
		Scedosporium apiospermum (an Ascomycota). Infected animals included 18 California
		"sea lions (Zalophus californianus), 20 southern sea otters (Enhydra lutris"
		"nereis), two Pacific harbor seals (Phoca vitulina richardsi), one Dall's porpoise"
		"(Phocoenoides dalli), and one northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris)."
		"Coccidioidomycosis was reported from 15 sea lions, 20 sea otters, and one harbor"
		"seal, confirming that Coccidioides spp. is the most common pathogen causing"
		systemic mycosis in marine mammals stranding along the central California coast.
		We also report the first confirmation of C. gattii infection in a wild marine
		mammal from California and the first report of coccidioidomycosis in a wild
		harbor seal. Awareness of these pathogenic fungi during clinical care and
		postmortem examination is an important part of marine mammal population health
		surveillance and human health protection. Temporal-spatial overlap may be
		observed for pathogenic mycoses infecting coastal marine mammals and adjacent
		human populations.

AB	-	The increasing prevalence of uncommon fungal species and higher antifungal
		resistance has turned antifungal susceptibility testing into an important
		"monitoring tool. In response, we evaluated the activity of isavuconazole against"
		"522 clinical mold isolates collected worldwide in 2017-2018, including 436"
		Aspergillus spp. isolates and 86 non-Aspergillus molds. The MIC values using
		Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute methods for isavuconazole versus
		Aspergillus ranged from 0.015 mg/L to >8 mg/L. Isavuconazole showed comparable
		"activity to itraconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole against A. fumigatus"
		species complex. Most of the Aspergillus spp. isolates tested (>90%) were wild
		type to all azoles and echinocandins. Eleven isolates were non-wild type to
		"isavuconazole and the other 3 azoles, and 10 of those isolates were from Europe."
		The azoles and echinocandins showed poor activity against Fusarium and
		Scedosporium spp. Isavuconazole exhibited excellent activity against most species
		"of Aspergillus and was comparable to itraconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole"
		against the less common molds.

		tuberculosis in a renal transplant recipient.
PG	-	259
LID	-	10.1186/1471-2334-14-259 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Renal transplant recipients are at high risk of developing multiple
		"infections, often concomitantly because of their immunocompromised status. Post"
		renal transplant infections are often elusive and require extensive evaluation
		for proper diagnosis and treatment. A high index of suspicion is required and an
		attempt should be made to confirm the microbiological diagnosis from each site
		involved to rule out multiple infections. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a
		"50-year-old female, a renal allograft recipient who presented with left"
		"hemiplegia, esophageal ulcers and fever 3 months after her transplant. Esophageal"
		biopsy revealed Cytomegalovirus (CMV) inclusions and the whole blood quantitative
		CMV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was positive. Neuroimaging showed a brain
		"abscess, stereotactic biopsy from which revealed Scedosporium apiospermum on"
		fungal culture. Her tacrolimus and mycophenolate were stopped and she was managed
		"with intravenous ganciclovir and voriconazole. With these measures, she showed"
		"marked improvement in her general and neurological condition. Two months later,"
		she developed recurrence of fever with dry cough. Radiological investigation
		"revealed a cavitating lung lesion, a needle aspiration from which demonstrated"
		acid-fast bacilli. She was started on antituberculous treatment. With these
		"measures, she recovered completely and maintained good graft function despite"
		being on only prednisolone 10 mg once a day. CONCLUSION: Although CMV disease is
		"not uncommon in the first three months post transplant, Scedosporium is a rare"
		"cause of brain abscess. On the other hand, tuberculosis is common in transplant"
		"recipients, especially in developing countries, like India. However, this is the"
		"first case report of occurrence of these three infections in the same patient,"
		demonstrating the importance of a good microbiological work-up from each site
		involved in immunosuppressed subjects.

TI	-	Recurrent Scedosporium apiospermum mycetoma successfully treated by surgical
		excision and terbinafine treatment: a case report and review of the literature.
PG	-	31

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Scedosporium apiospermum is an emerging opportunistic filamentous
		"fungus, which is notorious for its high levels of antifungal-resistance. It is"
		able to cause localized cutaneous or subcutaneous infections in both
		"immunocompromised and immunocompetent persons, pulmonary infections in patients"
		with predisposing pulmonary diseases and invasive mycoses in immunocompromised
		patients. Subcutaneous infections caused by this fungus frequently show chronic
		mycetomatous manifestation. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 70-year-old
		"immunocompromised man, who developed a fungal mycetomatous infection on his right"
		leg. There was no history of trauma; the aetiological agent was identified by
		microscopic examination and ITS sequencing. This is the second reported case of
		"S. apiospermum subcutaneous infections in Hungary, which was successfully treated"
		"by surgical excision and terbinafine treatment. After 7 months, the patient"
		remained asymptomatic. Considering the antifungal susceptibility and increasing
		"incidence of the fungus, Scedosporium related subcutaneous infections reported in"
		the past quarter of century in European countries were also reviewed.
		CONCLUSIONS: Corticosteroid treatment represents a serious risk factor of S.
		"apiospermum infections, especially if the patient get in touch with"
		manure-enriched or polluted soil or water. Such infections have emerged several
		times in European countries in the past decades. The presented data suggest that
		"besides the commonly applied voriconazole, terbinafine may be an alternative for"
		the therapy of mycetomatous Scedosporium infections.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Granulomatous infections are common in patients with chronic lung
		disease. We aim to study the incidence and clinicopathological features of
		granulomatous infections in a cohort of patients undergoing lung transplantation
		for end-stage chronic lung disease. METHODS: Pathology reports of 50 explanted
		native lungs of patients who underwent lung transplantation since 2015 at our
		institution were reviewed. Four cases with granulomatous lesions were identified.
		Correlation was made with clinical findings in the 4 cases. RESULTS: The
		granulomatous infections include non-necrotizing cryptococcal pneumonitis (case
		"1), necrotizing pneumonia due to Scedosporium sp. and Mycobacterium avium Complex"
		"(MAC) (Cases 2 and 3), and invasive Aspergillus pneumonia (Case 4). One patient"
		received pre-transplant fungal prophylaxis (Case 4). Post-transplant infectious
		complications included invasive (Cases 2 and 4) and non-invasive (Case 1) fungal
		infections and bacterial pneumonia (Cases 1 and 2). Two patients (Cases 3 and 4)
		developed acute cellular rejection (ACR) in the first 30 days. The third patient
		(Case 1) was identified with ACR in the 9 months post-transplant and chronic lung
		"allograft dysfunction at 29 months. In terms of mortality, 1 patient (Case 1)"
		died at 30 months post-transplant from pseudomonal sepsis and chronic graft
		failure. Two patients with invasive fungal infections (Cases 2 and 4) are on
		secondary prophylaxis and doing well. One patient (Case 3) remains infection-free
		"and on MAC prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: In our case series, patients with chronic"
		lung diseases with superimposed granulomatous infestations frequently experienced
		post-transplant complications. These include invasive infections and repeat ACRs
		that predispose patients to chronic graft dysfunction. Pre- and post-transplant
		antifungal prophylaxis reduces fungal load and complication risk post-transplant.

		"agents, and no recurrence of the tumorlet or S. apiospermum infection has"
		occurred.

		receiving hypomethylating agents.
PG	-	792-798
LID	-	10.1002/ajh.25808 [doi]
AB	-	Invasive fungal infections (IFI) are a significant source of morbidity and
		mortality for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic
		syndromes (MDS). Given the heterogeneity of the population receiving
		"hypomethylating agents (HMA), it is difficult for clinicians to accurately assess"
		their patients' risk of infection. Literature on the incidence of IFI following
		HMA is limited to several studies of azacitidine. The primary objective of this
		retrospective study was to establish the incidence of IFI in HMA treated AML/MDS
		patients at a large U.S. comprehensive cancer center. Secondary objectives
		included comparing incidence of IFI among pre-specified subgroups to identify
		"potential risk factors for IFI. Two hundred three patients with AML, intermediate"
		to very high risk MDS or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia who received at least
		"two cycles of HMA were included. The incidence of IFI, as defined by the European"
		Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer / Invasive Fungal Infections
		"Cooperative Group criteria, was 9.6%, with 20 IFI diagnosed following HMA (three"
		"proven, four probable, 13 possible). Among the proven cases of IFI, molds"
		included Scedosporium and Fusarium spp. Eleven patients who developed IFIs were
		neutropenic upon initiating HMA. The majority (17/20) of infections occurred
		"during the first four cycles. Given this incidence, mold-active prophylaxis can"
		be considered in patients who are neutropenic at the start of therapy.

		"base osteomyelitis, internal carotid artery vasculitis and subsequent stroke."
		"Despite the multiple complications encountered, prompt diagnosis and initiation"
		of appropriate antifungal treatment resulted in patient survival. Multiple
		imaging modalities were used to aid the establishment of the diagnosis in this
		complex case and highlight the radiological findings associated with skull base
		osteomyelitis and its possible complications.

PG	-	519-527
LID	-	10.1038/s41429-021-00431-4 [doi]
AB	-	Antifungal surveillance is an important tool to monitor the prevalence of
		uncommon fungal species and increasing antifungal resistance throughout the
		"world, but data comparing results across several different Asian countries are"
		"scarce. In this study, 372 invasive molds collected in the Asia-Western Pacific"
		region in 2011-2019 were susceptibility tested for mold-active triazoles
		"(isavuconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, and itraconazole). The collection"
		includes 318 Aspergillus spp. isolates and 53 non-Aspergillus molds. The MIC
		values using CLSI methods for isavuconazole versus Aspergillus fumigatus ranged
		"from 0.25 to 2 mg l(-1). Isavuconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, and"
		voriconazole acted similarly against A. fumigatus. The mold-active triazoles
		exhibited a wildtype phenotype to most of the Aspergillus spp. isolates tested
		"(>94%), but poor activity against Fusarium solani species complex and"
		Lomentospora prolificans. Voriconazole was most active against the Scedosporium
		"spp. and posaconazole was most active against the Mucorales. In summary,"
		isavuconazole displayed excellent activity against most species of Aspergillus
		and was comparable to other mold-active triazoles against non-Aspergillus molds.

		areas. Working diagnosis was sebaceous carcinoma. Biopsy was performed.
		Histopathological studies showed a mycotic eumycetoma with Splendore-Hoeppli
		phenomena and - microbiologic cultures grew Scedosporium apiospermum. The patient
		was started on voriconazole 200 mg po bid with adequate serum levels. A complete
		response was observed after 18 weeks of voriconazole therapy. To the best of our
		"knowledge, this is the first published case of S. apiospermum eumycotic mycetoma"
		of the eyelid. It is important to consider mycotic infection in the differential
		diagnosis of eyelid tumors even in healthy patients.

TI	-	Clinical outcome of cystic fibrosis patients colonized by Scedosporium species
		following lung transplantation: A single-center 15-year experience.
LID	-	10.1111/tid.12738 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Fungi of the genus Scedosporium are emerging pathogens responsible
		for severe infections in lung transplant recipients. These infections are
		associated with poor prognosis and some centers consider now Scedosporium species
		colonization as a contraindication to lung transplantation (LT) even though no
		published evidence demonstrates that Scedosporium species colonization is
		"associated with higher morbidity or mortality after LT. METHODS: Here, we aim to"
		describe characteristics and outcome of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung transplant
		recipients colonized with Scedosporium species in a single center over a 15-year
		"period. RESULTS: During the study period, 14 patients had scedosporial"
		"colonization reported. Only one patient, colonized before transplantation by"
		"Lomentospora prolificans, developed scedosporial disease. Among the eight"
		"patients colonized before transplantation by Scedosporium apiospermum complex,"
		the median survival was 1.92 year (range 0.21-12.5). All these patients except
		one became free of fungal colonization after transplantation with antifungal
		prophylaxis including voriconazole or posaconazole. For the five patients
		"colonized after LT, including two with L. prolificans, the median survival was"
		1.75 years (range 0.1-13); three of them are still alive. CONCLUSIONS: It appears
		to us that scedosporial colonization may not be a contraindication for LT in CF
		"patients, as long as S. apiospermum complex is involved and a life-long azole"
		prophylaxis prescribed.

AB	-	"INTRODUCTION: There are more than 300,000 extractors using the babaçu coconut as"
		"a source of income in the States of Maranhão, Pará, Tocantins and Piauí, and this"
		activity is associated with fungal infections. The objective of this study was to
		"examine the occurrence of emergent fungi in the conjunctiva, nails and surface"
		"and subcutaneous injuries of female coconut breakers in Esperantinópolis,"
		"Maranhão. Additionally, soil samples and palm structures were collected. METHODS:"
		The obtained samples were cultured in Petri dishes containing
		potato-dextrose-agar and chloramphenicol. The etiological agent was confirmed by
		"a direct mycological exam and growth in culture. RESULTS: In total, 150 domiciles"
		"were visited, and samples were collected from 80 patients. From the ground, the"
		most frequently isolated fungus was Aspergillus niger (53. 8%). the most
		frequently detected fungus in babaçu coconut was Aspergillus niger (66.7%).
		Conjunctival fungal growth occurred in 76.3% of the women. The ocular fungal
		"microbiota consisted of filamentous fungi (80.6%), and yeasts were present in"
		19.4% of cases. Onychomycosis was diagnosed in 44% (11/25) of the women.
		"CONCLUSIONS: The identification of the genera Neosartorya, Rhizopus and"
		Curvularia in onychomycoses shows that emergent filamentous fungi can be
		"isolated. Aspergillus sp., Penicillium sp. and Scedosporium sp. were the"
		"predominant genera found in the babaçu coconut. From ocular conjunctiva, Candida"
		"spp. were the most prevalent species isolated, and Fusarium sp. was present only"
		in one woman. The nearly permanent exposure of coconut breakers to the external
		environment and to the soil is most likely the reason for the existence of a
		"mycotic flora and fungal infections, varying according to the individual's"
		practices and occupation.

AB	-	Fungal keratitis is responsible for a significant burden of blinding disease in
		the developing world. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the
		"etiological agents, predisposing factors and therapy of keratomycosis in our"
		region. METHODS: Retrospective study of 60 patients with clinically and cultured
		"confirmed fungi keratitis, who were attended at department of mycology in Sfax"
		(1995 to 2012). RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 47.2 years (sex ratio:
		"1.58). At least, one presumed predisposing factor was identified in 83.3% of"
		cases. Corneal traumatism was established as the most common predisposing factor
		(61.6%) with vegetative matter (42.4%). Patients had corneal ulcer in 40% or
		abscess in 47.6%. All cases were positive on direct microscopy and 93% of
		cultures were positive. Filamentous fungi form the major etiologic agents (83%):
		"Fusarium species (49% with F. solani [66%]), Aspergillus sp. (22%), Alternaria"
		"(5%), Scedosporium sp. (2%); and non-identified mold in (5%). Yeast were"
		identified in 17% of cases. Topical agents were used in 97% of cases:
		"ketoconazole 2%, amphotericin B (0.5%). Fluconazole per os was administrated for"
		"11% of cases, itraconazole (2 cases) and voriconazole (one case). Keratoplasty"
		was indicated for 27% of cases. The outcome was favorable in 16% of patients.
		"Among the patients, 71% had persistent corneal deposit sequelae. Four patients"
		lost the eyeball. CONCLUSION: Corneal traumatism was the principal risk factor
		for fungal keratitis in young and middle-aged farmers. Fusarium solani is the
		"predominant cause in Sfax. Early diagnosis, coupled with appropriate treatment,"
		is crucial for increasing the chance of complete recovery.

PG	-	116-24
AB	-	"Over the past 20 years at my institution, 71 patients with invasive necrotizing"
		aspergillosis have been encountered; 42 have shown central nervous system (CNS)
		involvement by autopsy (40) or surgical biopsy (2). Most non-CNS aspergillosis
		"patients had invasive disease confined to the lung, and only 2 with dissemination"
		to 3 or more organs did not have spread to the CNS. In addition to the expected
		"post-transplantation and hematologic malignancy cases, other risk groups"
		"identified included those with chronic asthma and steroid use, acquired"
		"immunodeficiency syndrome, thermal burn, hepatic failure, and postoperative"
		"infection. Unusual cases manifested with basilar meningitis, myelitis, proptosis"
		"caused by sino-orbital disease, or epidural and subdural Aspergillus abscesses."
		The extent of gross neuropathologic disease ranged from subtle abscesses to
		massive hemorrhagic necrosis causing herniation and death. In addition to the
		"expected hemorrhagic necrosis, extensive hemorrhage, focal purulent meningitis,"
		and subtle bland infarctions were also seen. Distinctive microscopic findings
		encountered included 1 case with numerous meningeal granulomas and multinucleated
		giant cells and 4 cases showing the Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon. During the same
		"period, single cases of cerebritis caused by morphologically similar fungi"
		"(Pseudoallescheria boydii [Scedosporium apiospermum], Scedosporium inflatum,"
		Chaetomium sp) were identified and were indistinguishable from CNS aspergillosis
		clinically and pathologically.

TI	-	Disseminated infection by Scedosporium prolificans: an emerging fatality among
		haematology patients. Case report and review.
PG	-	340-4
AB	-	We describe a case of proven disseminated infection by Scedosporium prolificans
		in a profoundly neutropenic patient. The patient presented with a fever
		"unresponsive to broad-spectrum antibiotics, endophthalmitis, respiratory failure"
		and a renal abscess. The organism was isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid
		and from pus obtained through a sterile puncture. Review of the English-language
		literature identified 28 additional cases; these occurred exclusively in severely
		neutropenic patients (predominantly leukaemia) and in transplant recipients.
		"Apart from two or possibly three cases, dissemination was uniformly fatal due to"
		persistent neutropenia and inherited resistance of these pathogens to currently
		"available antifungal drugs. At present, the optimal treatment of S. prolificans"
		"infections is unknown, but reversal of the underlying deficient immune status"
		appears of great importance.

AB	-	The epidemiology of invasive fungal disease (IFD) due to filamentous fungi other
		"than Aspergillus may be changing. We analysed clinical, microbiological and"
		outcome data in Australian patients to determine the predisposing factors and
		identify determinants of mortality. Proven and probable non-Aspergillus mould
		infections (defined according to modified European Organization for Research and
		Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group criteria) from 2004 to 2012 were
		evaluated in a multicentre study. Variables associated with infection and
		"mortality were determined. Of 162 episodes of non-Aspergillus IFD, 145 (89.5%)"
		were proven infections and 17 (10.5%) were probable infections. The pathogens
		included 29 fungal species/species complexes; mucormycetes (45.7%) and
		Scedosporium species (33.3%) were most common. The commonest comorbidities were
		"haematological malignancies (HMs) (46.3%) diabetes mellitus (23.5%), and chronic"
		pulmonary disease (16%); antecedent trauma was present in 21% of cases.
		"Twenty-five (15.4%) patients had no immunocompromised status or comorbidity, and"
		were more likely to have acquired infection following major trauma (p <0.01); 61
		(37.7%) of cases affected patients without HMs or transplantation. Antifungal
		"therapy was administered to 93.2% of patients (median 68 days, interquartile"
		"range 19-275), and adjunctive surgery was performed in 58.6%. The all-cause"
		90-day mortality was 44.4%; HMs and intensive-care admission were the strongest
		"predictors of death (both p <0.001). Survival varied by fungal group, with the"
		risk of death being significantly lower in patients with dematiaceous mould
		infections than in patients with other non-Aspergillus mould infections.
		"Non-Aspergillus IFD affected diverse patient groups, including"
		"non-immunocompromised hosts and those outside traditional risk groups; therefore,"
		"definitions of IFD in these patients are required. Given the high mortality,"
		increased recognition of infections and accurate identification of the causative
		agent are required.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: In recent years an increase in the prevalence of colonization and
		infection by Scedosporium spp. in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) has been
		"observed. In this article, we study the frequency of isolation of Scedosporium"
		"spp. in an adult CF Unit, analyzing characteristics of the patients and"
		predisposing factors. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted
		in 87 adult CF patients in whom the presence of positive culture for Scedosporium
		spp. was tested for a 5-year period (January 2012-July 2017). We recorded the
		"following clinical variables: age, sex, body mass index, genotype, presence of"
		"pancreatic insufficiency, bacterial colonization, lung function, other"
		"complications, exacerbations and treatment, and the modified Bhalla score from"
		the last high-resolution computed tomography. Results were analyzed with IBM SPSS
		Statistics Version 22.0 software. RESULTS: Scedosporium spp. was isolated in
		"25.3% of patients. In the bivariate analysis, these patients showed a higher rate"
		"of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, worse score in the Bhalla classification"
		"(highlighting the following items: bronchiectasis, mucus plugs and bronchial"
		"generations), a slight decrease in the lung diffusion capacity and more"
		frequently received inhaled antibiotics. In the logistic regression multivariate
		"analysis, only the bronchial generations item was significant. CONCLUSION:"
		Scedosporium spp. must be considered an emerging opportunistic pathogen in
		"patients with CF whose clinical involvement, risk factors or need for treatment"
		is unknown.

		computed tomography findings and literature review.
PG	-	247-52
LID	-	10.1097/RCT.0b013e318172d629 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to evaluate chest computed tomography
		(CT) findings in 3 lung transplant recipients infected with Pseudallescheria
		"boydii complex or its asexual anamorph, Scedosporium apiospermum, 2 after"
		double-lung transplant and 1 after single-lung transplantation. Awareness and
		"early diagnosis of this rare but potentially lethal infection are important, as"
		it is largely refractory to treatment with the antifungal agents of choice used
		for the more common Aspergillus species. Computed tomography investigation
		"focused on the location, quality, and appearance of the various pulmonary lesions"
		"as well as the presence of cavitation, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and pleural"
		effusions. A literature review of previous lung and other solid organ transplant
		recipients infected with pulmonary Pseudallescheria boydii was also conducted and
		compared with our findings. CONCLUSION: While the high-resolution CT findings of
		pulmonary P. boydii infection are nonspecific and markedly similar to the
		"manifestations of the more common Aspergillus species, awareness of this rare"
		"opportunist is important, given the high mortality associated with disseminated"
		infection and the relative success possible with timely and appropriate
		treatment. The most common CT abnormalities present in our 3 patients included
		"hilar and paratracheal adenopathy, noncavitary tree-in-bud nodules surrounded by"
		"ground-glass opacities, and airway thickening."

		"fungus ubiquitous in soil as well as organically polluted areas, where"

		"myelodysplastic syndrome, in remission from chronic lymphocytic leukemia,"
		presented with pneumonia and deteriorating mental status. An X-ray computed

		"brain. Many erythematous, indurated skin lesions, measuring 3-5 mm in diameter,"
		"were noted on her chest, shoulders and arms. Biopsies were submitted for culture"
		and histology. Histopathologic examination revealed superficial and deep
		perivascular and periadnexal inflammatory infiltrates of lymphocytes and
		neutrophils. Scattered collections of fungal organisms were noted near the
		eccrine glands. The periodic acid Schiff with diastase stain showed the presence
		of variable sized spores and hyphae with some acute angle branching. Both tissue
		and blood cultures were positive for a single Scedosporium species.

TI	-	Clinical significance of Scedosporium apiospermum in patients with cystic
		fibrosis.
PG	-	53-6
AB	-	The incidence of airway colonization by Scedosporium apiospermum and of related
		sensitization was investigated prospectively in 128 patients with cystic fibrosis
		"over a 5-year period, and results were compared with clinical data. Scedosporium"
		"apio-spermum, recovered from sputum samples in 11 of 128 (8.6%) patients, was the"
		most frequent filamentous fungus after Aspergillus fumigatus.
		"Counterimmuno-electrophoresis, used to detect scedosporiosis serologically, was"
		positive in 27 of 128 (21.1%) patients. The discrepancy between the mycological
		and serological results may be related to immune cross-reactions between
		"Scedosporium apiospermum and Aspergillus fumigatus. However, symptoms of allergic"
		bronchopulmonary disease were observed in two patients chronically colonized by
		Scedosporium apiospermum. The results clearly demonstrate that the frequency of
		this fungus is largely underestimated and that it may trigger an inflammatory
		"response, thus suggesting a pathogenic role in patients with cystic fibrosis."

PG	-	145-9
LID	-	10.2174/1874306401206010145 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Persistent Candida from fungal cultures of respiratory secretions are
		often ignored and not treated due to assumptions concerning benign colonization.
		OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical course of patients with chronic sputum and
		"fungi on culture, including response to antifungal treatment. METHODS: All"
		patients seen at a single long term acute care hospital (LTAC) between May 2009
		and September 2010 with at least two months of daily sputum and fungus on more
		"than one sputum culture were identified. LTAC, inpatient, and outpatient records"
		through June 2011 were reviewed to assess clinical features and response to
		"therapy or to cessation of therapy. RESULTS: Eleven patients were identified,"
		"having sputum duration of 5 months to 28 years, and respiratory cultures growing"
		"Candida species. Fungi included C albicans (8 patients), C glabrata (2), C krusei"
		"(2), C tropicalis (1), C parapsilosis (1), Aspergillus fumigatus (1), Aspergillus"
		"terreus (1), and Scedosporium (1), the latter 3 in conjunction with Candida"
		"species. All had abnormal chest CT scans, often with bronchiectasis and sometimes"
		"atelectasis or consolidation, and ten of 11 patients were on chronic steroids"
		"(inhaled and/or systemic). Antifungal therapy, mostly oral voriconazole and"
		"nebulized amphotericin, led to improved respiratory symptoms and sputum within 3"
		weeks in 10 of 10 treated patients. Lack of antifungal therapy or early cessation
		of treatment was associated with progressive or recurrent symptoms and death of
		one patient. CONCLUSIONS: This case series suggests that chronic candidal
		bronchitis is associated with significant morbidity and responds well to
		treatment. Such patients may benefit from extended antifungal therapy. Guidelines
		for the treatment of Candida in pulmonary secretions should be reevaluated.

TI	-	Bone and joint infection after traumatic implantation of Scedosporium prolificans
		treated with voriconazole and surgery.
PG	-	980-2
AB	-	Scedosporium prolificans is an environmental mould that may cause local infection
		"in bone and joints after traumatic implantation, or generalized infection in"
		"immunocompromised patients. The fungus is highly drug resistant, both in vitro"
		and in vivo. We present a case of osteomyelitis and arthritis caused by S.
		prolificans in a 9-y-old boy whose knee had been punctured by a hawthorn spike.
		Treatment with different drugs was difficult and arthrodesis was necessary.
		"Concomitantly, voriconazole was given, and after three months bone biopsies were"
		sterile despite a high in vitro MIC-value of the fungus against voriconazole.
		Reversible skin depigmentation and fingernail oncholysis appeared toward the end
		of 17 months of voriconazole treatment. Twelve months after discontinuation of
		"treatment, no signs of relapse were detected. CONCLUSION: Voriconazole may be a"
		valuable adjunct to surgical treatment of bone and joint infection by
		Scedosporium prolificans.

		and Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococcus faecium Intra-Cranial Abscesses.
PG	-	500-1
LID	-	10.1089/sur.2016.023 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: The aim of this submission is to demonstrate the need for broad
		"antimicrobial therapy, including empiric anti-fungal therapy, if rim-enhancing"
		lesions are noted on cerebral imaging. METHODS: A retrospective microbiological
		and radiologic review of the management of a rare case of multiple Scedosporium
		apiospermum and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium intra-cranial abscesses
		in an immunocompromised patient was performed. A manual chart review assessing
		clinical and epidemiologic characteristics was completed including procedures and
		"operative notes, use of invasive devices, biochemical and haematological blood"
		"test results, antimicrobial agents received, and documentation of a travel"
		"history. RESULTS: Antimicrobial therapy combined with source control, typically"
		"surgical drainage, is considered the gold standard management of an intra-cranial"
		"abscess. Fungal abscesses produce rim-enhancing lesions, and where this"
		"radiographic feature is identified, evidence suggests that anti-fungal agents"
		"should be added. Antimicrobial therapy with linezolid and voriconazole failed,"
		and the patient died. There was extensive disease progression evident on serial
		imaging despite therapy. A definitive surgical drainage procedure could not be
		performed. CONCLUSIONS: Interval imaging assisted with the management of this
		challenging case. A low index of clinical suspicion for fungal intra-cerebral
		abscesses is necessary when treating immunosuppressed patients.

		"mm by 2.7 mm full-thickness stromal infiltrate, corresponding to the superior"

		residual deep scarring remained; the uncorrected distance visual acuity was 0.8
		"logMAR. To our knowledge, this is the first case of S apiospermum keratitis"

AB	-	Mycetoma is chronic granulomatous infection of skin and subcutaneous tissue
		caused by both bacteria and fungi. We report a case of mycetoma caused by
		Scedosporium apiospermum in the right foot of a 45-year-old farmer in north
		India. The patient had a history of trauma in the sole of the right foot followed
		by discharge of white granules along with proximal progression. Scedosporium
		apiospermum was identified based on colony characteristics and microscopic
		features on slide culture. Mycetoma is a progressive disease. Foot is commonly
		"affected in persons who walk barefoot, especially in south India. Untreated"
		mycetoma progress and involve the underlying fasciae and tissues along with bones
		often resulting in loss of limb. By prompt and reliable diagnosis with
		"corresponding antimicrobial administration, we can prevent further progression"
		and limb disability.

		case.
PG	-	321-3
AB	-	A forty-year-old man underwent an allogeneic BMT from his HLA identical sister.
		"GvHD prophylaxis was done with cyclosporine (CyA), methotrexate and prednisone"
		(PDN). On day +90 extensive GvHD was noted and higher doses of immunosuppressive
		drugs alternating CyA with PDN were initiated. Patient's follow-up was
		complicated by intermittent episodes of leukopenia and monthly episodes of
		"sinusitis or pneumonia. One year after BMT, the patient developed hoarseness and"
		nasal voice. No etiologic agent could be identified on a biopsy sample of the
		"vocal chord. Upon tapering the doses of immunosuppressive drugs, the patient had"
		worsening of chronic GvHD and was reintroduced on high doses of cyclosporine
		"alternating with prednisone on day +550. Three months later, GvHD remained out of"
		"control and the patient was started on azathioprine. On day +700, hoarseness and"
		nasal voice recurred. Another biopsy of the left vocal chord failed to
		demonstrate infection. Episodes of sinusitis became more frequent and
		"azathioprine was withheld 3 months after it was started. One month later, the"
		patient had bloody nasal discharge and surgical drainage of maxillary sinuses was
		performed. Histopathology showed hyphae and cultures grew Scedosporium
		apiospermum. Itraconazole 800 mg/day was initiated. The patient developed
		progressive respiratory failure and died 15 days later.

		Patient.
PG	-	906-909
LID	-	10.4103/0028-3886.293486 [doi]
AB	-	Scedosporium apiospermum is a filamentous fungus causing a broad spectrum of
		clinical diseases especially in those who are immunocompromised. The common sites
		"involved are lungs, skin, sinuses, eyes, bones, joints, and central nervous"
		system (CNS). CNS is involved in invasive Scedosporiosis in the form of a
		cerebral abscess. An antecedent event of either near-drowning or history of some
		trauma is present in the majority of the cases where the patients' immune
		response remains intact. Prognosis is generally poor since the majority of the
		patients have coexistent medical morbidity. Surgical drainage followed by
		"adjuvant antifungal, i.e., voriconazole therapy offers the best possible chance"
		for survival in these patients. This case report discusses a rare event of brain
		abscess caused by S. apiospermum in an immunocompetent patient without any
		preceding precipitating factor.

AB	-	CLINICAL CASE: A 51 year-old immunocompetent male was referred due to presenting
		with a large corneal ulcer with hypopyon in the right eye. Topical amphotericin
		"B, fluconazole and moxifloxacin, as well as oral itraconazole were initially"
		"indicated. Following the report of mycotic structures on staining, topical"
		"natamycin was started. The result of the culture was reported two weeks later as,"
		"Scedosporium apiospermum (S. apiospermum), and topical voriconazole was then"
		"added. The response to treatment was very slow, and took five weeks after"
		"receiving triple therapy (natamycin, voriconazole and fluconazole) and one dose"
		"of intrastromal voriconazole, for the hypopyon to disappear. The final outcome"
		"was successful, achieving healing of the ulcer. The patient is waiting for a"
		corneal transplant. DISCUSSION: A microbiological study is essential in patients
		in whom fungal keratitis is suspected. The treatment of choice against S.
		"apiospermum is with voriconazole, but the combination of various antifungal"
		agents may be required.

PG	-	2033-5
AB	-	"Scedosporium apiospermum, the asexual form of Pseudallescheria boydii, is a"
		ubiquitous fungus that represents an unfrequent complication of immune
		suppression. It accounts for 20% of all non-Aspergillus mold infections in organ
		transplant recipients. The infection can be localized or disseminated in multiple
		"organs, including lungs, brain, joints, tendons, and skin, and is difficult to"
		"treat, due to resistance of S apiospermum to amphotericin B and other antifungal"
		"agents. The mortality rate is about 50%. To our knowledge, there are no"
		prospective studies or registries of transplant recipients to guide diagnosis and
		there are no evidence-based recommendations for the optimal management of this
		infection. We report a case of S apiospermum infection in a woman with renal
		transplantation. The first occurrence of infection was a solitary nodule on the
		"forearm, which was surgically excised. Two following relapses were disseminated"
		"to the knee, the Achilles tendon, and the skin of the left leg. The infection was"
		"successfully treated with voriconazole, but due to the severe iatrogenic immune"
		"suppression, a strong reduction in immunosuppressant drugs was needed."

AB	-	Invasive fungal infections (IFI) are complications after liver transplantation
		"involving high morbidity and mortality. (1,3)-β-d-glucan (BG) is a biomarker for"
		"IFI, but its utility remains uncertain. This study was designed to evaluate the"
		"impact of BG following their diagnosis. Between January 2013 and May 2016, 271"
		liver transplants were performed in our institution. Serum samples were tested
		"for BG (Fungitell(®), Associates Cape Code Inc., Falmouth, MA, USA) at least"
		weekly between liver transplantation and the discharge of patients. Nineteen
		"patients (7%) were diagnosed with IFI, including 13 cases of invasive candidiasis"
		"(IC), eight cases of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, and one case of septic"
		arthritis due to Scedosporium apiospernum. Using a single BG sample for the
		"primary analysis of IFI, 95% (21/22) of the subjects had positive BG (>80 pg/mL)"
		at the time of IFI diagnosis. The area under the ROC curves to predict IFI was
		"0.78 (95% CI: 0.73-0.83). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value"
		"(PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of BG for IFI were 75% (95% CI: 65-83),"
		"65% (62-68), 17% (13-21), and 96% (94-97), respectively. Based on their high NPV,"
		the BG test appears to constitute a good biomarker to rule out a diagnosis of
		IFI.

		infections in a tertiary center. Medical records of 18 patients of culture-proven
		"CNS fungal infections were retrospectively reviewed from 2000 to 2007, including"
		12 isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and seven from tissue biopsy.
		Patient demographic data included 10 males and eight females. The mean age was 55
		years (range: 24-89 years). All but one patient were immunocompromised. Fungal
		"organisms isolated from CSF included: Cryptococcous neoformans (8 patients),"
		"Coccidioides immitis (3 patients), and Aspergillus versicolor (1 patient)."
		Histopathology of seven biopsy cases revealed groups of pigmented golden-brown
		"fungal forms in three cases; three cases showed septate fungi, two of which had"
		melanin in their walls; and one case showed multiple round spherules. These cases
		"on microbiological cultures grew Coccidioides immitis (1 patient), Aspergillus"
		"fumigatus (1 patient), Cladophialophora bantiana (2 patients), Fonsecaea"
		monophora (1 patient) and Scedosporium apiospermum (2 patients). Five of the
		seven fungal organisms isolated from tissue biopsies were dematiaceous fungi.
		"Twelve patients died after a period of a few weeks to months, two were lost to"
		"follow-up, and four are alive with severe neurological sequelae. CNS fungal"
		infections in our cohort were more common in patients post-transplant and with
		"hematologic malignancies. In our series, rare dematiaceous fungi are emerging"
		agents for cerebral mycosis. The outcome of CNS fungal infections is poor despite
		vigorous antifungal therapy.

AB	-	PURPOSE: To describe the clinical features and outcomes of patients with
		culture-proven Pseudallescheria endophthalmitis in the context of previously
		"published cases. METHODS: A multicenter, retrospective, consecutive case series"
		was undertaken. Pathology records were reviewed for all patients with
		Pseudallescheria endophthalmitis on vitreous/aqueous cultures from June 1998 to
		"June 2013 throughout Queensland, Australia. RESULTS: Three females and 1 male"
		"aged 60 to 78 years were identified. All patients had endogenous endophthalmitis,"
		"had an underlying malignancy, and were from South East Queensland. Vitreous"
		cultures identified Scedosporium auranticum in two cases and Scedosporium
		prolificans and Scedosporium apiospermum in one case each. All isolates were
		sensitive to voriconazole. Enucleation was required in two patients. Two patients
		had final best-corrected visual acuities of perception of light and no perception
		"of light, respectively. CONCLUSION: Endophthalmitis caused by species of the P."
		boydii complex is a devastating condition with poor visual outcomes. It is a
		condition that is difficult to treat because of its variable antifungal agent
		resistance.

PG	-	E330-2

AB	-	STUDY DESIGN: Case report and clinical discussion. OBJECTIVE: To describe a rare
		case of chronic spinal epidural abscess caused by Scedosporium prolificans in an
		immunocompetent patient. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: S. prolificans is an
		emerging multiresistant fungal pathogen that may cause a wide variety of
		"infections, whose severity depends of the patient's immune status. METHODS: A"
		35-year-old Brazilian man developed a 5-year chronic progressive paresis in lower
		limbs followed by sphincter dysfunction. Spinal magnetic resonance imaging
		revealed a thoracic-lumbar epidural mass that heterogeneously enhanced
		gadolinium. Spinal biopsy showed a chronic inflammatory process localized in
		epidural thoracic spine. S. prolificans was isolated in a specific culture.
		RESULTS: He was treated with endovenous voriconazole for 2 weeks followed by oral
		"voriconazole for 90 days. Three months later, a T9-T10 epidural mass was detected"
		"on a new magnetic resonance imaging. The abscess was drained, and the culture of"
		the material confirmed the persistence of infection by S. prolificans. A
		progressive paraparesis due to chronic meningo-myelitis was observed at a 6-month
		"follow-up. Although patient was treated with caspofungin, terbinafine, and"
		"voriconazole, no improvement was observed. CONCLUSION: S. prolificans can cause"
		chronic epidural abscess and spine infection in immunocompetent patients. The
		potential resistance of S. prolificans to antifungal agents should be borne in
		mind.

PG	-	1027-33
AB	-	We report on 17 Australian cases of human infection or colonization with
		Scedosporium inflatum. The spectrum of clinical manifestations was similar to
		that in infection caused by Scedosporium apiospermum. The patients were
		classified into three groups. Four immunocompetent patients who presented with
		"localized infections of a joint, nail bed, eye, or sphenoidal sinus made up the"
		"first group. Our first case, in a boy with posttraumatic septic arthritis,"
		responded to surgical drainage with amphotericin B followed by treatment with
		itraconazole. The other three cases were cured by surgery alone. The second group
		consisted of five immunocompromised patients who presented with disseminated
		infections in a variety of sites. Four of these patients did not respond to
		antifungal therapy and died. The fifth apparently responded to antifungal drugs
		after correction of his neutropenia. The third group included eight patients with
		asymptomatic colonization in the external ear (five cases) or respiratory
		secretions (three cases). The nine isolates of S. inflatum tested by both disk
		"and agar dilution methods were resistant to antifungal drugs. In our first case,"
		"which responded clinically to itraconazole, the MIC of this drug for the fungal"
		isolate was 25 micrograms/mL. Thus S. inflatum can cause a broad spectrum of
		human infections whose severity and prognosis depend largely on the host's immune
		status.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Mycotic ocular infections caused by the Scedosporium apiospermum
		species complex are challenging to treat because of the delayed diagnoses and
		poor responses to antifungal drugs and surgical treatment. CASE REPORT: A case of
		a 69-year-old male patient with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and prior
		surgery on the right femur is described. In the 10 days prior to the ophthalmic
		"consultation he started with ocular pain, adding to a previous and progressive"
		loss of visual acuity in his right eye. The diagnosis of endophthalmitis of
		"probable endogenous origin was established. Despite medical treatment, the"
		"patient's condition worsened and, due to the imminent risks, an enucleation was"
		"performed. Smears of the enucleation tissue revealed fungal cells, and the"
		"cultures yielded a fungus belonging to the S. apiospermum species complex, which"
		was identified as Scedosporium boydii by morphological characteristics and
		sequencing of a PCR amplicon. CONCLUSIONS: A diagnosis of endophthalmitis of
		probable endogenous origin in the right eye was based on a previous right femur
		surgery. Potential risk to the patient led to enucleation.

AB	-	"PURPOSE: To evaluate the prevalence, predisposing factors, and outcomes of"
		"bacterial and fungal scleritis. METHODS: We reviewed the clinical findings,"
		"therapeutic interventions, and visual outcomes of patients with suppurative"
		scleral inflammation without preceding microbial keratitis who had microorganisms
		isolated from scleral scrapings. DESIGN: Retrospective interventional case
		"series. RESULTS: Of 349 patients with scleritis diagnosed from 1999 to 2009, 6"
		adults (1.7%) presented with suppurative inflammation of the anterior sclera due
		"to Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2), Streptococcus pneumoniae (2), Staphylococcus"
		"aureus (1), and Scedosporium apiospermum/Pseudallescheria boydii (1). Each had"
		ocular surgery of the affected eye before presentation. Intraocular extension
		"occurred in 2 eyes. After local and systemic antimicrobial therapy, all improved"
		"without evisceration or enucleation, and 4 attained vision of 20/60 or better."
		CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial or fungal scleritis is an uncommon ocular infection that
		can belatedly follow anterior segment procedures. Antimicrobial therapy and
		surgical intervention can successfully control progressive suppuration and reduce
		vision-limiting complications.

PG	-	39-41
LID	-	10.1111/j.1600-0560.2008.01208.x [doi]
AB	-	We report a case of cutaneous Scedosporium apiospermum infection in an
		"immunocompromised host. S.apiospermum is an emerging opportunistic pathogen,"
		especially in organ transplant recipients. Prompt identification is critical
		because of its resistance to most antifungal drugs. Its histopathologic features
		are indistinct and overlap with those of more commonly recognized
		hyalohyphomycetes such as Aspergillus species. Cultures from infected tissue are
		generally required for correct identification. Clinicians and pathologists must
		be familiar with this organism and recognize the need for culture studies in
		addition to histopathology in the evaluation of specimens from immunocompromised
		patients with suspected fungal infection.

		Immunocompetent Battle Casualties.
PG	-	526-32
LID	-	10.1089/sur.2013.124 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive fungal infection (IFI) is described increasingly in
		individuals experiencing high-energy military trauma. Hallmarks of successful
		treatment involve aggressive surgical debridement and early initiation of
		"systemic antimicrobial therapy. Currently, intravenous anti-fungal therapy"
		commences based on appearance of wounds and patient's clinical course. Whereas
		some clinical protocols exist to predict which critically injured patients should
		"receive anti-fungal therapies, there are no established serum markers associated"
		with IFI. Our hypothesis is that serum inflammatory cytokines exist that can
		assist in identifying individuals at risk for IFI. METHODS: This is a
		retrospective case control study at a single institution. Nine patients with IFI
		"(Saksenaea vasiformis, Fusarium sp., Graphium sp., Scedosporium sp., Aspergillus"
		"sp., Mucor sp., and Alternaria sp.) after battlefield trauma were matched to nine"
		individuals with similar injury patterns whose laboratory results were negative
		for IFI. The combination of serum inflammatory cytokines from the first and
		second debridements was examined with multiplex platform proteomic analysis. We
		defined statistical significance as a two-tailed α<0.05 after adjusting for
		multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate method. This model was
		refined further with correlation-based filter selection and the area under the
		curve of the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) was tested. RESULTS: Both
		groups had similar Injury Severity Scores (ISS) (mean±standard deviation [SD])
		"(26.8±15.5 vs. 29.2±16.8, p=0.766). Elevated RANTES (regulated on activation,"
		"normal T cell expressed and secreted) alone (10,492.8±4,450.1 vs."
		"5,333.3±4,162.2, p=0.006) correlated with IFI. Also, the combination of"
		"persistent elevations in RANTES, interleukin (IL)-2R, and IL-15 was a robust"
		model for predicting IFI with the AUROC being 0.9. CONCLUSIONS: Elevation in
		"serum cytokines, particularly RANTES, correlated with IFI in this small group of"
		patients. This demonstrates the potential of future rapid serum testing for early
		initiation and guidance of anti-fungal therapies.

AB	-	We present a case of cerebral Scedosporium apiospermum infection presenting with
		intestinal manifestations in a 64-year-old male patient on immunosuppression for
		"orthotopic liver transplantation. At admission, the patient's chief complaint was"
		chronic watery diarrhea and he was found to have colonic ulcers on endoscopy. His
		hospital course was complicated by a tonic-clonic seizure caused by a left
		"frontal brain abscess, with the causative agent being identified by culture. He"
		"was treated with lobectomy, high-dose intravenous voriconazole, and liposomal"
		"amphotericin with clinical, endoscopic, and histologic improvement. To our"
		"knowledge, S. apiospermum has not been previously described as a cause of"
		colitis. The septate branching appearance of the Scedosporium species is similar
		to the more common Aspergillus species. This case of gastrointestinal
		Scedosporium brings into question previously reported cases of isolated
		gastrointestinal aspergillosis diagnosed by histopathology. Clinical suspicion
		for S. apiospermum must be maintained in immunosuppressed patients presenting
		with neurologic and gastrointestinal symptoms.

TI	-	Disseminated Scedosporium apiospermum infection in a cystic fibrosis patient
		after double-lung transplantation.
PG	-	603-7
AB	-	Scedosporium apiospermum is a saprophytic ubiquitous filamentous fungus. It can
		"cause a wide spectrum of diseases, from localized to invasive infections. S"
		apiospermum has been described as one of the major fungal agents of chronic
		colonization of airways in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Invasive infections due
		to S apiospermum are only rarely reported in CF after lung transplantation. A
		26-year-old woman with CF and chronic bronchial colonization by S apiospermum
		developed bilateral chorioretinitis and subcutaneous nodules 4 weeks after
		double-lung transplantation (LTx). Isolates of S apiospermum from sputum samples
		before and after LTx and from vitreal fluid were typed by random amplification of
		polymorphic DNA (RAPD). The patient was treated with voriconazole (VRC). The
		patient improved with VRC given orally for 6 months. Two days after VRC
		"discontinuation, she developed sub-acute meningitis (isolation of S apiospermum"
		"from the cerebrospinal fluid). She was again given VRC, but died 23 days later"
		from uncontrolled fungal infection. Molecular typing of clinical isolates of S
		apiospermum performed by RAPD demonstrated that all isolates belonged to the same
		"genotype. S apiospermum is a frequent, but late colonizing fungal agent in CF"
		"patients. In the case of LTx, these patients can develop invasive infection due"
		"to the colonizing strain, as confirmed by molecular typing."

AB	-	We report the case of a 53-year-old female patient with refractory acute myeloid
		"leukemia developing a necrotic, soft tissue abscess on the right forearm caused"
		by Scedosporium apiospermum during prolonged severe neutropenia (absolute white
		blood cell count <500/μL for 49 days). In the context of the severely
		immunocompromised state of the patient and her need for allogeneic hematopoietic
		"stem cell transplantation (HSCT), surgical treatment options were not favored."
		"Therefore, combined antifungal therapy with voriconazole and caspofungin was"
		"started, based on the results of the in vitro testing (minimum inhibitory"
		"concentrations of voriconazole, posaconazole, and amphotericin B: 1, 4, and"
		">2mg/L, respectively). The local site of infection slowly improved clinically and"
		"no spread of S. apiospermum infection to other sites was observed. After HSCT,"
		the soft tissue abscess resolved completely and the patient has remained free of
		S. apiospermum infection since then. We successfully demonstrate that the use of
		combined antifungal therapy with voriconazole and casopfungin may further improve
		the clinical course and provides a promising therapeutic option to treat
		Scedosporium infections in such patients.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Orbital apex syndrome is a localized type of orbital cellulitis,"
		where mass lesions occur at the apex of the cranial nerves. Although nasal septal
		"abscess is uncommon, the organism most likely to cause nasal septal abscess is"
		"Staphylococcus aureus, and fungal septal abscesses are rare. Here we present an"
		extremely rare and serious case of orbital apex syndrome secondary to fungal
		nasal septal abscess caused by Scedosporium apiospermum in a patient with
		uncontrolled diabetes. CASE PRESENTATION: A 59-year-old man with a 1-month
		history of headache underwent consultation in an otolaryngological clinic of a
		general hospital. He was diagnosed with nasal septal abscess and was treated with
		"incisional drainage and 1 month of an antibiotic drip; however, his symptoms"
		persisted. The patient later complained of diplopia due to bilateral abducens
		"nerve palsy, and was then referred to the department of Otolaryngology - Head and"
		"Neck Surgery, Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital. The septal lesion was"
		"biopsied under general anesthesia, and S. apiospermum was detected using"
		polymerase chain reaction. The patient was treated with an antifungal drug and
		"surgical resection of the lesion was performed. Although the patient survived, he"
		lost his eyesight. CONCLUSIONS: This patient represents the second reported case
		of nasal septal abscess and orbital apex syndrome caused by S. apiospermum. If
		"not treated properly, septal abscess can be life-threatening and cause severe"
		"complications, such as ablepsia."

TI	-	Fungal osteoarticular infections in patients treated at a comprehensive cancer
		centre: a 10-year retrospective review.
PG	-	621-6
AB	-	This study reviewed retrospectively the clinical characteristics of 28 cancer
		patients with fungal osteoarticular infections (FOAIs) between 1995 and 2005.
		Most patients (26; 93%) had haematological malignancies (19 had leukaemia); half
		(14) were allogeneic stem-cell transplant recipients. Twelve patients (43%) had
		severe neutropenia (< or = 100/mm3) with a mean duration of 65 days (range 10-500
		"days), and ten (36%) patients had received a significant dose of corticosteroids."
		"Most (19; 68%) FOAIs were caused by contiguous extension, while nine (32%) were"
		"associated with haematogenous spread. Pain, joint instability and local drainage"
		"were seen in 28 (100%), six (21%), and seven (25%) patients, respectively."
		Sixteen (57%) patients had symptoms for < 1 month. The sinuses (ten; 36%) and the
		vertebral spine (six; 21%) were the most common sites involved. Moulds were the
		predominant pathogens: Aspergillus fumigatus (two); non-fumigatus Aspergillus
		spp. (eight); non-specified Aspergillus spp. (three); Fusarium spp. (six);
		Zygomycetes (five); Scedosporium apiospermum (two); and Exserohilum sp. (one).
		Candida was the causative pathogen in four cases (including two cases of mixed
		"FOAIs). Arthritis and post-operative FOAIs were both uncommon manifestations,"
		occurring in two patients each. All patients received systemic antifungal therapy
		"(combinations in 20 cases), and 19 cases underwent adjunctive surgery. The crude"
		mortality rates (at 12 weeks) were 44% (9/20) in the patients who underwent
		surgery and antifungal therapy vs. 33% (2/6) in patients who received antifungal
		"therapy alone (p not significant). FOAI is a rare, yet severe, manifestation of"
		"localised or systemic mycoses, caused predominantly by moulds, and is seen"
		typically in patients with haematological malignancies.

PG	-	47-8
AB	-	This is the first documented case of post-traumatic Scedosporium inflatum
		endophthalmitis and only the second of S. inflatum endophthalmitis occurring in a
		"non-immunocompromised individual, to the authors' knowledge. A case is reported"
		"of a 57-year-old woman who, while chopping wood, had a wood chip hit her in the"
		right eye. This caused a penetrating corneal injury with uveal prolapse and
		damage to the crystalline lens. There were also vitreous and suprachoroidal
		haemorrhages. No detectable intraocular foreign material was retained. The
		"clinical manifestation of infection was delayed, but once established, it was"
		very destructive. The initially indolent endophthalmitis eventually led to loss
		of all light perception and panophthalmitis which required enucleation. The
		responsible strain of S. inflatum was found to be resistant to all antifungal
		medication in vitro.

LID	-	10.2147/OPTH.S25697 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: To describe the imaging appearance of Scedosporium apiospermum (S.
		apiosermum) endophthalmitis in an immunocompetent female who underwent high
		resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits and showed subchoroidal
		abscess on diffusion-weighted imaging. METHODS: WE HIGHLIGHT UTILITY OF MRI
		"SEQUENCES: diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), apparent diffusion coefficient"
		"(ADC), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and contrast-enhanced"
		magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) in the detection of a subchoroidal abscess
		and characterization of the inflammatory change of the uveal tract. Vitreous
		culture grew S. apiospermum. CONCLUSION: Fungal endophthalmitis is a rare but
		"aggressive process. Clinically, it can mimic other disease entities such as"
		"neoplasm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case that describes the"
		CT and MRI imaging findings of S. apiospermum endophthalmitis. We emphasize the
		use of DWI and ADC sequences in the detection of subchoroidal abscess.

AB	-	Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients may suffer increased morbidity and mortality
		"through colonisation, allergy and invasive infection from fungi. The black yeast,"
		Exophiala dermatitidis (synonym Wangiella dermatitidis) has been found with
		"increasing frequency in sputum specimens of CF patients, with reported isolation"
		"rates ranging from 1.1 to 15.7%. At present, no diagnostic PCR exists to aid with"
		the clinical laboratory detection and identification of this organism. A novel
		species-specific PCR-based assay was developed for the detection of E.
		"dermatitidis, based on employment of rDNA operons and interspacer (ITS) regions"
		"between these rDNA operons. Two novel primers, (designated ExdF & ExdR) were"
		designed in silico with the aid of computer-aided alignment software and with the
		"alignment of multiple species of Exophiala, as well as with other commonly"
		"described yeasts and filamentous fungi within CF sputum, including Candida,"
		"Aspergillus and Scedosporium. An amplicon of approximately 455 bp was generated,"
		spanning the partial ITS1 region - the complete 5.8S rDNA region - partial ITS2
		"region, employing ExdF (forward primer [16-mer], 5'-CCG CCT ATT CAG GTC C-3' and"
		"ExdR (reverse primer [16-mer], 5'-TCT CTC CCA CTC CCG C-3', was employed and"
		optimised on extracted genomic DNA from a well characterised culture of E.
		"dermatitidis, as well as with high quality genomic DNA template from a further 16"
		"unrelated fungi, including Candida albicans, C. dubliniensis, C. parapsilosis, C."
		"glabrata, Scedosporium apiospermum, Penicillium sp., Aspergillus fumigatus,"
		"Aspergillus versicolor, Pichia guilliermondii, Rhodotorula sp., Trichosporon sp.,"
		"Aureobasidium pullulans, Fusarium sp., Mucor hiemalis, Bionectria ochroleuca,"
		Gibberella pulicaris. Results demonstrated that only DNA from E. dermatitidis
		"gave an amplification product of the expected size, whilst none of the other"
		fungi were amplifiable. Subsequent employment of this primer pair detected this
		yeast from mycological cultures from 2/50 (4%) adult CF patients. These two
		patients were the only patients who were previously shown to have a cultural
		history of E. dermatitidis from their sputum. E. dermatitidis is a slow-growing
		"fungus, which usually takes up to two weeks to culture in the microbiology"
		"laboratory and therefore is slow to detect conventionally, with the risk of"
		bacterial overgrowth from common co-habiting pan- and multiresistant bacterial
		"pathogens from sputum, namely Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia"
		"complex organisms, hence this species-specific PCR assay may help detect this"
		"organism from CF sputum more specifically and rapidly. Overall, employment of"
		"this novel assay may help in the understanding of the occurrence, aetiology and"
		"epidemiology of E. dermatitidis, as an emerging fungal agent in patients with CF."

PG	-	484-9
AB	-	Cerebral mycosis is a significant cause of morbidity among immunocompromised
		populations. We present here a case of cerebral infection with Scedosporium
		apiospermum and Phaeoacremonium parasiticum in a 49-year-old renal transplant
		"recipient. Fourteen years after renal transplantation, the patient presented with"
		invasive pulmonary aspergillosis treated with intravenous liposomal amphotericin
		"B. The patient had clinical and radiographic improvement. However, 6 weeks later,"
		the patient presented with cerebral infection. Magnetic resonance imaging
		revealed multiple rim enhancing brain abscesses. Brain and cerebrospinal fluid
		cultures ultimately grew Scedosporium apiospermum and Phaeoacremonium
		parasiticum. The patient was treated with voriconazole for 6 months and had
		clinical and radiologic improvement. We believe this is the first reported case
		of co-infection of the brain with scedosporiosis and phaeohyphomycosis in a renal
		"transplant recipient, who had received intravenous liposomal amphotericin B."
		Voriconazole may represent a new therapeutic option for these simultaneous
		infections in the brain.

TI	-	Clinical utility of a panfungal polymerase chain reaction assay for invasive
		fungal diseases in patients with haematologic disorders.
PG	-	331-9
LID	-	10.1111/ejh.12078 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: Invasive fungal diseases (IFDs) are life-threatening events in
		"patients with haematologic disorders, and the spectrum of the aetiological"
		pathogens continues to expand. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical utility
		of a panfungal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the management of IFDs
		in such patients. METHODS: We prospectively analysed 273 consecutive blood
		samples from 64 risk episodes in 51 patients with haematologic disorders at high
		risk for IFD who were treated at our hospital between April 2007 and October
		2010. RESULTS: PCR-positive results were obtained in 18 of 64 risk episodes
		"(35.3%). IFD was documented in 14 episodes (21.9%, 9 probable IFDs and 5 possible"
		IFDs) according to the revised criteria of the European Organization for Research
		and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group. PCR was positive in all of these 14
		"episodes, and in 4 of the 50 episodes with no IFD category. Sensitivity,"
		"specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of our"
		"assay were 100%, 92%, 78% and 100% respectively. A considerable number of fungi"
		(44.4%) that are less common than Aspergillus and Candida species were positive
		"by PCR. Molecular diagnoses of Cunninghamella species, Aspergillus ustus,"
		"Fusarium species, Scedosporium apiospermum, Rhodotorula species and Rhizopus"
		species were beneficial in selecting suitable treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Our
		panfungal PCR approach allows for the highly sensitive and specific detection and
		"identification of a wide spectrum of fungal pathogens, which provides"
		"indispensable information for managing IFDs, especially refractory or"
		breakthrough IFDs during antifungal therapy in high-risk patients with
		haematologic disorders.

AB	-	Scedosporium prolificans has been increasingly recognized as an etiological agent
		of disseminated mycelial infections in profoundly immunocompromised patients.
		Reported herein is a case of disseminated S. prolificans infection in a patient
		undergoing anti-neoplastic chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia. Antemortem
		"blood culture yielded S. prolificans, which was confirmed on conventional"
		morphological examination and polymerase chain reaction-based DNA sequencing
		targeting internally transcribed spacer regions. Histopathology of autopsy
		"specimens indicated fungal infection in the heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, spleen,"
		"pancreas and gastrointestinal tract, with the development of hemorrhagic and"
		ischemic necrosis. The infecting fungus had developing septate hyphae and was
		"identified as belonging to the genus Scedosporium, on in situ hybridization of"
		tissue. The combination of haphazardly branching hyphae and lemon-shaped conidia
		appeared to be the most useful distinguishing features to allow differentiation
		of this fungus from other filamentous fungi in tissue. Three other unique
		histopathological characteristics of the fungus were noted: (i) parallel hyphae
		bridged at right angles to produce letter-H patterns; (ii) intravascular
		"conidiation; and (iii) purple conidia in tissue, though these are usually"
		"described as brown in most text books. Precise histopathology, in addition to"
		"other techniques such as in situ hybridization, can aid in the identification of"
		etiological fungi.

TI	-	Scedosporium apiospermum (Pseudallescheria boydii) infection in a heart
		transplant recipient: a case of mistaken identity.
PG	-	321-4
AB	-	We report a case of fatal central nervous system infection with Scedosporium
		apiospermum (Pseudallescheria boydii) in a heart transplant recipient. This
		ubiquitous fungus is known to cause mycetoma and localized infections in patients
		with otherwise normal conditions. Disseminated infections occur rarely and are
		seen primarily in patients who are receiving immunosuppressive medications or who
		have neutropenia. Often life-threatening when infection is disseminated and
		"involves the central nervous system, this diagnosis is difficult to make rapidly"
		"because S. apiospermum (P. boydii) mimics Aspergillus spp. and Fusarium spp.,"
		"both clinically and histopathologically. Imidazoles such as miconazole, but not"
		"amphotericin B, are considered the therapeutic compounds of choice. Improved"
		diagnostic and treatment options are needed to optimize management of infections
		with S. apiospermum (P. boydii).

AB	-	"In this paper, we report a case of a post-traumatic Scedosporium endophthalmitis"
		"treated with a posterior vitrectomy, followed by intravitreal injections and"
		systemic voriconazole. This is the second documented case of S. apiospermum
		endophthalmitis treated with voriconazole and the first case with intravitreal
		injections of voriconazole. A 29-year-old man developed endophthalmitis after
		being struck in the left eye by a chip from a swimming pool pump. Despite 3 weeks
		"of prophylactic antibiotherapy, his visual acuity remained only for the"
		perception of light and vitreous inflammation increased. A creamy-white fungal
		mass grew at the inferior peripheral retina and pars plana. The fungus was
		"identified as S. apiospermum. Oral voriconazole, at 200 mg twice-daily, did not"
		"bring the infection under control, considering the low plasma and intravitreal"
		concentrations. Before steady-state plasma voriconazole concentrations reached an
		"efficacy level greater than minimum inhibitory concentration of Scedosporium,"
		intravitreal injections of 64 ug/0.1 mL of voriconazole were initiated
		twice-weekly for 3 weeks. Administration of higher intravenous voriconazole doses
		(6 mg/kg b.i.d.) for 6 weeks was needed to achieve an antifungal effect without
		systemic dissemination.

AB	-	Scedosporium apiospermum is the asexual form of a rare fungus Pseudallescheria
		"boydii that is usually present in the soil, sewage and dirty water. In"
		"immunocompromised patients, it is a rare infection involving multiple organs. We"
		present a case of renal allograft recipient who developed fever two weeks post
		"renal transplant. He was initially found to have dengue fever. After five days,"
		he became drowsy and developed right-sided hemiparesis. Magnetic resonance
		imaging of the brain revealed multiple irregular masses with associated edema
		consistent with fungal brain abscesses. Left parietal abscess was drained and he
		was started on voriconazole. His cyclosporine was stopped. Drained pus revealed
		fungal hyphae on potassium hydroxide stain and Scedosporium apiospermum on
		"culture. Unfortunately, the patient died after five days. Scedosporium infections"
		should be kept as a possibility in transplant recipients with disseminated
		"infections, especially with a brain abscess. Despite antifungal therapy and"
		"surgical drainage, mortality rates are high."

PG	-	605-10
LID	-	10.1089/sur.2006.038 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Bacterial infections are a well-known complication of traumatic
		amputations. In cases involving contact with soil or water contaminated with
		"manure, one also must be aware of infections with fungi, particularly"
		Scedosporium spp. We report on an immunocompetent trauma patient with an
		"infection caused by a recently described Scedosporium species, S. aurantiacum."
		METHODS: Case report and literature review. RESULTS: In a 36-year-old healthy
		"man, entrapment of the right leg resulted in a traumatic amputation just below"
		the knee and contamination of the wound with manure. Six weeks after the initial
		"surgical debridement, he developed a phlegmon. Cultures yielded Staphylococcus"
		"aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and treatment with ciprofloxacin and"
		"clindamycin was started. After several weeks, a fistula developed, and"
		roentgenograms demonstrated osteomyelitis. A pure culture of Scedosporium was
		grown from bone fragments and was identified as S. aurantiacum by sequencing of
		"the rDNA internal transcribed spacer 1 region. Following debridement, the wound"
		was drenched in 0.2% polyhexamethylene biguanide for four minutes. A
		"pre-operative culture showed growth of S. aureus only. Postoperatively,"
		"clindamycin, ciprofloxacin, and voriconazole were started and continued for 12"
		"weeks. At the last follow-up, 15 months after the trauma and nine months after"
		"cessation of the antimicrobial agents, the patient had no signs of osteomyelitis."
		"CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first case of osteomyelitis caused by"
		S. aurantiacum. The patient was treated successfully by a combination of surgery
		and voriconazole.

LID	-	10.1136/bcr-2019-233470 [doi]
LID	-	e233470
AB	-	Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common life-limiting autosomal recessive genetic
		disorder among Caucasian populations. The majority of CF cases are diagnosed in
		"childhood; however, increasing numbers of adults are being diagnosed with the"
		condition. We present the case of a 65-year-old Irish woman presenting with a
		chronic cough and a history of recurrent respiratory tract infections.
		"Staphylococcus aureus, Scedosporium apiospermum and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia"
		were grown from bronchoalveolar lavage raising suspicion for CF. Sweat testing
		"was negative; however, genetic testing revealed the presence of ∆F508 and R117H"
		"CF mutations, the latter mutation conferring a milder form of CF. The patient"
		commenced treatment with the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
		(CFTR) potentiator medication ivacaftor to good effect. Novel CFTR potentiators
		and modulators have significant potential to benefit morbidity and mortality in
		"this group. In this case, the microbiological results were key in pursuing"
		genetic testing and diagnosing CF.

TI	-	Severe keratomycosis secondary to Scedosporium apiospermum.
PG	-	516-8
AB	-	PURPOSE: To report an unusual case of severe keratomycosis caused by Scedosporium
		"apiospermum without any known previous ocular injury, that resulted in a corneal"
		"perforation, which was treated with an emergency penetrating tectonic"
		keratoplasty and later with phacoemulsification and astigmatic keratotomy to
		restore good visual function. METHODS: A 45-year-old woman with a history of
		multiple sclerosis presented with a severe and refractory corneal abscess in her
		right eye without any known prior injury. Corneal scrapings were obtained and
		stained for microscopic evaluation. The samples were sent for aerobic and
		anaerobic bacterial and fungal cultures. RESULTS: Microbiologic examination of
		the corneal scraping showed Scedosporium apiospermum micelle. The fungal culture
		"was sensitive to miconazole, itraconazole and voriconazole. Partial clinical"
		"improvement was achieved with hourly topical natamycin, amphotericin B, and"
		"systemic itraconazole application, although in vitro sensitivity tests showed"
		resistance to the topical antifungal agents used. A corneal paracentral
		perforation occurred despite aggressive treatment. An emergency eccentric
		penetrating keratoplasty was performed with satisfactory results. Subsequent
		phacoemulsification and astigmatic keratotomy restored a good visual function.
		CONCLUSION: A fungal etiology should be suspected in a progressive and refractory
		corneal abscess. This report highlights the utility of microbiologic
		investigation to perform an early and accurate diagnosis. Aggressive medical
		treatment and even therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty to remove infected tissue
		could result in the maintenance of useful visual function. In view of the poor
		"prognosis of this specific fungus, a closer observation and early keratoplasty"
		might be required to preserve the ocular globe.

TI	-	Topical and oral voriconazole in the treatment of fungal keratitis.
PG	-	151-3
AB	-	PURPOSE: To describe nine patients with fungal keratitis refractory to standard
		antifungal therapy whose condition was managed with voriconazole. DESIGN:
		Retrospective case series. METHODS: Chart review of patients with fungal
		keratitis who were treated with topical and oral voriconazole. RESULTS: Nine
		patients were treated. Two patients were contact lens wearers who used
		multipurpose cleaning solutions. Corneal isolates found were Fusarium (three
		"patients), Candida albicans (three patients), Alternaria (one patient),"
		"Scopulariopsis (one patient), and Scedosporium apiospermum (one patient). Nine"
		"patients were treated with topical voriconazole, and eight patients were treated"
		with oral voriconazole. Patients were treated topically for four to 16 weeks
		"(mean, 10 weeks) and orally for five to 17 weeks (mean, 10 weeks). One patient"
		was lost to follow-up. Two patients discontinued the topical voriconazole after
		"one day and four weeks, respectively, because of ocular burning. Of the seven"
		"patients who were treated with topical therapy and followed, five conditions"
		"healed. CONCLUSION: Voriconazole is a new, promising therapy for fungal keratitis"
		that is refractory to standard antifungal treatments.

TI	-	Pathology of hyalohyphomycosis caused by Scedosporium apiospermum
		(Pseudallescheria boydii): an emerging mycosis.
PG	-	1266-72
AB	-	The genus Scedosporium contains two medically significant species of emerging
		"mycotic agents, S. apiospermum and S. prolificans, which have received scant"
		"attention. Scedosporium apiospermum is the anamorph, or asexual state, of the"
		"cosmopolitan fungus Pseudallescheria boydii, with both sharing the same risk"
		"factors for infection, clinical spectrum, and histopathologic features."
		"Scedosporium prolificans is a recently recognized agent of bone, soft tissue, and"
		joint infections that occurs with highest frequency in children and young adults.
		S. prolificans may also cause potentially fatal disseminated infections in
		immunocompromised persons. The drug sensitivities of both Scedosporium species
		"are significantly different from those of most other fungi, and thus"
		"identification of these organisms is important. Unfortunately, the pathological"
		features of Scedosporium infections may be easily confused with other mycotic
		"agents, resulting in delayed or inappropriate medical therapy. Because many"
		pathologists and clinicians are unfamiliar with the significance of Scedosporium
		"spp. infection, this communication describes three persons with differing"
		clinical and pathological presentations of S. apiospermum infection. In one
		"patient with sickle cell disease and chronic mycotic sinusitis, fungal colonies"
		of S. apiospermum removed from the sinuses showed a pattern of alternating zones
		"of mycelial hypercellularity and hypocellularity associated with conidiation,"
		similar to a previous report of P. boydii infection. The clinicopathologic
		"features of an immunocompetent person with S. apiospermum osteomyelitis, and a"
		patient with S. apiospermum infection of the brain after bone marrow
		"transplantation, are also described."

TI	-	The importance of a proper aetiological diagnosis in the management of patients
		with invasive mycoses: a case report of a brain abscess by Scedosporium
		apiospermum.
PG	-	317-22
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-011-9436-4 [doi]
AB	-	Scedosporium apiospermum is a saprobic fungus responsible for many different
		"clinical manifestations. Although it affects mostly immunocompromised patients,"
		pulmonary and disseminated scedosporiosis have also been reported in
		"immunocompetent subjects. It often causes subcutaneous mycetoma, despite its"
		preferential tropism to CNS. The authors describe a fatal case of a S.
		apiospermum brain abscess in a 58-year-old female. She was affected by chronic
		liver disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and had been treated with
		"corticosteroid therapy for a long time. She recovered in a neurosurgery unit,"
		wherein TC scan and cerebral MRI revealed an expansive left temporo-parietal
		process with vasogenic oedema. A stereotactic puncture of the lesion was carried
		"out, and pus of brain abscess was evacuated. Empirical antifungal therapy was"
		initiated with liposomal amphotericine B based on the clinical suspicion of
		"Zygomycetes infection; after 3 days, posaconazole was added. The correct"
		aetiological diagnosis arrived too late and the patient was treated with no
		specific therapy. This fatal case confirms the necessity of having a fast and
		correct aetiological diagnosis to improve the patient's outcome.

		course of active invasive fungal infections. The aim of this study was to assess
		the role of positron emission tomography with [¹⁸F]FDG ([¹⁸F]FDG-PET) in the
		diagnosis and staging of IFI. A prospective monocentric study evaluating
		[¹⁸F]FDG-PET in 30 consecutive adults and children with European Organization for
		Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group probable or proven IFI was
		"performed. Twenty males and ten females (median age, 45 years (range 6-7 years))"
		"were enrolled. Twenty-six were immunocompromised, as follows: haematological"
		"malignancy (18) with allogeneic stem cell transplantation (16/18), solid tumour"
		"(three), solid organ transplantation (two), diabetes mellitus (two) and cystic"
		"fibrosis (one). IFIs were acute invasive aspergillosis (ten), chronic"
		"disseminated candidiasis (ten), zygomycosis (two), black grains eumycetoma (two),"
		"pulmonary Histoplasma capsulatum var. capsulatum histoplasmosis (two), and"
		"Phomopsis sp. osteoarthritis, Scedosporium apiospermum and Candida krusei"
		"spondylodiscitis, and acute pulmonary coccidioidomycosis in one case each. An"
		increased uptake of [¹⁸F]FDG was observed in all areas previously identified by
		computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging to be involved by IFI. In
		"4/10 chronic disseminated candidiasis cases, [¹⁸F]FDG-PET revealed small splenic"
		abscesses that were unapparent on the corresponding computed tomography scan.
		[¹⁸F]FDG uptake disappeared after 6 months of antifungal therapy in three
		patients with chronic disseminated candidiasis for whom the [¹⁸F]FDG-PET was
		performed to assess the evolution of the disease. [¹⁸F]FDG-PET could potentially
		be useful for the initial diagnosis and staging of IFI. Whether or not
		[¹⁸F]FDG-PET might be useful for assessing the optimal duration of IFI therapy
		should now be assessed in a specific prospective study.

		"infections in immunocompromised hosts. Here, we present the case of a 28-year-old"
		female with S. apiospermum infection on the left forearm that had developed while
		she was on long-term immunosuppressant therapy. Analysis of a skin biopsy
		specimen showed a mixed cell granuloma with hyaline septate hyphae. Culture of
		the abscess revealed S. apiospermum which was identified as S. apiospermum sensu
		stricto by sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer-1 region of ribosomal
		DNA genes. Resection of the eruption and oral itraconazole (100 mg day(-1))
		therapy for 4 months was effective in curing the infection.

TI	-	Absence of intraocular infections after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
		at a single center: the experience with current preventive regimens.
PG	-	116-20
LID	-	10.3109/09273948.2013.827216 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: To investigate the prevalence of intraocular infections after allogeneic
		stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). METHODS: The study design was a single
		institutional retrospective noncomparative cohort of 135 consecutive patients in
		2006 and 2007 who underwent allo-SCT for hematological malignancy. The primary
		outcome was the development of intraocular infections after allo-SCT and
		secondary outcome consisted of development of other ocular disorders during
		follow-up. RESULTS: The most frequent ocular sequel to allo-SCT included ocular
		"graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), which developed in 37/135 patients (27%)."
		Intraocular infection occurred in 1 of 135 patients (0.7%). This patient
		"developed infectious chorioretinitis together with osteomyelitis, endocarditis,"
		and brain abscess with fungus Scedosporium and was successfully treated with a
		"combination of voriconazole, amphotericine B, and surgical interventions. Viral"
		and/or bacterial intraocular infections were not observed at all. CONCLUSIONS:
		Intraocular infections after allo-SCT are currently uncommon due to systematic
		"use of preemptive treatment regimens, frequent controls, and early treatment of"
		systemic infections.

LID	-	e16063
AB	-	RATIONALE: Scedosporium species is rare pathogen of ocular infection. The
		accurate diagnosis is delaying in many cases and the clinical prognosis is poor
		due to its resistance to antifungal agents. This report describes a patient with
		infectious scleritis and corneal ulcer caused by Scedosporium auranticum
		infection who required enucleation to control the infection. PATIENT CONCERNS: A
		70-year-old woman visited our clinic after experiencing ocular discomfort in her
		"right eye for 4 days after minor ocular trauma, with soil exposure. DIAGNOSES:"
		"Scedosporium species was isolated from a culture of corneal tissue, Scedosporium"
		aurantiacum was identified in a culture of necrotic tissue. INTERVENTIONS: She
		"was started on treatment with antifungal agents, including topical amphotericin B"
		"and systemic fluconazole, but her ocular condition did not improve. Although the"
		"lesion showed temporary improvement, ocular pain and corneal ulcer recurred 3"
		"months later. Evisceration was performed due to corneal perforation, and"
		enucleation was also performed for dehiscence of the conjunctiva and scleral
		"necrosis. OUTCOMES: After enucleation, postoperative systemic voriconazole"
		treatment controlled the infection without recurrence. LESSONS: S aurantiacum
		"keratitis is difficult to eradicate, even with several months of treatment with"
		"systemic and topical antifungal agents, and tends to progress to scleritis. The"
		infection can be terminated by the orbital enucleation. Infection with this rare
		organism should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients with severe
		infectious keratitis.

AB	-	Disseminated Scedosporium prolificans infection occurs mainly in
		"immunocompromised patients. The mortality rate is high, as the fungus is"
		"resistant to most antifungal agents. Here, we present the case of a 66-year-old"
		female with acute myeloid leukemia who developed infective endocarditis caused by
		"S. prolificans infection during induction chemotherapy. Her 1,3-β-D-glucan levels"
		were elevated and computed tomography revealed bilateral sinusitis and
		disseminated small nodular masses within the lungs and spleen; it nonetheless
		took 6 days to identify S. prolificans by blood culture. The patient died of
		multi-organ failure despite the combined use of voriconazole and terbinafine.
		Autopsy revealed numerous mycotic emboli within multiple organs (caused by mitral
		valve vegetation) and endocarditis (caused by S. prolificans). The geographic
		"distribution of this infection is limited to Australia, the United States, and"
		"southern Europe, particularly Spain. The first Japanese case was reported in"
		"2011, and four cases have been reported to date, including this one. Recently,"
		the incidence of S. prolificans-disseminated infection in immunocompromised
		"patients has increased in Japan. Therefore, clinicians should consider S."
		prolificans infection as a differential diagnosis when immunocompromised patients
		"suffer disseminated infections with elevated 1,3-β-D-glucan levels."

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To report successful management of Scedosporium apiospermum
		(previously known as Monosporium apiospermum) keratitis with topical voriconazole
		as monotherapy. CASE SUMMARY: A 54-year-old previously well woman presented to
		"the emergency department with a painful, injected right eye. There was no history"
		"of trauma or use of contact lenses. On examination, the right eye was estimated"
		to have visual acuity of hand movement. Slit lamp examination detected a 2.5 x
		"3.5 mm dense, central corneal infiltrate with overlying epithelial defect. The"
		eye had mild corneal edema with anterior chamber inflammation. Microbiology
		testing revealed S. apiospermum as the primary pathogen. Hourly administration of
		"topical natamycin 5% resulted in initial improvement in visual acuity to 20/50,"
		"with reduction in the size of the central infiltrate. However, 1 month later, the"
		"eye infection relapsed, with recurrence of epithelial defect (3.1 x 3.1 mm) and"
		decline in visual acuity to 20/100. Antifungal therapy was switched to topical
		"voriconazole 1%, administered every 2 hours. Vision improved to 20/30 within 5"
		"days, and the central defect had completely re-epithelialized within 1 week."
		DISCUSSION: Treatment of S. apiospermum keratitis remains inadequate. A high
		natamycin minimum inhibitory concentration is necessary to treat S. apiospermum
		"infection, which may explain the persistence of central infiltration despite"
		ongoing therapy. The combined use of topical and oral voriconazole for the
		"treatment of S. apiospermum keratitis has been reported. However, this is the"
		first report of a successful clinical experience using topical voriconazole
		without oral therapy to manage S. apiospermum keratitis. This eliminates some
		"disadvantages associated with oral voriconazole such as high cost, potential"
		"significant toxicity, and drug interactions. CONCLUSIONS: The voriconazole 1% eye"
		"drop used alone is a promising, cost-effective, safe option for managing fungal"
		"keratitis, even that caused by S. apiospermum. It may have a larger role to play"
		than simply that of adjunctive therapy.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Disseminated fungal infections are a known serious complication in
		individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) following orthotopic lung transplantation.
		Aspergillus fumigatus and Scedosporium species are among the more common causes
		"of invasive fungal infection in this population. However, it is also important"
		for clinicians to be aware of other emerging fungal species which may require
		markedly different antifungal therapies. CASE SUMMARY: We describe the first
		laboratory-documented case of a fatal disseminated fungal infection caused by
		Rasamsonia aegroticola in a 21-year-old female CF patient status post-bilateral
		"lung transplantation, which was only identified post-mortem. Molecular analysis"
		revealed the presence of the identical Rasamsonia strains in the patient's
		respiratory cultures preceding transplantation. DISCUSSION: We propose that the
		patient's disseminated fungal disease and death occurred as a result of
		recrudescence of Rasamsonia infection from her native respiratory system in the
		setting of profound immunosuppression post-operatively. Since Rasamsonia species
		"have been increasingly recovered from the respiratory tract of CF patients, we"
		further review the literature on these fungi and discuss their association with
		invasive fungal infections in the CF lung transplant host. CONCLUSION: Our report
		suggests Rasamsonia species may be important fungal pathogens that may have fatal
		consequences in immunosuppressed CF patients after solid organ transplantation.

AB	-	Aspergillosis is a commonly diagnosed fungal infection. Histopathologic
		examination alone can have diagnostic pitfalls due to the overlapping of fungal
		morphology. We report a case of Scedosporium boydii infection initially
		misdiagnosed as aspergillosis. The patient presented to the hospital with
		shortness of breath and chest and abdominal pain. Laboratory tests revealed
		"leukocytosis and elevated serum liver enzymes, myoglobin and lipase. He died of"
		hypotensive shock and brain abscesses despite antibiotic treatment. Autopsy
		"revealed invasive fungal infection in the heart, thyroid, and brain with presence"
		"of 45-degree angled, branching hyphae. The initial diagnosis of aspergillosis was"
		"made; however, further molecular studies identified the organism as S. boydii."
		This report reveals the potential pitfalls of morphologic diagnosis alone; and
		the necessity of other testing modalities to render an accurate diagnosis which
		is crucial for appropriate.

AB	-	A 51-year-old male was admitted in our institute following an episode of
		near-drowning. He later developed ventriculitis and cerebral ring-enhancing
		lesions. He died following a subarachnoid hemorrhage due to rupture of a mycotic
		aneurysm involving the right fetal posterior cerebral artery. Scedosporium
		apiospermum was isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid. Central nervous system
		"invasion by S apiospermum may present insidiously in near-drowning patients and,"
		"therefore, requires a high index of suspicion. In cases with the characteristic"
		"cerebral ring-enhancing lesions and concomitant ventriculitis, treatment should"
		be instituted while awaiting fungal culture. With this article we intend to alert
		"neurologists, intensivists, and physicians to this near fatal infection, as early"
		identification and prompt treatment with voriconazole may be life saving.

AB	-	This report describes a 77-year-old man with cutaneous mycosis caused by
		Scedosporium dehoogii while taking oral betamethasone and tacrolimus for the
		"treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. At examination in our clinic, the patient had"
		"multiple cystic lesions and nodules with slight tenderness, varying in size up to"
		"4 cm, on his left knee and shin. He had not noticed any traumatic injury at the"
		"site of the lesions. Fungal cultures of samples taken from the abscesses, scales,"
		"and crusts of the lesions yielded white, later grayish brown, fluffy surfaced"
		colonies. Partial sequencing of the β-tubulin gene confirmed the species of the
		isolate. The patient was initially treated with oral voriconazole and local
		"hyperthermia, but experienced hepatic injury 2 weeks later. His treatment was"
		"changed to itraconazole (ITC) and local hyperthermia, followed by a combination"
		of ITC and terbinafine. The patient recovered completely during the 12-month
		course of treatment.

PG	-	81-3
AB	-	CASE HISTORY: A 2-year-old female Siberian Husky was presented with a 6-month
		history of sneezing and mucous discharge from the right nostril. CLINICAL
		FINDINGS: Reduced airflow through the right nostril was evident. Radiographs
		showed subtle loss of detail of turbinates within the right nasal chamber.
		Rhinoscopy revealed swollen and erythematous turbinates and a white mass within
		"the caudal aspect of the right nasal cavity. Histopathologically, there was a"
		"heavy mixed inflammatory infiltrate in the submuscosa of the right turbinate, and"
		the presence of fungal hyphae and spores in the white mass. A heavy growth of
		Scedosporium apiospermum was cultured from the mass. DIAGNOSIS: Chronic rhinitis
		of the right nasal cavity and infection with S. apiospermum. CLINICAL RELEVANCE:
		This is the first reported case of S. apiospermum isolated from the nasal cavity
		of a dog in New Zealand. Fungal culture is necessary to differentiate this fungus
		from Aspergillus spp.

PG	-	92-5
LID	-	10.1080/00480169.2011.552859 [doi]
AB	-	CASE HISTORY: A sub-adult female olive ridley sea turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea)
		"was found floating off the coast of Gran Canaria, Canary Islands, Spain. CLINICAL"
		"AND PATHOLOGICAL FINDINGS: The turtle was lethargic and weak, and died one day"
		after it was found. Necropsy was performed and selected samples of lung and liver
		were routinely processed for histopathological and immunohistological studies.
		"Grossly, round, ulcerative lesions were observed on the rear flippers. The liver,"
		"spleen, coelomic wall, gastric serosa, lungs and urinary bladder were covered by"
		"various amounts of fibrin and small granulomas. Histopathologically, a severe"
		"fibrinous and granulomatous polyserositis (liver, spleen, stomach, urinary"
		"bladder, coelomic wall), severe fibrinous pleuritis and severe multifocal"
		granulomatous pneumonia were diagnosed. Numerous fungal hyphae were observed
		associated with the lesions. Specific monoclonal and heterologously absorbed
		polyclonal antibodies served as the primary reagents for identification of
		"aspergillosis, candidiasis, fusariosis, geotricosis, dermatophytosis,"
		"scedosporiosis, and zygomycosis. All hyphae were identified as Trichophyton spp.,"
		because a strong and uniform reactivity was obtained only with an heterologously
		absorbed polyclonal antibody raised against somatic antigens of Trichophyton spp.
		DIAGNOSIS: Systemic mycosis caused by Trichophyton spp. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: There
		are no known previous reports of Trichophyton spp. causing skin disease or
		systemic mycotic infection in sea turtles. The usefulness of immunohistochemistry
		for identifying fungi in sea turtles is reinforced.

		aspergillosis increased in allograft recipients and remained high through the
		"1990s. Infections with non-fumigatus Aspergillus species, Fusarium species, and"
		"Zygomycetes increased during the late 1990s, especially in patients who received"
		multiple transplants. Although infection caused by Scedosporium species was
		"common in patients who had neutropenia, infection caused by Zygomycetes typically"
		"occurred later after transplantation, when patients had graft-versus-host"
		disease. The overall 1-year survival rate was equally poor (similar20%) for all
		patients with mould infections. The results of the present study demonstrate the
		"changing epidemiology of mould infections, emphasizing the increasing importance"
		of amphotericin B--resistant organisms and the differences in risks and outcome
		of infection with different filamentous fungi.

PG	-	370-3
AB	-	PURPOSE: To report a case of bilateral endogenous fungal endophthalmitis
		resulting from disseminated Scedosporium prolificans. DESIGN: Observational case
		report. METHODS: A 56-year-old woman with cystic fibrosis status post dual lung
		transplantation on chronic immunosuppressive therapy presented with acute graft
		rejection. Cultures of bronchial brushings revealed S. prolificans. Three weeks
		"after admission, the patient noted increased blurriness and a central scotoma in"
		her right eye. Dilated fundus examination revealed profound vitritis in the right
		"eye with hemorrhagic retinitis involving the macula. A peripheral, yellow"
		choroidal infiltrate with overlying retinitis and localized vitritis was present
		"in the left eye. RESULTS: Intravitreal antibiotics were initiated, and vitreous"
		cultures revealed S. prolificans. The patient ultimately succumbed to her
		disseminated disease. Pathologic examination of the eyes confirmed bilateral
		endogenous fungal endophthalmitis. CONCLUSION: S. prolificans is an opportunistic
		infection resistant to standard antifungal therapy that can result in endogenous
		endophthalmitis in immunocompromised individuals.

AB	-	Abstract This is a case of Scedosporium apiospermum skeletal infection in a
		10-year-old immunocompetent girl whose chief complaint was left knee swelling and
		pain. The child had a history of a bicycle accident two months before with a
		resultant deep penetrating trauma. Systematic administration of broad-spectrum
		"antibiotics for 10 days was used, with no clinical improvement. Magnetic"
		Resonance Imaging and arthrotomy of the affected joint revealed findings
		suggestive of osteomyelitis. Empirical intravenous antimicrobial therapy was
		instituted for a total of two months but one month after completion of
		antibacterial therapy the child returned to the hospital because of persistent
		"knee swelling and pain. Following a new arthrotomy, Scedosporium apiospermum was"
		isolated. The patient was cured with intravenous administration of voriconazole
		without any side effects and has no evidence of relapse after four years of
		follow-up.

PG	-	327-33
LID	-	10.1111/1469-0691.12323 [doi]
AB	-	Aspergillus terreus is a common soil saprophyte. After Aspergillus fumigatus and
		Scedosporium apiospermum it ranks third amongst the filamentous fungi colonizing
		"the airways of patients with cystic fibrosis. In this context, the clinical"
		presentation of A. terreus infection mainly corresponds to allergic
		"broncho-pulmonary aspergillosis. In the work presented here, we studied"
		colonization patterns of A. terreus in CF patients by genotyping using nine short
		tandem repeat markers. A total of 115 clinical isolates from respiratory
		secretions collected from five French CF patients were studied. The number of
		"isolates varied from 15 to 39 per patient, and the duration of the follow-up"
		"period ranged from 2 months to 7.5 years. Seventeen genotypes were identified,"
		corresponding to three distinct colonization patterns. The first colonization
		pattern consisted of a chronic colonization by one dominant genotype associated
		with few other genotypes found only incidentally. The second colonization pattern
		consisted of a prolonged colonization by two distinct genotypes detected
		simultaneously. The last pattern was characterized by multiple different
		genotypes that were present only transiently. These results demonstrate the
		importance of genotyping clinical isolates before making conclusions about
		chronic colonization of the airways in CF patients in the case of repeated
		isolation of the fungus.

AB	-	Clinical and epidemiological aspects of 41 cases of mycetoma seen in São Paulo
		city from January 1978 to December 1989 are presented. Twenty-eight cases (68%)
		"were caused by actinomycetes, while 13 (32%) were caused by true fungi. In only"
		22 (78%) actinomycetoma cases was it possible to identify the agent. Nocardia
		"brasiliensis, by far the commonest actinomycete isolated, was responsible for 13"
		"cases. Among eumycetomata, Madurella grisea was isolated from 3 cases,"
		"Scedosporium apiospermum from 2 cases, and Madurella mycetomatis from 1 case, and"
		in 7 cases the agent was not identified. Distribution by sex and age was similar
		to that reported in the literature. Feet and legs were the commonest sites
		"affected. The mean age of actinomycetoma patients was 33.2 years, while patients"
		with eumycetomata were an average of 32.8 years. Mean duration of the disease was
		6.8 and 9.8 years respectively. Most patients came from rural areas in the
		north-eastern region of the country and worked as field labourers. Bone
		involvement was frequent for both actinomycetomata and eumycetomata and was
		"characterized by osteoporosis, periostal reaction and cavitation. The authors'"
		elected treatment consists of combining sulfamethoxazole (800 mg) and
		"trimethoprim (100 mg) with prednisone (10 mg) orally, daily."

		necrosis following pterygium excision.
PG	-	947-51
AB	-	"OBJECTIVE: To assess the precipitating factors, clinical course, and treatment of"
		11 cases of severe intraocular infections of radionecrosis after pterygium
		excision in an attempt to minimize the devastating ocular sequelae. DESIGN AND
		SETTING: From the database of cases of radionecrosis at Royal Perth (Australia)
		"Hospital and Lions Eye Institute, Perth, we identified 11 cases of severe"
		intraocular infection complicating radionecrosis. We reviewed the case notes and
		the available radiotherapy records (n = 8). PATIENTS: Eleven patients admitted
		during an 8-year period. RESULTS: Mean (+/- SD) dose of radiotherapy was 22.7 +/-
		"1.0 Gy and mean latency period, 14.45 +/- 2.5 years. Among the six proven"
		"bacterial cases, Pseudomonas was identified in four, Staphylococcus aureus in"
		"one, and Streptococcus pneumoniae was involved in one bilateral case. Among the"
		"four fungal cases, Petriellidium boydii was indicated in two, and Fusarium and"
		Scedosporium inflatum in one each. The condition may remain undiagnosed for some
		"time and mimic a posterior scleritis, serous retinal detachment, or pseudotumor."
		INTERVENTIONS: Early débridement and culture; close microbiological assistance;
		and systemic antimicrobials for a prolonged period. Perforation or incipient
		perforation necessitated penetrating keratoplasties in seven patients and
		repeated keratoplasties in three. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The use of radiotherapy
		following pterygium excision should be limited and only low doses used. Ulcer
		beds and calcific plaques at sites of radionecrosis should not be directly
		covered without first performing adequate sterilization. Removal of plaques may
		precipitate sepsis; ulcer beds and plaques harbor infective agents. CONCLUSION:
		Severe radionecrosis may expose a patient to a lifelong risk of intraocular
		sepsis and profound visual morbidity. Conjunctival autografting is a safer method
		to reduce recurrence rate after pterygium excision.

PG	-	181-6
LID	-	10.1111/myc.12289 [doi]
AB	-	Central nervous system (CNS) infections after liver transplantation may be fungal
		"in aetiology, with involvement from either common organisms such as Cryptococcus"
		"neoformans and Aspergillus spp. as well as less common organisms, such as the"
		Mucorales and Scedosporium spp. Although the mortality of CNS fungal infections
		"was nearly 100% in early series, more recent data has suggested that good"
		outcomes can be achieved. This may be due to both improved diagnostic
		"capabilities, such as the ability to obtain fungal susceptibilities and"
		"therapeutic drug levels, and improved therapeutic options, such as the newer"
		"triazoles- voriconazole and posaconazole. Due to improved outcomes, issues have"
		now arisen around the long-term tolerability of these agents. The following two
		"cases of invasive cerebral fungal infections following liver transplantation, one"
		"with Aspergillus flavus, and the other with Scedosporium boydii/apiospermum"
		highlight the success that can be seen with the modern management of a previously
		"fatal diagnosis. In particular, we highlight the issues around therapeutic"
		monitoring and discontinuation of therapy.

PG	-	1436-8
AB	-	We report a case of disseminated Scedosporium apiospermum infection in a
		neutropenic patient with acute myeloid leukemia. Due to progression of the
		mycosis after 7 days of amphotericin B lipid complex therapy and to high
		"susceptibility of the mold to voriconazole in vitro, the patient was treated with"
		"intravenous voriconazole. After a few days of therapy, fever disappeared and skin"
		"lesions improved. However, the patient died after 1 month due to intestinal"
		"bleeding. Despite a negative outcome, this case seems to indicate a promising"
		role for voriconazole in the treatment of S. apiospermum infections.

AB	-	Eculizumab has become the standard of care for patients with paroxysmal nocturnal
		"hemoglobinuria (PNH). As more patients are treated, the long-term outcomes of"
		these patients will become apparent. We recently treated a patient who developed
		PNH in the setting of aplastic anemia. The patient developed acute myeloid
		leukemia less than three years after initiating eculizumab. The patient also died
		suddenly from Scedosporium sepsis during induction therapy. This patient's course
		seemed more aggressive than would be expected. The possible effect of complement
		blockade is discussed.

AB	-	We report a very rare case of pulmonary chromomycosis caused by Scedosporium
		prolificans that developed after lung transplantation and was successfully
		treated with endobronchial topical amphotericin B instillation. The subject was a
		woman in her 50s with a history of bilateral lobar lung transplantation from
		living donors for idiopathic pulmonary hypertension. Eight years after the lung
		"transplantation, chest radiography X-ray and computed tomography showed an"
		abnormal shadow in the right lung. Bronchoscopic findings showed obstruction by a
		fungal component at the laterobasal bronchus B9. She was diagnosed with pulmonary
		chromomycosis after S. prolificans was detected in the bronchial aspirate.
		"Systemic antifungal treatment with itraconazole was ineffective. Therefore, we"
		administered topical amphotericin B weekly via endobronchial instillation and
		replaced oral itraconazole with voriconazole. The endobronchial procedure was
		safe and tolerable. Bronchial obstruction improved after three 3 instillations.
		"We continued topical amphotericin B instillation once every 3 months for 2 years,"
		and the abnormal shadow nearly disappeared. This case report describes infection
		"by S. prolificans, which rarely becomes an etiologic agent in lung transplant"
		"patients, and shows that endobronchial topical amphotericin B instillation is a"
		therapeutic option when systemic antifungal treatment is ineffective.

AB	-	This report describes a fatal case of central nervous system pseudallescheriasis.
		A 32 year old white man presented with headache and meningismus 15 days after
		nearly drowning in a swine sewage reservoir. Computerised tomography and magnetic
		"resonance imaging of the head revealed multiple brain granulomata, which vanished"
		"when steroid and broad spectrum antimicrobial and antifungal agents, in addition"
		"to dexamethasone, were started. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis disclosed a"
		"neutrophilic meningitis. Treatment with antibiotics and amphotericin B, together"
		"with fluconazole and later itraconazole, was ineffective. Miconazole was added"
		"through an Ommaya reservoir, but was insufficient to halt the infection."
		Pseudallescheria boydii was finally isolated and identified in cerebrospinal
		"fluid cultures, a few days before death, three and a half months after the"
		symptoms began. Diagnosis was delayed because of a reduction in the lesions after
		"partial treatment, which prevented a stereotactic biopsy. Physicians should be"
		"aware of this condition, and provide prompt stereotactic biopsy. Confirmed cases"
		"should perhaps be treated with voriconazole, probably the most effective,"
		currently available treatment for this agent.

TI	-	"Onychomycosis in white line disease in horses: pathology, mycology and clinical"
		features.
PG	-	27-35
AB	-	This paper describes onychomycosis in horses and reports the pathological
		"findings, associated fungi and incidence of concurrent white line disease. In"
		"addition to these observations, relevance between post mortem and clinical"
		findings of onychomycosis are discussed in 3 necropsied horses. Samples were
		collected from 100 hooves from a total of 51 Thoroughbreds suffering from white
		"line disease. Of these, 15 hooves from 13 horses were also complicated with"
		severe hoof wall fissure formation. Preparations from the same samples were used
		both for histopathology and for culture to identify the associated fungi.
		Onychomycosis was diagnosed when it could be confirmed histologically. Fungal
		identification was based on morphological characteristics in culture and the
		associated fungi were determined by comparison with culture morphology. As a
		"result, 10 samples collected from horses were diagnosed as suffering from"
		onychomycosis. Seven of these showed complicating severe inner hoof wall fissures
		"and the soil fungus Scedosporium apiospermum or the teleomorph of this fungus,"
		"i.e., Pseudallescheria boydii, was isolated. The fungus was found to be"
		"ubiquitous in the fissure cavities, the terminal horn of the white line and the"
		terminal horn-like laminae of the metaplastic white line-like tissue. It can be
		concluded that onychomycosis frequently causes white line disease and/or makes it
		"worse. Associated with deterioration of the submural condition, the main"
		"associated fungus for onychomycosis in this series, was Genus Scedosporium and"
		the most susceptible region was the terminal horn of the hypertrophied white line
		and/or the terminal horn-like laminae of the metaplastic white line-like tissue.

PG	-	508-9
AB	-	PURPOSE: To report fungal infection complicating Acanthamoeba keratitis. METHODS:
		Case report. A 45-year-old woman with contact lens-related bilateral Acanthamoeba
		"keratitis developed corneal ulcer, corneal perforation, and mature cataract in"
		"the left eye, which was managed by penetrating keratoplasty, lensectomy, and"
		vitrectomy. RESULTS: Histopathologic examination of the keratoplasty specimen
		from the left eye revealed extensive lamellar stromal necrosis with the
		coexistence of both empty cysts and branching hyphae. Cultures from the
		keratoplasty specimen grew Scedosporium apiospermum. CONCLUSION: Keratomycosis
		caused by S. apiospermum may complicate protracted Acanthamoeba keratitis.

AB	-	Chronic subcutaneous infections caused by Aspergillus species are considered to

		of ketoconazole and itraconazole without improvement. Initial diagnosis based on
		"histology and radiology was Scedosporium eumycetoma. However, examination of the"
		"biopsy revealed A. flavus, which was identified by molecular analysis and"
		MALDI-TOF MS. Immunohistochemistry using antibody directed against Aspergillus
		species was positive. Because of the earlier treatment failures with ketoconazole
		"and itraconazole, therapy with voriconazole was initiated. However, in vitro"
		susceptibility testing yielded a lower Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC)
		value for itraconazole (0.25 μg ml(-1) ) than for voriconazole (1 μg ml(-1) ).
		"Based on the presented results, A. flavus can be considered as one of the agents"
		of white-grain eumycetoma.

PG	-	169-71
AB	-	BACKGROUND: A case of Scedosporium prolificans corneoscleritis is reported in a
		"patient who had developed scleral necrosis following pterygium surgery, with"
		adjunctive beta-irradiation. This fungus has been reported to be the causative
		organism in only two previous cases of corneoscleritis. METHODS: The patient
		presented with signs and symptoms typical of corneoscleritis. When the fungus was
		"isolated from a biopsy specimen, aggressive scleral debridement was carried out"
		and intensive antifungal therapy was instigated. RESULTS: After a prolonged
		"course, the eye was rendered sterile. CONCLUSION: Early conjunctival recession"
		and aggressive scleral debridement combined with intensive instillation of
		antifungals are crucial to the successful management of fungal corneoscleritis.

AB	-	"Mycetoma is a chronic granulomatous infection that is difficult to treat, notably"
		when due to fungi such as Scedosporium apiospermum. Recent antifungal agents
		"could be an option, but cases are rarely reported, and none with posaconazole."
		"Paradoxical responses, defined as initial clinical worsening despite appropriate"
		"treatment, are common in tuberculosis but rare in deep mycoses in"
		"non-immunocompromised hosts. Hence, paradoxical responses in context other than"
		mycobacterial infection in an immunocompromised host could provide insights into
		the pathophysiology and the optimal strategy for treatment. We report the first
		case of a mycetoma caused by S. apiospermum with bone involvement treated with
		"posaconazole, and the paradoxical response observed at the beginning of the"
		"treatment. As with mycobacterial infections, a paradoxical response in deep"
		mycosis could represent the earliest marker of therapeutic efficacy.

TI	-	Cushing's syndrome due to interaction between inhaled corticosteroids and
		itraconazole.
PG	-	46-9
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To report a case of an interaction between inhaled corticosteroids and
		itraconazole causing iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome and provide a review of the
		relevant literature. CASE SUMMARY: A 70-year-old white woman on long-term
		treatment with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids for asthma was diagnosed as
		having Scedosporium apiospermum infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissues.
		"As a result, she was treated with itraconazole for 2 months. She subsequently"
		developed Cushing's syndrome due to a probable cytochrome P450-mediated
		interaction between itraconazole and budesonide. She also had secondary adrenal
		insufficiency requiring prolonged treatment with replacement hydrocortisone.
		DISCUSSION: Budesonide is a potent glucocorticoid that is metabolized in the
		liver by the CYP3A4 isoenzyme to inactive metabolites. Itraconazole is a potent
		cytochrome P450 inhibitor. It can inhibit the metabolism of oral or inhaled
		"corticosteroids, producing cortisol excess leading to Cushing's syndrome and"
		adrenal insufficiency. An assessment of causality indicated a possible adverse
		interaction between itraconazole and budesonide. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of
		itraconazole and inhaled corticosteroids is increasingly being used to treat
		conditions such as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Clinicians need to be
		aware of the potential for an interaction between such a combination.

AB	-	We present a case of long-standing unilateral cacosmia in a healthy 67-year-old
		man due to maxillary fungal infestation. Treatment with septoplasty had been
		attempted 10 years prior but no further investigation or management undertaken
		and symptoms continued. Subsequent MRI scan revealed significant opacification of
		the left maxillary sinus. This was readily amenable to treatment by balloon
		sinuplasty. This yielded viscous grey mucus which grew Scedosporium apiospermum.
		"The case highlights the need for careful investigation of olfactory symptoms,"
		"including blood tests to exclude systemic causes, endoscopy and imaging where"
		indicated.

PG	-	231-2
AB	-	Scedosporium apiospermum is a filamentous fungi that commonly causes cutaneous
		"infection. In certain circumstances, S. apiospermum can also cause invasive"
		"disease, which can involve the central nervous system (CNS). When the CNS becomes"
		"involved, treatment is difficult, therapeutic options are limited and the"
		prognosis is poor. Early identification and treatment can decrease the mortality
		rate. Here we present a case of brain abscess with chronic suppurative otitis
		"media, caused by S. apiospermum. This is the first such case report from Nepal."
		"We could identify the organism only post mortem. We could not save the patient,"
		probably due to delay in diagnosis.

PG	-	193-7
AB	-	Five cases of human infection with Scedosporium prolificans are described. There
		"were two groups of patients. In group one, two were immunocompetent males with"
		"localized bone and joint infections, a man with post-traumatic septic arthritis,"
		responded to surgical treatment alone and a boy with post-traumatic septic
		"arthritis, appeared to respond to treatment with oral fluconazole, without"
		surgery. The second group consisted of three immunocompromised patients. S.
		prolificans was isolated at autopsy from the lungs of one patient with acute
		"leukaemia, and from the lungs, liver, and kidneys of another. Nosocomial S."
		prolificans infection of a synthetic vascular graft occurred in the third patient
		with end-stage renal failure on corticosteroid therapy for idiopathic
		"hypereosinophilia. His infection failed to respond to combinations of surgery,"
		fluconazole and itraconazole. All isolates of S. prolificans were resistant in
		"vitro to antifungal drugs, including the first case, which responded clinically"
		to fluconazole.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To report the successful treatment of external ventricular-drain
		(EVD)-associated infection due to vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE)
		with intraventricular daptomycin and intravenous linezolid. CASE SUMMARY: A
		64-year-old white male with a complicated medical history was admitted to the
		neurosurgical unit with Scedosporium apiospermum meningitis and hydrocephalus
		"requiring management with a right and left EVD. On day 28, cerebrospinal fluid"
		cultures from the right EVD grew VRE. Despite initiation of intravenous
		"linezolid, cultures from the right EVD remained positive. Intraventricular"
		daptomycin 5 mg daily was initiated and administered into the right EVD for 7
		days. Cerebrospinal fluid was collected from EVD outputs and analyzed for
		daptomycin concentrations. VRE in cultures from the EVD cleared after 1 day of
		therapy and no adverse effects were noted. Right and left EVD daptomycin
		concentrations were discordant throughout therapy by at least a 3-fold
		difference. First-dose peak and trough daptomycin concentrations in the
		"cerebrospinal fluid were 112.2 and 1.34 μg/mL, respectively, for the right EVD"
		"and 37.4 and 0.37 μg/mL, respectively, for the left EVD. Daptomycin accumulation"
		was evident after 3 days of therapy. DISCUSSION: Varying doses and frequencies of
		intraventricular daptomycin have been reported effective for VRE ventriculitis.
		Intraventricular drug distribution may not be homogeneous throughout the central
		"nervous system. Therefore, daptomycin minimum inhibitory concentration for VRE,"
		"cerebrospinal fluid communication throughout the central nervous system, EVD"
		"output, and the potential for drug accumulation should be considered when"
		selecting a dose and frequency. CONCLUSIONS: Intraventricular daptomycin may be
		an option for EVD-associated VRE infections that do not respond to conventional
		therapy. Intraventricular daptomycin 5 mg is a reasonable initial dose in adults
		"with VRE ventriculitis, based on our experience in this patient."

		"orthopaedic infection in a non-immunocompromised host with S. prolificans, in"
		which the combinations of itraconazole/terbinafine and voriconazole/terbinafine
		"showed synergy in vitro, and success was achieved without radical surgery, using"

AB	-	A 3-year-old neutered male Bengal cat with a history of chronic mucopurulent
		bilateral nasal discharge and sneezing was diagnosed with severe fungal
		"rhinosinusitis. A diagnosis was obtained after computer tomography imaging,"
		histopathological examination and fungal culture. The mold Scedosporium
		"apiospermum was identified as the aetiological agent. To our knowledge, this case"
		is the first description of a rhinitis or sinusitis caused by this agent in a
		cat. Aggressive surgical debridement combined with topical and systemic
		"antifungal therapy was performed. Unfortunately, the treatment resulted only in a"
		partial remission of signs.

PG	-	603-5
AB	-	We report the case of a 52-year-old male heart transplant recipient with a
		persistent localized subcutaneous infection by Scedosporium apiospermum. This
		form differs from the most common mycetoma by the absence of granules. The
		patient showed multiple nodules on the right hand that were surgically removed.
		"Concomitantly, he received oral itraconazole, but the infection persisted for two"
		"years, and several surgical interventions were necessary to eradicate the"
		infection. Our case demonstrates that a medical approach alone may be not
		sufficient to cure this fungal infection.

		recipients.
PG	-	408-13
AB	-	Mortality due to invasive mold infections in solid organ transplant recipients is
		"very high despite therapy with amphotericin B, including lipid formulations."
		"Voriconazole is a triazole with a good activity against molds, including"
		"Aspergillus spp. and Scedosporium spp. Experience with voriconazole is limited,"
		but preliminary results in patients with these infections are promising. Reported
		here is the experience with voriconazole administered on a compassionate-use
		basis to five patients with invasive mold infections: four solid organ recipients
		and one patient with an autoimmune disorder. Four patients had invasive
		"Aspergillus fumigatus infection (3 lung infections, 1 abdominal infection) and"
		one had invasive ocular Scedosporium apiospermum infection. The MIC of
		voriconazole was < or =1 microg/ml for all isolates (NCCLS performance standards
		"for microdilution assay, proposed standard M38-P). Voriconazole was administered"
		"as primary therapy in a patient with Scedosporium infection and, in patients with"
		"Aspergillus infections, after persistence of positive culture despite a"
		cumulative dose of 3 g of a lipid formulation of amphotericin B. Voriconazole was
		"administered for a median time of 80 days (range, 60-90 days). No visual"
		"disturbances were observed, but one patient presented a moderate increase in"
		liver enzymes. An increase in the levels of immunosuppressive drugs (tacrolimus
		or cyclosporine) was detected in all patients during coadministration with
		voriconazole. A clinical response was observed in all patients (complete
		"response, n=3; partial response, n=2), and a microbiological response was"
		"observed in all but one patient. Furthermore, a good relationship between the MIC"
		of voriconazole and outcome was observed. Voriconazole is an effective and safe
		therapy for treatment of invasive mold infections in solid organ recipients. To
		"avoid toxicity with this drug, however, the dosing of immunosuppressive drugs"
		must be reduced.

TI	-	Invasive pulmonary infection due to Scedosporium apiospermum in two children with
		chronic granulomatous disease.
PG	-	1437-41
AB	-	Scedosporium apiospermum is an opportunistic fungus in humans. The incidence of
		"S. apiospermum infection in patients with acquired neutropenia (e.g., patients"
		receiving chemotherapy and bone marrow transplant recipients) is steadily
		"increasing. S. apiospermum has poor in vitro susceptibility to ""conventional"""
		"antifungal agents, rendering the management of infections complex. Patients with"
		"chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) are highly susceptible to fungal infections,"
		which are mostly due to Aspergillus species. We describe two children with CGD
		and invasive pulmonary infection due to S. apiospermum. Both patients were
		treated with antifungal therapy including azole derivatives (itraconazole or
		voriconazole) and surgical resection of infected tissues. These cases highlight
		that scedosporium infection can closely mimic aspergillus infection and should be
		considered in any case in which there is a failure to respond to appropriate
		"""conventional"" antifungal therapy. We also suggest that the emergence of this"
		pathogen may have been favored by long-term use of amphotericin B in both
		patients.

TI	-	First reported case of subcutaneous hyalohyphomycosis caused by Paecilomyces
		variotii.
PG	-	711-3
LID	-	10.1111/j.1365-4632.2012.05761.x [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Hyalohyphomycosis is a rare opportunistic fungal infection caused by
		"saprophytes of genera such as Fusarium, Paecilomyces, Scedosporium, Penicillium,"
		"Scopulariopsis Acremonium, and similar fungi. The literature includes only one"
		previous report of Paecilomyces variotii human infection and very few reports of
		subcutaneous mycosis caused by any of the hyalohyphomycosis group of fungi.
		"METHODS: We report an instance of fungal infection in a 50-year-old woman, known"
		"to have diabetes, who presented with multiple raised lesions on the upper back of"
		"two years' duration. Dermatological examination revealed a 20 × 22-cm, swollen,"
		"indurated area on the upper back with multiple violaceous, exophytic nodules on"
		the surface. RESULTS: Microscopy from pus and tissue smear revealed septate
		branching fungi. Periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain was positive for fungal
		elements. Culture on three occasions yielded P. variotii. Slide culture mounts
		showed septate hyaline hyphae of P. variotii with elongated phialides
		demonstrating bulbous bases and tapering apices attached to the conidiophores.
		"The patient was treated with itraconazole, to which she responded well."
		CONCLUSIONS: This is the first reported case of subcutaneous hyalohyphomycosis
		caused by P. variotii. It appears that this relatively rare fungal pathogen may
		be starting to assert itself as an important cause of infection in humans.

TI	-	Cutaneous infection due to Scedosporium apiospermum in an immunosuppressed
		patient.
PG	-	47-9
AB	-	"Scedosporium apiospermum, the anamorphic form of Pseudallescheria boydii, is a"
		filamentous fungus with low inherent virulence. Increasing numbers of cases of
		this infection have been reported probably related to the rising number of
		"immunosuppressed persons. Apart from mycetoma, cutaneous and subcutaneous"
		infection is rarely encountered in clinical practice. We describe a case of
		cutaneous infection caused by Scedosporium apiospermum in a subject with
		rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes mellitus who was submitted to long-term therapy
		with cyclosporin and corticosteroids. Histopathologic examination of a skin
		biopsy showed a granulomatous infiltrate with hyaline septate hyphae. Culture of
		"two skin biopsies taken at two different observations of the woman, 3 weeks"
		"apart, allowed isolation of Scedosporium apiospermum. Therapy with itraconazole,"
		"400 mg/day, for 3 months was effective in curing the infection."

TI	-	Scedosporium endophthalmitis: two fatal disseminated cases of Scedosporium
		infection presenting with endophthalmitis.
PG	-	330-4
AB	-	The incidence of disseminated infection with Scedosporium species is increasing
		in patients with haematological malignancy. Two fatal cases are reported of
		patients with acute myeloid leukaemia and neutropenia who presented with
		Scedosporium endophthalmitis. Diagnosis of fungal infection was delayed as blood
		and vitreous cultures were positive only after 3 days in patient 1 and blood
		culture was positive at 7 days in patient 2. Despite antifungal therapy with
		"amphotericin B and additional fluconazole in patient 2, both patients died of"
		overwhelming fungal septicaemia. Post-mortem examination of the right globe in
		patient 1 showed haemorrhagic necrotizing chorioretinitis with numerous fungal
		"hyphae in choroidal vessels, choroid, retina and vitreous. Scedosporium species"
		are often resistant to conventional antifungal therapy including amphotericin B.
		Diagnosis is difficult and mortality in disseminated infection is high.

		pain despite a normal chest radiograph. Fluconazole treatment was carried out
		"empirically because no sign of a fungal infection was detected ante mortem,"
		either by mycological cultivation or by serological investigation. First
		post-mortem examination revealed a disseminated fungal infection involving the
		"central nervous system. Scedosporium prolificans was cultured from the kidney,"
		"spleen and myocardium. In vitro, the fungal isolate was found to be highly"
		resistant to all available systemic antimycotics.

TI	-	An immunocompetent patient with primary Scedosporium apiospermum vertebral
		osteomyelitis.
PG	-	425-30
AB	-	"Scedosporium apiospermum, the asexual anamorph of Pseudallescheria boydii, is a"
		ubiquitous saprophytic fungus that usually causes cutaneous/subcutaneous
		"infection but may manifest as an invasive disease, often in immunocompromised"
		"hosts. Following an extensive literature review, we think that this case"
		represents the first documented report of a primary infection of the spine in an
		immunocompetent patient. Despite extensive surgical debridement and itraconazole
		"therapy, the patient died of multisystem organ failure of unknown etiology. Our"
		case and three previously reported cases of P. boydii vertebral osteomyelitis
		highlight the importance of obtaining repeat cultures in patients with
		culture-negative vertebral osteomyelitis who fail to adequately respond to
		empiric standard antibacterial and/or antimycobacterial therapy. Combined
		surgical debridement and antifungal therapy have been required for eradication of
		P. boydii spinal infections in two previously reported immunocompromised
		"patients, although the optimal antifungal regimen for this infection has not been"
		established.

		immunocompetent individual.
PG	-	226-7
AB	-	Endogenous intraocular infection of fungal etiology is extremely rare in an
		"immunocompetent individual. Usually, an antecedent history of trauma, surgery,"
		intravenous drug abuse or an immunocompromized state can be elicited.
		Scedosporium apiospermum is a known cause of keratomycosis after traumatic
		implantation and can cause fatal disseminated infection in immunocompromized
		"patients. However, cases of S. apiospermum intraocular infection in"
		immunocompetent individuals have been very rarely reported in literature. We
		report here a case of an anterior chamber exudative mass due to S. apiospermum in
		an immunocompetent individual which was managed successfully with anterior
		chamber wash and intravitreal injection of voriconazole.

AB	-	A man aged 47 years who was immunosuppressed following renal transplantation for
		focal segmental glomerulosclerosis was referred to the Plastic Surgery team for
		"management of a painful, chronic, granulomatous lesion of the right forearm."
		"Serial ultrasound scans and MRI scans were not diagnostic, but microbiological"
		specimens tested positive for the fungus Scedosporium apiospermum The renal
		"transplant graft-which was failing-was removed, allowing him to cease"
		immunosuppression. He then underwent a resection of the lesion and reconstruction
		"with a split thickness skin graft. Analysis of the specimen revealed fibrosis,"
		granulomatosis and a collection of S. apiospermum He was started on voriconazole
		"which, in conjunction with his surgical resection, appears to have kept the"
		disease at bay. With increasing numbers of solid organ transplants and improved
		"survival, this case highlights the growing burden of rare, opportunistic"
		"infections, the difficulty in diagnosis and the need for specialist intervention."

PG	-	102-7
AB	-	"The clinical course of 11 patients is reported: a newly-described species,"
		"Scedosporium inflatum, was isolated from each. Infections were primarily focally"
		invasive and involved musculoskeletal tissues. All but one followed penetrating
		"trauma, often minor, or surgery. Two cases, one fatal, occurred in"
		immunosuppressed patients. In only one case was there presumptive hematogenous
		spread. In three cases colonization with S. inflatum could not reliably be
		distinguished from infection. In vitro susceptibility testing of isolates from
		"all patients showed that all were resistant to amphotericin B, miconazole, and"
		ketoconazole and most were resistant to fluconazole and itraconazole. The optimum
		management of S. inflatum infection is not apparent: Although several patients
		"recovered without antifungal therapy, progressive unremitting infection occurred"
		in an immunocompromised patient and in a previously healthy child despite
		aggressive antifungal chemotherapy and surgical debridement.

AB	-	Post mortem examination of a juvenile loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta)
		stranded in the Canary Islands revealed a fishing-line in the small intestine.
		"Histologically, severe necrotic enteritis, multiple haemorrhages, and marked"
		oedema of the intestinal submucosa were observed. Yeast cells and fungal hyphae
		were seen in the lamina propria of the intestinal mucosa and in the connective
		tissue of the submucosa. Because fungal cultures were not taken at the time of
		"necropsy, an immunohistochemical study was performed in order to identify the"
		fungus involved. Specific monoclonal and heterologously absorbed polyclonal
		"antibodies served as the primary reagents for identification of aspergillosis,"
		"candidiasis, fusariosis, geotricosis, scedosporiosis, and zygomycosis, using an"
		indirect immunofluorescence staining technique. The fungal elements were strongly
		stained only by a polyclonal antibody against Candida albicans and a monoclonal
		antibody against C. albicans. There are no known previous reports of Candida sp.
		causing skin disease or systemic mycotic infection in sea turtles.

TI	-	Imaging findings of pulmonary infection caused by Scedosporium prolificans in a
		deep immunocompromised patient.
PG	-	47-9
AB	-	Scedosporium prolificans is an emerging fungus that causes rapid progressive and
		disseminated infections in immunodepressed patients. We present a case of a
		34-year-old woman with chronic myelogenous leukemia who received a bone marrow
		transplantation and suffered a sudden respiratory failure in +67 day. Chest
		radiographies showed growing bilateral patchy condensations. Computed Tomography
		depicted bilateral nodular condensation of alveolar space. S. prolificans was
		"detected from sputum, but the patient died 72 h later. Imaging findings of lung"
		"scedosporiosis are nonspecific, but CT may provide a prompter diagnosis and allow"
		to add newer antifungal treatments. This report presents the first imaging report
		of lung scedosporiosis.

PG	-	2223-4
LID	-	10.1016/j.transproceed.2009.06.017 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: We sought to present our results of topical intrabronchial
		installation of amphotericin B lipid complex (AmpB lipid). PATIENT AND METHODS: A
		deposit of fungal material was observed in a bilateral lung transplant recipient
		who experienced stenosis of the left anastomosis and have been fitted with a
		double endobronchial prosthesis. The deposit was adherent to the prosthetic
		"material, causing marked local laceration, risk of perforation, and exacerbation"
		"of the bronchial stenosis. Upon cultivation of a bronchial aspirate (BAS), we"
		"isolated Aspergillus fumigatus, Scedosporium prolificans, and Candida glabrata."
		Systemic antifungal treatment was begun with oral voriconazole (200 mg every 12
		hours) and inhaled AmpB lipid (25 mg once daily). The fungal deposit on the
		prosthetic material was treated by topical instillation of a solution of 25 mg
		"AmpB lipid before and after each therapeutic fibrobronchoscopy (FB), which was"
		performed weekly at 5 consecutive examinations. Tolerance was excellent. RESULTS:
		The improvement obtained after the procedure made it possible to withdraw one of
		the displaced prostheses. Subsequent cultivation for the fungi found in the BAS
		was persistently negative over a follow-up of 2 years. CONCLUSION: Topical
		intrabronchial instillation of AmpB lipid has proven effective and well tolerated
		for the treatment of localized fungal colonies. This use could be extended by
		protocol to FB in the early postoperative period after lung transplantation for
		antifungal prophylaxis.

LID	-	71
AB	-	"Crude oil contamination of soils and waters is a worldwide problem, which has"
		been actively addressed in recent years. Sequencing genomes of microorganisms
		involved in the degradation of hydrocarbons have allowed the identification of
		"several promoters, genes, and degradation pathways of these contaminants. This"
		knowledge allows a better understanding of the functional dynamics of microbial
		"degradation. Here, we report a first draft of the 44.2 Mbp genome assembly of an"
		environmental strain of the fungus Scedosporium apiospermum. The assembly
		consisted of 178 high-quality DNA scaffolds with 1.93% of sequence repeats
		"identified. A total of 11,195 protein-coding genes were predicted including a"
		diverse group of gene families involved in hydrocarbon degradation pathways like
		dioxygenases and cytochrome P450. The metabolic pathways identified in the genome
		"can potentially degrade hydrocarbons like chloroalkane/alkene, chorocyclohexane,"
		"and chlorobenzene, benzoate, aminobenzoate, fluorobenzoate, toluene, caprolactam,"
		"geraniol, naphthalene, styrene, atrazine, dioxin, xylene, ethylbenzene, and"
		polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The comparison analysis between this strain and
		the previous sequenced clinical strain showed important differences in terms of
		annotated genes involved in the hydrocarbon degradation process.

TI	-	Fungal infections in marrow transplant recipients under antifungal prophylaxis
		with fluconazole.
PG	-	789-98
AB	-	Fungal infection is one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality
		in bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients. The growing incidence of these
		"infections is related to several factors including prolonged granulocytopenia,"
		"use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, conditioning regimens, and use of"
		immunosuppression to avoid graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). In the present
		"series, we report five cases of invasive mold infections documented among 64 BMT"
		recipients undergoing fluconazole antifungal prophylaxis: 1) A strain of
		Scedosporium prolificans was isolated from a skin lesion that developed on day
		+72 after BMT in a chronic myeloid leukemic patient. 2) Invasive pulmonary
		aspergillosis (Aspergillus fumigatus) was diagnosed on day +29 in a patient with
		a long period of hospitalization before being transplanted for severe aplastic
		anemia. 3) A tumoral lung lesion due to Rhizopus arrhizus (zygomycosis) was
		observed in a transplanted patient who presented severe chronic GvHD. 4) A
		"tumoral lesion due to Aspergillus spp involving the 7th, 8th and 9th right ribs"
		and local soft tissue was diagnosed in a BMT patient on day +110. 5) A patient
		with a history of Ph1-positive acute lymphocytic leukemia exhibited a cerebral
		lesion on day +477 after receiving a BMT during an episode of severe chronic
		"GvHD. At that time, blood and spinal fluid cultures yielded Fusarium sp."
		Opportunistic infections due to fungi other than Candida spp are becoming a major
		problem among BMT patients receiving systemic antifungal prophylaxis with
		fluconazole.

		"malignancies receiving voriconazole are being reported with increasing frequency,"
		with zygomycete infections predominating. We report a case of disseminated
		Scedosporium prolificans infection in a patient receiving voriconazole
		"prophylaxis. Despite poor in vitro activity of voriconazole for this organism,"
		synergy studies using the checkerboard method demonstrated synergy with the
		"combination of voriconazole and terbinafine. This regimen, in conjunction with"
		"central venous line removal and intravitreal voriconazole, contributed to the"
		recovery of the patient. S. prolificans is a life-threatening mold that should be
		considered in patients with breakthrough invasive fungal infections while on
		voriconazole prophylaxis.

AB	-	Prosthetic joint infections (PJI) are rarely due to fungal agents and if so they
		are mainly caused by Candida strains. This case represents a PJI caused by a
		"multi-drug resistant Pseudallescheria apiosperma, with poor in vivo response to"
		"itraconazole and voriconazole. This case differs also by the way of infection,"
		since the joint infection did not follow a penetrating trauma. In the majority of
		"cases, Scedosporium extremity infections remain local in immunocompetent"
		individuals. We report a persistent joint infection with multiple therapeutic
		"failures, and subsequent amputation of the left leg. Detailed clinical data,"
		"patient history, treatment regime and outcome of a very long-lasting (>4 years)"
		"P. apiosperma prosthetic knee infection in an immunocompetent, 61-year-old male"
		patient are presented with this case. The patient was finally cured by the
		combination of multiple and extensive surgical interventions and prolonged
		antifungal combination therapy with voriconazole and terbinafine.

		"are rare. However, orbital abscess following STTA has been reported in seven"
		"cases. Furthermore, although eye infections due to Exophiala species are"
		"uncommon, there have been 19 cases to date. E. jeanselmei, E. phaeomuriformis, E."
		"werneckii, and E. dermatitidis have been reported to cause human eye infections;"
		"however, to the best of our knowledge, orbital abscess caused by E. dermatitidis"
		has not yet been reported. We describe the first documented case of fungal
		orbital abscess caused by E. dermatitidis following STTA. We also review the
		"related literature of orbital abscess following STTA, as well as eye infections"
		caused by the four Exophiala species. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was a
		69-year-old Japanese woman with diabetic mellitus. She had a macular oedema in
		"her right eye, which occurred secondary to branch retinal vein occlusion. An"
		orbital abscess caused by E. dermatitidis occurred 4 months after the second STTA
		"for the macular oedema, which was successfully treated by a surgical debridement"
		and systemic administration of voriconazole. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings in the
		patient and from our literature survey caution ophthalmologists to the fact that
		"STTA can cause fungal orbital infections, especially in diabetic patients."
		"Furthermore, surgical treatment is one of the most important risk factors."

		in diagnosis and management.
PG	-	633-4
AB	-	Pseudallescheria boydii and its asexual state Scedosporium apiospermum is a well
		known opportunistic pathogen among immunocompromised patients. However it is rare
		in immunocompetent patients. The optimum management of this infection is still
		not clear. The new azoles may show better efficacy than amphotericin B and
		additional surgery may play a pivotal role. We report a case of Pseudallescheria
		boydii lung infection in an immunocompetent patient who had an old tuberculous
		cavity and presumed inhalational exposure. The case highlights difficulties in
		diagnosis which complicates the selection of antifungal agent/s and the need for
		aggressive surgical debridement.

		recipient receiving treatment for severe graft-versus-host disease. This fatal
		"breakthrough intracranial abscess, due to amphotericin B-resistant (minimum"
		"inhibitory concentration > 16 micro g/ml) mold, developed during the course of"
		systemic antifungal therapy given for multicentric pulmonary aspergillosis.
		"Despite treatment with high-dose Abelcet (10 mg/kg daily), free amphotericin B"
		was not detected in postmortem cerebellar tissue. A broad-spectrum triazole-based
		"agent (voriconazole/UK-109, 496--Vfend), and a novel fungal cell wall inhibitor,"
		"an echinocandin/pneumocandin analog (caspofungin/MK-0991--Cancidas), which"
		exhibit excellent in vitro activity against most clinical Pseudallescheria
		"boydii-Scedosporium apiospermum isolates, have recently become available in the"
		United States and may provide much needed treatment options for patients at risk.

TI	-	Voriconazole in fungal keratitis caused by Scedosporium apiospermum.
PG	-	414-7
AB	-	"OBJECTIVE: To describe the first case, to the best of our knowledge, of"
		posttraumatic Scedosporium apiospermum (ScA) keratitis successfully treated with
		systemic and topical voriconazole. CASE SUMMARY: A 19-year-old man was admitted
		to the hospital with an incisive wound of his left eye and the cornea totally
		sectioned after trauma with a cutter used in gardening. Initial empirical
		"treatment was followed by systemic and topical voriconazole, and the eye did not"
		"have to be enucleated. Five months after the trauma, a penetrating keratoplasty"
		and chamber intraocular lens implantation was performed with a favorable visual
		"outcome. DISCUSSION: ScA keratitis is rare, but it must be suspected if a history"
		of ocular injury with contaminated objects exists. Among the antifungals
		"available to treat ScA keratitis, voriconazole has shown advantages such as the"
		lowest minimum inhibitory concentration and the availability of an oral
		formulation. CONCLUSIONS: Voriconazole shows promise as an effective alternative
		to conventional antifungals in the treatment of ScA keratitis. It is available
		"both as oral and intravenous preparations, which is a great advantage in these"
		lengthy infections.

PG	-	2425-7
LID	-	10.1016/j.transproceed.2008.07.030 [doi]
AB	-	"Pseudallescheria boydii and its asexual form, Scedosporium apiospermum, are"
		ubiquitous filamentous fungi that rarely cause central nervous system (CNS)
		"infection. Brain abscess caused by P. boydii is a highly lethal infection,"
		usually seen in organ transplant recipients who receive a number of
		immunosuppressive agents. We have presented a case of a 48-year-old man 6 years
		after renal transplantation who received methylprednisolone followed by
		antithymocyte globulin for treatment of acute cellular rejection. Eight weeks
		"later, he developed fever, headache, and left-sided hemiparesis. Further"
		investigation with magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed multiple
		ring-enhancing hypodense lesions with marked edema which were compatible with
		"brain abscesses. Following surgical drainage, multiple fungal elements were"
		initially described as Aspergillus species. The patient failed to improve and
		died from rapidly progressive infection despite treatment with amphotericin B.
		Later a diagnosis was finally made by the isolation of P. boydii in pus culture.
		"The specific diagnosis is difficult to rapidly make, because P. boydii mimics"
		other fungi morphologically in tissue sections and may produce infections
		clinically similar to other mycoses. Culture of the organism is required for
		definitive diagnosis. P. boydii infections are important complications of
		transplantation. They are difficult to treat due to resistance to amphotericin B.

TI	-	Successful recovery after disseminated infection due to mycobacterium abscessus
		in a lung transplant patient: subcutaneous nodule as first manifestation--a case
		report.
PG	-	2413-5
AB	-	Mycobacterium abscessus infection following lung transplantation (LT) has been
		described in a few cases. It is characterized by a variable initial location and
		"subsequent course in this special risk group of patients, particularly those with"
		cystic fibrosis (CF). Herein we have presented the case of a patient subjected to
		"LT due to CF, who 1 year after transplantation developed a subcutaneous nodule"
		"produced by M abscessus, with subsequent hematogenous spread as well as bronchial"
		and bone marrow involvement. Antecedents prior to LT included Staphylococcus
		aureus colonization and sputum positivity for Aspergillus fumigatus and
		Scedosporium apioespermum. Treatment with ciprofloxacin and linezolid was started
		on the basis of the antibiogram findings. The latter antibiotic was replaced by
		"clarithromycin for 6 months. Two years later, the patient remains asymptomatic"
		with respiratory function parameters in the normal range. The infected patient
		described herein was our only case with sepsis and multisystemic spread. The
		important mortality among such cases reported in the literature makes early
		diagnosis and treatment essential.

		correlation.
PG	-	656-60
AB	-	Mycotic osteomyelitis is rare and occurs in immunocompromised patients after
		inoculation of the pathogen at a penetrating trauma site. Mycotic osteomyelitis
		"due to Scedosporium Apiospermum is extremely rare, with only 13 cases of septic"
		arthritis reported previously. Ours is only the third case of S. apiospermum
		osteomyelitis in an immunocompromised patient and the only patient with a
		histopathologic diagnosis from an amputation specimen. Recognition of this
		"pathogen may be delayed due to insidious onset and negative joint fluid cultures,"
		often requiring synovial or bone biopsies to establish the diagnosis. Delay in
		appropriate treatment may result in disseminating infection or even death.

		"medial rectus abdominis muscle flap coverage, transport distraction osteogenesis,"
		"and combination voriconazole/terbinafine chemotherapy, a novel antifungal"
		"regimen. We achieved successful control of the infection, limb salvage, and an"
		excellent functional outcome through aggressive debridement of infected bone and
		"soft tissue, elimination of dead space within the bony defect, the robust"
		"perfusion provided by the free flap, the hypervascular state induced by"
		"distraction osteogenesis, and the synergism of the novel antifungal regimen."
