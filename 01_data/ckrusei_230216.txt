AB	-	BACKGROUND: The oral mucosa is likely to be compromised by acquired systemic
		disease. There are no data available on the prevalence of oral candidiasis and
		"the species distribution among patients with oral mucosal diseases. Therefore, it"
		is necessary to conduct a study assessing the characterization of oral
		candidiasis and the species profiles in such patients. METHODS: Over a period of
		"four consecutive years, patients with oral mucosal diseases were screened for"
		oral candidiasis by a combination of clinical presentation and laboratory
		"findings (smear test and Candida cultures). In addition, Candida species were"
		"isolated and identified for further analysis. RESULTS: In total, 9769 (6.09%) of"
		"the 160,357 patients screened were diagnosed with oral candidiasis on the basis"
		of both clinical manifestations and laboratory testing. The ratio of females to
		"males was 1:0.61, and females had higher overall infection rates than males in"
		"all age subgroups. Patients with HIV infection, anaemia-related stomatitis,"
		"Sjögren's syndrome/xerostomia, pemphigoid, and radiation-induced stomatitis were"
		"highly susceptible to oral candidiasis. Of the 11,161 isolated Candida strains,"
		"C. albicans remained the most common species (75.37%), followed by C. tropicalis"
		"(6.06%), C. krusei (2.79%), and C. glabrata (2.02%). Surprisingly, both the"
		proportion and the number of C. glabrata isolates increased dramatically over the
		"4 consecutive years. CONCLUSIONS: In this large-scale population-based study, the"
		features of oral candidiasis prevalence and the species profile among patients
		with oral mucosal diseases were summarized. The information gleaned will enhance
		the understanding of and improve management strategies for oral candidiasis and
		the underlying systemic and oral conditions.

AB	-	Vaginal candidiasis (VC) continues to be a health problem to women worldwide.
		"Although the majority of VC cases are caused by Candida albicans (C. albicans),"
		non-albicans Candida spp. like C. glabrata and C. tropicalis are emerging as
		important and potentially resistant opportunistic agents of VC. The objective of
		this study was to evaluate the prevalence and epidemiology of VC in the UAE
		through retrospective analysis of pertinent data compiled by the microbiology and
		"infection control unit at Latifa Hospital, Dubai between 2005 and 2011. The"
		incidence of VC significantly increased from 10.76% in 2005 to 17.61% in 2011;
		"average prevalence was 13.88%. C. albicans occurred at a frequency of 83.02%, C."
		glabrata at 16.5% and C. tropicalis at 1.2%. A single C. dubliniensis isolate was
		identified in the sample population. The percentage of C. albicans significantly
		decreased from 83.02% in the sample population as a whole to 60.8% in subjects
		"over 45 years of age (P < 0.01) and that of C. glabrata, C. tropicalis and C."
		"krusei significantly increased from 13.88%, 0.9% and 0.03% to 29.7%, 6.7% and"
		1.4% (P < 0.05) respectively. The incidence of VC in the UAE is on the rise and
		the frequency of non-albicans Candida spp. is noticeably increasing especially in
		postmenopausal women.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is the second most common infection of
		the genital tract affecting millions of women worldwide. Data concerning the
		distribution and antifungal resistance of Candida species responsible of VVC vary
		among countries and population studied. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this work was to
		"determine the prevalence, species distribution and antifungal susceptibility"
		patterns of Candida species among symptomatic women over a 20-year period.
		"METHODS: A total of 5,820 unique samples were retrospectively identified. Out of"
		"them, 1,046 (18%) were diagnosed with VVC. RESULTS: Women between 18 and 30 years"
		had the highest prevalence rate of VVC (21%). Women aged less than 18 years and
		greater than 51 years had the highest prevalence rates of vaginal bacterial
		infections. Thirty-five (3.3%) women presented recurrent VVC. The most common
		"yeast isolated was C. albicans, followed by C. glabrata, C. krusei, and C."
		parapsilosis. Non-Candida albicans species (NAC) were more significantly isolated
		"among women aged 51 or above, than in women included in other groups (p < 0.01)."
		Resistance to fluconazole and amphotericin B was infrequent in C. albicans
		strains. Resistance to fluconazole and amphotericin B was infrequent in C.
		albicans strains. NAC species presented higher resistance rates against
		fluconazole (30%) and voriconazole (25%). C. krusei and C. glabrata isolates
		showed lower MICs than most of the strains against amphotericin B (1 mg/L) and
		flucytosine (1 mg/L). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated that continued
		surveillance on Candida species distribution and non-susceptibility rates to
		antifungals should be routinely reported to help the selection of the most
		"appropriate drug, to avoid the emergence of resistant strains, and to improve the"
		patient's outcomes.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Pregnant women are more susceptible to vaginal colonization and
		infection by yeast. The role of Candida colonization in the occurrence of preterm
		birth is well established. The knowledge of local epidemiology and identification
		of risk factors for preterm birth is important for the prevention and management
		strategies. The purpose of the study was to determine the prevalence of
		Candida sp. in vaginal swabs of pregnant women. METHODS: Pregnant women attending
		routine antenatal visits in three primary health centres in Bobo-Dioulasso
		(Burkina Faso) were enrolled into a cross-sectional study carried out from
		February to April 2015. Vaginal swabs samples were taken from participants after
		obtaining oral consent. The swabs were inoculated into Sabouraud's glucose agar
		supplemented with chloramphenicol and incubated at 37°C for 24 to 48hours under
		aerobic conditions in order to perform fungal culture. The identification of the
		Candida species was done by culture on HiCrome Candida Differential Agar at 35°C
		for 48h for production of species-specific colors. RESULTS: A total of
		229 pregnant women were included. The prevalence of vulvovaginal candidiasis
		"(VVC) was 22.71%, (95% CI [17.45-28.69]). Candida albicans accounted for 40.39%"
		"and non-Candida albicans species for 59.61% of the isolates, with mainly"
		"C. glabrata (32.69%), C. tropicalis (15.38%) and C. krusei (11.54%). CONCLUSIONS:"
		This study revealed a high prevalence of non-C. albicans species. The syndromic
		management guidelines for VVC in Burkina Faso will be revised to include a
		specific protocol for pregnant women.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: The goal of the study was to measure the prevalence of Candida spp. in
		the oral cavity of patients with diabetes types 1 and 2 when compared to healthy
		individuals and to study antifungal resistance profile of the isolates. DESIGN:
		There were 162 subjects in the study: diabetes type 1 (n=39); control group 1
		"(n=50): healthy individuals matched in gender, age, and oral conditions to"
		diabetes type 1 patients; diabetes type 2 (n=37); control group 2 (n=36) who were
		matched to each patient of the diabetes type 2 group. Stimulated saliva was
		collected and isolates were identified with phenotypic tests. The presence of C.
		dubliniensis was determined by multiplex PCR. RESULTS: There were no
		statistically significant differences in Candida spp. frequency between the
		diabetes 1 group and its control (p=0.443) nor between the diabetes 2 group and
		its control (p=0.429). C. albicans was the most frequently isolated yeast in all
		"groups. In the diabetes groups, C. stellatoidea, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis,"
		"C. lipolytica, C. glabrata, and C. krusei were also identified. Additionally, in"
		"control groups, C. kefyr was also detected. None of the isolates were resistant"
		to amphotericin B and flucytosine. A low percentage of the isolates were
		resistant to ketoconazole. CONCLUSIONS: No differences were detected in
		colonization of Candida spp. oral isolates from type 1 and type 2 diabetes when
		compared to matched controls. The antifungal resistance of Candida spp. isolates
		for ketoconazole from type 1 diabetes patients was significantly higher than that
		of its matched control.

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To investigate the risk factors and outcomes associated with Candida
		krusei bloodstream. METHODS: We performed a case control study of patients with
		C. krusei bloodstream infection at the University of Pennsylvania from 1982 to
		"2010. Controls were without candidemia, and matched to cases on duration of"
		hospitalization and underlying disease. RESULTS: We enrolled 34 cases and 114
		matched controls. Most subjects (62%) had hematologic malignancies. In the
		"multivariate model, including a priori the duration of fluconazole use (OR 1.06;"
		"95% CI 1.00, 1.11) and days of neutropenia (OR 1.01; 95% CI 0.98, 1.13), risk"
		factors associated with C. krusei bloodstream infection were splenectomy (OR
		"11.66; 95% CI 1.04, 130.64), and exposure to antimicrobials with anaerobic"
		"activity (OR 5.74; 95% CI 1.76, 18.67). Outcomes of infected patients were poor."
		"Only 32% of case patients survived to hospital discharge, compared to 89% of"
		controls. For 48% death was attributed to C. krusei infection. CONCLUSIONS: C.
		krusei bloodstream infection occurs most commonly in neutropenic patients with
		hematologic malignancy. The association with prior fluconazole exposure is less
		marked than previously described. Splenectomy and the receipt of antimicrobials
		with anaerobic activity are significant risk factors. The outcome of infected
		"patients remains poor, despite appropriate antifungal therapy."

		review.
PG	-	e954-66
LID	-	10.1016/j.ijid.2010.04.006 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candidemia is among the leading causes of nosocomial bloodstream
		infections and is associated with significant mortality. Several centers have
		published data regarding the incidence and relative frequency of Candida spp.
		OBJECTIVE: We performed a systematic review to summarize and evaluate the
		available evidence regarding the distribution of the relative frequency of
		"Candida spp isolated from blood, according to geographic region and study design,"
		during the period 1996 to 2009. METHODS: We searched PubMed and Scopus and
		retrieved 81 relevant articles reporting data on the relative frequency of
		Candida spp. RESULTS: C. albicans was the predominant species in almost all
		studies. The highest proportion of C. albicans was found in North and Central
		"Europe and the USA. Non-albicans species were more common in South America, Asia,"
		and South Europe. C. glabrata was commonly isolated in the USA and North and
		"Central Europe; C. parapsilosis in South America, South Europe, and several parts"
		of Asia; and C. tropicalis in South America and Asia. The relative frequency of
		C. krusei was low in all regions. Significant differences were noted depending on
		"study design (surveillance study, multicenter or single centre, prospective or"
		retrospective) and setting (hospital or intensive care unit). CONCLUSIONS:
		Significant geographic variation is evident among cases of candidemia in
		different parts of the world. Local epidemiological data continue to be of major
		significance.

PG	-	523-530
LID	-	10.1093/ejcts/ezab437 [doi]
AB	-	"OBJECTIVES: Postoperative mediastinitis, a feared complication after cardiac"
		"surgery, is associated with high mortality, especially of critically ill"
		"patients. Candida species infections are rare and severe, with poorly known"
		"outcomes. We conducted a case-control study to describe the characteristics,"
		management and outcomes of patients with postoperative Candida mediastinitis.
		"METHODS: This French, monocentre, retrospective study included all patients with"
		postoperative Candida mediastinitis (January 2003-February 2020) requiring
		intensive care unit admission. Candida mediastinitis patients (henceforth cases)
		"were matched 1:1 with postoperative bacterial mediastinitis (henceforth control),"
		"based on 3 factors during mediastinitis management: age >40 years, cardiac"
		transplantation and invasive circulatory device used. The primary end point was
		the probability of survival within 1 year after intensive care unit (ICU)
		admission. RESULTS: Forty cases were matched to 40 controls. The global
		"male/female ratio was 2.1, with mean age at admission 47.9 ± 13.8 years. Candida"
		"species were: 67.5% albicans, 17.5% glabrata, 15% parapsilosis, 5.0% tropicalis,"
		2.5% krusei and 2.5% lusitaniae. The median duration of mechanical ventilation
		"was 23, 68.8% of patients received renal replacement therapy and 62.5%"
		extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. The probability of survival within
		the first year after ICU admission was 40 ± 5.5% and was significantly lower for
		"cases than for controls (43 ± 8% vs 80 ± 6.3%, respectively; Log-rank test: P <"
		0.0001). The multivariable Cox proportional hazards model retained only renal
		"replacement therapy [hazard ratio (HR) 3.7, 95% confidence interval (CI)"
		"1.1-13.1; P = 0.04] and Candida mediastinitis (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.1-5.6; P = 0.04)"
		as independently associated with 1-year mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Candida
		mediastinitis is a serious event after cardiac surgery and independently
		associated with 1-year mortality. Further studies are needed to determine whether
		deaths are directly attributable to Candida mediastinitis.

		Candida spp.
PG	-	E419-23
AB	-	Oral candidiasis represents a serious problem for children with cancer. The
		"mortality rate of this infection has increased due to fungal septicemia,"
		associated with a primary buccal infection. OBJECTIVE: Identify the Candida spp.
		"in buccal lesions of patients with cancer, establish the predominant species and"
		"correlate them to age and sex of the patient, clinical presentation, type of"
		"neoplasic disease and cytostatic therapy received. STUDY DESIGN: 62 patients,"
		"between 0-16 years, were investigated in a cross sectional study. SAMPLE"
		INCLUSION CRITERIA: Patients with malignant neoplasic disease that were receiving
		cytostatic treatment and had suspicious lesions of oral candidiasis. Patients
		"with antifungal therapy, active caries, calculus or intraoral appliances were"
		excluded. A clinical evaluation was carried out. The lesion sample was taken and
		studied by direct exam and culture in CHROMagar-Candida and Sabouraud-Dextrose
		Agar with chloramphenicol. The identification of the isolated yeast was done by
		"the filamentation test, carbohydrate fermentation and assimilation. RESULTS: Most"
		"of the cases (69.35%) were positive to oral candidiasis, C. albicans was the most"
		"frequent species found, followed by C. parapsilosis (14.89%), C. tropicalis"
		"(12.77%), C. krusei (4.26%), C. glabrata (2.13%) and C. lusitaniae (2.13%). In"
		some cases more than one specie were isolated (9.30%). The most frequent location
		of the lesion was in the tongue (72.70%). The pseudomembranous candidiasis was
		the most frequent clinical presentation found (78.71%). There were not
		"significant statistically differences with regard to sex and age of the patient,"
		type of neoplasic disease and cytostatic agent received. CONCLUSION: The results
		suggest that oral candidiasis is a frequent complication in the pediatric
		"oncological population, being C. albicans the main etiological agent, however,"
		there is an important participation of other Candida species.

		"centre, we performed a systematic epidemiologic study on fungaemia due to rare"
		yeast. OBJECTIVES: We undertook the present prospective observational study to
		explore the epidemiological features and clinical characteristics of fungaemia
		due to rare yeasts in paediatric ICUs at our centre. METHODS: The successive
		yeasts isolated from blood at our PICUs during December 2017 through March 2019
		were identified by molecular methods. Fungaemia due to yeasts other than
		"C. albicans, C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, C. krusei and C. parapsilosis was"
		categorised as rare yeasts. Antifungal susceptibility testing of the yeast
		isolates was performed as per clinical and laboratory standards institute (CLSI)
		guidelines. We also compared different clinical parameters of fungaemia due to
		"common versus rare yeasts, and rare yeasts in neonates versus non-neonates."
		"RESULTS: During the study period, 212 yeast isolates were obtained from 159"
		"patients at PICUs of our hospital, and 127 isolates from 98 patients (61.6%) were"
		categorised as rare yeasts. Neonates acquired fungaemia significantly earlier
		after ICU admission than non-neonates (median:4 vs 6 days; p = .005). Regarding
		"epidemiology study of rare yeast fungaemia, Wickerhamomyces anomalus (43.8%) and"
		Candida utilis (40.8%) were common isolates; surgical intervention and
		"gastrointestinal disease were significantly associated; overall, azole,"
		"echinocandin and amphotericin B resistance was at 9.1%, 1.02% and 1.02%,"
		respectively; overall mortality was 65.3%. CONCLUSIONS: The emergence of rare
		yeasts especially W. anomalus and C. utilis causing fungaemia in our children
		demands urgent attention to control the spread.

AB	-	Major burn patients have characteristics that make them especially susceptible to
		"candidemia, but few studies focused on this have been published. The objectives"
		"were to evaluate the epidemiological, microbiological and clinical aspects of"
		"candidemia in major burn patients, determining factors associated with a poorer"
		prognosis and mortality. We conducted a retrospective observational study of
		candidemia between 1996 and 2012 in major burn patients admitted to the La Fe
		"University Hospital, Valencia, Spain. The study included 36 episodes of"
		"candidemia in the same number of patients, 55.6% men, mean age 37.33 years and"
		low associated comorbidity. The incidence of candidemia varied between 0.26 and
		6.09 episodes/1000 days stay in the different years studied. Candida albicans was
		the most common species (61.1%) followed by Candida parapsilosis (27.8%).
		"Candidemia by C. krusei, C. glabrata or C. tropicalis were all identified after"
		2004. Central vascular catheter (CVC) was established as a potential source of
		"candidemia in 36.1%, followed by skin and soft tissues of thermal injury (22.2%)"
		and urinary tract (8.3%). Fluconazole was used in 19 patients (52.7%) and its in
		"vitro resistance rate was 13.9%. The overall mortality was 47.2%, and mortality"
		related to candidemia was 30.6%. Factors associated with increased mortality were
		those related to severe infection and shock. CVC was the most usual focus of
		candidemia. Fluconazole was the most common antifungal drug administered. The
		management of candidemia in major burn patients is still a challenge.

TI	-	Vulvovaginal candidiasis: species distribution of Candida and their antifungal
		susceptibility pattern.
PG	-	94
LID	-	10.1186/s12905-018-0607-z [doi]
LID	-	94
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Vulvovaginal candidiasis is a global issue of concern due to its
		"association with economic costs, sexually transmitted infections, and ascending"
		genital tract infection. The aim of this study was to determine species
		distribution and antifungal susceptibility pattern of Candida species causing
		vulvovaginal candidiasis. METHODS: A cross sectional study was conducted from
		November 2015 to December 2016 at the Family Guidance Association of Ethiopia.
		Vaginal swabs collected from study subjects that were clinically diagnosed with
		vulvovaginal candidiasis were cultured. Yeast identification and antifungal
		susceptibility testing were determined by the automated VITEK 2 compact system.
		The association of vulvovaginal candidiasis with possible risk factors was
		assessed and analyzed using SPSS version 20. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of
		vulvovaginal candidiasis was 41.4%. The association of vulvovaginal candidiasis
		"was statistically significant with previous genital tract infection (p = 0.004),"
		"number of life-time male sex partners (p = .037), and number of male sex partners"
		"in 12 month (p = 0.001). Of 87 Candida isolates recovered, 58.6% were C. albicans"
		while 41.4% were non-albicans Candida species. The highest overall drug
		"resistance rate of Candida species was observed against fluconazole (17.2%),"
		followed by flycytosine (5.7%). All Candida isolates were 100% susceptible to
		"voriconazole, caspofungin, and micafungin. C. albicans, was 100% susceptible to"
		all drugs tested except fluconazole and flycytosine with a resistance rate of 2%
		"each drug. C. krusei, was 100 and 33.3% resistant to fluconazole and flycytosine,"
		respectively. CONCLUSIONS: High prevalence rate of vulvovaginal candidiasis and
		observation of high prevalence rate of non-albicans Candida species in the
		"present study substantiate, the importance of conducting continuous"
		epidemiological surveys to measure changes in species distribution from C.
		"albicans to non-albicans Candida species in Ethiopia. Although, fluconazole still"
		appeared to be active against all isolates of C. albicans and non-albicans
		Candida species high resistance rate of C. krusei against the drug may
		demonstrate a search for alternative antifungal drugs when treating vulvovaginal
		candidiasis caused by C. krusei.

PG	-	e13486
LID	-	10.1111/tid.13486 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Data on the risk factors and outcome of intra-abdominal fungal
		infections (IAFI) following simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation (PKT)
		are scarce. MATERIALS/METHODS: A retrospective monocentric study was conducted on
		all patients who underwent simultaneous PKT from January 2007 to December 2016.
		Deep sites positive cultures for fungi during the first post-transplantation year
		"were collected. Clinical, radiological, and microbiological data of proven and"
		probable invasive fungal infections were analysed. RESULTS: Among sixteen PKT
		"patients, 15 were included. Seven patients (47%) developed an invasive fungal"
		"infection, exclusively IAFI (six proven, one probable). The proven IAFI included"
		"four peritonitis, one pancreatic necrosis with infected hematoma, and one patient"
		with positive preservation fluid only (PF). Candida albicans (n = 4) was the most
		"prevalent species (associated with Galactomyces candidus in one case), C"
		"glabrata, C dubliniensis, and C krusei were found in one case each. Three"
		patients had either a positive direct examination and/or culture for renal or
		pancreatic PF and the culture of PF was positive for the same species that caused
		IAFI. IAFIs were significantly associated with pancreatic graft arterial
		"thrombosis (5/7 vs 0/8, P = .007) and fungal contamination of PF (3/7 vs 0/8,"
		"P = .008). Among patients with IAFI, all required an early surgical revision"
		post-transplantation [1-18 days] and six had early or delayed pancreatic graft
		removal. One patient died in the first post-transplant year. CONCLUSION: IAFI is
		"a common complication in PKT, associated with pancreatic graft thrombosis or"
		"fungal contamination of the graft PF, and can sometimes lead to pancreatic"
		detransplantation.

		"infection of the neonate. We aimed to determine the prevalence of VVC, identify"
		"the recent and most frequently occurring species of Candida in pregnant women,"
		and determine the most effective antifungal drug of choice for treatment. METHOD:
		A prospective cross-sectional study in which 176 high vaginal swab samples of
		consented pregnant women visiting the antenatal clinic from February 2018 to
		April 2018 were subjected to direct gram smear and culture for Candida isolation.
		Candida isolates were identified using a germ tube test and HiCrome Candida
		differential agar. Candida isolates were then subjected to a disk diffusion
		"method using fluconazole (25 μg), nystatin (100 units), and voriconazole (1 μg)"
		on Mueller-Hinton agar supplemented with 2% (w/v) glucose and 0.5 μg/ml methylene
		blue dye to determine the susceptibility pattern as per the guidelines of the
		Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI). Chi-square analysis was used to
		ascertain the significant association of participants' sociodemographics and
		clinical presentations to VVC. A univariate logistic regression model was used to
		identify potential risk factors of VVC. RESULTS: The prevalence of VVC among our
		study participants was 30.7%. Non-albicans Candida (NAC) and Candida albicans had
		"a prevalence of 74.1 and 25.9%, respectively. Candida glabrata was the most"
		"common species, followed by Candida albicans, Candida krusei, and Candida"
		"parapsilosis. 50.0, 18.5 and 3.7% of Candida species were susceptible to"
		"voriconazole, fluconazole and nystatin, respectively, whereas 37.0, 48.1 and 9.3%"
		"of Candida species were resistant to voriconazole, fluconazole and nystatin,"
		respectively. The majority of isolates were susceptible dose dependent to all
		"three antifungal agents, with voriconazole being the most efficacious antifungal"
		agent. There was no significant association between participants'
		socio-demographic information and clinical presentations to VVC. CONCLUSION: The
		prevalence of VVC was high in the study area. C. glabrata was found to be the
		"most common cause of VVC among the pregnant women attending antenatal clinics, in"
		the Ho Municipality region of Ghana. The majority of the Candida isolates were
		"susceptible and resistant to voriconazole and fluconazole, respectively."

AB	-	PURPOSE: To analyze trends in incidence and mortality of candidemia in intensive
		care units (ICUs) vs. non-ICU hospitalized patients and to determine risk factors
		for infection by specific species and for death. METHODS: Active hospital-based
		surveillance program of incident episodes of candidemia due to common species in
		"24 tertiary care hospitals in the Paris area, France between October 2002 and"
		"September 2010. RESULTS: Among 2,507 adult cases included, 2,571 Candida isolates"
		"were collected and species were C. albicans (56 %), C. glabrata (18.6 %), C."
		"parapsilosis (11.5 %), C. tropicalis (9.3 %), C. krusei (2.9 %), and C. kefyr"
		"(1.8 %). Candidemia occurred in ICU in 1,206 patients (48.1 %). When comparing"
		"ICU vs. non-ICU patients, the former had significantly more frequent surgery"
		"during the past 30 days, were more often preexposed to fluconazole and treated"
		"with echinocandin, and were less frequently infected with C. parapsilosis. Risk"
		factors and age remained unchanged during the study period. A significant
		increased incidence in the overall population and ICU was found. The odds of
		being infected with a given species in ICU was influenced by risk factors and
		preexposure to fluconazole and caspofungin. Echinocandins initial therapy
		"increased over time in ICU (4.6 % first year of study, to 48.5 % last year of"
		"study, p < 0.0001). ICU patients had a higher day-30 death rate than non-ICU"
		patients (odds ratio [OR] 2.12; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.66-2.72; p <
		0.0001). The day-30 and early (<day 8) death rates increased over time in ICU
		(from 41.5 % the first to 56.9 % the last year of study (p = 0.001) and 28.7-38.8
		"% (p = 0.0292), respectively). Independent risk factors for day-30 death in ICU"
		"were age, arterial catheter, Candida species, preexposure to caspofungin, and"
		lack of antifungal therapy at the time of blood cultures results (p < 0.05).
		CONCLUSIONS: The availability of new antifungals and the publication of numerous
		guidelines did not prevent an increase of candidemia and death in ICU patients in
		the Paris area.

AB	-	"OBJECTIVES: To determine the epidemiology of Candida bloodstream infections,"
		"variables influencing mortality, and antifungal resistance rates in ICUs in"
		"Spain. DESIGN: Prospective, observational, multicenter population-based study."
		SETTING: Medical and surgical ICUs in 29 hospitals distributed throughout five
		metropolitan areas of Spain. PATIENTS: Adult patients (≥ 18 yr) with an episode
		of Candida bloodstream infection during admission to any surveillance area ICU
		from May 2010 to April 2011. INTERVENTIONS: Candida isolates were sent to a
		reference laboratory for species identification by DNA sequencing and
		susceptibility testing using the methods and breakpoint criteria promulgated by
		the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing. Prognostic
		factors associated with early (0-7 d) and late (8-30 d) mortality were analyzed
		using logistic regression modeling. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We detected
		"773 cases of candidemia, 752 of which were included in the overall cohort. Among"
		"these, 168 (22.3%) occurred in adult ICU patients. The rank order of Candida"
		"isolates was as follows: Candida albicans (52%), Candida parapsilosis (23.7%),"
		"Candida glabrata (12.7%), Candida tropicalis (5.8%), Candida krusei (4%), and"
		others (1.8%). Overall susceptibility to fluconazole was 79.2%. Cumulative
		mortality at 7 and 30 days after the first episode of candidemia was 16.5% and
		"47%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that early appropriate antifungal"
		"treatment and catheter removal (odds ratio, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.08-0.91), Acute"
		"Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (odds ratio, 1.11; 95% CI,"
		"1.04-1.19), and abdominal source (odds ratio, 8.15; 95% CI, 1.75-37.93) were"
		independently associated with early mortality. Determinants of late mortality
		"were age (odds ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.07), intubation (odds ratio, 7.24; 95%"
		"CI, 2.24-23.40), renal replacement therapy (odds ratio, 6.12; 95% CI,"
		"2.24-16.73), and primary source (odds ratio, 2.51; 95% CI, 1.06-5.95)."
		CONCLUSIONS: Candidemia in ICU patients is caused by non-albicans species in 48%
		"of cases, C. parapsilosis being the most common among these. Overall mortality"
		remains high and mainly related with host factors. Prompt adequate antifungal
		treatment and catheter removal could be critical to decrease early mortality.

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To identify the epidemiology and antifungal susceptibilities of
		Candida spp. among blood culture isolates to identify the epidemiology and
		antifungal susceptibilities of Candida spp. among blood culture isolates in
		"Sweden. METHODS: The study was a retrospective, observational nationwide"
		laboratory-based surveillance for fungaemia and fungal meningitis and was
		"conducted from September 2015 to August 2016. RESULTS: In total, 488 Candida"
		blood culture isolates were obtained from 471 patients (58% males). Compared to
		"our previous study, the incidence of candidaemia has increased from 4.2/100 000"
		(2005-2006) to 4.7/100 000 population/year (2015-2016). The three most common
		"Candida spp. isolated from blood cultures were Candida albicans (54.7%), Candida"
		glabrata (19.7%) and species in the Candida parapsilosis complex (9.4%). Candida
		"resistance to fluconazole was 2% in C. albicans and between 0% and 100%, in"
		non-albicans species other than C. glabrata and C. krusei. Resistance to
		"voriconazole was rare, except for C. glabrata, C. krusei and C. tropicalis."
		Resistance to anidulafungin was 3.8% while no Candida isolate was resistant to
		amphotericin B. CONCLUSIONS: We report an overall increase in candidaemia but a
		minor decrease of C. albicans while C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis remain
		constant over this 10-year period.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Osteomyelitis due to Candida krusei are extremely rare, given that"
		"only six cases have been reported, all of which are limited to the patients with"
		immunocompromising risk factors. Here we report a case of C. krusei osteomyelitis
		"in an immunocompetent patient, presenting with multiple huge cystic lesions of"
		talus. CASE PRESENTATION: A 66-year-old female presented with one year history of
		painful swelling of right ankle and a draining sinus around lateral malleolus.
		"Five months and three months ago, she had undergone arthroscopic synovectomy and"
		bursectomy which revealed no causative organism. Open bursectomy with sinus tract
		excision was performed and intravenous antibiotic was administered. Two year
		"after the surgery, the patient revisited the clinic for recurrent painful"
		swelling with pus drainage at the same location. Multiple huge cystic lesions
		with osteolysis and sclerotic rim of talus were found and C. krusei was isolated
		from tissue culture. The patient received surgical debridement and prolonged
		antifungal treatment comprising caspofungin and voriconazole. CONCLUSIONS: In
		"this case, C. krusei infection showed atypically aggressive osteolysis shown as"
		multiple huge cystic abscess. High index of suspicion is critical for early
		diagnosis and treatment to prevent such devastating results even in an
		immunocompetent patient.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating
		autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system. Since immune system
		"plays a key role in this disease, patients with MS can present higher risk of"
		infections. PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of Candida
		spp. in the oral cavity of MS patients in relation to a control group METHODS: In
		"total, 100 individuals were selected: 55 diagnosed with MS and 45 healthy"
		individuals (control group). Saliva samples were collected and seeded in culture
		"media selecting for Candida. Following an incubation period of 48 h,"
		colony-forming units (CFU mL(-1)) were counted and colonies were isolated for
		Candida species identification by multiplex PCR. The results were analysed by
		chi-squared and Mann-Whitney U statistical tests considering a significance level
		of 5%. RESULTS: Candida spp. were confirmed in the oral cavity of 50.09% patients
		in the MS group and 35.55% individuals in the control group. In individuals
		"positive for the growth of Candida spp., the median values of Candida colonies"
		were 220 CFU mL(-1) for the MS group and 120 CFU mL(-1) for the control group.
		"However, no statistically significant differences were observed between groups"
		"for both prevalence and CFU mL(-1) count. Of the Candida species identified,"
		"73.91% were C. albicans, 21.73% C. glabrata, 2.17% C. tropicalis, and 2.17% C."
		krusei. CONCLUSIONS: The colonization of Candida spp. in the oral cavity of
		individuals with multiple sclerosis was higher than in the control group; however
		these findings were not proven to be statistically significant.

AB	-	Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC) is a major health problem for sexually
		active women because of its severe effect on their quality of life. A thorough
		"knowledge of their epidemiology leads to their efficient management. Therefore, a"
		cross-sectional study was conducted in 2014 in women with leucorrhoea associated
		or not with other clinical signs. Recurrence was based on the occurrence of at
		least four annual episodes of Candida vulvo-vaginitis. An individual interview
		based on a questionnaire was conducted to identify the socio-demographic
		parameters that could be associated with the RVVC. Vaginal samples were collected
		at the obstetrical gynaecology department of the University Hospital of Cocody
		"and at the Pasteur Institute of Côte d'Ivoire. On each sample, a direct"
		examination and culture on Sabouraud-chloramphenicol medium with or without
		actidione were performed. Yeast identification was performed using chromogenic
		media (CandiSelect(®)4 [Bio-Rad]) and the study of sugar assimilation using the
		Auxacolor(®) 2 gallery (Bio-Rad). A total of 400 patients were included. The
		"average age was 29.2 years (SD=7.2 years). Of these, 94 had recurrent"
		"vulvovaginal candidiasis, with a prevalence of 23.5% (CI(95%): 19.49-28.02). Five"
		"species of the genus Candida have been identified: Candida albicans (59.6%),"
		"Candida glabrata (19.1%), Candida tropicalis (16%), Candida krusei (4.2%) and"
		"Candida inconspicua (1.1%). Some factors such as education level, history of"
		"sexually transmitted infection, type of underwear used, frequency of personal"
		hygiene and type of product used for these hygiene have been associated with the
		occurrence of RVVCs. The occurrence of RVVCs is relatively high in our study
		population. Non-albicansCandida species occupy a significant place in this
		disease epidemiology. By addressing the factors associated with the occurrence
		"and/or persistence of RVVCs, it will be possible to reduce their incidence in"
		sexually active women.

AB	-	PURPOSE: To assess the risk factors and outcomes associated with fungemia caused
		by the six most commonly occurring Candida species in patients with and without
		malignancies. METHODS: Analysis of the episodes of fungemia due to common Candida
		"species in adults, based on an active hospital-based surveillance program (Paris"
		"area, France, 2002 to 2014). RESULTS: Of the 3417 patients (3666 isolates), 1164"
		(34.1%) had a solid tumor (45.7% digestive tract) and 586 (17.1%) a hematological
		"malignancy (41.8% lymphoma, 33.5% acute leukemia). The hematology patients were"
		"significantly younger, more often pre-exposed to antifungals, more often infected"
		"by C. tropicalis, C. krusei, or C. kefyr, and more often treated in the first"
		instance with an echinocandin. Compared with inpatients who were not in ICU at
		"the time of fungemia, those in ICU were less frequently infected by"
		"C. parapsilosis (p < 0.02), had more recent surgery (p < 0.03), and died more"
		frequently before day 8 and day 30 (p < 0.0001). An increase in crude mortality
		over time in ICU was observed only in oncology patients (p < 0.04). For all
		"patients, lack of prescription of antifungals despite knowledge of positive blood"
		culture increased the risk of death. The odds of being infected by a given
		"Candida species compared with C. albicans were uneven regarding age, gender, type"
		"of malignancy, hospitalization in ICU, central venous catheter, HIV status,"
		"intravenous drug addiction, and previous exposure to antifungal drugs. Compared"
		"with C. albicans, C. glabrata (OR = 0.69 [0.54-0.89]) and C. parapsilosis"
		(OR = 0.49 [0.35-0.67]) were associated with a decreased risk of death by day 8
		and day 30. CONCLUSION: The clinical context of underlying malignancy and
		hospitalization in ICU may be relevant to the initial management of candidemia.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Vaginal candidiasis is frequent in pregnant women and is associated
		with sepsis and adverse neonatal outcomes. This study determined the prevalence
		of candida species in symptomatic pregnant women and evaluated the antifungal
		susceptibility profile of the isolated Candida strains. It also aimed to explore
		whether Candida species predicts gestational complications and adverse neonatal
		outcomes. METHODS: A total of 258 pregnant women with vaginal discharge at 35 to
		37 week of gestation participated in this study. Vaginal swabs from these
		patients were collected at various obstetrics and gynecology clinics in Lebanon
		for a period of 14 months. Candida isolates were identified at species level and
		"antifungal susceptibility of Candida albicans to fluconazole (FCZ), amphotericin"
		"B (AMB), itraconazole (ICZ) and voriconazole (VCZ) was determined by the"
		"agar-based E-test method. RESULTS: Among 258 women tested, 100 (39%) were"
		"positive for Candida species. C. albicans, C. glabrata and C. krusei were"
		"isolated from 42, 41 and 17% of the women, respectively. C. albicans was"
		significantly associated only with gestational diabetes while C. krusei or C.
		glabrata had significant positive associations with other gestational
		complications. The antifungal susceptibility tests of C. albicans isolates
		"revealed 97.5, 90, 87.5 and 97.5% susceptibility to AMB, FCZ, ICZ and VCZ,"
		respectively. CONCLUSION: The current study revealed high incidence of both C.
		albicans and non-C. albicans Candida strains causing vulvovaginitis among
		"pregnant women in Beirut, Lebanon. Candida screening as antenatal follow up is"
		advised to minimize the risk of adverse neonatal outcome or gestational
		complications.

		a case report and an updated literature review.
PG	-	e16-22
LID	-	10.1016/j.ijid.2011.10.001 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: We present a case of bilateral polymicrobial osteomyelitis with
		"Candida tropicalis and Candida krusei, and review the literature on Candida"
		osteomyelitis. METHODS: PubMed was searched for cases of Candida osteomyelitis
		published in the English-language literature between 1970 and 2010. CASE: A
		60-year-old previously healthy man was hospitalized with gallstone pancreatitis.
		"Between 3 weeks and 6 months after hospitalization, he developed bilateral"
		osteomyelitis of the feet with C. tropicalis and C. krusei. The patient was
		"treated with surgery, fluconazole, and a liposomal formulation of amphotericin B."
		"The left lower limb was amputated, and at a 2-year follow-up, the patient had"
		almost no pain in his right foot. LITERATURE REVIEW: We identified 40 new cases
		in the literature since the latest review in 2004. Most cases of Candida
		"osteomyelitis are caused by Candida albicans, but an increasing number are caused"
		"by non-albicans species. The prognosis is favorable, with full recovery in the"
		majority of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Candida osteomyelitis should be considered when a
		"patient presents with risk factors and pain without previous trauma, because"
		"Candida, despite being part of the normal flora, is the fourth leading cause of"
		hematogenous nosocomial infections. The recommended treatment is surgery and
		"fluconazole as monotherapy or initially combined with a fungicidal agent, either"
		a different amphotericin B formulation or an echinocandin.

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to determine the frequency of Candida species in
		women of different age groups as well as to suggest the criteria for the
		diagnosis of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC). STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study of
		"vulvovaginal candidiasis was carried out using laboratory diagnosis, with the"
		estimation of vaginal pH and the direct microscopic and biochemical examination
		of vaginal discharge/secretions. Vaginal cultures for Candida species were
		"collected from 1050 women with vulvovaginal symptoms. RESULTS: Out of 1050 women,"
		"215 (20.47%) were positive for Candida species. Of 215 women, 172 (80%) had pH"
		within the normal range and 167 (77.67%) were showing yeast cells and mycelia on
		"direct microscopic examination. Candida albicans accounted for 46.9% of cases,"
		"Candida glabrata 36.7%, Candida parapsilosis 10.2%, Candida tropicalis 2.8%,"
		"Candida krusei 1.4%, and Candida kiefer 1.9%. The frequency of culture positivity"
		"was related to pregnancy (P<0.001), an increase in parity (P<0.001), and use of"
		oral contraceptives (P<0.001) and antibiotics (P<0.001). The most common signs
		and symptoms in 215 women with positive cultures were pruritus with or without
		vaginal discharge and vaginal erythema. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that
		vulvovaginal candidiasis can only be diagnosed by using clinical criteria in
		correlation with vulvovaginal symptoms and Candida cultures.

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: Breakthrough candidemia (BTC) on fluconazole was associated with
		non-susceptible Candida spp. and increased mortality. This nationwide FUNGINOS
		study analyzed clinical and mycological BTC characteristics. METHODS: A 3-year
		prospective study was conducted in 567 consecutive candidemias. Species
		identification and antifungal susceptibility testing (CLSI) were performed in the
		FUNGINOS reference laboratory. Data were analyzed according to STROBE criteria.
		"RESULTS: 43/576 (8%) BTC occurred: 37/43 (86%) on fluconazole (28 prophylaxis,"
		median 200 mg/day). 21% BTC vs. 23% non-BTC presented severe sepsis/septic shock.
		Overall mortality was 34% vs. 32%. BTC was associated with gastrointestinal
		"mucositis (multivariate OR 5.25, 95%CI 2.23-12.40, p < 0.001) and"
		"graft-versus-host-disease (6.25, 1.00-38.87, p = 0.05), immunosuppression (2.42,"
		"1.03-5.68, p = 0.043), and parenteral nutrition (2.87, 1.44-5.71, p = 0.003)."
		Non-albicans Candida were isolated in 58% BTC vs. 35% non-BTC (p = 0.005). 63% of
		"16 BTC occurring after 10-day fluconazole were non-susceptible (Candida glabrata,"
		"Candida krusei, Candida norvegensis) vs. 19% of 21 BTC (C. glabrata) following"
		"shorter exposure (7.10, 1.60-31.30, p = 0.007). Median fluconazole MIC was 4 mg/l"
		vs. 0.25 mg/l (p < 0.001). Ten-day fluconazole exposure predicted non-susceptible
		BTC with 73% accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes of BTC and non-BTC were similar.
		Fluconazole non-susceptible BTC occurred in three out of four cases after
		prolonged low-dose prophylaxis. This implies reassessment of prophylaxis duration
		and rapid de-escalation of empirical therapy in BTC after short fluconazole
		exposure.

TI	-	Fungal peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis: 5-year review from a North China
		center.
PG	-	35-43
LID	-	10.1007/s15010-018-1204-7 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: Fungal peritonitis (FP) is a rare but devastating complication in
		"peritoneal dialysis (PD), accounting for high rates of technique failure,"
		morbidity and mortality. This study was conducted to investigate FPs with regard
		"to peritonitis rate, microbiology testing, patient characteristics, clinical"
		"features, antifungal treatments, and clinical outcomes in patients on PD."
		METHODS: This single-center study retrospectively reviewed all FP episodes
		"diagnosed from June 1, 2012 to June, 2017. All FPs were matched in a 1:5 ratio"
		"with PD patients diagnosed with bacterial peritonitis. Clinical, biochemical"
		characteristics and detailed data on peritonitis episodes were recorded. RESULTS:
		Eleven fungal peritonitis episodes (rate of 0.0067 episodes per patient-year on
		dialysis) were identified. All FPs were caused by Candida species (identification
		and antifungal susceptibility testing were performed with VITEK 2(®) compact
		"system), including C. albicans (6/11), C. parapsilosis (4/11) and C. krusei"
		"(1/11). Except C. krusei, no Candida resistance to fluconazole was detected."
		"Compared to bacterial peritonitis (matched cases, n = 55), FP group showed higher"
		"rate of previous antibiotic use (p = 0.002), higher total effluent cell count"
		"(p = 0.007), and lower serum albumin (p = 0.01), higher rate of infection-related"
		"surgery (p < 0.001), HD transfer (p = 0.001), and all-cause death (p = 0.006)."
		"High prevalence (≥ 50%) of female gender, anuria, CCI ≥ 4, hypoalbuminemia,"
		"anemia, and hypokalemia were also observed in FP patients. More than half of the"
		FP patients presented gastrointestinal symptoms (7/11) and extraperitoneal
		infection (6/11). Eight (72.7%) patients had catheter surgically removed with a
		"median 5.5 lag days, four (36.4%) patients died within 3 months and six (54.5%)"
		cases led to technique failure. CONCLUSIONS: FP results in high rates of catheter
		"loss and all-cause mortality in 3 months of follow-up, candida species were the"
		commonest pathogens in our center. Variations of clinical features and
		susceptibility patterns were observed. Gastrointestinal disorders maybe a
		potential risk factor for FP.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive candidiasis (IC) is the most common invasive fungal
		infection. The epidemiology of IC in hospitalized patients has been widely
		"investigated in many metropolitan cities; however, little information from medium"
		and small cities is known. METHODS: A 5-year retrospective study was carried out
		"to analyze the prevalence, species distribution, antifungal susceptibility, risk"
		factors and mortality of inpatients with invasive Candida infection in a regional
		tertiary teaching hospital in Southwest China. RESULTS: A total of 243 inpatients
		with invasive Candida infection during the five-year study period were
		"identified, with a mean annual incidence of 0.41 cases per 1000 admissions and a"
		"30-day mortality rate of 12.3%. The species distributions of Candida albicans,"
		"Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, Candida krusei, Candida parapsilosis and"
		"other Candida species was 45.3, 30.0, 15.2, 4.9, 2.1 and 2.5%, respectively. The"
		"total resistance rates of fluconazole (FCA), itraconazole (ITR) and voriconazole"
		"(VRC) were 18.6, 23.1 and 18.5%, respectively. Respiratory dysfunction, pulmonary"
		"infection, cardiovascular disease, chronic/acute renal failure, mechanical"
		"ventilation, abdominal surgery, intensive care in adults, septic shock and IC due"
		to C. albicans were associated with 30-day mortality (P < 0.05) according to the

		"commonly identified (36.5%), followed by C. glabrata (27.2%), C. parapsilosis"
		"(25.7%), and C. krusei (2.4%). Clinical presentation of C. tropicalis candidemia"
		was most severe with highest median C-reactive protein level (10.1 mg/dL) and
		"Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (14, both P ≪ 0.05). C."
		tropicalis showed the highest 14- and 30-day mortality (28.9% and 44.1%). In
		"multivariate analysis, C. tropicalis infection was significantly related with 14-"
		"(P = 0.005) and 30-day mortality (P = 0.033). In conclusion, C. tropicalis"
		infection presented most severely and showed worst clinical outcome among
		non-albicans candidemia.

		0.33% of total patient discharges. These percentages represent a 20-fold increase
		in the incidence of candidemia at our hospital in comparison with that during

		Mortality was associated with higher APACHE II scores (25 for nonsurvivors vs. 16
		"for survivors; P = .0001), the presence of a rapidly fatal underlying illness (P"
		"= .0009), and sustained positivity of blood cultures (P = .02). In cases of"

		sequelae. There has been a marked increase in the incidence of candidemia in our
		institution that is associated with a high overall mortality. Candidemia lasting
		less than 24 hours was associated with a lower mortality than was that of longer

AB	-	BACKGROUND: A sudden rise of Candida krusei candidemia cases was noticed in our
		hospital within 1 year with maximum cases from paediatric unit. The present study
		reports the results of epidemiological investigation of possible outbreak of
		candidemia by C. krusei in paediatric unit at our tertiary care centre. METHODS:
		Clinical characteristics and risk factors associated with C. krusei candidemia
		were evaluated. Yeast identification and antifungal susceptibility testing was
		performed according to standard protocol. To find the potential source of C.
		"krusei in hospital environment and hand colonization, swabs were collected from"
		"different fomites (n = 40) and hand washings from 24 health care workers (HCW),"
		respectively. Infection control and prevention practices were intensified
		following the recognition of outbreak. Genetic typing was done by fluorescent
		amplified fragment length polymorphism (FAFLP) technique. Case-control comparison
		was performed with C. tropicalis and C. pelliculosa cases. RESULTS: Candida
		"krusei fungaemia significantly affected paediatric group (82/186, 44%) as"
		"compared to adults (14/130, 10.8%; p < 0.001). Among paediatric group, maximum"
		isolation was reported from neonatal unit of paediatric emergency (NUPE). C.
		krusei was isolated from hands of one HCW and washbasin in NUPE. FAFLP revealed
		clonality between blood and environmental isolates indicating cross-transmission
		"of C. krusei. Gastrointestinal disease (p = 0.018), previous antibiotics"
		"(p = 0.021) especially to carbapenems (p = 0.039), was significant among C."
		krusei candidemia cases compared to C. pelliculosa cases. CONCLUSION: We report
		the largest outbreak of C. krusei candidemia in paediatric unit within 1 year
		with isolation of related strains from environment and hands of HCW. Routine
		screening of hand hygiene practices revealed non-compliance to standard practices
		leading to the increase in C. krusei candidemia cases.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Different yeast species have different susceptibilities to commonly
		"prescribed antifungal drugs. Thus, it is important to accurately determine the"
		"species of pathogenic yeasts, especially when more than one species are in a"
		specimen. METHODS: Clinically significant yeast isolates were collected via the
		Taiwan Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance of Yeasts from July to September
		in 2010. The identifications of isolates were assessed in the core laboratory at
		"the National Health Research Institutes. RESULTS: Of the 1127 isolates recovered,"
		"1088 were of Candida genus, accounting for 96.53% of the total isolates, followed"
		"by Cryptococcus (15, 1.33%), Trichosporon (12, 1.06%), Kodamaea (4, 0.35%),"
		"Pichia (4, 0.35%), and three others. In all, 38 out of 1116 (3.4%) specimens had"
		"mixed yeast cultures. One ascites specimen had three species, Candida albicans,"
		"Candida glabrata, and Candida tropicalis. In the remaining 37 specimens, 16 had a"
		"combination of C. albicans and C. glabrata, eight C. albicans and C. tropicalis,"
		"five C. glabrata and C. tropicalis, three Candida krusei and C. tropicalis, and"
		five with different combinations. CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of cultures
		"with mixed yeasts may be an emerging issue. Thus, to determine mixed yeast"
		"cultures in the same specimen, we highly recommend CHROMagar Candida medium to"
		culture yeast isolates directly from the specimen.

PG	-	780-785
AB	-	A retrospective analysis of fungal infections was carried out in a health-care
		burn center between 2011 and 2014 using the patients' medical records (n = 36).
		"Patients ranged from 18 to 87 years of age, with 23 (63.9%) being women. The most"
		prevalent widespread total body surface area affected (TBSA) was 30-50% (p =
		"0.03), and 71-100% in younger patients, mainly associated with femicide. Fourth"
		"degree burns were revealed in 69.4% of the patients while in 50%, inhalation"
		injuries were observed to represent a higher mortality rate (p = 0.04). The
		Candida score was 3 in 77.7% of cases respectively. Central venous catheter and
		mechanical ventilation were used. All patients received antibiotic treatment and
		91.7% antifungal treatment. Surgical excision of the burn was performed in 33
		"(91.7%) patients, and skin autografting in 29 (80.6%). The median of the fungal"
		infection developed was 21.4 days after admission to the ICU. The specimens
		analyzed involved 52 yeast samples isolated from different cultures: urine
		"(42.3%), blood (26.9%), skin biopsy (9.6%), catheter tip (15.4%) and tracheal"
		aspirate (5.8%). The use of microbiological culture and molecular methods allowed
		"for the identification of Candida albicans (53.8%), C. tropicalis (23.1%), C."
		"parapsilosis sensu stricto (13.5%), C. krusei (5.8%), C. glabrata (1.9%) and C."
		dubliniensis (1.9%). Fungal infections observed in skin burns lead to severe
		complications in at-risk patients.

PG	-	S120-5
AB	-	This study reviews data on patients with fungemia and confirms the high
		prevalence (50%) of infections caused by non-albicans species of Candida.
		Fungemia due to C. albicans or Torulopsis glabrata occurred significantly more
		"often in patients with a solid tumor, while fungemia due to Candida tropicalis or"
		Candida krusei was significantly more common in patients with hematologic
		"malignancy (P = .001). For 31% of patients, only a single blood culture was"
		"positive for yeasts, and the prognosis for these patients was not significantly"
		different than that for patients with three or more positive blood cultures (P =
		"1), including those who had C. albicans fungemia. The overall mortality rate was"
		"41.8%, which is much lower than that previously reported in studies of patients"
		with cancer. No significant difference was observed between patients treated with
		amphotericin B and those treated with fluconazole in this retrospective analysis.
		Although no significant difference was observed in the mortality rate among
		"patients who had fungemia with or without neutropenia, the incidence of"
		disseminated candidiasis was significantly higher among neutropenic patients (P =
		.03).

PG	-	107-119
LID	-	10.1007/s10123-018-0014-1 [doi]
AB	-	Recent changes in the aetiology and epidemiology of invasive candidiasis have
		"serious implications for current and future diagnosis, treatment and prognosis."
		The aim of the current review was to discuss the epidemiology of invasive
		"candidiasis, the distribution of Candida species in different regions of the"
		"world, the medical concerns of the changing aetiology and the emergence of"
		"antifungal resistance. Overall burden of invasive candidiasis remains high,"
		"especially in vulnerable persons, such as the elderly, immunosuppressed or"
		"debilitated patients. Moreover, there is a progressive shift in the aetiology of"
		"invasive candidiasis from Candida albicans to other species of Candida, probably"
		related to the increased use of azole drugs with a clear trend towards increased
		"antifungal resistance. Finally, the emergence and rise of multiresistant species,"
		"such as Candida auris or Candida glabrata, is a major threat making necessary"
		invasive candidiasis worldwide surveillances. These changes have serious
		"implications for the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of invasive candidiasis."
		Updated knowledge of the current local epidemiology of invasive candidiasis is
		critical for the clinical management.

TI	-	Factors influencing the presence of Candida dubliniensis and other non-albicans
		species in patients with oral lichen planus: a retrospective observational study.
PG	-	333-342
LID	-	10.1007/s00784-021-04004-5 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: The epidemiologic distribution of non-albicans species in the oral
		"cavity of oral lichen planus (OLP) patients remains uncertain. Therefore, the aim"
		of this study was to identify factors associated with the presence of C.
		"dubliniensis and other non-albicans species. Furthermore, independent risk"
		factors for Candida superinfection in OLP should be identified. MATERIAL AND
		METHODS: Epidemiologic data and microbiological findings from 268 symptomatic OLP
		patients who underwent continuous oral swab culture over a 5-year period
		(2015-2019) were retrospectively reviewed. Candida species identification and
		"semi-quantification were obtained by culture on CHROMagar Candida, followed by"
		matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry
		(MALDI-TOF MS). RESULTS: C. albicans was the most frequently isolated species
		"(72.3%), followed by C. glabrata (7.3%), C. dubliniensis (5.8%), C. krusei and C."
		parapsilosis (both 2.6%). The presence of C. dubliniensis was significantly
		associated with tobacco smoking. Other non-albicans spp. were significantly more
		often detected in patients using removable dentures. Increasing age and the
		intake of psychotropic drugs were identified as independent risk factors of
		"Candida superinfection in OLP. CONCLUSION: In OLP patients, certain local and"
		systemic factors increase the risk of carrying potentially drug-resistant Candida
		species and the development of Candida superinfection of OLP lesions. CLINICAL
		"RELEVANCE: Due to the frequent detection of non-albicans species in OLP,"
		resistance or at least reduced sensitivity to azole antifungals should be
		"expected, especially in smokers and patients using removable dentures. In the"
		"case of oral complaints, a superinfection with Candida should be considered,"
		whereby older patients and patients taking psychotropic drugs have an increased
		risk for oral infection with Candida.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION AND AIM: Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is the most common
		infectious complication in cirrhosis. Spontaneous fungal peritonitis is rare and
		"remains unknown. In this work, spontaneous fungal peritonitis as well as risk"
		factors and prognosis are characterized. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective
		case-control study of 253 consecutive admissions by peritonitis in cirrhotic
		patients was carried out between 2006 and 2015. Comparison of patients with
		spontaneous fungal peritonitis (cases) and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis with
		positive microbiologic ascitic fluid culture (controls) was performed. Variables
		"such as sociodemographic and clinical features, cirrhosis etiology, liver"
		"dysfunction scores, ascitic and laboratory parameters, invasive procedures, and"
		"prognosis were evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 231 patients, eight (3.5%) developed"
		"spontaneous fungal peritonitis, 62.5% of cases being coinfected with bacteria."
		"Candida spp. was isolated in 87.5% of cases, mainly Candida albicans (37.5%) and"
		C. krusei (25.0%). Patients with spontaneous fungal peritonitis had higher
		"ascitic fluid lactate dehydrogenase (288.4±266.6 vs. 161.0±179.5; P=0.011), blood"
		"leukocyte count (15187.5±5432.3 vs. 10969.8±6949.5; P=0.028), blood urea nitrogen"
		"(69.8±3.1 vs. 36.3±25.5; P=0.001), higher number of invasive procedures"
		"(colonoscopy: 25.0 vs. 0.8%, P=0.001; urinary catheterization: 87.5 vs. 49.6%,"
		"P=0.038; nasogastric intubation: 87.5 vs. 26.9%, P=0.001), and longer duration of"
		hospital stay (30.0±32.9 vs. 18.9±17.0 days; P=0.031). No statistical difference
		"was found between the two groups for Model for End-Stage Liver Disease, Model for"
		"End-Stage Liver Disease-sodium, and Child-Pugh scores. Spontaneous fungal"
		"peritonitis was associated with a worse prognosis, particularly severe"
		"sepsis/septic shock (87.5 vs. 42.8%, P=0.023), admission in the gastroenterology"
		"intensive care unit (87.5 vs. 24.4%; P=0.001), and overall (62.5 vs. 31.9%;"
		"P=0.039) or 30-day mortality (50.0 vs. 24.4%; P=0.034), with a mean"
		diagnosis-death time of 17.6±11.5 days. CONCLUSION: Despite being a rare
		"condition, spontaneous fungal peritonitis was associated with worse prognosis and"
		"higher mortality than SBP. The ascitic fluid lactate dehydrogenase, blood"
		"leukocyte count and urea nitrogen, invasive procedures, and longer admission time"
		were independent risk factors for spontaneous fungal peritonitis.

TI	-	Prior antimicrobial therapy and risk for hospital-acquired Candida glabrata and
		Candida krusei fungemia: a case-case-control study.
PG	-	4555-60
AB	-	"The incidence of infections caused by Candida glabrata and Candida krusei, which"
		"are generally more resistant to fluconazole than Candida albicans, is increasing"
		"in hospitalized patients. However, the extent to which prior exposure to specific"
		antimicrobial agents increases the risk of subsequent C. glabrata or C. krusei
		candidemia has not been closely studied. A retrospective case-case-control study
		"was performed at a university hospital. From 1998 to 2003, 60 patients were"
		identified with hospital-acquired non-C. albicans candidemia (C. glabrata or C.
		"krusei; case group 1). For comparison, 68 patients with C. albicans candidemia"
		(case group 2) and a common control group of 121 patients without candidemia were
		"studied. Models were adjusted for demographic and clinical risk factors, and the"
		risk for candidemia associated with exposure to specific antimicrobial agents was
		assessed. After adjusting for both nonantimicrobial risk factors and receipt of
		"other antimicrobial agents, piperacillin-tazobactam (odds ratio [OR], 4.15; 95%"
		"confidence interval [CI], 1.04 to 16.50) and vancomycin (OR, 6.48; CI, 2.20 to"
		19.13) were significant risk factors for C. glabrata or C. krusei candidemia. For
		"C. albicans candidemia, no specific antibiotics remained a significant risk after"
		adjusted analysis. Prior fluconazole use was not significantly associated with
		either C. albicans or non-C. albicans (C. glabrata or C. krusei) candidemia. In
		"this single-center study, exposure to antibacterial agents, specifically"
		"vancomycin or piperacillin-tazobactam, but not fluconazole, was associated with"
		subsequent hospital-acquired C. glabrata or C. krusei candidemia. Further studies
		are needed to prospectively analyze specific antimicrobial risks for nosocomial
		candidemia across multiple hospital centers.

AB	-	Candidemia is a major cause of healthcare-associated infections. We describe a
		large outbreak of Candida krusei bloodstream infections among infants in Gauteng
		"Province, South Africa, during a 4-month period; a series of candidemia and"
		bacteremia outbreaks in the neonatal unit followed. We detected cases by using
		enhanced laboratory surveillance and audited hospital wards by environmental
		"sampling and epidemiologic studies. During July-October 2014, among 589 patients,"
		48 unique cases of C. krusei candidemia occurred (8.2% incidence). Risk factors
		"for candidemia on multivariable analyses were necrotizing enterocolitis,"
		"birthweight <1,500 g, receipt of parenteral nutrition, and receipt of blood"
		"transfusion. Despite initial interventions, outbreaks of bloodstream infection"
		"caused by C. krusei, rarer fungal species, and bacterial pathogens continued in"
		"the neonatal unit through July 29, 2016. Multiple factors contributed to these"
		outbreaks; the most functional response is to fortify infection prevention and
		control.

AB	-	PURPOSE: This study examined the prevalence of Candida species in the saliva of
		oral squamous cell carcinoma patients and its effect on the mortality rate.
		MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred patients with oral cavity squamous cell
		carcinoma undergoing protocol treatment at Helsinki University Hospital were
		"recruited into the study from March 2011 through 2014. For comparison, 75"
		age-matched controls with no current or previously treated oral cancer were
		recruited. Paraffin-stimulated whole saliva samples were collected and cultivated
		"on CHROMagar Candida medium (CHROMagar, Paris, France) to establish possible"
		"Candida growth. The API ID 32C yeast identification kit (bioMérieux, Lyon,"
		"France) and Bichro-Dubli Fumouze latex agglutination test (Fumouze Diagnostics,"
		"Levallois-Perret, France) were used for further identification of different"
		Candida species. Patients' medical records were studied for information on their
		"health habits and general health status, as well as tumor-related data. The"
		patients' status regarding being alive and cancer free was checked at a follow-up
		point in December 2017. Descriptive statistics and cross tabulation were carried
		"out, and the P value was set at .05. RESULTS: Candida species were detected in"
		"74% of the oral cancer patients' samples, with C. albicans being the most common"
		"species (84%). Other species identified were C. dubliniensis (8%), C. tropicalis"
		"(4%), C. glabrata (3%), C. parapsilosis (3%), C. sake (3%), C. krusei (1%), and"
		"C. guilliermondii (1%). After the follow-up period, 63% of the patients were"
		alive and 86% of them were cancer free. Harboring Candida species in the saliva
		was not associated with any increase in the mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS: C.
		albicans was common in the oral cavity of the oral squamous cell carcinoma
		"patients. However, in this patient population, we did not observe a statistically"
		significant effect of the yeast on the mortality rate.

LID	-	10.1111/myc.12077 [doi]
AB	-	Significant changes in the frequency of candidaemia and the distribution of
		causative species have been noted worldwide in the last two decades. In this
		"study, we present the results of the first multicentre survey of fungaemia in"
		Polish hospitals. A total of 302 candidaemia episodes in 294 patients were
		identified in 20 hospitals during a 2-year period. The highest number of
		"infections was found in intensive care (30.8%) and surgical (29.5%) units,"
		"followed by haematological (15.9%), 'others' (19.2%) and neonatological (4.6%)"
		units. Candida albicans was isolated from 50.96% of episodes; its prevalence was
		"higher in intensive care unit and neonatology (61.22% and 73.33%, respectively),"
		and significantly lower in haematology (22%; P < 0.001). The frequency of C.
		krusei and C. tropicalis was significantly higher (24% and 18%) in haematology
		"(P < 0.02); whereas, the distribution of C. glabrata (14.1%) and C. parapsilosis"
		(13.1%) did not possess statistically significant differences between compared
		departments. Obtained data indicates that species distribution of Candida blood
		"isolates in Polish hospitals reflects worldwide trends, particularly a decrease"
		in the prevalence of infections due to C. albicans.

AB	-	Candidemia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing
		hemodialysis but it has not been well defined in this patient population. We
		"performed a retrospective case-control study to characterize the epidemiology,"
		"microbiology, and outcomes of hemodialysis-associated candidemia. All cases of"
		candidemia at our institution were evaluated from 1 January 2000 until 1
		"September 2004. For each case, two non-candidemic dialysis patients served as"
		"controls. Among 350 cases of candidemia, 78 (22%) occurred in adult hemodialysis"
		"patients. Cases and controls were similar with respect to age, corticosteroid,"
		"antibiotics use, prevalence of diabetes mellitus, liver cirrhosis, surgical"
		"procedures, and cancer. Multivariate analysis found total parenteral nutrition"
		(TPN) (19.5% vs. 1.3%; P<0.0001) and dialysis through a vascular catheter (74%
		vs. 46.8%; P=0.0001) to be independently associated with candidemia.
		Non-C.albicans Candida spp. particularly C. glabrata and C. krusei were more
		common in hemodialysis recipients than in candidemic patients not receiving
		hemodialysis (31% vs. 17% p = 0.009). In-hospital mortality was significantly
		elevated for candidemic vs. non-candidemic hemodialysis recipients (51.9% vs.
		7.8%; P<0.0001). Candidemia in hemodialysis recipients is frequently caused by
		"non-C. albicansCandida species, is associated with TPN and dialysis via a"
		vascular catheter (vs. shunt or fistula) and carries a high mortality rate.

AB	-	The aims of this study were to establish the incidence of invasive candidiasis
		"(IC) in a Beijing hospital, to identify risk factors associated with IC caused by"
		"non-C. albicans Candida (NAC), and to determine risk factors for infection caused"
		by NAC species not susceptible to fluconazole. Clinical data from 141 patients
		admitted to Beijing Chaoyang Hospital (from 2001-2010) diagnosed with IC were
		retrospectively analyzed. The incidence of IC increased during the 10-year
		"period, but the proportion due to NAC did not change significantly in that of 141"
		"cases, 55 (39%) were due to NAC and 86 (61%) to C. albicans (CA). The NAC species"
		"isolated included C. tropicalis (25 of 141, 18%), C. glabrata (14 of 141, 9.9%),"
		"C. parapsilosis (eight of 141, 5.7%), C. krusei (three of 141, 2.1%) and C."
		"lusitaniae (one of 141, 0.71%); other Candida species accounted for four of the"
		141 cases (2.8%). Twenty-one isolates (38%) of NAC were not susceptible to
		fluconazole. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) (OR 4.2; 95% CI 3.5-58; P < 0.001)
		and previous fluconazole therapy (OR 7.7; 95% CI 2.2-27; P = 0.001) were risk
		"factors for invasive NAC candidiasis, whereas patient age ≥65 years (OR 0.37; CI"
		0.16-0.88; P = 0.025) and invasive mechanical ventilation (OR 0.22; CI
		0.069-0.70; P =0.010) were connected with invasive CA candidiasis. Prior
		fluconazole therapy was a risk factor (P = 0.007) for infections caused by NAC
		"not susceptible to fluconazole. In conclusion, TPN and prior fluconazole therapy"
		"are independent risk factors for NAC infection, while prior fluconazole therapy"
		is a risk factor for infection due to NAC not susceptible to fluconazole.

		"infection: results from population-based surveillance, barcelona, Spain, from"
		2002 to 2003.
PG	-	1829-35
AB	-	We conducted population-based surveillance for Candida bloodstream infections in
		"Spain to determine its incidence, the extent of antifungal resistance, and risk"
		factors for mortality. A case was defined as the first positive blood culture for
		"any Candida spp. in a resident of Barcelona, from 1 January 2002 to 31 December"
		2003. We defined early mortality as occurring between days 3 to 7 after
		candidemia and late mortality as occurring between days 8 to 30. We detected 345
		"cases of candidemia, for an average annual incidence of 4.3 cases/100,000"
		"population, 0.53 cases/1,000 hospital discharges, and 0.73 cases/10,000"
		"patient-days. Outpatients comprised 11% of the cases, and 89% had a central"
		venous catheter (CVC) at diagnosis. Overall mortality was 44%. Candida albicans
		"was the most frequent species (51% of cases), followed by Candida parapsilosis"
		"(23%), Candida tropicalis (10%), Candida glabrata (8%), Candida krusei (4%), and"
		other species (3%). Twenty-four isolates (7%) had decreased susceptibility to
		"fluconazole (MIC > or = 16 microg/ml). On multivariable analysis, early death was"
		"independently associated with hematological malignancy (odds ratio [OR], 3.5; 95%"
		"confidence interval [CI], 1.1 to 10.4). Treatment with antifungals (OR, 0.05; 95%"
		"CI, 0.01 to 0.2) and removal of CVCs (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1 to 0.9) were"
		"protective factors for early death. Receiving adequate treatment, defined as"
		"having CVCs removed and administration of an antifungal medication (OR, 0.2; 95%"
		"CI, 0.08 to 0.8), was associated with lower odds of late mortality; intubation"
		"(OR, 7.5; 95% CI, 2.6 to 21.1) was associated with higher odds. The incidence of"
		candidemia and prevalence of fluconazole resistance are similar to other European
		"countries, indicating that routine antifungal susceptibility testing is not"
		warranted. Antifungal medication and catheter removal are critical in preventing
		mortality.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Oral candidiasis is one of the most common opportunistic infection
		in HIV/AIDS patient and it is caused by Candida species. The low absolute
		CD4+T-lymphocyte count has traditionally been cited as the greatest risk factor
		for the development of Oral Candidiasis. The aim of this study was to identify
		"Candida species isolated from the oral cavity of HIV/AIDS patients, to determine"
		their in vitro antifungal susceptibility and to investigate the possible risk
		factors associated with oral candidiasis. METHODS: This was a hospital based
		cross sectional study that was carried out for a period of 3 months amongst
		"HIV/AIDS patients in Kumba District Hospital, whether on HAART or not. Mouth"
		swabs were collected from 378 participants using sterile cotton wool swabs and
		5ml venous blood were collected for determination of CD4 cell. Candida species
		were isolated and identified. Antifungal sensitivity testing was performed using
		modified kirby-bauer susceptibility testing technique. RESULTS: Candida species
		were present in 42.86% of the samples and Candida albicans was the most prevalent
		"(60.2%) amongst the six Candida isolates identified, followed by Candida glabrata"
		"(16.9%), Candida krusei (12.3%), Candida tropicalis (6.4%), Candida parapsilosis"
		"(2.3%) and Candida pseudotropicalis (1.8%). Pregnancy, oral hygiene and"
		antibiotic usage were significantly associated with oral candidiasis in HIV/AIDS
		patients (P<0.05). Oral candidiasis was mostly frequent in HIV/AIDS patients
		between 21-40 years. A CD4 cell count less than 200 cells/μl was a significant
		risk factor for acquiring oral candidiasis in HIV/AIDS patients (P<0.001).
		Nystatin was the most sensitive drug (83.6%) meanwhile ketonazole was the most
		"resistant drug (29.2%), followed by fluconazole (24.6%) to all oral Candida"
		isolates. CONCLUSION: Oral Candida colonization occurs more frequently in
		HIV/AIDS patients and the is a need for the government to implement regular
		"checks for opportunistic infections in HIV/AIDS patients, including oral"
		candidiasis in HIV/AIDS patients to monitor disease progression and prevent
		subsequent complications such as candidemia and diarrhea.

LID	-	10.1017/S0950268809991531 [doi]
AB	-	The incidence of nosocomial candidaemia was evaluated in a retrospective study in
		"a Turkish tertiary-care hospital. Over a 12-year period (1996-2007), a total of"
		"743 episodes of candidaemia occurred in 743 patients, accounting for an average"
		incidence of 1.9 episodes/1000 admissions and 2.9 episodes/10 000 patient-days
		per year. The annual incidence was almost constant during the study period except
		for 1996 when it was significantly higher in comparison with other years
		"(P<0.05). The most common species isolated was Candida albicans (45%), followed"
		"by C. parapsilosis (26%), C. tropicalis (7%), C. krusei (7%), and C. glabrata"
		(3.5%). A significant increase in C. albicans isolates causing candidaemia linked
		to a decrease in C. parapsilosis isolates in adult patients and C. krusei
		isolates in children was found between the two 6-year study periods. This trend
		reflects improved infection control at Uludağ University Hospital. Ninety percent
		of isolates were susceptible to fluconazole (8 microg/ml) and resistance was
		found only in C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis isolates. Regular local
		surveillance of Candida spp. is important in order to develop empirical treatment
		protocols to reduce the incidence and mortality of candidaemia.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: This paper aimed to identify and quantify Candida on head and neck
		irradiated patients with two comparative elderly populations. MATERIALS AND
		METHODS: Saliva was sampled from 29 head and neck irradiated patients (group 1)
		34 non-institutionalized elderly patients (group 2) and 29 institutionalized
		"elders (group 3) and matched by age. For quantification, the obtained saliva was"
		"sewed on CHROMagar Candida(®), which was used also for presumptive identification"
		"of Candida, API 20C AUX(®), microculture and RAPD (OPE-18) were used for the"
		"final identification. RESULTS: Among the 92 patients surveyed, 51 (55.4%) had"
		"scores classified as positive for Candida, and among individuals of groups 1 and"
		"3, 58.6% had Candida. There was higher positive/carrier conditions (CFU/sample)"
		"in groups 1 and 3, comparing with group 2 (P=0.011). Gender was not associated"
		with Candida portability (P=0.334). Candida portability was significantly
		associated with the presence of candidosis (P=0.031) and xerostomic state
		"(P=0.007). The isolates and definitive confirmed colonies were Candida albicans,"
		"Candida dubliniensis, Candida tropicalis, Candida krusei, Candida glabrata,"
		"Candida parapsilosis, Candida guilliermondii, Candida lusitaniae, and Candida"
		"kefyr. Among the species identified, C. albicans was the most frequent, followed"
		"by C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis and C. glabrata. C. albicans was more prevalent"
		"in group 2 and 3, 45% and 41.2%, respectively, whereas, the most prevalent"
		"species in group 1 were C. tropicalis (27%), C. albicans and C. parapsilosis"
		"(16.2% for both). On multiple statistical models, only radiotherapic treatment"
		was associated with positiveness to Candida. CONCLUSIONS: Diversification and
		major prevalence of non-albicans species were observed in irradiated patients on
		head and neck and this treatment is straightly associated with fungus
		positiveness.

AB	-	Candidemia is a growing problem in hospitals all over the world. Despite advances
		"in the medical support of critically ill patients, candidiasis leads to prolonged"
		"hospitalization, and has a crude mortality rate around 50%. We conducted a"
		multicenter surveillance study in 16 hospitals distributed across five regions of
		"Brazil to assess the incidence, species distribution, antifungal susceptibility,"
		and risk factors for bloodstream infections due to Candida species. From June
		"2007 to March 2010, we studied a total of 2,563 nosocomial bloodstream infection"
		(nBSI) episodes. Candida spp. was the 7th most prevalent agent. Most of the
		"patients were male, with a median age of 56 years. A total of 64 patients (46.7%)"
		were in the ICU when candidemia occurred. Malignancies were the most common
		underlying condition (32%). The crude mortality rate of candidemia during the
		hospital admission was 72.2%. Non-albicans species of Candida accounted for 65.7%
		"of the 137 yeast isolates. C. albicans (34.3%), Candida parapsilosis (24.1%),"
		Candida tropicalis (15.3%) and Candida glabrata (10.2%) were the most prevalent
		species. Only 47 out of 137 Candida isolates were sent to the reference
		"laboratory for antifungal susceptibility testing. All C. albicans, C. tropicalis"
		and C. parapsilosis isolates were susceptible to the 5 antifungal drugs tested.
		"Among 11 C. glabrata isolates, 36% were resistant to fluconazole, and 64% SDD."
		All of them were susceptible to anidulafungin and amphotericin B. We observed
		that C. glabrata is emerging as a major player among non-albicans Candida spp.
		and fluconazole resistance was primarily confined to C. glabrata and C. krusei
		strains. Candida resistance to echinocandins and amphotericin B remains rare in
		Brazil. Mortality rates remain increasingly higher than that observed in the
		"Northern Hemisphere countries, emphasizing the need for improving local practices"
		"of clinical management of candidemia, including early diagnosis, source control"
		and precise antifungal therapy.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: There is no data available on the prevalence of oral mucosal lesion
		and candida infection among DM patients which necessitate conducting a local or
		nation-wide study to assess the oral mucosa lesions and candida prevalent in
		"diabetic patients in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. OBJECTIVES: The objective of the"
		"present study was to characterize oral mucosa lesions, and the prevalence of"
		yeasts in diabetic patients and their association with the risk factors in
		comparison with a group of non-diabetic controls. METHODS: Study design: A
		cross-sectional comparative study was conducted assuming 50% of the diabetic
		patients have oral lesions compared to nondiabetic patients and a power of 80%
		"with 5% level of significance, the minimum required sample size was estimated to"
		be 115 in each group. The buccal swabs were collected to isolate Candida species
		from the individual patient with a current and former history of diabetes. The
		laboratory findings were collected and the clinical examination of the oral
		mucosa was processed at the department of microbiology. RESULTS: The results
		inferred a significant presence of oral mucosa alterations in the diabetic group.
		A majority of the patients were suffering from type 2 diabetes for the past 10
		"years. C. albicans was the predominant yeast, followed by. C. tropicalis and C."
		krusei nonalbicans species that were most frequently isolated. Diabetes and
		smoking habit were the two risk factors for oral mucosa alterations. CONCLUSIONS:
		The study found a significant presence of oral mucosa alterations in the diabetic
		group and the fungal infection tended to be more in the diabetic group with a
		high incidence of C. albicans. The presence of diabetes and smoking habit were
		two risk factors identified as significant for oral mucosa alterations. The
		significant variation in education level in groups indicates that education would
		help to enhance the prognosis in diabetic patients and healthcare behavior.

		"Candida infections in patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome (SS), and the"
		clinical and drug susceptibility profile. METHODS: Thirty patients with primary
		SS were enrolled in our study. The diagnosis of oral candidiasis was based on the
		"clinical manifestation, and confirmed by a concentrated rinse culture. Candida"
		spp. assessment was accomplished using standard methods: Sabouraud dextrose agar
		with 50 mg/l chloramphenicol and CHROMagar were used for the rapid screening of
		"clinical species, followed by the API 20C system for further species"
		identification. In vitro antifungal drug susceptibility of Candida isolates was
		"determined by the minimal inhibitory concentrations. RESULTS: In our study, 87%"
		"(26/30) of subjects had oral candidiasis, in which 42% (11/26) had multiple"
		"Candida spp. infection. Although C. albicans remains the predominant isolate,"
		"other rare species such as C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, and C."
		"krusei were present, alone or in combination. Chronic atrophic candidiasis is the"
		most common clinical type of oral candidiasis in patients with SS. The
		susceptibilities of the 44 Candida isolates to 7 antifungal agents varied
		"dramatically. The resistance to azoles was remarkable, and the phenomenon of"
		cross-resistance between itraconazole and fluconazole was observed. CONCLUSION:
		Patients with primary SS carry a high risk of oral candidiasis and a high
		frequency of multiple Candida infections. The azole resistance patterns of
		Candida spp. support the necessity for drug susceptibility testing as a routine
		procedure for patients with oral Candida infections.

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To define the antifungal susceptibility patterns of the most common
		non-albicans Candida spp. in China. METHODS: We evaluated the susceptibilities to
		"nine antifungal drugs of Candida parapsilosis species complex, Candida"
		"tropicalis, Candida glabrata species complex and Candida krusei isolates from"
		patients with invasive candidiasis at 11 hospitals over 3 years. Isolates were
		identified by MALDI-TOF MS supplemented by DNA sequencing. MICs were determined
		by Sensititre YeastOne(TM) using current clinical breakpoints/epidemiological
		"cut-off values to assign susceptibility (or WT), and by CLSI M44-A2 disc"
		"diffusion for fluconazole and voriconazole. RESULTS: Of 1072 isolates, 392"
		"(36.6%) were C. parapsilosis species complex. C. tropicalis, C. glabrata species"
		"complex and C. krusei comprised 35.4%, 24.3% and 3.7% of the isolates,"
		respectively. Over 99.3% of the isolates were of WT phenotype to amphotericin B
		and 5-flucytosine. Susceptibility/WT rates to azoles among C. parapsilosis
		"species complex were ≥97.5%. However, 11.6% and 9.5% of C. tropicalis isolates"
		"were non-susceptible to fluconazole and voriconazole, respectively (7.1% were"
		resistant to both). Approximately 14.3% of C. glabrata sensu stricto isolates
		"(n = 258) were fluconazole resistant, and 11.6% of C. glabrata sensu stricto"
		isolates were cross-resistant to fluconazole and voriconazole. All C. krusei
		"isolates were susceptible/WT to voriconazole, posaconazole and itraconazole."
		"Overall, 97.7%-100% of isolates were susceptible to caspofungin, micafungin and"
		"anidulafungin, but 2.3% of C. glabrata were non-susceptible to anidulafungin."
		There was no azole/echinocandin co-resistance. Disc diffusion and Sensititre
		YeastOne(TM) methods showed >95% categorical agreement for fluconazole and
		"voriconazole. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, reduced azole susceptibility was seen"
		among C. tropicalis. Resistance to echinocandins was uncommon.

		transplantation: no adverse effect of low-dose fluconazole prophylaxis on
		incidence and outcome.
PG	-	873-8
AB	-	"Candidemia is a serious complication in patients following allogeneic blood,"
		"marrow, and organ transplantation. Fourteen patients developed nosocomial"
		fungemia among 204 allogeneic marrow transplants performed during 1997-1999.
		Incidence of hematogenous candidiasis was 6.8 per 100 allogeneic BMT. All 14 had
		an indwelling central venous catheter (CVC) and fluconazole (100-200 mg daily)
		"was given prophylactically. In 11 (78.5%) neutropenic patients, duration between"
		"agranulocytosis and diagnosis of fungemia was (median, +/- s.d.) 10 +/- 8 days."
		"Candida glabrata (53.3%) was the most common yeast species, followed by C. krusei"
		"(33.3%), and C. parapsilosis (13.3%). Candida albicans was conspicuously absent."
		Ten patients (71.4%) had primary transplant-related complication (>2 days)
		including hemolytic uremic syndrome/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (HUS/TTP)
		"(n = 5), severe hemorrhagic cystitis (n = 3), and bacteremia (n = 2). Seven"
		(50.0%) patients expired and in three (21.4%) deaths were attributed to fungemia.
		The impact of a primary transplant-related complication on short-term survival in
		this setting was not significant (P = 0.07) (HUS/TTP (P > 0.5); neutropenia (P >
		0.5); GVHD (P = 0.35)). Removal of CVC did not alter outcome in our group (P > or
		"= 0.5) although in patients with persistent fungemia (>72 h), and those with"
		"preceding bacteremia, mortality was significantly higher (P = 0.002)."
		Conventional prognosticators of poor outcome did not adversely effect short-term
		survival in our transplant recipients with hematogenous candidiasis. The
		predominance of C. glabrata and C. krusei breakthrough infections was similar to
		"what is seen with high-dose fluconazole (400 mg) prophylaxis, and no adverse"
		effects of low-dose fluconazole in terms of increased incidence of
		non-susceptible Candida species was seen.

AB	-	PURPOSE OF RESEARCH: The aim of the current study was gut profiling of culturable
		Candida species and their possible pathogenic potential to asses role in obesity.
		METHODS: This case control study includes stool samples from 75 obese individuals
		and 50 controls. Isolation and identification of various Candida species was
		"carried out by standard microbiological techniques. For pathogenic profiling,"
		"extracellular enzymatic assays, biofilm forming ability and resistance to azole"
		were analyzed. RESULTS: Culturable gut profiling identified comparative higher
		abundance and diversity of Candida species among obese compared to controls. The
		most abundant specie among both groups was C.kefyr. A comparatively higher
		"pathogenic potential as more hydrolases expression was detected in C.kefyr,"
		C.albicans and Teunomyces krusei from obese group. Majority isolates from obese
		group were strong biofilm formers (47.1%) compared to control group (35.4%)
		suggesting it as strong risk factor for obesity. Fluconazole resistance was
		highest among C.kefyr (51%) followed by Teunomyces krusei and C.albicans. All the
		isolates from different species were voriconazole sensitive except C.kefyr
		displaying a 4.2% resistance in obese group only. A significant association of
		"dominant colonizing species with meat, fruit/vegetable consumption and residence"
		area was present (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The presence of hydrolytic enzymes in
		gut Candida species showed strong association with protein's degradation and
		enhanced pathogenicity. C.kefyr and Teunomyces krusei has emerged as potential
		pathogen showing increased colonization as result of protein rich and low carb
		diet. Thus presenting it as a bad choice for weight loss in obese individuals.

		incidence of fungaemia and numbers of isolates with reduced azole susceptibility.
PG	-	487-94
LID	-	10.1111/j.1469-0691.2008.01954.x [doi]
AB	-	A semi-national laboratory-based surveillance programme for fungaemia was
		initiated in 2003 that now covers c. 3.5 million inhabitants (64%) of the Danish
		"population. In total, 1089 episodes of fungaemia were recorded during 2004-2006,"
		corresponding to an annual incidence of 10.4/100 000 inhabitants. The annual
		number of episodes increased by 17% during the study period. Candida spp.
		accounted for 98% of the fungal pathogens. Although Candida albicans remained
		"predominant, the proportion of C. albicans decreased from 66.1% in 2004 to 53.8%"
		"in 2006 (p <0.01), and varied considerably among participating departments, e.g.,"
		from 51.1% at a university hospital in Copenhagen to 67.6% in North Jutland
		"County. Candida glabrata ranked second, and increased in proportion from 16.7% to"
		"22.7% (p 0.04). Candida krusei was isolated rarely (4.1%), but the proportion"
		doubled during the study period from 3.2% to 6.4% (p 0.06). MIC distributions of
		amphotericin B and caspofungin were in close agreement with the patterns
		"predicted by species identification; however, decreased susceptibility to"
		"voriconazole, defined as an MIC of >1 mg/L, was detected in one (2.5%) C."
		"glabrata isolate in 2004 and in 12 (14.0%) isolates in 2006 (p 0.03). Overall,"
		the proportion of isolates with decreased susceptibility to fluconazole exceeded
		30% in 2006. The incidence of fungaemia in Denmark was three-fold higher than
		that reported from other Nordic countries and is increasing. Decreased
		"susceptibility to fluconazole is frequent, and a new trend towards C. glabrata"
		isolates with elevated voriconazole MICs was observed.

		non-albicans Candida spp.
PG	-	2034-9
LID	-	10.1097/CCM.0b013e3181760f42 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the clinical features
		associated with candidemia caused by non-albicans Candida spp. and with
		potentially fluconazole-resistant Candida spp. (C. glabrata and C. krusei) among
		candidemic intensive care unit patients. DESIGN: The authors conducted a
		nationwide prospective cohort study. SETTING: The study was conducted in
		Australian intensive care units. PATIENTS: All patients with intensive care
		unit-acquired candidemia over a 3-yr period were included in the study.
		"MEASUREMENTS: Clinical risk factors occurring up to 30 days before candidemia,"
		"Candida spp. associated with candidemia, and outcomes were determined. Risk"
		factors associated with either non-albicans Candida spp. or with potentially
		fluconazole-resistant Candida spp. (C. glabrata or C. krusei) were assessed using
		multivariate logistic regression. MAIN RESULTS: Among 179 episodes of intensive
		"care unit-acquired candidemia, C. albicans accounted for 62%, C. glabrata 18%, C."
		"krusei 4%, and other Candida spp. 16%. Independently significant variables"
		associated with non-albicans Candida bloodstream infection included recent prior
		"gastrointestinal surgery (adjusted odds ratio, 2.87; 95% confidence interval,"
		1.68-4.91) and recent prior systemic antifungal exposure (4.6; 1.36-15.53). Those
		associated with potentially fluconazole-resistant candidemia included recent
		prior gastrointestinal surgery (3.31; 1.79-6.11) and recent prior fluconazole
		exposure (5.47; 1.23-24.32). No significant differences in outcomes were
		demonstrated for non-albicans or potentially fluconazole-resistant candidemia.
		"CONCLUSIONS: Among candidemic intensive care unit patients, prior"
		gastrointestinal surgery and systemic antifungal exposure were significantly
		associated with both a non-albicans Candida spp. and a potentially
		fluconazole-resistant Candida spp.

TI	-	Prevalence and antifungal susceptibility of 442 Candida isolates from blood and
		other normally sterile sites: results of a 2-year (1996 to 1998) multicenter
		"surveillance study in Quebec, Canada."
PG	-	949-53
AB	-	"During a 2-year surveillance program (1996 to 1998) in Quebec, Canada, 442"
		strains of Candida species were isolated from 415 patients in 51 hospitals. The
		"distribution of species was as follows: Candida albicans, 54%; C. glabrata, 15%;"
		"C. parapsilosis, 12%; C. tropicalis, 9%; C. lusitaniae, 3%; C. krusei, 3%; and"
		"Candida spp., 3%. These data, compared to those of a 1985 survey, indicate"
		"variations in species distribution, with the proportions of C. glabrata and C."
		"parapsilosis increasing by 9 and 4%, respectively, and those of C. albicans and"
		"C. tropicalis decreasing by 10 and 7%, respectively. However, these differences"
		are statistically significant for C. glabrata and C. tropicalis only. MICs of
		"amphotericin B were > or =4 microg/ml for 3% of isolates, all of which were"
		non-C. albicans species. Three percent of C. albicans isolates were resistant to
		flucytosine (> or =32 microg/ml). Resistance to itraconazole (> or =1 microg/ml)
		"and fluconazole (> or =64 microg/ml) was observed, respectively, in 1 and 1% of"
		"C. albicans, 14 and 9% of C. glabrata, 5 and 0% of C. tropicalis, and 0% of C."
		parapsilosis and C. lusitaniae isolates. Clinical data were obtained for 343
		"patients. The overall crude mortality rate was 38%, reflecting the multiple"
		serious underlying illnesses found in these patients. Bloodstream infections were
		"documented for 249 patients (73%). Overall, systemic triazoles had been"
		administered to 10% of patients before the onset of candidiasis. The frequency of
		isolation of non-C. albicans species was significantly higher in this group of
		"patients. Overall, only two C. albicans isolates were found to be resistant to"
		"fluconazole. These were obtained from an AIDS patient and a leukemia patient,"
		"both of whom had a history of previous exposure to fluconazole. At present, it"
		appears that resistance to fluconazole in Quebec is rare and is restricted to
		patients with prior prolonged azole treatment.

		experience.
PG	-	263-9
LID	-	10.3904/kjim.2009.24.3.263 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND/AIMS: The increasing incidence of Candida glabrata and Candida krusei
		infections is a significant problem because they are generally more resistant to
		fluconazole. We compared the risk factors associated with C. glabrata and C.
		krusei fungemia with Candida albicans fungemia and examined the clinical
		manifestations and prognostic factors associated with candidemia. METHODS: We
		"retrospectively reviewed demographic data, risk factors, clinical manifestations,"
		and outcomes associated with C. glabrata and C. krusei fungemia at a
		tertiary-care teaching hospital during a 10-years period from 1997 to 2006.
		"RESULTS: During the study period, there were 497 fungemia episodes. C. glabrata"
		fungemia accounted for 23 episodes and C. krusei fungemia accounted for 8.
		Complete medical records were available for 27 of these episodes and form the
		"basis of this study. Compared to 54 episodes of C. albicans fungemia, renal"
		insufficiency and prior fluconazole prophylaxis were associated with development
		of C. glabrata or C. krusei fungemia. The overall mortality was 67%. The
		fungemia-related mortality of C. glabrata and C. krusei was higher than that of
		"C. albicans (52 vs. 26%, p=0.021). Empirical antifungal therapy did not decrease"
		the crude mortality. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that high
		"APACHE II scores, catheter maintenance, and shock were independently associated"
		with an increased risk of death. CONCLUSIONS: Renal insufficiency and prior
		fluconazole prophylaxis were associated with the development of C. glabrata or C.
		krusei fungemia. Fungemia-related mortality of C. glabrata or C. krusei was
		higher than that of C. albicans. Outcomes appeared to be related to catheter
		"removal, APACHE II scores, and shock."

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Blood cultures are approximately 50% sensitive for diagnosing
		invasive candidiasis. The T2Candida nanodiagnostic panel uses T2 magnetic
		resonance and a dedicated instrument to detect Candida directly within whole
		"blood samples. METHODS: Patients with Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida"
		"parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, or Candida krusei candidemia were identified at"
		14 centers using diagnostic blood cultures (dBCs). Follow-up blood samples were
		collected concurrently for testing by T2Candida and companion cultures (cBCs).
		"T2Candida results are reported qualitatively for C. albicans/C. tropicalis, C."
		"glabrata/C. krusei, and C. parapsilosis. T2Candida and cBCs were positive if they"
		detected a species present in the dBC. RESULTS: Median time between collection of
		"dBC and T2Candida/cBC samples in 152 patients was 55.5 hours (range, 16.4-148.4)."
		"T2Candida and cBCs were positive in 45% (69/152) and 24% (36/152) of patients,"
		"respectively (P < .0001). T2Candida clinical sensitivity was 89%, as positive"
		results were obtained in 32/36 patients with positive cBCs. Combined test results
		"were both positive (T2+/cBC+), 21% (32/152); T2+/cBC-, 24% (37/152); T2-/cBC+, 3%"
		"(4/152); and T2-/cBC-, 52% (79/152). Prior antifungal therapy, neutropenia, and"
		C. albicans candidemia were independently associated with T2Candida positivity
		and T2+/cBC- results (P values < .05). CONCLUSIONS: T2Candida was sensitive for
		diagnosing candidemia at the time of positive blood cultures. In patients
		"receiving antifungal therapy, T2Candida identified bloodstream infections that"
		were missed by cBCs. T2Candida may improve care by shortening times to Candida
		"detection and species identification compared to blood cultures, retaining"
		sensitivity during antifungal therapy and rendering active candidemia unlikely if
		results are negative. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: NCT01525095.

		patients: A matter of concern?
PG	-	e22343
LID	-	10.1002/jcla.22343 [doi]
LID	-	e22343
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Among the fungal pathogens, Candida species are the most common cause"
		of urinary tract infection (UTI). Some predisposing factors such as diabetes
		"mellitus, urinary retention, urinary stasis, renal transplantation, and"
		hospitalization can increase the risk of candiduria. The aim of this
		cross-sectional study was to evaluate candiduria among type 2 diabetic patients
		and identification of the Candida isolates. METHOD: Four hundred clean-catch
		midstream urine specimens were obtained from patients with type 2 diabetes
		mellitus. The specimens were centrifuged and the sediments were examined by
		direct examination and cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar. The plates were
		incubated for 2-3 days at 35°C. The Candida colonies were counted and purified
		using CHROMagar Candida. The isolates were identified by matrix-assisted laser
		desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) system.
		"RESULTS: Of the 400 urine specimens, 40 (10%) had positive cultures for Candida"
		species with a colony count of ≥1 × 10(3) colony forming units (CFU)/mL. The
		"frequencies of the Candida species were as follows: C. albicans (n = 19, 47.5%),"
		"C. glabrata (n = 15, 37.5%), C. kefyer (n = 4, 10%) and C. krusei (n = 2, 5%)."
		Seventy-three (88%) of the patients with candiduria had hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)
		levels above 7%. CONCLUSION: The rate of candiduria was relatively high in type 2
		diabetic patients and they were also suffering from a lack of proper blood
		glucose control. Although the frequency of non-albicans Candida species had not
		"significantly higher than C. albicans, however, they obtained more from those"
		with symptomatic candiduria.

		of species from the genus Candida in Hospital Base Valdivia. MATERIAL AND
		METHODS: All candidemia cases presented between March 2009 and August 2011 in our
		institution were identified. Species distribution and susceptibility were studied
		through the disk diffusion method. RESULTS: Twenty-seven candidemia episodes were
		studied. Incidence varied from 0.3 to 0.7 by a thousand discharges (according to
		"clinical service). Risk factors were hospitalization, preliminary use of"
		"antibiotics, aged people and underlying disease (renal failure, heart and lung"
		"disease). The most frequent species was C. albicans, followed by C. tropicalis,"
		C. glabrata and C. krusei. Voriconazole was the antifungal showing the best in
		"vitro performance. Amphotericin B, fluconazole and itraconazole presented"
		variable results. DISCUSSION: Incidence found was superior to that described in
		"developed countries. Candida albicans constitute the most frequent species, with"
		high sensitivity levels to fluconazole; Candida no albicans species must be
		monitored. Developing new research on the topic appears as fundamental to detect
		potential epidemiological variations.

PG	-	369-74
AB	-	"OBJECTIVE: To examine the incidence, epidemiology, and clinical characteristics"
		of candidemia in a pediatric intensive care unit. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort
		study. SETTING: Pediatric intensive care unit of a tertiary care teaching and
		referral hospital in north India. SUBJECTS: All patients with candidemia from
		March 1993 to December 1996. INTERVENTIONS: Patient-related data were analyzed to
		"study candidemia in relation to reason for fungal culture, underlying medical"
		"conditions, predisposing factors, Candida isolates, antimicrobial and antifungal"
		"treatment, and deaths. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Sixty-four patients with"
		candidemia were identified. The Candida species isolated were Candida tropicalis
		"(48.4%), C. albicans (29.7%), C. guillermondii (14.1%), C. krusei (6.3%), and C."
		glabrata (1.6%). Thirty-three patients were detected by a high-risk surveillance
		"blood culture, whereas 31 patients were detected while undergoing septic workup."
		Sixteen (25%) patients were asymptomatic; they recovered without any antifungal
		"therapy and without any sequelae. Of 48 symptomatic patients, 11 died before"
		institution of antifungal therapy; 37 received oral itraconazole (10
		mg.kg(-1).day(-1)). Seven (19%) of these 37 patients died. Those who recovered
		"had sterile culture on average by day 14 (range, 4-30) and received the"
		"antifungal therapy on average for 24 days (range, 9-42 days). Overall mortality"
		"rate was 28.1%, and bivariate analysis showed significant association with"
		"Pediatric Risk of Mortality score (p =.0001), presence of symptoms (p =.003),"
		isolation of nonalbicans Candida in general (p =.04) and C. tropicalis
		"specifically (p =.001), and failure to give presumptive antifungal therapy (p"
		"=.055). On multivariate analysis, Pediatric Risk of Mortality score and isolation"
		of C. tropicalis were the only significant predictors of mortality. CONCLUSIONS:
		Nonalbicans Candida accounted for 70% of candidemia in a pediatric intensive care
		unit. High-risk surveillance blood cultures aided diagnosis in about half the
		patients. Severity of illness and isolation of C. tropicalis were significant
		predictors of mortality.

		vaginal candidiasis.
PG	-	226-34
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To identify Candida strains isolated from Tanzanian women (13 to 45
		years) with vaginal candidiasis. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. SETTING:
		"Antenatal clinic in Ilala district hospital in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania from March"
		1998 to December 2000. RESULTS: The identities of the 272 isolates tested with
		"API Candida were: Candida albicans 180(66.2%), Candida tropicalis 13(4.7%),"
		"Candida glabrata 20(7.35%), Candida famata 6(2.2%), Candida parapsilosis 6 (2.2%)"
		and Candida lusitaniae one (0.37%). API Candida could not speciate 43 (15.8%)
		"isolates of these; two (0.7%) fell between C. albicans and C. tropicalis,"
		"17(6.25%) C. lusitaniael, C. guilliermondii/C. famata, 14(5.15%) C. krusei, C."
		"inconspicua, and C. norvegensis and nine (3.3%) either C. parapsilosis, C."
		"krusei, C. incospicua or Geotrichum spp. Four (1.5%) isolates had an assimilation"
		"pattern of Trichosporo spp, but were all germ tube positive and had morphological"
		features on cornemeal agar that were consistent with C. albicans. API 20C AUX was
		"used for testing 29 isolates and results showed: 11/29 (37.9%) C. albicans, 1/29"
		"(3.4%) C. tropicalis, 4/29 (13.8%) C. glabrata, 1/29 (3.4%) C. parapsilosis, 1/29"
		"(3.4%) C. famata, 1/29 (3.4%) C. lusitaniae, 1/29 (3.4%) C. colliculosa/C."
		"magnoliae, 5/29(17.2%) C. albicans/ C. tropicals 2/29 (6.8%) C. norvegensis/C."
		"parapsilosis, and 2/29(6.8%) C. kruseil/C. inconspicua. Results of 20 isolates"
		identified by Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPID) technique showed a 95%
		agreement with API Candida and a 100% agreement with API 20C AUX. CONCLUSION:
		Although most (66.3%) of the species isolated from Dar es Salaam women with
		"vaginal candidiasis were C. albicans, a considerable percentage (33.7%) were"
		"non-albicans, mainly C. glabrata, C. krusei and C. tropicalis. The high"
		prevalence of non-albicans Candida spp observed in this population may have
		therapeutic implications.

AB	-	"Many uncommon Candida spp. (species other than C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, C."
		"glabrata, C. tropicalis, and C. krusei) have been shown to emerge in tertiary"
		care facilities. We aimed to investigate these uncommon candidemia in children.
		Forty-six cases of candidemia caused by uncommon Candida spp. were identified
		during 2003-2015 from a medical center in Taiwan. The most common specie was C.
		"guilliermondii (31.2%), followed by C. lusitaniae (18.8%) and C. metapsilosis"
		(18.8%). These cases were analyzed and compared with 148 episodes of C. albicans
		candidemia. The incidence density of uncommon Candida spp. candidemia and the
		proportion to all candidemia episodes increased substantively during the study
		"period. Prior exposure to azoles was uncommon in the 30 days prior to infection,"
		"but fluconazole resistant strains were significantly more common (n = 19, 41.3%)."
		The increased incidence density of uncommon Candida spp. candidemia was
		associated with increasing use of antifungal agents. No differences in
		"demographics, underlying comorbidities, risk factors, clinical features,"
		"dissemination, and 30-day mortality were found between uncommon Candida spp. and"
		C. albicans candidemia. Patients with uncommon Candida spp. candidemia were more
		likely to require modifications in antifungal treatment and receive echinocandin
		"drugs (43.5% vs 21.6%, p = 0.007). Candidemia caused by uncommon Candida spp. had"
		"poorer response to antifungal treatment, led to longer duration of candidemia"
		"(median 4.0 versus 2.5 days, p = 0.008), and had a higher treatment failure rate"
		"(56.5% vs 38.5%, p = 0.040)."

TI	-	Successful eradication of chronic symptomatic Candida krusei urinary tract
		infection with increased dose micafungin in a liver and kidney transplant
		recipient: Case report and review of the literature.
PG	-	e13118
LID	-	10.1111/tid.13118 [doi]
AB	-	Treatment of symptomatic candiduria is notoriously challenging because of the
		limited repository of antifungals that achieve adequate urinary concentrations.
		"Fluconazole, amphotericin B-based products, and flucytosine are established"
		treatment options for most Candida species. Candida krusei exhibits intrinsic
		resistance to fluconazole and decreased susceptibility to amphotericin B and
		"flucytosine. In transplant patients, both amphotericin B-based products and"
		flucytosine are less desirable because of their toxicities. Other triazole
		antifungals are unappealing because they do not achieve adequate urinary
		"concentrations, have multiple toxicities, and interact with transplant-related"
		immunosuppressive medications. Echinocandins are well-tolerated but have been
		traditionally deferred in the treatment of symptomatic funguria because of their
		poor urinary concentrations but there is a small but emerging body of literature
		"supporting their use. Here, we present a case of successful eradication of"
		chronic symptomatic C krusei urinary tract infection with micafungin 150
		"milligrams daily in a liver and kidney transplant recipient, and we review the"
		literature on treatment of symptomatic candiduria.

		syndrome.
PG	-	1367-1378
LID	-	10.1111/odi.12896 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to investigate the pattern of oral yeast colonization
		"of Sjögren's syndrome patients and its correlation to salivary flow rates, age,"
		and time of the disease progression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Saliva and swab
		specimens were obtained from 45 patients (primary Sjögren's syndrome = 15/
		secondary Sjögren's syndrome = 15/ healthy controls = 15). Yeast species were
		identified using culture method through chromogenic medium followed by polymerase
		chain reaction and Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: Eleven species from six different
		genera were detected. The most prevalent species found was Candida albicans
		"followed by Candida tropicalis, Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis, and"
		Candida krusei. Both groups of Sjögren's syndrome showed higher counts of
		"C. albicans (Total and CFU counts) when compared to control group. In contrast, a"
		greater variety of yeast species was identified on samples of the control group.
		"CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that C. albicans is the most prevalent yeast, but"
		also that a variety of other yeast species can colonize the oral cavity of
		Sjogren's syndrome patients. The identification of most of the colonies was not
		obtained by culturing-PCR methods combined.

AB	-	"Superficial and cutaneous mycoses are common in tropical countries, caused by"
		"dermatophytes, yeast, and non-dermatophyte molds in different clinical specimens."
		In order to define the epidemiology of mycoses and the profile of their
		"etiological agents in Alagoas (northeastern Brazil) between 2009 and 2016, we"
		"obtained data of patients from the main laboratories of Alagoas, by examining"
		clinical samples with direct microscopy and culture on Sabouraud dextrose agar
		and Chromagar(®)Candida. A total of 3316 patients were confirmed with mycoses
		"(595 men/2716 women) and 40.25 of average age. Positive samples totaled 3776,"
		"mainly vaginal secretion (1593/42.2%), toenails (876/23.2%), and fingernails"
		"(589/15.6%). Yeasts were the most isolated (3129/82.9%), including 3012 Candida"

		"Geotrichum spp. (0.3%), and 8 Rhodotorula spp. (0.2%). Candida albicans was the"
		"most frequent species (715/18.9%), followed by C. krusei (194/5.1%), C."
		"tropicalis (24/0.6%), and 2079 unspecified species (55.1%). Among 17.1%"
		"filamentous fungi, 14.8% dermatophytes were distributed as 211 Trichophyton sp."
		"(5.6%), 125 T. rubrum (3.3%), 106 T. tonsurans (2.8%), 72 T. mentagrophytes"
		"(1.9%), 2 Microsporum sp. (0.1%), 15 M. canis (0.4%), and 26 Epidermophyton sp."
		(0.7%). Other fungi represented the minority: Fusarium sp. and Aspergillus sp.
		These are the first clinical data on the Alagoas population affected by fungi
		"pathogens, confirming a higher incidence of candidiasis (mainly vulvovaginal and"
		"onychomycosis) and dermatophytes, providing a better understanding of different"
		mycoses in northeastern Brazil.

TI	-	Gastrointestinal Disease Associated with Non-albicans Candida Species in Six
		Birds.
PG	-	413-418
LID	-	10.1647/2018-419 [doi]
AB	-	A non-albicans Candida species was identified in 6 birds exhibiting clinical
		signs associated with gastrointestinal disease. The clinical disease signs noted
		"in these 6 birds included diarrhea, regurgitation, and melena, and were"
		considered concurrent or identified secondary to other comorbidities. Candida
		"glabrata was identified in a yellow-naped Amazon parrot (Amazona auropalliata), a"
		"ring-necked dove (Streptopelia capicola), a blue-and-gold macaw (Ara ararauna),"
		and 2 cockatiels (Nymphicus hollandicus). Candida krusei was identified in a
		white-crowned parrot (Pionus senilis). Fungal culture and matrix-assisted laser
		desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry identification was
		"correlated with results of fecal and/or crop Gram's stains, and DNA sequencing"
		"was used in one case. Three cases resolved after treatment, 2 birds died, and 1"
		was lost to follow-up. Non-albicans Candida infections are an emerging issue in
		human health care and are known to have an increased resistance to antifungal
		"drugs. Similar to Candida albicans, these non-albicans Candida species are often"
		identified in patients that have a history of prior antibiotic exposure. Recent
		data in human medicine describe a shift in species distribution away from C
		"albicans dominance and toward other species, including C glabrata and C krusei."
		Both species are considered normal flora within the human and bird mycobiota and
		"may emerge to cause disease, especially when the normal gastrointestinal"
		environment has been disrupted.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: There are few recent studies evaluating trends in the epidemiology of
		candidemia including changes in species or utilization of antifungal agents in
		children. METHODS: We performed a retrospective case series of candidemia at our
		children's hospital from 2002 to 2006. Our objectives were to study trends in the
		"rates of candidemia, demographic characteristics, Candida species, antifungal"
		"susceptibility, and antifungal utilization. These data were obtained from the"
		electronic medical records. RESULTS: There were 203 episodes of candidemia in 154
		"subjects. During the study period, the average rate of candidemia was 5.52 per"
		1000 patient-discharges and did not change throughout the study. The mean and
		"median ages of subjects were 3 years versus 9 months, respectively, and 38% were"
		less than 3 months of age. Gastrointestinal disorders were a common comorbid
		"condition (33%), especially for subjects with multiple episodes of candidemia."
		"Overall, Candida parapsilosis and Candida albicans caused 43% and 26% of"
		"episodes, respectively, and candidemia caused by Candida glabrata (5.3%-23%) and"
		Candida krusei (0%-8.5%) increased during the study. Ninety-eight percent of C.
		albicans and C. parapsilosis isolates remained susceptible to all antifungal
		"drugs. From 2003-2006, the use of antifungal agents increased from 79 days to 150"
		days per 1000 hospital-days. CONCLUSIONS: While antifungal use at our hospital
		"increased, candidemia rates remained stable. C. parapsilosis was the most common"
		species but other non-C. albicans species increased during the study period.
		Local epidemiology should be monitored in pediatric populations for potential
		impact on management strategies.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candida is the commonest opportunistic fungi in human. Candida
		species cause diverse types of diseases. Vaginal candidiasis has been reported as
		one of the most common type of fungal diseases among pregnant women. However; In
		"Ethiopia, due to scarcity of data, much has not been documented regarding the"
		prevalence of Candida among pregnant women. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to
		"determine the prevalence, possible risk factors and antifungal susceptibility"
		profile of Candida species among pregnant women attending Debre Markos Referral
		"Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was conducted from"
		February to May 2017. A total of 384 pregnant women were included using a
		"systematic random sampling technique. Vaginal specimens were collected,"
		inoculated on Candida HiV eg culture Medium and incubated at 37 °C for
		24 h.Colonies were identified using standard microbiological methods and selected
		for further Candida Species identification using Hi Chrome agar and germ tube
		test. Fungal suspensions were made and adjusted at 0.5% MacFarland standard.
		Modified Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion technique was used for antifungal
		"susceptibility. Data was entered, cleaned using Ep info version 7.1and"
		transported to Statistical Packages for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21 for
		analysis. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were performed. P. value
		< 0.05 at 95% confidence interval was considered as statistically significant.
		"RESULT: From a total of 384 study participants, 96 (25%) were positive for"
		Candida species. The predominant Candida species was Candida albicans 54(56.25%)
		"followed by Candida krusei 21(21.9%), Candida glabrata 17(17.7%), Candida"
		tropicalis 1(1%) and 3(3.1%) were other Candida species. Contraceptive use (AOR:
		0.394; 95% CI = 0.20-0.74) and prolonged antibiotic uses (AOR: 0.393; 95%
		CI = 0.21-0.72) were risk factors. All isolates except Candida krusei were 100%
		susceptible to amphotericin-B. Resistance rate was high against itraconazole and
		Ketoconazole 55(57.3%). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of Candida species among
		symptomatic pregnant women was significantly higher than asymptomatic pregnant
		women. Age group between 26 and 40 years was significantly associated with
		Candida infection. Amphotericin B was the most sensitive antifungal drug. High
		rate of multiple drugs resistant Candida species was detected. Therefore
		Symptomatic women should be routinely screened and treated.

		in HIV positive patients.
PG	-	282-7
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Mucocutaneous candidiasis (almost endogenous) is one of the most
		common manifestations of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The aim of
		"this study was the investigation of colonization patterns of Candida species,"
		"particularly C. dubliniensis, among mucosal sites of HIV-positive patients and"
		determining corresponding in vitro susceptibility patterns to the antifungals.
		"METHODS: From July 2006 to May 2008, specimens from the mucosal sites of 273"
		seropositive HIV patients were collected for Candida colonization. All isolates
		were identified by standard methods and carbohydrate assimilation patterns.
		Isolates phenotypically identified as C. albicans or C. dubliniensis were
		subjected to molecular identification. Susceptibility patterns of the isolated
		species to seven antifungal agents were determined using the broth microdilution
		method. RESULTS: The 359 samples from mucosal sites which consisted of 273 oral
		and 86 vaginal were collected and evaluated for Candida species distributions and
		their corresponding susceptibility patterns. The most commonly isolated species
		"were: C. albicans (50%) followed by C. glabrata (21.4%), C. dubliniensis (13.3%,"
		"reported for the first time in Iran), C. krusei (9.8%), C. kefyr (3.1%), C."
		"parapsilosis (1.6%), and C. tropicalis (0.8%). All species were sensitive to"
		"amphotencin B, ketoconazole, nystatin, voriconazole, and caspofungin. In some"
		"isolates, resistance to fluconazole and itraconazole was noted. CONCLUSION: As"
		"demonstrated, resistance to fluconazole and itraconazole, the most frequent"
		antifungals in use in the region suggests regular investigation into antifungal
		resistance in medical centers should be undertaken in order to promote the
		effective management of invasive candidiasis in HIV/AIDS patients.

AB	-	A prospective observational nationwide investigation was performed from September
		2005 to August 2006 to study the epidemiology of candidaemia in Sweden. From 385
		"patients, 403 isolates were recovered, yielding an incidence of 4.2 cases per 100"
		"000 inhabitants. Candida albicans was the most common species (61%), followed by"
		Candida glabrata (20%) and Candida parapsilosis (9%). The rates of resistance to
		fluconazole were ≤ 1% in C. albicans and 6-29% in non-albicans species other than
		"C. glabrata and Candida krusei. Resistance to voriconazole was rare, except for"
		C. glabrata and C. krusei. Only three isolates had reduced susceptibility to
		"amphotericin B, and one had reduced susceptibility to caspofungin."

PG	-	537-543
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-020-00457-6 [doi]
AB	-	Candida species are common in the human oral microbiota and may cause oral
		candidiasis (OC) when the microbiota equilibrium is disturbed. Immunosuppressed
		individuals are susceptible to oral infections as individuals with Down syndrome
		"(IDS) due to particularities of their mouth morphoanatomy, saliva and"
		comorbidities. This study aimed to analyze the molecular epidemiology of Candida
		spp. from the oral cavity of IDS and their relatives. A case-control study with
		80 IDS and 80 non-syndromic (non-DS) was evaluated by oral swab collection for
		"culture on Sabouraud dextrose agar, selection of yeast colonies to Gram staining"
		and culturing on chromogenic media. DNA extraction was performed with the
		phenol/chloroform method for screening of 6 Candida species medically important
		"in PCR, applying SPSS for statistics. We confirmed four species in 46 IDS without"
		"use of antimicrobials (57.54%), with a high prevalence of C. albicans/Ca"
		"(93.48%/43) and 3 C. glabrata/Cg (6.52%), being 25 of these IDS (31.25%)"
		"colonized by species other than C. albicans: Ca + Cg (16), Ca + C. tropicalis/Ct"
		(7) and Ca + C. krusei/Ck (2). Only 10 non-DS were colonized by one species
		"(11.25%): 6 C. albicans, 2 C. glabrata, 1 C. tropicalis and 1 C. krusei. Previous"
		"OC was reported by 39 IDS (48.75%), being 33 positives for Candida spp. (84.61%)"
		and 17 with active OC (21.25%). Five non-DS reported OC previously and had no
		active lesions. Behavioral changes and buccal health programs directed to IDS may
		"help prevent OC and its recurrence, providing information on oral hygiene for"
		self-care.

LID	-	10.1016/j.ijid.2011.06.006 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To review the epidemiology of candidemia in a UK tertiary referral
		center. METHODS: Clinical and laboratory data from patients with candidemia were
		"collected prospectively from October 1, 2005 to June 30, 2008 (a 33-month"
		period). RESULTS: A total of 107 episodes were identified. The incidence was 10.9
		episodes/100 000 bed-days. The most common predisposing factors were the use of
		"broad-spectrum antibiotics (92%), the presence of an intravascular device (IVD)"
		"(82%), admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) (51%), and recent surgery (50%)."
		"Non-Candida albicans species accounted for 58% of the episodes, which is higher"
		than the percentage reported from other UK centers. C. albicans was the most
		"common species, accounting for 43% of episodes, followed by C. glabrata (31%) and"
		"C. parapsilosis (20%). Overall C. tropicalis, C. krusei, C. norvegensis, and C."
		lusitaniae caused 7% of episodes. The crude 30-day mortality rate was 37%.
		Advanced age (p = 0.003) and the presence of septic shock (p = 0.038) were
		associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Candidemia continues to be associated
		with a high mortality. Preventative measures should be targeted against high-risk
		"hospitalized patients, especially those in ICUs, the elderly, and those"
		undergoing major surgery. Local surveillance of candidemia is important to
		optimize management.

AB	-	This analysis describes the epidemiology and outcomes of invasive candidiasis
		caused by non-albicans species of Candida in patients enrolled in the Prospective
		Antifungal Therapy Alliance (PATH Alliance) registry from 2004 to 2008. A total
		"of 2,496 patients with non-albicans species of Candida isolates were identified."
		"The identified species were C. glabrata (46.4%), C. parapsilosis (24.7%), C."
		"tropicalis (13.9%), C. krusei (5.5%), C. lusitaniae (1.6%), C. dubliniensis"
		(1.5%) and C. guilliermondii (0.4%); 111 infections involved two or more species
		of Candida (4.4%). Non-albicans species accounted for more than 50% of all cases
		of invasive candidiasis in 15 of the 24 sites (62.5%) that contributed more than
		"one case to the survey. Among solid organ transplant recipients, patients with"
		"non-transplant surgery, and patients with solid tumors, the most prevalent"
		"non-albicans species was C. glabrata at 63.7%, 48.0%, and 53.8%, respectively. In"
		"1,883 patients receiving antifungal therapy on day 3, fluconazole (30.5%) and"
		echinocandins (47.5%) were the most frequently administered monotherapies. Among
		"the 15 reported species, 90-day survival was highest for patients infected with"
		either C. parapsilosis (70.7%) or C. lusitaniae (74.5%) and lowest for patients
		infected with an unknown species (46.7%) or two or more species (53.2%). In
		"conclusion, this study expands the current knowledge of the epidemiology and"
		outcomes of invasive candidiasis caused by non-albicans species of Candida in
		North America. The variability in species distribution in these centers
		underscores the importance of local epidemiology in guiding the selection of
		antifungal therapy.

TI	-	Epidemiology and risk factors for nosocomial Non-Candida albicans candidemia in
		adult patients at a tertiary care hospital in North China.
PG	-	684-90
LID	-	10.1093/mmy/myv060 [doi]
AB	-	"Nosocomial candidemia extends the length of hospital stay, increases the costs of"
		"medical care, and is associated with a high mortality rate. Epidemiological data"
		that assist in the choice of initial therapy may help to improve the prognosis.
		The present study was undertaken to investigate the epidemiology of nosocomial
		candidemia and identify risk factors for nosocomial candidemia caused by C.
		albicans and non-albicans Candida species (NAC). A retrospective chart review was
		undertaken to analyze cases of nosocomial candidemia treated at the Beijing
		Friendship Hospital between January 2008 and December 2012. All cases of
		candidemia were identified using the previously published criteria. Among 106
		"patients analyzed, 53.8% had nosocomial candidemia caused by NAC. Candida"
		"albicans was the most common causative agent, accounting for 46.2% of all cases,"
		"followed by C. glabrata (25.5%), C. tropicalis (15.1%), C. parapsilosis (10.4%)"
		and C. Krusei (0.9%). Comparison of nosocomial C. albicans and NAC candidemia by
		multivariate logistic regression showed that factors independently associated
		with nosocomial NAC candidemia included exposure to azole agents (odds ratio
		[OR]: 3.359; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.136-10.154; P = .031) and artificial
		surgical implants (OR: 37.519; 95% CI: 2.5-562.998; P = .009). A significant risk
		factor for nosocomial C. albicans candidemia was cancer surgery (OR: 0.075; 95%
		CI: 0.013-0.437; P = .004). Clinical and epidemiological differences in the risk
		factors between nosocomial candidemia caused by C. albicans and NAC should be
		considered when selecting an initial antifungal regimen for the treatment of
		adult patients. This should be undertaken before the availability of species
		identification and/or antifungal susceptibility results.

TI	-	Nosocomial candidemia in a university hospital in Taiwan.
PG	-	19-28
AB	-	The incidence of nosocomial candidemia increased 27-fold over the past 13 years
		at National Taiwan University Hospital. In order to investigate its predisposing
		"factors, clinical manifestations and prognostic determinants, a prospective"
		observational study of nosocomial candidemia was undertaken at the hospital. From
		"1 May 1994 to 30 April 1995, 118 consecutive adult patients with 120 Candida spp"
		blood isolates were analyzed. Clinical presentations included fever (100%) with a
		"median duration of 3 days, diarrhea within 7 days of candidemia (27.9%) and"
		macronodular skin emboli (7.6%). Laboratory studies showed worsening azotemia
		"(35.6%), elevation of aminotransferase (28.3%), leukocytosis (27.1%) and"
		"thrombocytopenia (23.3%). Use of multiple antibiotics, retained vascular"
		catheters and parenteral nutritional support were the three most common
		predisposing factors for candidemia. C. albicans was the most common isolate
		"(50%), followed by C. tropicalis (20%), C. glabrata (14%), C. parapsilosis"
		"(9.2%). C. guilliermondii (2.5%), and C. Krusei (1.7%). C. tropicalis was more"
		"frequently the cause of candidemia in patients with leukemia and neutropenia,"
		while C. glabrata was more commonly seen in patients receiving fluconazole
		prophylaxis. A severity scoring system adopted from prospective bacteremia
		studies proved to be highly predictive of mortality in candidemic patients. The
		"overall case fatality rate was 70/118 (59.3%), and 51/70 (72.9%) were"
		"attributable to candidemia. In a multivariate analysis, the prognostic factors"
		"adversely influencing outcome were: higher severity scores, no removal of the"
		"catheter, persistent candidemia and lack of antifungal therapy."

		"candidemia: a prospective multicenter study involving 2,441 patients."
PG	-	532-8
LID	-	10.1128/AAC.01128-10 [doi]
AB	-	A prospective multicenter surveillance program on yeast bloodstream infections
		"was implemented in the Paris, France, area without restrictions on ward of"
		"hospitalization (intensive care unit, hematology, and surgery) or age (adults and"
		"children). The present analysis concerns 2,618 isolates collected over 7 years"
		"from 2,441 patients. Centralized species identification and antifungal"
		susceptibility testing using the EUCAST methodology were performed. Almost 10%
		"(232/2,441) of the patients had recently (≤30 days) been treated with antifungal"
		drugs. We analyzed the effect of recent exposure to fluconazole (n = 159) or
		caspofungin (n = 61) on the proportions of the five major Candida species. For
		"both drugs, preexposure was associated with a decreased prevalence of Candida"
		albicans in favor of less drug-susceptible species (C. glabrata and C. krusei for
		"the former and C. parapsilosis and, to a lesser extent, C. glabrata and C. krusei"
		"for the latter; P = 0.001). In the multivariate analysis, the risk of being"
		infected with an isolate with decreased susceptibility to fluconazole was
		independently associated with an age of ≥15 years (odds ratio [OR] = 2.45; 95%
		confidence interval [CI] = 1.39 to 4.31; P = 0.002) and with recent exposure to
		"fluconazole (OR = 2.17; 95% CI = 1.51 to 3.13; P < 0.001), while the risk of"
		being infected with an isolate with decreased susceptibility to caspofungin was
		independently associated with an age <15 years (OR = 2.53; 95% CI = 1.43 to 4.48;
		P = 0.001) and with recent exposure to caspofungin (OR = 4.79; 95% CI = 2.47 to
		9.28; P < 0.001). These findings could influence future recommendations for the
		management of candidemia.

LID	-	739
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive infections with Candida krusei are uncommon and rarely
		complicated by spondylitis. Previous described cases were solely treated with
		"antimycotic therapy, despite guidelines recommending surgical interventions. CASE"
		PRESENTATION: We describe a case of C. krusei spondylitis in a patient treated
		"with chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia. After induction chemotherapy, the"
		"patient developed a candidemia, which was treated with micafungin. One month"
		"after the candidemia, the patient was admitted with severe lumbar pain."
		"Spondylitis of the L4 and L5 vertebra was diagnosed on MR-imaging, with signs"
		suggesting an atypical infection. The patient was treated with anidulafungin
		combined with voriconazole. Despite maximal conservative management symptoms
		gradually worsened eventually requiring surgical intervention. CONCLUSIONS: In
		"contrast to previous case reports, antimycotic treatment alone could be"
		insufficient in treating C. krusei spondylitis.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Mexican diabetic population frequently presents mycosis under foot
		"hyperkeratosis; however, in another type of onychomycosis as the ones that is"
		"assumed Candida albicans is the causal agent, it is unknown the frequency, the"
		prevalence and if another Candida species or other yeasts are found. OBJECTIVE:
		Evaluate the frequency of yeasts causing onychomycosis in diabetic patients
		"looked after in public institutions of health of the State of Hidalgo, Mexico,"
		and its association with clinical epidemiological variables. MATERIALS AND
		"METHODS: An observational, descriptive and transversal study was made on 261"
		"patients, from which one nail sample of each one was obtained, used to isolate"
		and identify dermatophytes and yeasts; the results were statistically correlated
		with 24 epidemiological parameters. The clinical study was done through
		interrogation and by medical exploration in order to evaluate Tinea pedis and
		"onychomycosis. RESULTS: Onychomycosis were caused by Candida guilliermondii,"
		"Candida parapsilosis, Candida glabrata, Candida krusei, Candida spp., Kodamaea"
		"ohmeri, Prototheca wickerhamii and unidentified yeasts. The prevalence for"
		"general onychomycosis, by dermatophytes, mixed onychomycosis and by yeasts were:"
		"24.1, 19.5, 2.3 and 14.6%, respectively. Patients with significant probability to"
		be diagnosed as having onychomycosis by yeasts are those wearing open shoes
		(2.59%); technicians and professionals (10.49%) and alcohol drinkers (3.72%).
		CONCLUSION: The fact that Candida albicans is not present in this study as causal
		"agent of onychomycosis, and emerging and non-common yeasts were indeed isolated,"
		creates new challenges. It is remarked the clinical criterion that when
		"onychomycosis is suspected in diabetics, the diagnosis for culturing"
		dermatophytes and yeasts should be included.

TI	-	Inadequacy of fluconazole dosing in patients with candidemia based on Infectious
		Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines.
PG	-	919-27
AB	-	"INTRODUCTION: Based on Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines,"
		inappropriate fluconazole therapy in patients with candidemia is defined as an
		"empiric dose <6 mg/kg/d, <12 mg/kg/d after Candida glabrata identification, or"
		"continued fluconazole use after identification of Candida krusei. However, the"
		extent to which inappropriate antifungal therapy is due to improper dosing or
		drug selection has not been well investigated. The objectives of this study were
		to assess the incidence of inappropriate fluconazole therapy in patients with
		candidemia and to identify variables associated with inappropriate therapy.
		METHODS: Retrospective cohort study from four medical centers of hospitalized
		patients with candidemia prescribed fluconazole. Appropriateness of fluconazole
		dosages (adjusted for renal dysfunction) was assessed at the time of symptom
		onset and after Candida identification. RESULTS: Patients (206) were identified.
		Sixty-one of 112 (55%) patients who were given empiric therapy received an
		initial dose of fluconazole <6 mg/kg. After identification of the Candida
		"species, 97 of 206 (47%) patients received inadequate fluconazole therapy based"
		on IDSA guideline recommendations due to a fluconazole dose <12 mg/kg after
		"isolation of C. glabrata (12%), continued use of fluconazole after isolation of"
		"C. krusei (3%), or a dose <6 mg/kg for all other Candida species (32%). Using"
		"multivariate logistic regression, increased weight in 1-kg increments (OR: 1.02;"
		p = 0.0142) and a creatinine clearance (CRCL) >50 ml/minute (OR: 3.17; p =
		0.0003) were associated with increased risk of inadequate fluconazole therapy.
		CONCLUSION: A high prevalence of suboptimal dosing of fluconazole given
		empirically or after Candida species identification was documented. Increased
		weight and CRCL were significant predictors of inadequate fluconazole doses.

TI	-	Clinical profile and risk factors for oral candidosis in sick newborns.
PG	-	299-303
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To provide the clinical profile and assess the significance of
		various risk factors contributing to the occurrence of oral candidosis in
		newborns. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Neonatal Intensive Care Unit
		(NICU). SUBJECTS: Twenty newborns with oral candidosis and an equal number of age
		and weight matched controls. INTERVENTIONS: All cases of oral candidosis were
		treated with local application of 1% Clotrimazole. RESULTS: Oral candidosis was
		documented in 3.2% (20/650) cases in the NICU. Acute pseudomembranous candidosis
		was the most common presentation. The mean age of onset was 10.5 days. Candida
		"albicans was isolated in 50% cases in addition to C. tropicalis, C."
		"paratropicalis, C. krusei, C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis. On univariate"
		"analysis, male sex, birth asphyxia and prolonged antibiotic therapy had a"
		significant correlation with occurence of oral candidosis in neonates. Out of
		"these, birth asphyxia was the only factor significantly associated with oral"
		"candidosis (OR 8.09, 95% CI 1.34-48.8, p = 0.0226) on multivariate analysis."
		CONCLUSIONS: C. albicans was the predominant isolate in this series of oral
		candidosis. Clinical manifestations were evident in the second week of life and
		birth asphyxia was the most important associated perinatal event.

		intensive care unit of the University College of Medical Sciences and G.T.B.
		Hospital were screened for oral thrush. A case control study was conducted to
		determine risk factors for oral candidiasis in newborns. The rate of oral
		candidiasis in this population was 3.2% (20 cases). The most common pathogen was
		Candida albicans (50%). All but 1 oral thrush case had acute pseudomembranous
		candidiasis. 75% of oral thrush cases were asymptomatic. Mean age of onset was
		"10.4 days (median, 9.5 days). Clotrimazole solution was applied to oral lesions"
		of all oral thrush cases. The multiple logistic regression revealed that birth
		asphyxia was the only significant factor responsible for oral thrush in newborns
		(odds ratio = 8.09; p = 0.0226). These findings show that the most important
		perinatal event associated with oral thrush in newborns was birth asphyxia.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Surveillance of current changes in the epidemiology of Invasive
		Fungal Diseases (IFDs) as an important component of the antifungal stewardship
		"programs (ASP), requires careful regular monitoring, especially in high-risk"
		settings such as oncology centers. This study aimed to examine Candida
		colonization status and corresponding current changes in children with malignancy
		during repeated admissions and also investigate the possible epidemiological
		shifts after the implementation of ASP. METHODS: In this prospective
		"observational study, all eligible patients younger than 18 years were recruited"
		"during 2016-2017 at Amir Medical Oncology Center (AMOC) in Shiraz, Iran. Totally,"
		136 patients were enrolled and 482 samples were collected from different sites
		"(oral/nasal discharges, urine and stool). Weekly regular sampling was carried out"
		during hospitalization. Candida colonization status and epidemiological changes
		were monitored during repeated admissions. Samples were cultivated on Sabouraud
		Dextrose agar medium and identified by Polymerase Chain Reaction -Restriction
		Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). RESULTS: Estimated Candida colonization
		incidence was 59.9% (82/136) in our patients. Candida colonization was found to
		be higher in oral cavity and rectum than that in nasal cavity. Among those
		"long-term follow ups and repetitive hospitalizations, a significant number of"
		patients exhibited changes in their colonization patterns (37.7%). Candida
		"colonization did not reveal any significant relationship with age, sex, oncologic"
		diseases and degree of neutropenia. C. albicans (72.0%) was found as the most
		"common Candida species in colonized patients, followed by C. krusei, C. kefyr, C."
		glabrata and C. parapsilosis. CONCLUSION: Given the high incidence of Candida
		"infections in children with cancers, close monitoring of epidemiologic changes is"
		"essential for judicious management, based on local surveillance data and"
		improvement of overall quality of care in high risk patients.

		"Rhodotorula spp., remained susceptible to voriconazole. This survey demonstrates"
		the broad spectrum of these azoles against the most common opportunistic yeast
		pathogens but identifies several less common yeast species with decreased
		susceptibility to antifungal agents. These organisms may pose a future threat to
		optimal antifungal therapy and emphasize the importance of prompt and accurate
		species identification.

		"tract and brain, the so-called microbiota-gut-brain axis, are hypothesized, which"
		may be involved in the etiology of several mental disorders. Recent reports
		"suggest that Candida, particularly Candida albicans, growth in intestines may"
		cause lower absorption of carbohydrates and minerals and higher toxin levels
		which are thought to contribute autistic behaviors. The aim of this study was to
		identify the 3-year deposited yeasts isolated from stool samples of children with
		diagnosed or suspected ASD and to determine in vitro activity of nystatin and
		fluconazole against these isolates using Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute
		M27-A3 guidelines. A 17-year retrospective assessment was also done using our
		"laboratory records. Among the species identified, intrinsically"
		fluconazole-resistant Candida krusei (19.8 %) and Candida glabrata (14.8 %) with
		"elevated MICs were remarkable. Overall, C. albicans (57.4 %) was the most"
		commonly isolated species in 17 years. The species identification and/or
		antifungal susceptibility tests have to be performed using the strain isolated
		"from stool sample, to select the appropriate antifungal agent, if antimycotic"
		therapy is needed.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors for pediatric Candida central line-associated
		bloodstream infections (CLABSIs). DESIGN: Retrospective case-control study.
		SETTING: Freestanding tertiary care children's hospital. PATIENTS: Patients with
		"Candida CLABSI from January 31, 2000, through December 31, 2010, compared with"
		"age- and year-matched controls. METHODS: Demographics, comorbidities, presence of"
		"indwelling foreign bodies, exposure to antibiotics or corticosteroids, total"
		"parenteral nutrition (TPN) or blood transfusions, complications, and outcome were"
		evaluated. Bivariate and then logistic regression were used to compare temporal
		trends and risk factors. Results. A total of 160 Candida CLABSI patients (median
		"age, 1.96 years) were compared with 457 controls. Those with Candida CLABSIs were"
		"more likely to have intestinal failure (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 6.777 [95%"
		"confidence interval (CI), 2.315-19.839]; P< .001), to have a gastrostomy tube in"
		"place (aOR, 4.156 [95% CI, 2.317-7.456]; P< .001), and to receive TPN (aOR, 3.897"

		"1.841-4.856]; P< .001), and they had a 3-fold increase in mortality (aOR, 3.543"
		"[95% CI, 1.501-8.364]; P< .004). Candida albicans was most common, but"
		non-albicans strains resistant to amphotericin (C. lusitaniae) and fluconazole
		(C. glabrata and C. krusei) were also found. Conclusions. Those patients with
		"intestinal failure, gastrostomy tube presence, and/or receipt of TPN and blood"
		transfusions are at increased risk for development of Candida CLABSI.

		xerostomia.
PG	-	149-54
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the relationship between salivary flow and
		Candida colony counts in the saliva of patients with xerostomia. STUDY DESIGN:
		Sialometry and Candida colony-forming unit (CFU) counts were taken from 112
		subjects who reported xerostomia in a questionnaire. Chewing-stimulated whole
		saliva was collected and streaked in Candida plates and counted in 72 hours.
		Species identification was accomplished under standard methods. RESULTS: There
		was a significant inverse relationship between salivary flow and Candida CFU
		counts (P =.007) when subjects with high colony counts were analyzed (cutoff
		"point of 400 or greater CFU/mL). In addition, the median sialometry of men was"
		"significantly greater than that of women (P =.003), even after controlling for"
		confounding variables like underlying disease and medications. Sjögren's syndrome
		was associated with low salivary flow rate (P =.007). There was no relationship
		between the median Candida CFU counts and gender or age. There was a high
		frequency (28%) of mixed colonization. Candida albicans was the most frequent
		"species, followed by C parapsilosis, C tropicalis, and C krusei. CONCLUSIONS: In"
		subjects with high Candida CFU counts there was an inverse relationship between
		salivary flow and Candida CFU counts.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the"
		"incidence of fungal infections attributed to Candida species worldwide, with a"
		"major shift toward non-albicans Candida (NAC). In this study, we have described"
		the distribution of Candida species among different hospital departments and
		calculated the antifungal consumption in our facility. We also correlated the
		consumption of certain antifungals and the prevalence of specific Candida
		species. METHODS: This was a retrospective review of all the Candida isolates
		recovered from the computerised microbiology laboratory database of Makassed
		"General Hospital, a tertiary care centre in Beirut, Lebanon, between January 2010"
		and December 2015. Data on antifungal consumption between January 2008 and
		December 2015 were extracted from the hospital pharmacy electronic database. We
		used Spearman's coefficient to find a correlation between Candida species
		"distribution and antifungal consumption. RESULTS: Between 2008 and 2015, we"
		observed that the highest antifungal consumption was in the haematology/oncology
		"department (days of therapy/1000 patient days = 348.12 ± 85.41), and the lowest"
		"was in the obstetrics/gynaecology department (1.36 ± 0.47). In general, the"
		difference in antifungal consumption among various departments was statistically
		"significant (P < 0.0001). Overall, azoles were the most common first-line"
		antifungals in our hospital. Echinocandins and amphotericin B were mostly
		prescribed in the haematology/oncology department. As for Candida species
		"distribution, a total of 1377 non-duplicate isolates were identified between 2010"
		and 2015. A non-homologous distribution of albicans vs. non-albicans was noted
		among the different departments (P = 0.02). The most commonly isolated NAC was
		"Candida glabrata, representing 14% of total Candida species and 59% of NAC."
		"Candida famata (9% of NAC), Candida parapsilosis (3.6% of NAC) and Candida krusei"
		(3% of NAC) were recovered unequally from the different departments. The total
		antifungal consumption correlated positively with the emergence of NAC. The use
		"of azoles correlated positively with Candida glabrata, while amphotericin B"
		formulations correlated negatively with it. None of these correlations reached
		statistical significance. CONCLUSION: Different Candida species were unequally
		"distributed among different hospital departments, and this correlated with"
		"consumption of antifungals in respective departments, highlighting the need for"
		antifungal stewardship.

		"factors, clinical presentation and prognosis of MC episodes. A comparison between"
		MC and monomicrobial candidaemia within a prospective programme on candidaemia
		was performed in 29 hospitals between April 2010 and May 2011. In fifteen
		"episodes of candidaemia corresponding to 15 patients, out of 752, two species of"
		Candida (1.9%) were isolated. MC was more frequent in patients with HIV infection
		"(12%, P = 0.038) and those admitted due to extensive burns (23%, P = 0.012). The"
		Candida species most frequently identified in MC were C. albicans 12 patients
		"(40%), C. glabrata seven patients (23.3%) and C. parapsilosis six patients (20%)."
		"Early mortality was higher (nine patients, 60%) in patients with MC than in"
		"patients with MMC (223 patients, 30.3%, P = 0.046). In conclusion, MC was was"
		independently associated with increased mortality even after considering other
		prognostic factors. MC is an infrequent event that is more common in HIV
		"infection and in patients suffering from burns, and is associated with increased"
		mortality.

		with candidaemia: a multi-institutional study.
PG	-	557-62
AB	-	Mortality significantly increases in patients with candidaemia who receive
		inappropriate fluconazole therapy. The goals of this study were to compare
		hospital length of stay and costs for non-neutropenic patients with candidaemia
		treated with fluconazole based on the empirical dose and time until initiation of
		therapy. A retrospective cohort study was conducted of patients with candidaemia
		who were prescribed fluconazole at the onset of candidaemia or later.
		Hospital-related costs were compared based on time to initiation of fluconazole
		therapy and empirical fluconazole dose. A total of 192 non-neutropenic patients
		"(55% male; mean age+/-standard deviation, 56+/-17 years) were identified."
		"Isolated Candida species included C. albicans (59%), C. glabrata (15%), C."
		"parapsilosis (11%), C. tropicalis (6%), C. krusei (3%) or other Candida spp."
		"(6%). Time to initiation of fluconazole was Day 0 (35.4%), Day 1 (14.1%), Day 2"
		(26.6%) or Day >or=3 (23.9%). Thirty-two patients (17%) received a dose of
		fluconazole >or=6 mg/kg on Day 0. Total costs were lowest for patients started on
		"fluconazole on the culture day with adequate doses ($35,459+/-25,988) compared"
		"with all other patients ($52,158+/-53,492) (P=0.0088). After controlling for"
		"covariates, each 1-day delay in fluconazole therapy was associated with increased"
		"total hospital costs of $6392+/-3000 (P=0.0344), and an adequate fluconazole dose"
		"was associated with decreased total hospital costs of $18,744+/-7173 (P=0.0097)."
		A delay or an inadequate dose or fluconazole in patients with candidaemia was
		associated with increased hospital costs. Improved methods to diagnose patients
		with candidaemia quickly are needed.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Bloodstream Candida infection is a life-threatening event among ICU
		admitted patients. This infection is caused by a diverse range of Candida species
		having varied minimum inhibitory concentrations. OBJECTIVES: To identify Candida
		species causing bloodstream infections with their antifungal susceptibility
		determination. METHODS: Candida species isolated from the blood of ICU admitted
		patients were identified by phenotypic as well as by molecular methods including
		PCR-RFLP using MspI restriction enzyme and MALDI TOF MS. The minimum inhibitory
		"concentration of fluconazole, voriconazole, amphotericin B and caspofungin was"
		determined against isolated Candida species by CLSI M27A(3) guidelines. RESULTS:
		"A total of 119 Candida species were isolated. Among them, C. tropicalis(n=29) was"
		"the predominant isolate followed by C. parapsilosis(n=18), C. glabrata (n=12), C."
		krusei (n=11) and C. albicans(n=11). Uncommon Candida species isolated were;
		"Wickerhamomyces anomalus(n=15), Kodaemia ohmeri(n=8), C. lusitaniae (n=5) and C."
		auris (n=2). A varied antifungal MIC values were observed. Caspofungin had the
		lowest MIC among the tested antifungals. Increased fluconazole MIC was observed
		against the isolated Candida species including C. tropicalis. All the isolated C.
		lusitaniae and C. auris strains have ≥1mcg/ml amphotericin B MIC. In comparison
		"to fluconazole, voriconazole was more effective when tested in vitro. CONCLUSION:"
		Emergence of uncommon Candida species having varied antifungal MIC warns the
		"physicians to have a prompt, accurate identification with antifungal MIC"
		determination in each case of bloodstream Candida infections.

LID	-	573
AB	-	BACKGROUND: The goal was to determine whether one medical centres' unique
		antifungal prophylactic regimen for patients at high risk for invasive
		"candidiasis because of their haematological malignancies, haematopoietic stem"
		"cell transplants, or high-dose chemotherapy might lead ultimately to a higher"
		"incidence of infection, to increasing fluconazole resistance, or to a shift in"
		the predominant strain of Candida in invasive fungal episodes. METHODS: Data were
		"collected retrospectively, for a ten-year period from ONKO-KISS surveillance"
		"records, and from hospital, medical, and pharmacy records and then evaluated with"
		"respect to incidence of fungal infection episodes, emergence of antifungal drug"
		"resistance, and predominance of specific Candida strains in isolate cultures."
		Fisher's exact test and linear regression were used to compare minimum inhibitory
		"concentrations and to compare the incidence of different Candida isolates,"
		respectively. RESULTS: The incidence of infection remained quite stable over 10
		"years with a median of 0.67 episodes/1000 bed days. Overall, Candida glabrata was"
		the predominant species with 29% followed by C. albicans and C. krusei (14%
		each). No significant increment of non-albicans Candida species with decreased
		fluconazole susceptibility was perceived over this decade. CONCLUSIONS: Once
		weekly administration of 400 mg of fluconazole to prevent candidaemia appears to
		have no negative impact on the efficacy as a prophylaxis when compared to
		standard of care (400 mg of fluconazole daily).

		for death of invasive Candida infections in intensive care units (ICUs). DESIGN:
		"Prospective, observational, national, multicenter study. SETTING: One hundred"
		"eighty ICUs in France. PATIENTS: Between October 2005 and May 2006, 300 adult"
		patients with proven invasive Candida infection who received systemic antifungal
		therapy were included. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: One
		"hundred seven patients (39.5%) with isolated candidemia, 87 (32.1%) with invasive"
		"candidiasis without documented candidemia, and 77 (28.4%) with invasive"
		"candidiasis and candidemia were eligible. In 37% of the cases, candidemia"
		occurred within the first 5 days after ICU admission. C. albicans accounted for
		"57.0% of the isolates, followed by C. glabrata (16.7%), C. parapsilosis (7.5%),"
		"C. krusei (5.2%), and C. tropicalis (4.9%). In 17.1% of the isolates, the"
		causative Candida was less susceptible or resistant to fluconazole. Fluconazole
		"was the empirical treatment most commonly introduced (65.7%), followed by"
		"caspofungin (18.1%), voriconazole (5.5%), and amphotericin B (3.7%). After"
		"identification of the causative species and susceptibility testing results,"
		treatment was modified in 86 patients (31.7%). The case fatality ratio in ICU was
		45.9% and did not differ significantly according to the type of episode.
		Multivariate analysis showed that factors independently associated with death in
		ICU were type 1 diabetes mellitus (odds ratio [OR] 4.51; 95% confidence interval
		"[CI] 1.72-11.79; p = 0.002), immunosuppression (OR 2.63; 95% CI 1.35-5.11; p ="
		"0.0045), mechanical ventilation (OR 2.54; 95% CI 1.33-4.82; p = 0.0045), and body"
		"temperature >38.2 degrees C (reference, 36.5-38.2 degrees C; OR 0.36; 95% CI"
		0.17-0.77; p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: More than two thirds of patients with
		invasive candidiasis in ICU present with candidemia. Non-albicans Candida species
		reach almost half of the Candida isolates. Reduced susceptibility to fluconazole
		is observed in 17.1% of Candida isolates. Mortality of invasive candidiasis in
		ICU remains high.

PG	-	624-34
LID	-	10.3855/jidc.4186 [doi]
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: This study was conducted to determine characteristics of Candida
		colonization and candidemia in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of a
		tertiary care children's hospital. METHODOLOGY: Patients between 6 months and 15
		years of age consecutively admitted to the PICU of Mansoura University Children's
		"Hospital in Mansoura, Egypt, during one year period, were evaluated for Candida"
		colonization and candidemia. Susceptibility of Candida species isolated from
		blood to fluconazole and amphotericin B was determined by Etest. RESULTS:
		Sixty-six patients without prior fluconazole prophylaxis had 88 episodes of
		"candidemia, representing 19% of all cases with blood stream infections (BSIs)."
		Candida albicans (CA) and non-albicans Candida (NAC) species accounted for 40%
		"and 60% of candidemia episodes respectively. C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, and"
		"C. glabrata accounted for 25%, 17%, and 8% of NAC candidemias respectively."
		Fluconazole resistance was detected in 11.4% and 18.9% of CA and NAC isolates
		"respectively. Of the fluconazole resistant NAC isolates, four were C. krusei."
		Amphotericin B resistance was detected in 17% of NAC isolates. Candida
		"colonization was detected in 78.8% of patients. Compared to CA candidemia, higher"
		"risk for NAC candidemia was associated with age older than 1 year, Candida"
		isolation from endotracheal tube (ETT) and from central venous catheter.
		"Mortality rate was 42.4%, attributable mortality of candidemia was 16.7%."
		Regression analysis showed that the most significant independent predictors of
		"death were ETT and mechanical ventilation (MV), MV longer than 7 days, and"
		candiduria. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents important epidemiological features
		of Candida BSIs in a non-neonatal population.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infection (UTI) remains to be one of the most common
		infectious diseases diagnosed in developing countries. And a widespread use of
		antibiotics against uropathogens has led to the emergence of antibiotic resistant
		species. A laboratory based cross-sectional survey was conducted in Shashemene
		referral hospital to determine the prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility of
		uropathogens. METHODS: We have collected 384 clean catch mid-stream urine samples
		from all suspected UTI outpatients using sterile screw capped container. The
		urine samples were cultured and processed for subsequent uropathogens isolation.
		The isolated pure cultures were grown on BiOLOG Universal Growth agar (BUG) and
		identified using GEN III OmniLog® Plus ID System identification protocols. The
		identified species were then exposed to selected antibiotics to test for their
		susceptibility. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of urinary tract infection in the
		area was 90.1%. Most frequently isolated uropathogen in our study was Escherichia
		"coli (39.3%). While, Staphylococcus species (20.2%), Leuconostoc species (11.4%),"
		"Raoultella terrigena/Klebsiella spp./ (8.4%), Salmonella typhimurium (6.3%),"
		"Dermacoccus nishinomiyaensis (6.3%), Citerobacter freundii (5.2%) and"
		Issatchenkia orientalis/Candida krusei/ (2.7%) were the other isolates. We find
		that the relationship between uropathogens and some of UTI risk factors was
		statistically significant (P < 0.05). Gentamicin was the most effective drug
		against most of the isolates followed by chloramphenicol and nitrofurantoin. In
		"contrast, amoxicillin, vancomycin and cephalexin were the antibiotics to which"
		most of the isolates developed resistance. CONCLUSION: Urinary tract infection
		was highly prevalent in the study area and all uropathogens isolated developed a
		resistance against mostly used antibiotics.

		pregnant and non-pregnant women.
PG	-	89-97
AB	-	Pregnancy represents a risk factor in the occurrence of vaginal candidosis. The
		objectives of our study were: to make determination of the microscopic findings
		"of vaginal swab, frequency of Candida species in the culture of pregnant women"
		"and patients who are not pregnant, determine the Candida species in all cultures,"
		and to determine the frequency and differences in the frequency of C. albicans
		"and other non-albicans species. In one year study performed during 2006 year, we"
		tested patients of Gynaecology and Obstetrics clinic of the Clinical Centre in
		Sarajevo and Gynaecology department of the General hospital in Sarajevo. 447
		woman included in the study were separated in two groups: 203 pregnant (in the
		"last trimester of pregnancy), and 244 non-pregnant woman in period of fertility."
		"Each vaginal swab was examined microscopically. The yeast, number of colonies,"
		and the species of Candida were determined on Sabouraud dextrose agar with
		"presence of antibiotics. For determination of Candida species, we used germ tube"
		"test for detection of C. albicans, and cultivation on the selective medium and"
		assimilation tests for detection of non-albicans species. The results indicated
		"positive microscopic findings in the test group (40,9%), as well as greater"
		"number of positive cultures (46,8%). The most commonly detected species for both"
		"groups was C. albicans ( test group 40.9% and control group 23,0%). The most"
		"commonly detected non-albicans species for the test group were C. glabrata (4,2"
		"%) and C. krusei (3,2%), and for the control group were C. glabrata (3,2%) and C."
		"parapsilosis (3,2%). The microscopic findings correlated with the number of"
		"colonies in positive cultures. In the test group, we found an increased number of"
		"yeasts (64,3%), and the pseudopyphae and blastopores by microscopic examination"
		"as an indication of infection. In the control group, we found a small number of"
		"yeasts (64,6%) , in the form of blastopores, as an indication of the candida"
		"colonisation. Our results indicate that gravidity, as the risc factor for"
		"incidence of infection, has the significant role in the incidence of vaginal"
		candidosis.

TI	-	Risk factors and clinical outcomes of breakthrough yeast bloodstream infections
		in patients with hematological malignancies in the era of newer antifungal
		agents.
PG	-	197-206
LID	-	10.1093/mmy/myx038 [doi]
AB	-	Although yeast bloodstream infections (BSIs) are increasingly being reported in
		"patients with hematological malignancies undergoing antifungal therapy, clinical"
		information regarding breakthrough infections is scarce. The aim of this study
		was to determine the risk factors for and clinical outcomes of breakthrough yeast
		BSIs in patients with hematological malignancies in the era of newer antifungal
		"agents. Between 2011 and 2014, all consecutive patients with hematological"
		malignancies who developed yeast BSIs were included in a case-control study
		wherein breakthrough infections (cases) and de novo infections (controls) were
		"compared. Of 49 patients with yeast BSIs, 21 (43%) met the criteria for"
		breakthrough infections. The proportions of Candida krusei and Candida tropicalis
		"in the cases and controls were significantly different (32% [7/22] vs. 3% [1/29],"
		"P = .015; 5% [1/22] vs. 38% [11/29], P = .007, respectively). Acute leukemia,"
		presence of a central venous catheter and neutropenia in the 3 days prior to BSI
		were significant risk factors for breakthrough infections. Six-week mortality
		rates was 33% [7/21] in the cases and 43% [12/28] in the controls (P = .564).
		Refractory neutropenia and the Pitt bacteremia score were independent predictors
		"of 6-week mortality. In conclusion, breakthrough infections accounted for a"
		significant proportion of yeast BSIs in patients with hematological malignancies.
		"However, these infections did not increase the risk of death by themselves. Our"
		"results suggest that current clinical management of breakthrough yeast BSIs,"
		which includes switching to a different antifungal class and prompt catheter
		removal is reasonable.

AB	-	The incidence of multiple-species candidemia (MSC) among cases of candidemia
		ranges between 2.8% and 8.0%. We sought to study the epidemiology and outcome of
		MSC at a tertiary care center. A retrospective analysis of MSC episodes occurring
		between 2004 and 2007 was performed. MSC was defined as > or =2 different Candida
		spp. growing concomitantly within the same blood culture bottle or within 72 h of
		"each other. Information on demographics, comorbidities, antifungal use, and"
		survival was collected. Forty MSC patients with 81 Candida isolates were
		"identified. Non-albicans Candida spp. (54 of 81 isolates, 66.7%) were more"
		frequently identified. The most common combinations observed were Candida
		"albicans/Candida glabrata (15 of 40 patients, 37.5%), C. albicans/Candida"
		"parapsilosis (8, 20.0%), and C. glabrata/Candida krusei (5, 12.5%). The overall"
		"crude 4- and 12- week mortality, excluding patients lost to follow-up, was 41.9%"
		"and 66.7%, respectively. In this contemporary sampling of patients with MSC, the"
		combination of C. albicans/C. glabrata was most frequently observed and mortality
		was high.

PG	-	296-303
LID	-	10.1111/myc.12470 [doi]
AB	-	Candidemia remains a major cause of disease worldwide and is associated with a
		high mortality rate. We conducted a retrospective study of candidemia at Nantes
		"Hospital, France, between 2004 and 2010. A total of 191 episodes (n = 188"
		"patients) were reviewed. Incidence, demographics, risk factors, antifungal"
		"management, species identification, in vitro susceptibility and 12 weeks survival"
		were analysed. Global incidence of candidemia was 0.37‰ admissions. Higher
		incidences were observed in haematology (6.65‰) and intensive care units (2‰).
		Central venous catheter and antibiotic exposure were the most frequent risk
		factors (77% and 76% respectively). Candida albicans was the predominant species
		"(51.8%) followed by C. parapsilosis (14.5%), C. glabrata (9.8%), C. tropicalis"
		"(9.8%) and C. krusei (4.1%). However, species distribution differed significantly"
		between medical units with frequency of C. tropicalis being higher in haematology
		compared to other medical units. Fluconazole and caspofungin were the main
		"antifungals given as first-line therapy. Although not significant, 12 weeks"
		"mortality rate was 30.9%, being higher for C. tropicalis (44.4%) than for C."
		parapsilosis (16%). Acquired azole or echinocandin resistance was noted in some
		"isolates, underlining the need for systematic antifungal susceptibility testing"
		in patients with candidemia. These epidemiological findings will be of interest
		for antifungal stewardship at our hospital.

AB	-	Routine identification of fungal pathogens from positive blood cultures by
		"culture-based methods can be time-consuming, delaying treatment with appropriate"
		antifungal agents. The GenMark Dx ePlex investigational use only blood culture
		identification fungal pathogen panel (BCID-FP) rapidly detects 15 fungal targets
		simultaneously in blood culture samples positive for fungi by Gram staining. We
		aimed to determine the performance of the BCID-FP in a multicenter clinical
		study. Blood culture samples collected at 10 United States sites and tested with
		BCID-FP at 4 sites were compared to the standard-of-care microbiological and
		"biochemical techniques, fluorescence in situ hybridization using peptide nucleic"
		acid probes (PNA-FISH) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of
		flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Discrepant results were analyzed by
		bi-directional PCR/sequencing of residual blood culture samples. A total of 866
		"clinical samples, 120 retrospectively and 21 prospectively collected, along with"
		725 contrived samples were evaluated. Sensitivity and specificity of detection of
		"Candida species (C. albicans, C. auris, C. dubliniensis, C. famata, C. glabrata,"
		"C. guilliermondii, C. kefyr, C. krusei, C. lusitaniae, C. parapsilosis, and C."
		"tropicalis) ranged from 97.1 to 100% and 99.8 to 100%, respectively. For the"
		"other organism targets, sensitivity and specificity were as follows: 100% each"
		"for Cryptococcus neoformans and C. gattii, 98.6% and 100% for Fusarium spp., and"
		"96.2% and 99.9% for Rhodotorula spp., respectively. In 4 of the 141 clinical"
		"samples, the BCID-FP panel correctly identified an additional Candida species,"
		undetected by standard-of-care methods. The BCID-FP panel offers a faster
		turnaround time for identification of fungal pathogens in positive blood cultures
		"that may allow for earlier antifungal interventions and includes C. auris, a"
		highly multidrug-resistant fungus.

PG	-	880-3
AB	-	"OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical characteristics, therapeutic measures and risk"
		factors of pulmonary fungal infection in patients after renal transplantation.
		METHODS: The clinical data of 176 patients receiving renal allograft
		transplantation with postoperative infections were retrospectively analyzed.
		"Among the patients, 40 were diagnosed to have pulmonary fungal infection, and"
		"their clinical symptoms, signs, radiographic findings, pathogenic bacterial"
		"culture, histopathological examination, and treatments were analyzed. RESULTS:"
		The 40 recipients with postoperative pulmonary fungal infection included 25 male
		and 15 female patients with a mean age of 49 years. Twenty-eight of the patients
		developed pulmonary fungal infection within 6 months after transplantation.
		"Positive pathogen cultivation was reported in 19 cases, and Candida albicans was"
		"detected in 11 cases, Candida krusei in 2 cases, Candida glabrata in 3 cases,"
		"Candida tropicalis in 1 case, aspergillosis in 1 case, and Candida mycoderma in 1"
		case. Twenty-four of out of the 40 cases were found to have co-infection. All the
		"patients received antifungal drugs and adjuvant treatments, and 38 patients were"
		cured and 2 died. CONCLUSION: Pulmonary fungal infection often occurs within 6
		months after renal transplantation. The most common fungal pathogen is Candida
		"albicans, and the patients often had coinfections. Early diagnosis and timely"
		intervention with antifungal drugs and comprehensive measures are critical in the
		management of pulmonary fungal infection following renal transplantation.

PG	-	83-9
LID	-	10.1111/j.1600-0714.2010.00937.x [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the epidemiology of oral
		yeast colonization and infection amongst cancer patients. METHODS: Patients with
		"solid tumor, head-neck cancer or hematological malignancy were recruited into the"
		"study. Demographic data on age, gender, type of cancer, preceding treatment with"
		"antibiotics, anti-fungal agents, chemotherapy, radiation or surgery and presence"
		of dentures were recorded on admission. Oral examination and microbial swabs were
		"obtained and yeast culture, identification and antifungal susceptibility"
		performed. RESULTS: Oral yeast colonization was prevalent in 56.8% (227/400) of
		all cancer patients and 18.9% (43/227) of those had clinical and microbiological
		evidence of infection. The incidence of oral candidiasis in yeast colonized
		patients was highest in head neck cancer (29.2%) followed by hematological
		malignancies (20.5%) and solid tumor (17%) patients. Age and dentures were
		identified as independent risk factors associated with yeast carriage. Candida
		albicans was the dominant (74%) species (497.5 per 1000 cancer admissions)
		"followed by C. glabrata (11.5%), C. tropicalis (2.6%), C. krusei (2.6%) and C."
		parapsilosis (1.9%). The overall resistance to azoles was 28.2% (75/266).
		"Resistance to specific drugs was seen for fluconazole (4.5%), itraconazole"
		"(11.7%), ketoconazole (11.3%), voriconazole (0.75%) and caspofungin (41.1%) but"
		none to amphotericin B or nystatin. CONCLUSIONS: The highest incidence of oral
		candidiasis amongst cancer patients was seen in head neck cancers. The majority
		of infections were caused by C. albicans but almost one third of patients
		harbored non-C. albicans strains such as C. glabrata which were often more
		resistant to anti-fungal agents.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: This retrospective study investigated clinical manifestations of
		candidemia caused by uncommon Candida species and antifungal susceptibility of
		the isolates in a regional hospital in Taiwan. METHODS: The uncommon Candida
		"species was initially defined as Candida species other than C. albicans, C."
		"tropicalis, C. glabrata complex, C. parapsilosis complex and C. krusei. All"
		uncommon Candida isolates were identified and confirmed by molecular methods.
		In vitro susceptibility testing of the uncommon Candida species to nine
		antifungal agents was conducted using the broth microdilution method with the
		"Sensititre YeastOne (SYO) system (Trek Diagnostic Systems, Ltd., East Grimstead,"
		"UK). RESULTS: Twenty-one patients, comprising 11 males and 10 females with a"
		"median age of 69 years, were recruited. Cancer (n = 11) was the most common"
		"underlying disease, 19 (90.5%) cases had prior antibiotic exposure, and only two"
		patients had prior antifungal use. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was
		"38.1% (n = 8). C. guilliermondii (n = 11) was the most common pathogen, followed"
		by C. curvata (n = 3). C. guilliermondii isolates exhibited relatively high rates
		of azole minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) above epidemiological cut-off
		"values (ECVs), whereas C. pelliculosa and C. lusitaniae isolates all remained"
		susceptible to azoles. All three C. curvata isolates had high caspofungin
		(>8 mg/L) and fluconazole MICs (8 mg/L) and could be defined as
		multidrug-resistant. CONCLUSIONS: Uncommon Candida species frequently exhibit
		high rates of non-susceptibility to antifungals. Identification of all Candida
		isolates at the species level from blood samples is of value for treatment.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Persistent Candida from fungal cultures of respiratory secretions are
		often ignored and not treated due to assumptions concerning benign colonization.
		OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical course of patients with chronic sputum and
		"fungi on culture, including response to antifungal treatment. METHODS: All"
		patients seen at a single long term acute care hospital (LTAC) between May 2009
		and September 2010 with at least two months of daily sputum and fungus on more
		"than one sputum culture were identified. LTAC, inpatient, and outpatient records"
		through June 2011 were reviewed to assess clinical features and response to
		"therapy or to cessation of therapy. RESULTS: Eleven patients were identified,"
		"having sputum duration of 5 months to 28 years, and respiratory cultures growing"
		"Candida species. Fungi included C albicans (8 patients), C glabrata (2), C krusei"
		"(2), C tropicalis (1), C parapsilosis (1), Aspergillus fumigatus (1), Aspergillus"
		"terreus (1), and Scedosporium (1), the latter 3 in conjunction with Candida"
		"species. All had abnormal chest CT scans, often with bronchiectasis and sometimes"
		"atelectasis or consolidation, and ten of 11 patients were on chronic steroids"
		"(inhaled and/or systemic). Antifungal therapy, mostly oral voriconazole and"
		"nebulized amphotericin, led to improved respiratory symptoms and sputum within 3"
		weeks in 10 of 10 treated patients. Lack of antifungal therapy or early cessation
		of treatment was associated with progressive or recurrent symptoms and death of
		one patient. CONCLUSIONS: This case series suggests that chronic candidal
		bronchitis is associated with significant morbidity and responds well to
		treatment. Such patients may benefit from extended antifungal therapy. Guidelines
		for the treatment of Candida in pulmonary secretions should be reevaluated.

TI	-	Polymicrobial candidaemia revealed by peripheral blood smear and chromogenic
		medium.
PG	-	196-8
AB	-	Candida spp are the fourth most common group of nosocomial pathogens isolated
		"from patients on medical, surgical, and intensive care wards. Polymicrobial"
		candidaemia has rarely been described. The diagnosis of candidaemia from
		peripheral blood smears has not been widely reported. This report describes the
		case of a young woman suffering from Ewing's sarcoma who developed a syndrome of
		septic shock. Deep fungal infection was diagnosed from a systematic peripheral
		blood smear and yeasts were isolated within 24 hours. A subculture on CHROMagar
		Candida allowed the differentiation and presumptive identification of Candida
		tropicalis and Candida krusei. Species identification was confirmed by the ID 32C
		system. This report underlines the usefulness of peripheral blood smears in the
		"diagnosis of fulminant deep fungal infections, and of a differential isolation"
		medium in the rapid presumptive identification of clinically important yeast
		species from clinical samples. This medium is particularly useful for the
		"detection of mixed fungal infections, allowing early and better adapted"
		antifungal treatment.

PG	-	139-44
AB	-	This retrospective study includes all newborn patients with culture proved
		candidaemia who were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of Jordan
		University Hospital through the period January 1995 to June 2006. Among 24
		"patients included, 13 (54.2%) died. The incidence of candidaemia was 0.27%, the"
		mean age at diagnosis 25.9 d and the mean gestational age at birth 34.6 weeks.
		Species most frequently isolated were Candida albicans (50%) and C. krusei (20%).
		Previous gastrointestinal pathology was present in 41.7% of the cases. A
		comparison of cases due to C. albicans with those due to other species of Candida
		"revealed no statistical differences in terms of demographic factors, age at onset"
		"of disease, mortality, clinical manifestations or risk factors. Based on our"
		"results, empirical antifungal therapy should be considered in neonates who have"
		gastrointestinal pathology and other risk factors.

		Index of Suspicion.
PG	-	8039803
LID	-	10.1155/2018/8039803 [doi]
LID	-	8039803
AB	-	Empyema thoracis is a serious condition characterized by the accumulation of
		"purulent fluid in the pleural cavity, typically following a pneumonia,"
		"subdiaphragmatic abscess, or esophageal rupture. Fungal empyema thoracis is a"
		"rare form of this condition with especially high mortality, in which the most"
		frequently isolated fungus is Candida spp. This article presents a 74-year-old
		"female with Candida krusei pneumonia and a complicated hospital course, initially"
		"presenting with nausea, vomiting, and dysphagia. She was initially suspected to"
		have community-acquired pneumonia and was started on azithromycin and
		ceftriaxone. Worsening respiratory function led to the diagnosis of
		hydropneumothorax. Pleural fluid and an independent sample of pus and pleural
		"tissue grew Candida krusei, giving the diagnosis of fungal empyema. With further"
		"respiratory deterioration, the patient was intubated and switched to"
		piperacillin/tazobactam and micafungin. Decortication with extensive pleural peel
		and removal of foul-smelling pus and food particles within the chest was
		"performed. This further lead to confirmation of esophageal perforation, and she"
		"was started on voriconazole and meropenem. After developing septic shock, the"
		"patient was managed with phenylephrine and vasopressin. Finally, after improving"
		"she was weaned off pressors and extubated, followed by an"
		esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EDG) with pneumatic balloon dilation and WallFlex
		"stent placement. This patient's case demonstrated an example of empyema thoracis,"
		which required a high index of suspicion since the presentation was with a
		community-acquired infection. Candida empyema thoracis may be a complication of
		"operation, gastroesophageal fistula, and spontaneous esophageal rupture. On the"
		"other hand, the course of this patient's hospital stay progressed from esophageal"
		"perforation to Candida krusei pneumonia, empyema, and pneumothorax. Thus,"
		community-acquired fungal empyema should be considered in patients with
		"respiratory symptoms and suspected esophageal perforation; nevertheless, after a"
		"diagnosis of fungal empyema, esophageal perforation should also be ruled out in"
		"addition to other causes like pneumonia, subphrenic abscess, and hematogenous"
		spread. Improved communication between clinicians and microbiologists can lead to
		early diagnosis and a reduction in the morbidity and mortality of this condition.

TI	-	Prevalence and antifungal susceptibility of Candida species in a tertiary care
		"hospital in Islamabad, Pakistan."
PG	-	986-991
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and antifungal susceptibility pattern of
		"Candida species. METHODS: This prospective, cross-sectional study was conducted"
		"at the Quaid-e-Azam International Hospital, Islamabad, Pakistan, from January"
		"2014 to February 2015, and comprised different clinical samples which were"
		analysed for various types of microbial infections. Species differentiation was
		confirmed by biochemical and molecular methods. Antifungal susceptibility against
		"amphotericin B, fluconazole and voriconazole was determined by Clinical and"
		Laboratory Standards Institute M44-A disk diffusion method. RESULTS: Of the 219
		"Candida isolates, majority of them were isolated from urine 78(35.6%) and vaginal"
		"swabs 59(26.9%). Moreover, 144(65.8%) samples were of females and 75(34.2%) were"
		of males. Candida albicans 128(58.45%) was the most predominant species followed
		"by Candida glabrata 30(13.69%), Candida tropicalis 26(11.87%), Candida krusei"
		"17(7.76%), Candida parapsilosis 12(5.47%), Candida dubliniensis 3(1.37%) and"
		Candida lusitaniae 3(1.37). All isolates were least susceptible to amphotericin B
		with a susceptibility rate of 213(97.26%). The highest resistance was found for
		voriconazole 40(18.26%) compared to fluconazole 32(14.61%). CONCLUSIONS: Candida
		species possessed high resistance rate against various antifungal agents.

		"During 1990's, C. parapsilosis emerged as the most frequent yeast species in the"
		non-C. albicans group (36.1% during 1993-1998 from 20.9% 1974-1982; p < 0.01). An
		increase in C. krusei from 5.9% (1974-1982) to 10.5% during the recent six years
		(1993-1998) was also noticed. The proportion of C. tropicalis among non-albicans
		"fungemia during 1974-1982 was 42.8%, whereas in 1993 to 1998 a marked decline in"
		"C. tropicalis hematogenous infection was observed (27.8%; p < 0.01). During 1998,"
		the incidence of candidemia declined from 7.1% (1972-1973) and 6.5% (1982) to
		"3.4% (p < 0.01), and improved survival among fungemic patients (33% mortality in"
		1998; 77.3% during 1974-1982; p < 0.001) was encouraging. The increase in C.
		parapsilosis bloodstream invasion during 1990's was associated with a significant
		reduction in the endogenous non-albicans Candida tropicalis infection that
		"probably resulted in part due to the common prophylaxis, and/or preemptive"
		fluconazole given routinely in high-risk patients undergoing treatment for
		cancer. The widespread use of extraneous implantable and/or semi-implantable
		indwelling intra-vascular devices may also have played an important role in
		promoting (exogenous) C. parapsilosis infection. This study emphasizes the
		"importance of periodic evaluation of candidemia, especially at centers caring for"
		patients at risk.

AB	-	Contamination of preservation solution (PS) with yeasts during solid organ
		recovery can lead to life-threatening complications in the recipients. The
		prevalence of such a contamination needs to be established. From January 2004 to
		"December 2008, we prospectively investigated the potential fungal contamination"
		of all the PSs collected in our institution using a standardised procedure
		consisting in centrifugation of 10 mL PS and incubation of the pellet seeded on
		"fungal-specific medium for 15 days at 30 degrees C. During the study period, 728"
		"transplantations (397 kidneys, 262 livers and 69 hearts) were performed for which"
		"659 PSs (90.5%) were available. The yeast contamination rate was 0% (0/62), 3.1%"
		"(11/356) and 4.1% (10/241) for heart, kidney and liver transplants, respectively."
		"We identified 10 Candida albicans, five C. glabrata, two C. krusei, one C."
		"tropicalis, one C. valida, one Pichia etchelsii and one Rhodorula sp. Routine"
		bacterial analysis identified only five of these 21 fungal contaminations. Twenty
		recipients were alive after at least one year of follow-up and one died from
		meningeal carcinomatosis at seven months. Three patients were found to have the
		same species of Candida from their surgical drains but did not develop any
		infection or abnormalities upon ultrasound investigation. Fourteen patients
		received antifungal drugs. Yeast contamination occurred in 3.4% of all kidney and
		liver PSs tested. Its clinical consequences and therapeutic management remain to
		be defined. Our study also suggests that optimisation/standardisation of
		"microbiological procedures is warranted, including analysis of large PS volume,"
		seeding of fungal-specific medium and prolonged incubation.

		frequently lethal infection.
PG	-	4745-52
LID	-	10.1002/cncr.24507 [doi]
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: The incidence, epidemiology, Candida species distribution, resistance"
		"patterns, and outcome of candidemia in high-risk hematologic malignancy and/or"
		stem cell transplantation patients have not been extensively described since the
		"introduction of new antifungal agents. METHODS: In this retrospective study, the"
		authors reviewed the medical records and microbiologic data of hematologic
		malignancy patients with candidemia at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson
		Cancer Center from March 2001 to February 2007. RESULTS: The authors analyzed 173
		"episodes of candidemia (170 patients), 125 (72%) of which were breakthrough cases"
		"after prior antifungal agents, mainly fluconazole (28 [22%]), caspofungin (25"
		"[20%]), and voriconazole (18 [14%]). The incidence of candidemia (per 100,000"
		"inpatient days) remained relatively stable, from 13.9 in 2001 to 19.2 in 2006."
		"However, compared with the findings of previous studies at the authors'"
		"institution, the frequency of Candida glabrata and C. krusei infection decreased"
		"(to 5% and 17%, respectively) and C. parapsilosis (24%) and C. tropicalis (21%)"
		increased. C. parapsilosis fungemia was associated with prior caspofungin use
		"(P<.001). The overall 30-day crude mortality rate was 38%, and the attributable"
		"mortality rate was 19%, similar to previous findings at the authors' institution."
		The Candida species associated with the highest mortality rate was C. glabrata.
		CONCLUSIONS: Despite the widespread use of antifungal prophylaxis and the
		"introduction of new antifungal agents, the incidence and associated mortality"
		rates of candidemia remained stable in high-risk hematologic malignancy patients.
		"However, its epidemiological characteristics have shifted, with C. parapsilosis"
		and C. tropicalis becoming more common.

		in Turkey: a Multicentre Study].

LID	-	10.5578/mb.69837 [doi]
AB	-	Bloodstream infections due to yeast species especially Candida spp. have been
		reported to be important healthcare associated infections with high mortality and
		morbidity rates. Candidemia causes prolonged hospital stays as well as increased
		cost. In order to prevent or treat these life-threatening bloodstream infections
		"successfully, nationwide epidemiological data should be available about the"
		etiological agents of these infections. Multi-centre national epidemiological
		data on yeast bloodstream infections in Turkey is lacking. A retrospective study
		was designed and data from six different centres in Turkey between 2011 and 2016
		years were gathered and analysed for the distribution and frequency of yeast
		species in order to assist clinicians in their choice of early and appropriate
		antifungal therapy. All laboratories used automated blood culture systems for the
		isolation of blood strains. All the participating centres performed the
		identification of their own isolates by conventional methods using germ tube
		"test, morphology on corn meal agar with tween 80 and chromogenic media and the"
		"identification was confirmed by API 20C AUX, API ID 32C or matrix-assisted laser"
		desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrophotometry (MALDI-TOF MS)
		systems. The analysis of the results was performed on the basis of intensive care
		"units (ICUs), other inpatient clinics (OICs) and totally all clinics (ACs)."
		Totally 2547 yeast isolates were determined from six participating centres during
		"six years. According to the total ACs results, Candida albicans was the most"
		"prevalent species (43.1%), followed by Candida parapsilosis complex (29.1%),"
		"Candida glabrata (10.1%), Candida tropicalis (7.5%), Candida krusei (2.4%) and"
		Candida kefyr (1.6%) and the remaining (6.2%) of them consisted of other yeast
		species. The distribution of the Candida species did not show statistically
		"significant difference between the years, however the increase of C.parapsilosis"
		"complex in 2016 was statistically significant, (p= 0.02). During the study"
		"period, totally 1054 yeast isolates were obtained from the ICUs of the centres."
		C.albicans predominated with 476 (45.2%) isolates and C.parapsilosis complex
		"(28.7%), C.glabrata (10.7%) and C.tropicalis (7.3%) were the other leading"
		species in ICUs. Among 1493 isolates of the OICs of six centres participated in
		"the study, C.albicans was the most prevalent species with 622 (41.7%) isolates."
		"The other frequent species of OICs were C.parapsilosis complex (29.5%),"
		C.glabrata (9.6%) and C.tropicalis (7.6%) resembling ICU results. It can be
		concluded that C.albicans is still the leading cause of bloodstream infections in
		the six different centres located in various geographical areas of Turkey.

TI	-	Analysis of the risk factors associated with the emergence of azole resistant
		oral candidosis in the course of HIV infection.
PG	-	691-9
AB	-	"The objective of this case-control study, conducted in a large Italian university"
		"hospital over a 12-month period, was to evaluate the risk factors associated with"
		the emergence of azole resistant oral candidosis in 64 Human Immunodeficiency
		Virus (HIV) infected patients. A swab was obtained from each patient by brushing
		"candidal lesions. Candida albicans was isolated in 41 patients (64%), Candida"
		"glabrata in ten (16%), Candida krusei in five (8%), Candida kefyr in two (3%),"
		"Candida tropicalis in two (3%), and Candida lipolytica and Candida guilliermondii"
		"in one case, respectively. Two patients suffered a double infection i.e. C."
		"albicans+C. krusei and C. albicans+C. glabrata, respectively. Candida species"
		"were tested in vitro for their susceptibility to ketoconazole, fluconazole,"
		itraconazole and amphotericin B. MICs of the four antifungal drugs were obtained
		for each yeast using a microdilution broth method developed in our laboratory.
		Twenty four (37%) of the isolated strains were resistant both to itraconazole and
		"fluconazole, five (8%) to fluconazole alone, and two (3%) to ketoconazole alone,"
		while none of the isolated strains was resistant to amphotericin B. Patients with
		oral candidosis caused by a strain resistant to one or more azole drug were
		compared to control patients with azole-susceptible oral candidosis. On
		"univariate analysis, more than five episodes of oral candidosis in the last year"
		"(P = 0.01), previous use of azole therapy (P = 0.001), C2-3 category of HIV"
		infection (P = 0.01) and low number of circulating CD4+ T-cells (P = 0.03) were
		significantly associated with an increased risk for the development of azole
		"resistance. However, previous use of azole therapy was the only factor selected"
		by a stepwise logistic regression analysis which was independently associated
		with the isolation of azole resistant strains (P = 0.003). Our findings indicate
		"that, in view of the potential risk for the emergence and selection of azole"
		"resistant strains of Candida in patients with AIDS, it is important to carefully"
		choose the antifungal drug for the therapy of mild fungal infections after
		evaluation of the in-vitro susceptibility of the isolated strains.

		Five-year surveillance of Candida bloodstream infection in a university reference
		hospital in southeast Brazil.
PG	-	225-30
LID	-	10.3109/13693786.2012.708107 [doi]
AB	-	"From 2006 to 2010, a retrospective study was conducted in a university referral"
		tertiary care hospital to study the frequency and distribution of Candida species
		"in different medical specialties. The use of mechanical ventilation, central"
		"venous catheter, and urinary catheter were recorded per 1,000 patient-days and"
		the use of antifungals was calculated using defined daily dose (DDD). A total of
		313 episodes were identified and the overall incidence was 0.54 (0.41-0.71)
		"episodes per 1,000 patient-days. Candida albicans caused 44% of the overall"
		"episodes, followed by C. tropicalis (21.7%), C. parapsilosis (14.4%), C. glabrata"
		"(11.2%), and C. krusei (3.5%). The incidence of C. glabrata significantly"
		increased from 2006-2010 (range: 4.8-23.5%) (P = 0.024). Candida glabrata was
		associated with malignancies (P = 0.004) and C. krusei with hematologic
		malignancies (P < 0.0001). The use of antifungals was higher in the
		hematology/bone marrow transplant units and represented 40% of all fluconazole
		prescription in the hospital. There was no correlation with the use of
		fluconazole and the increasing ratio of C. glabrata (r = 0.60). The use of
		invasive devices was significantly higher in the intensive care units (ICUs) than
		"the medical and surgical emergencies units (P < 0.001). In contrast, the"
		"emergencies had higher incidence of candidemia (2-2.1 episodes/1,000"
		"patient-days) than the ICUs (1.6 episodes 1,000 patient-days). Candida glabrata"
		candidemia showed a significant increase in contrast to the current national
		literature where C. parapsilosis remained the most important non-C. albicans
		Candida species in Brazilian hospitals. Our findings suggested that the
		increasing incidence of C. glabrata was not associated with use of fluconazole
		and other risk factors might play an important role.

		Resistance surveillance study in Venezuelan strains.
PG	-	137-43
LID	-	10.1080/13693780802144339 [doi]
AB	-	The aim of this study was to determine in vitro susceptibility profiles of
		Venezuelan strains of Candida spp. to four antifungal agents. One hundred and
		forty five (145) isolates were recovered during a 1-year period (June 2006 to
		June 2007) from clinical specimens of patients with severe Candida spp.
		"infections in 15 hospitals. In vitro susceptibilities to amphotericin B,"
		"fluconazole, itraconazole and voriconazole were determined by modified Etest. Non"
		Candida albicans Candida spp. were the most frequently isolated yeasts (72.4%) in
		comparison with C. albicans (27.6%). Candida spp. strains showed MIC ranges
		between <0.002 and 0.5 mug/ml to amphotericin B. While none were found to be
		"resistant to voriconazole, 5.5% and 27.6% of the test strains were resistant to"
		"fluconazole and itraconazole, respectively. C. albicans remains the most"
		susceptible of the yeasts studied to fluconazole and itraconazole (P<0.05) when
		compared with non C. albicans Candida spp. C. krusei showed the greater
		"cross-resistance to azoles, followed by C. glabrata, C. tropicalis and C."
		"parapsilosis, while C. albicans isolates did not demonstrate this characteristic."
		It is very important to carry out the correct species identification of clinical
		yeast isolates because they show up variations in both distribution and
		"susceptibility profiles according to the hospital, patient's underlying disease,"
		"clinical specimen analyzed, and the geographical region in which the studies were"
		conducted. The Mycology Department of the INHRR is the national reference center
		"responsible for antifungal resistance surveillance, performing the susceptibility"
		tests with isolates recovered from hospitalized patients in public health centres
		which do not have mycological diagnosis laboratories.

		and species-specific oligonucleotide probes. Each step in the process of
		detection and identification was standardized to a common set of conditions
		applicable without modification to all fungi of interest and all types of
		clinical specimens. These steps consist of DNA extraction by boiling specimens in
		"an alkaline guanidine-phenol-Tris reagent, amplification of a variable region of"
		"the 28S rRNA gene with universal primers, and amplicon identification by probe"
		hybridization or DNA sequencing performed under conditions identical for all
		fungi. The results obtained by testing a panel of fungal isolates and a variety
		of clinical specimens indicate a high level of specificity.

TI	-	Increased incidence of vulvovaginal candidiasis caused by Candida glabrata in
		Jordan.
PG	-	103-7
AB	-	Due to the rising importance of Candida glabrata and other non-albicans Candida
		"as principle human opportunistic pathogens, 356 women with abnormal vaginal"
		"discharge who attended a private obstetrics and gynecology clinic in Amman,"
		"Jordan, between January 1999 and February 2001 were examined. The isolation rate"
		of Candida spp. from high-vaginal swabs was 44.9%. CHROMagar Candida and
		"conventional mycological methods identified six isolated Candida spp., including"
		"C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, C. krusei, and C."
		"kefyr. The percentages of C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. tropicalis isolates"
		"were 43.1%, 32.5%, and 8.1%, respectively. C. albicans was isolated in"
		combination with C. tropicalis and C. krusei in two patients. Statistical
		analysis of the present results clearly show an increase in the incidence of
		"vulvovaginal candidiasis caused by C. glabrata in the two study periods,"
		"1994-1996 and 1999-2001 (P = 0.0186). In contrast, comparing the proportions of"
		"vulvovaginal candidiasis caused by C. albicans in the two periods, there was no"
		"significant difference. These results may have significant clinical implications,"
		as C. glabrata are innately less susceptible to most antifungal agents than C.
		albicans; these findings support viewing this organism as a major pathogen.

AB	-	Candiduria detection in hospitalized or immunocompromised patients is of great
		clinical significance. The aim of our study was to describe the isolation
		frequency of significant species of yeasts in urine samples processed in our
		"hospital during the period 2010- 2013, and to analyze their susceptibility to"
		commonly used antifungal agents. Species identification was performed by seeding
		"on a chromogenic medium, the filamentation test and automated systems (ASM Vitek"
		"and MALDI Biotyper), while susceptibility was determined using the ASM Vitek"
		"system. Of the 632 yeast isolates in urine, 371 were Candida albicans species and"
		261 non-C. albicans Candida spp. The species with the highest number of resistant
		"isolates were Candida glabrata and Candida krusei. Based on the results obtained,"
		we believe that species identification and the susceptibility study should be
		current practice in the laboratories when species other than C. albicans are
		isolated.

TI	-	The epidemiology of Candida species associated with vulvovaginal candidiasis in
		an Iranian patient population.
PG	-	199-203
LID	-	10.1016/j.ejogrb.2010.11.022 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: Vulvovaginal candidiasis is a common infection among women worldwide.
		"According to previous epidemiological studies, Candida albicans is the most"
		"common species of Candida. The prevalence of non-Candida species, however, is"
		increasing. Identification of Candida species among the population will not only
		"help health professionals to choose suitable antifungal treatments, but also"
		"prevent development of drug resistance. The aim of this study was to identify,"
		"using chromogenic agar medium, the Candida species associated with vulvovaginal"
		candidiasis among a sample of the Iranian population. STUDY DESIGN: In a
		"prospective cohort study during a two year period from March 2006 to March 2008,"
		swab samples of vaginal discharge/secretion were taken from 200 patients admitted
		"to the gynecology clinic of Mahdieh Hospital (Tehran, Iran) with a clinical"
		presentation suggestive of vulvovaginal candidiasis. The isolates obtained were
		cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar and chromogenic agar medium. Candida species
		"were also identified by germ tube formation in serum, chlamydospore production on"
		Corn Meal Agar and carbohydrate absorption using the API 20C-AUX kit.
		Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire investigating the risk
		factors associated with candidiasis. An assessment of the different species of
		"recurrent and non-recurrent candidiasis was also made. Descriptive statistics,"
		"chi-square test, and t-test were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: A total of"
		191 isolates were obtained from 175 vaginal specimens. Candida albicans accounted
		for 67% of the strains including single and mixed infections. The other
		"identified species were Candida glabrata (18.3%), Candida tropicalis (6.8%),"
		"Candida krusei (5.8%), Candida parapsilosis (1.6%), and Candida guilliermondii"
		(0.5%) respectively. Mixed infection with two or more species of Candida was seen
		in 10.3% of patients. The most common mixed cause was the combination of Candida
		albicans and Candida glabrata. Participants who were sexually active and those
		who had orogenital sex were more likely to suffer recurrent vulvovaginal
		candidiasis. CONCLUSIONS: Candida albicans was the most common cause of recurrent
		and non-recurrent vulvovaginitis. The second most common species was Candida
		glabrata. This study suggests CHROMagar method as a convenient and cost effective
		yet reliable method to isolate the species of Candida especially in cases where
		more than one species is present.

TI	-	Caspofungin-induced severe toxic epidermal necrolysis.
PG	-	1116-8
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To report a case of suspected caspofungin-induced toxic epidermal
		necrolysis (TEN). CASE SUMMARY: An 86-year-old man had a right femur
		intertrochanteric fracture and right proximal humerus fracture due to an
		accidental fall. Disseminated Candida krusei infection complicated the
		postoperative course. Candidemia persisted despite 25 days of treatment with
		parenteral fluconazole. The antifungal agent was changed to intravenous
		caspofungin. Immediately after administration of a caspofungin 70-mg loading
		"dose, a transient skin rash developed, which resolved after discontinuation of"
		the drug and immediate treatment with intravenous diphenhydramine 30 mg and
		"methylprednisolone 40 mg. Six days later, a caspofungin 70-mg loading dose was"
		given again due to increasing sepsis. Erythematous and purpuric macules and
		"plaques developed the next day and rapidly progressed to extensive erythema,"
		"exfoliation, blisters, and skin erosions. A dermatologist was consulted and TEN"
		was diagnosed. The patient was treated with intravenous hydrocortisone 100 mg
		every 8 hours and diphenhydramine 30 mg every 8 hours. The skin lesions
		progressed unrelentingly and the patient died of refractory shock 6 days later.
		DISCUSSION: TEN is a rare but life-threatening systemic and cutaneous disease
		that is most often the result of an adverse drug reaction. It usually manifests
		as fever and influenza-like symptoms 1-3 days before the development of
		"mucocutaneous lesions, namely erythema and erosions of the buccal, ocular, and"
		genital mucosa and characteristic epidermal detachment. The precise pathogenesis
		"is not fully understood. Several models have been described, including"
		"immunopathology, genetic susceptibility, Fas-Fas ligand, perforin/granzyme, and"
		cytokine dysregulation. Use of the Naranjo probability scale indicated a probable
		relationship between caspofungin and the development of TEN in this patient.
		CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of caspofungin-induced TEN. Health-care
		professionals are advised to be aware of the early presentations of TEN in
		patients receiving caspofungin.

TI	-	Candidaemia in a tertiary care centre of developing country: Monitoring possible
		change in spectrum of agents and antifungal susceptibility.
PG	-	110-116
LID	-	10.4103/ijmm.IJMM_20_112 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: Candidaemia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality of hospitalised
		"patients, especially in developing countries. This study was conducted to monitor"
		any change in species distribution and antifungal susceptibility pattern of
		Candida species causing candidaemia over the last 20 years. MATERIALS AND
		METHODS: The candidaemia cases reported during January 1999 and December 2018 at
		our centre were reviewed. The yeasts were identified by phenotypic characters
		(during 1999-2014) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation-time of flight
		mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) (during 2014-2018). Antifungal susceptibility
		testing (AFST) was performed in accordance with the Clinical and Laboratory
		"Standards Institute guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 602,963 blood samples from"
		patients with suspected sepsis were processed. Candidaemia was diagnosed in 7927
		(1.31%) cases. The frequency of cases rose significantly (P = 0.000) in the last
		"quarter of the study. Candida tropicalis (40.1%) was the most common species,"
		"followed by Candida albicans (15.2%), Wickerhamomyces anomalus (13.1%), Candida"
		"krusei (6.6%), Candida parapsilosis (4.7%) and others. Rare species such as"
		"Candida auris, Candida lambica, Candida orthopsilosis, Candida vishwanathii were"
		identified after the introduction of MALDI-TOF. The minimum inhibitory
		concentrations of amphotericin B rose significantly from the first to last
		quarter (0.5%-4.9%). Fluconazole resistance was fairly constant at 7.4%-8.8%.
		CONCLUSION: Local epidemiology of candidaemia at our centre was distinct
		regarding prevalence and change of spectrum of species. The identification of
		rare species was possible after the introduction of MALDI-TOF. With the emergence
		"of multidrug-resistant C. auris and resistance in other species, routine AFST has"
		become imperative.

TI	-	The changing face of candidemia: emergence of non-Candida albicans species and
		antifungal resistance.
PG	-	617-23
AB	-	"OBJECTIVES: To assess the changing epidemiology of candidemia in the 1990s, to"
		evaluate the clinical implications for the presence of non-Candida albicans in
		"blood, and to evaluate the presence of antifungal resistance in relation to prior"
		antifungal administration. DESIGN: Multicenter prospective observational study of
		patients with positive blood cultures for Candida species or Torulopsis glabrata.
		SETTING: Four tertiary care medical centers. RESULTS: Four hundred twenty-seven
		consecutive patients were enrolled. The frequency of candidemia due to non-C.
		albicans species significantly increased in each hospital throughout the 3.5-year
		study period (P = 0.01). Thirteen percent of candidemias occurred in patients who
		were already receiving systemic antifungal agents. Candidemias developing while
		receiving antifungal therapy were more likely caused by non-C. albicans species
		than by C. albicans species (P = 0.0005). C. parapsilosis and C. krusei were more
		"commonly seen with prior fluconazole therapy, whereas T. glabrata was more"
		commonly seen with prior amphotericin B therapy. Candida species isolated during
		episodes of breakthrough candidemia exhibited a significantly higher MIC to the
		antifungal agent being administered (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In this large scale
		"study, the non-C. albicans species, especially T. glabrata, emerged as important"
		and frequent pathogens causing fungemia. This finding has major clinical
		implications given the higher complication and mortality rate associated with the
		non-C. albicans species. The change in the pattern of candidemia might be partly
		attributed to the increase in number of immunocompromised hosts and the
		widespread use of prophylactic or empiric antifungal therapy. This is an ominous
		sign given the in vitro resistance of the non-C. albicans species to currently
		available antifungal agents.

TI	-	Fungal colonization of the esophagus in alcoholic liver disease.
PG	-	821-5
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: Little is known about the fungal colonization of the esophagus. Since
		"alcoholic liver disease (ALD) patients are prone to fungal esophagitis, we have"
		investigated the esophageal fungal colonization of this patient group. METHODS:
		One hundred consecutive ALD patients were enrolled in this prospective study. 22
		patients with dyspeptic symptoms acted as controls. After taking an oropharyngeal
		"swab, patients underwent an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and surface material"
		was obtained from the esophagus for direct smears and culture. RESULTS: In the
		ALD group pseudohyphae were found in 21.5% and yeast forms in 6.4% of the direct
		"smears. The culture was positive in 40.8% of the ALD patients, the isolated"
		"strains were: 30 C. albicans, 2 C. kefyr, 2 C. krusei, 1 C. zeylanoides and in 3"
		cases the species could not be identified. 41.9% of ALD patients and 13.6% of
		control patients (p = 0.013) had fungi in their esophagus. Significantly more ALD
		"patients had fungal esophagitis than in the control group (19.3% vs. 0%, p ="
		"0.021), the rate of fungal colonization was also higher, but the difference was"
		not significant (22.5% vs. 13.6%). A significantly higher rate of fungal
		esophagitis and esophageal colonization was found in patients with fungi in their
		oropharyngeal swabs (p = 0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: Fungal colonization of the
		esophagus is frequent in ALD patients. Its presence might have clinical
		significance in the case of liver transplantation.

AB	-	Optimal staging and evaluation of residual lesions of invasive fungal infections
		(IFIs) are major challenges in the immunocompromised host. Preliminary data have
		suggested that [¹⁸F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([¹⁸F]FDG) uptake may be observed in the
		course of active invasive fungal infections. The aim of this study was to assess
		the role of positron emission tomography with [¹⁸F]FDG ([¹⁸F]FDG-PET) in the
		diagnosis and staging of IFI. A prospective monocentric study evaluating
		[¹⁸F]FDG-PET in 30 consecutive adults and children with European Organization for
		Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group probable or proven IFI was
		"performed. Twenty males and ten females (median age, 45 years (range 6-7 years))"
		"were enrolled. Twenty-six were immunocompromised, as follows: haematological"
		"malignancy (18) with allogeneic stem cell transplantation (16/18), solid tumour"
		"(three), solid organ transplantation (two), diabetes mellitus (two) and cystic"
		"fibrosis (one). IFIs were acute invasive aspergillosis (ten), chronic"
		"disseminated candidiasis (ten), zygomycosis (two), black grains eumycetoma (two),"
		"pulmonary Histoplasma capsulatum var. capsulatum histoplasmosis (two), and"
		"Phomopsis sp. osteoarthritis, Scedosporium apiospermum and Candida krusei"
		"spondylodiscitis, and acute pulmonary coccidioidomycosis in one case each. An"
		increased uptake of [¹⁸F]FDG was observed in all areas previously identified by
		computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging to be involved by IFI. In
		"4/10 chronic disseminated candidiasis cases, [¹⁸F]FDG-PET revealed small splenic"
		abscesses that were unapparent on the corresponding computed tomography scan.
		[¹⁸F]FDG uptake disappeared after 6 months of antifungal therapy in three
		patients with chronic disseminated candidiasis for whom the [¹⁸F]FDG-PET was
		performed to assess the evolution of the disease. [¹⁸F]FDG-PET could potentially
		be useful for the initial diagnosis and staging of IFI. Whether or not
		[¹⁸F]FDG-PET might be useful for assessing the optimal duration of IFI therapy
		should now be assessed in a specific prospective study.

		head and neck area.
PG	-	e52-7
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To investigate oral Candida strain diversity in patients receiving
		radiation therapy for head and neck cancer compared to controls by conventional
		"procedures, including cultivation of imprint samples on chromogenic medium and"
		subsequent identification using Analytical Profile Index testing. METHOD AND
		MATERIALS: Twenty-two irradiated patients aged 18 to 55 years were recruited from
		"the Maxillofacial Prosthetic Service, Mahidol University. Concomitantly, 22"
		healthy individuals whose age and sex matched that of the patient group were
		selected for a control group. RESULTS: All patients studied were Candida carriers
		and were predominantly infected with Candida albicans (86.36%). Besides C
		"albicans, other yeasts colonizing the oral cavity of these patients were C"
		"glabrata, C krusei, and C tropicalis. Candida carriage was found relatively less"
		"frequently (45.45%) in control subjects. However, C albicans was still the"
		predominant species detected. No C dubliniensis was found in either group.
		CONCLUSION: Head and neck cancer patients who had received radiotherapy had a
		"high prevalence of Candida colonization in the oral cavity. Consequently,"
		prophylaxis to reduce Candida infection in these patients is required. This may
		improve the quality of life for patients who receive irradiation treatment for
		malignant cancer.

AB	-	Abstract We conducted a four-year (2003-2006) retrospective study of yeasts
		recovered in a hospital laboratory in the centre of Portugal to evaluate the
		epidemiology of yeast infections. Clinical isolates and data were gathered from
		751 patients corresponding to 906 episodes of yeast infection. The isolates were
		"first identified using classical and commercial methods, routinely employed at"
		the hospital laboratory. We then re-identified the same isolates using RFLP of
		the ITS 5.8S rRNA gene and sequence of the D1/D2 domain of the 26S rRNA gene.
		Candida parapsilosis isolates were re-identified using the Ban I digestion of the
		SADH gene. C. albicans was the most frequently isolated of the yeasts found in
		"the analysed specimens, with an overall incidence of 69.6% and then in decreasing"
		"order, C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis and C. krusei. C. parapsilosis"
		"was most frequently recovered from younger patients, decreasing with age, while"
		C. glabrata occurrence increased with age. We found an increased number of cases
		"of fungemia per 100,000 people per year, reaching a maximum of 4.4 during 2006."

TI	-	Assessment of preemptive treatment to prevent severe candidiasis in critically
		ill surgical patients.
PG	-	2443-9
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of a preemptive antifungal therapy in
		preventing proven candidiasis in critically ill surgical patients. DESIGN:
		"Before/after intervention study, with 2-yr prospective and 2-yr historical"
		control cohorts. SETTING: Surgical intensive care unit (SICU) in a
		"university-affiliated hospital. PATIENTS: Nine hundred and thirty-three patients,"
		"478 in the prospective group and 455 in the control group, with SICU stay > or =5"
		"days. INTERVENTIONS: During the prospective period, systematic mycological"
		"screening was performed on all patients admitted to the SICU, immediately at"
		admittance and then weekly until discharge. A corrected colonization index was
		used to assess intensity of Candida mucosal colonization. Patients with corrected
		colonization index > or =0.4 received early preemptive antifungal therapy
		"(fluconazole intravenously: loading dose 800 mg, then 400 mg/day for 2 wks)."
		MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: End points of this study were the frequency of
		"proven candidiasis, especially SICU-acquired candidiasis. During the"
		"retrospective period, 32 patients of 455 (7%) presented with proven candidiasis:"
		22 (4.8%) were imported and 10 (2.2%) were SICU-acquired cases. During the
		"prospective period, 96 patients with corrected colonization index > or =0.4 of"
		478 received preemptive antifungal treatment and only 18 cases (3.8%) of proven
		candidiasis were diagnosed; all were imported infections. Candida infections
		occurred more frequently in the control cohort (7% vs. 3.8%; p = .03). Incidence
		of SICU-acquired proven candidiasis significantly decreased from 2.2% to 0% (p <
		".001, Fisher test). Incidence of proven imported candidiasis remained unchanged"
		(4.8% vs. 3.8%; p = .42). No emergence of azole-resistant Candida species
		"(especially Candida glabrata, Candida krusei) was noted during the prospective"
		period. CONCLUSIONS: Targeted preemptive strategy may efficiently prevent
		acquisition of proven candidiasis in SICU patients. Further studies are being
		performed to assess cost-effectiveness of this strategy and its impact on
		selection of azole-resistant Candida strains on a long-term basis.

TI	-	Molecular typing for investigating an outbreak of Candida krusei.
PG	-	117-23
AB	-	Invasive infections due to Candida krusei are often observed in immunocompromised
		"patients who have received prior therapy with fluconazole, although infection has"
		also occurred in patients in the absence of this antifungal agent. From August 25
		"through September 19, 1995, we identified four patients with C. krusei fungemia"
		on our hematology/oncology unit. Molecular typing of all the isolates was
		performed by restriction endonuclease analysis of genomic DNA using HinfI. A
		total of 7 patients found to be colonized or infected with C. krusei were matched
		with 14 controls. There was no difference between the cases and controls with
		"respect to underlying disease, duration of hospitalization, or neutropenia. The"
		"numbers of days of hyperalimentation, corticosteroids, and antibiotics were"
		similar between both groups. The mean number of antibiotics was greater in the
		cases versus controls (5.0 versus 2.5; p = .003). There was no difference with
		respect to total dose or duration of fluconazole administration. Molecular typing
		"of the isolates revealed that four had identical DNA banding patterns, plus"
		another two that differed by one band and were considered related. Three
		"historical strains were unrelated. In conclusion, this report demonstrates that"
		"molecular typing can be used to define clonality and, thereby, support increased"
		infection control practices to eliminate such outbreaks when evidence of clonal
		spread is present.

		"with Candida albicans and Candida stellatoidea, including the ability to produce"
		"germ tubes and chlamydospores. However, in contrast to these latter two species,"
		"C. dubliniensis isolates produce abundant chlamydospores, which are often"
		"arranged in contiguous pairs, triplets and other multiples suspended from a"
		single suspensor cell. They belong to C. albicans serotype A and exhibit atypical
		substrate assimilation profiles. Genomic DNA fingerprinting analysis with the C.
		albicans-specific probe 27A and five different oligonucleotide probes consisting
		"of short repeat sequence-containing motifs, demonstrated that C. dubliniensis has"
		a distinct genomic organisation relative to C. albicans and C. stellatoidea. This
		was confirmed by karyotype analysis and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)
		analysis. Comparison of 500 bp of the V3 variable region of the large ribosomal
		subunit genes from 14 separate C. dubliniensis isolates and the corresponding
		"sequences from C. albicans, C. stellatoidea, C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, C."
		"parapsilosis, C. kefyr and C. krusei demonstrated that the C. dubliniensis"
		"isolates formed a homogenous cluster (100% similarity), representing a discrete"
		taxon within the genus Candida that was significantly different from the other
		species analysed.

PG	-	259-63

AB	-	Candida krusei has been documented as an emerging pathogen causing nosocomial
		outbreaks. The consecutive isolation of C. krusei strains in three patients
		admitted to the same hospital department within 2 months lead us to consider the
		"possibility of an outbreak. Additionally, C. krusei isolates were collected from"
		"the room surfaces, whereas another isolate had been recovered from the blood of"
		one patient 2 years before. HinfI DNA restriction endonuclease-based analysis of
		all C. krusei isolates was performed and restriction profiles were compared.
		"Surprisingly, isolates from different patients were unrelated, whereas isolates"
		from biological products of the same patient showed indistinguishable HinfI
		restriction patterns and were similar to those obtained from the surrounding
		environment of the respective patients. The study approach revealed the
		endogenous origin of the C. krusei infectious episodes observed and demonstrated
		"that, subsequent to colonizing a patient, C. krusei can be involved in infectious"
		"episodes distant in time. The hypothesis of an outbreak was excluded, although we"
		believe that the methodology employed in the present study represents a valuable
		tool for diagnostic and epidemiological surveys.

PG	-	554-565
LID	-	10.3290/j.qi.a44630 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To assess the relationship between the development of denture-related
		"stomatitis (DRS) and the identification of commonly isolated yeast species, and"
		to evaluate various predisposing factors in Saudi participants wearing new
		removable dental prostheses. METHOD AND MATERIALS: A total of 75 edentulous male
		"participants were recruited, and 64 patients finished the present case-series."
		All participants received new conventional complete dentures. Colonization of
		"Candida species was assessed, and species were identified by means of the VITEK 2"
		(bioMérieux) laboratory components. RESULTS: The most prevalent type of Candida
		"at baseline was C albicans, followed by non-C albicans species (C glabrata)."
		Counts of Candida species significantly increased from the day of insertion to
		"the first month (P < . 05), but there were no significant changes between the"
		"first and second month (P > . 05). On the day of insertion, C tropicalis, C"
		"dubliniensis, and C krusei were extracted from few subjects only, with no"
		significant changes over the first and second month (P > .05). Patients revealing
		habits of sleeping with their dentures were found to frequently suffer from DRS;
		"development of the latter was rapid, and mixed Candida biofilms (with high CFU/mL"
		"counts), along with inadequate oral and denture hygiene, turned out to be"
		contributing factors (P < .05). CONCLUSION: DRS can develop faster than
		"previously reported, even with new dentures; continued denture wearing and poor"
		cleaning of dentures revealed a considerable impact on DRS onset. In the present
		"cohort, C albicans was the most identified kind of yeast, and was followed by C"
		glabrata infection in cases with DRS.

TI	-	[Antifungal susceptibility of Candida spp. isolates from blood cultures in a
		five-year period (1997-2001)].
PG	-	488-92
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: This retrospective study investigates the incidence of candidemia
		and antifungal susceptibility of Candida spp. isolates from blood cultures
		performed in the period from January 1997 to December 2001. METHODS: Amphotericin
		"B, fluconazole, itraconazole and flucytosine minimal inhibitory concentrations"
		(MICs) were determined using the Sensititre YeastOne broth microdilution assay
		"for the 53 isolates detected in the study period: C. parapsilosis (22), C."
		"albicans (19), C. glabrata (5), C. krusei (3), C. tropicalis (2) and C."
		guilliermondii (2). RESULTS: The incidence of candidemia was 0.25 episodes per
		1000 admissions in the period studied. C. parapsilosis was present in 41.5% of
		"cases, followed by C. albicans (35.8%), C. glabrata (9.4%), C. krusei (5.5%), C."
		tropicalis (3.7%) and C. guilliermondii (3.7%). Isolation of C. parapsilosis was
		significantly associated with the neonatal and pediatric ICU. None of the
		isolates presented an amphotericin B MIC > 1 micro g/ml. All the C. krusei
		isolates were resistant to fluconazole. Itraconazole resistance and
		dose-dependent fluconazole susceptibility was found in 80% of C. glabrata
		isolates. Only one C. parapsilosis isolate was resistant to flucytosine.
		CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of candidemia in our hospital was low. C. parapsilosis
		was the most common species and was associated with neonatal and pediatric ICUs.
		Fluconazole and itraconazole resistance was only found among C. krusei and C.
		"glabrata isolates, which accounted for 15% of the total Candida spp. isolated"
		from blood cultures in our hospital.

AB	-	Superficial fungal diseases that affect the skin and its appendages are
		frequently seen in basic triage and in dermatology services. These diseases are
		distributed in Venezuela with an incidence of 92.9%. The aim of this study was to
		determine the genera and species that cause dermatomycoses in residents of
		"Anzoátegui state, Venezuela, during the period 2002-2012. A total of 4257"
		"patients with a presumptive diagnosis of superficial mycoses were studied, with"
		ages from 7 months to 79 years. The overall prevalence was 30.9%. The most
		frequent were dermatophytosis (44.7%). M. canis produced 148 cases of tinea
		"capitis. Three dermatophytic agents represented 95% of all cases, with a"
		significant predominance of T. mentagrophytes with 50%. Candidosis occurred in
		"28.4%. C. albicans, and the C. parapsilosis complex, were responsible for 80% of"
		"the cases. The other species identified were C. tropicalis (n = 41, 11.0%), C."
		"glabrata (n = 10, 2.7%), C. guilliermondii (n = 6, 1.6%), C. krusei (n = 4,"
		"1.1%). Pityriasis versicolor occurred in 22.4% of the cases studied, and less"
		frequently were present onychomycosis produced by a non dermatophytic mold:
		"Fusarium oxysporum (n = 34, 65.4%), Aspergillus terreus (n=16, 30.8%) and"
		Scytalidium dimidiatum (n=2; 3.8%). Rare cases of Trichosporon onychomycosis
		(0.5%) and one case of black tinea were also found. Health education in the
		population is recommended to promote measures to prevent transmission of these
		fungi and prevent the spread of this silent public health problem.

TI	-	Pneumonia due to Candida krusei.
PG	-	806-9
AB	-	A case of post-transplantation pneumonia due to Candida krusei is reported. A
		"42-year-old man was admitted 28 days after heart transplantation with cough,"
		pleuritic pain and fever. A chest computed tomograph showed multiple alveolar
		"infiltrates bilaterally. He received broad-spectrum antibiotics, fluconazole for"
		"oral candidiasis, and cotrimoxazole for possible Pneumocystis carinii. A"
		short-lived period of improvement was followed by respiratory failure. Cultures
		of bronchial washings grew C. krusei and C. albicans. The infection was
		documented by histology and culture obtained by transthoracic aspiration.
		"Treatment with amphotericin B was initiated, but the patient died. Histology and"
		"culture of a pulmonary specimen, obtained immediately post mortem, further"
		documented the infection with C. krusei.

TI	-	Nosocomial breakthrough fungaemia during antifungal prophylaxis or empirical
		antifungal therapy in 41 cancer patients receiving antineoplastic chemotherapy:
		analysis of aetiology risk factors and outcome.
PG	-	373-80
AB	-	Forty-one episodes of breakthrough fungaemia occurring over a 7.5 year period in
		"the National and St Elizabeth's Cancer Institutes in Bratislava, Slovakia, were"
		analysed. Five of them occurred during prophylaxis with fluconazole (one
		"Torulopsis glabrata, one Hansenula anomala, two Candida krusei and one Candida"
		"parapsilosis), ten with itraconazole (three Trichosporon pullulans, one"
		"Trichosporon beigelii, one Cryptococcus laurentii, three Candida albicans and two"
		"T. glabrata), 11 during prophylaxis with ketoconazole (one Candida norvegenesis,"
		"one C. parapsilosis, one C. krusei, one Candida tropicalis, five C. albicans, one"
		Candida stellatoidea and one C. laurentii and 15 during empirical therapy with
		"amphotericin B (ten C. albicans, two T. beigelii and three Candida lusitaniae)."
		"The most frequent risk factors for breakthrough fungaemia were neutropenia,"
		previous therapy with multiple antibiotics and recent catheter insertion.
		Comparing these episodes with 38 non-breakthrough fungaemias (appearing at the
		same institute in the same period) differences in certain risk factors were
		noted: breakthrough fungaemias were more frequently observed in patients with
		"acute leukaemia (39.0% vs 5.2%, P < 0.001), mucositis (34.2% vs 13.1%, P < 0.05),"
		"prophylaxis with quinolones (58.5% vs 15.8%, P < 0.0001) and catheter-associated"
		"infections (29.3% vs 2.6%, P < 0.003). In this subgroup overall mortality (36.6%"
		vs 28.8%) or early attributable mortality (22.0% vs 23.6%) were not significantly
		different.

PG	-	47-53
AB	-	"AIM: To study the etiology, clinical manifestations, risk factors, and results of"
		treatment for candidemia (CE) in patients with blood system tumors. SUBJECTS AND
		METHODS: The investigation included the patients with CE and hemoblastoses
		"treated at the Hematology Research Center, Ministry of Health of the Russian"
		"Federation, in 2006 to 2012. The diagnosis of CE was established according to the"
		single isolation of Candida spp. from blood cultures and the presence of
		"infection symptoms. RESULTS: Over 7 years, CE was diagnosed in 57 patients aged"
		"17 to 77 years (median age 48 years). Among the patients with CE, there was a"
		preponderance of those with lymphomas (54%) and acute leukemias (30%). The
		"pathogens of CE were C. albicans (33%), C. guilliermondii (26%), C. parapsilosis"
		"(12%), C. krusei (8%), C. lusitaniae (5%), C. famata (4%), C. tropicalis (4%), C."
		"glabrata (4%), and C. pelliculosa (4%). The major risk factors were"
		"polychemotherapy (85%), granulocytopenia (63%), mucosal Candida spp. colonization"
		"(82%), the presence of central venous catheter (CVC) (97%), antibiotics (100%),"
		and glucocorticosteroids (70%). The infection occurred with the intake of an
		antifungal agent in 33% of the patients; 60% had concomitant infections of other
		etiology. Antifungal agents were given to 52 (91%) patients. Within 30 days after
		"CE diagnosis, 20 (35%) patients died; of them 12 (60%) patients showed tumor"
		progression concurrent with the infection. The cure rate for CE was significantly
		"higher in the use of echinocandin as a first-line drug (92%), in complete or"
		"partial remission in hemoblastosis (90%), CVC removal (76%) and in the"
		administration of an antifungal drug on day 1 of detection of positive blood
		cultures (75%). The cure rate was significantly lower when septic shock developed
		"and a patient was transferred to an intensive care unit (15%), when amphotericin"
		"B was used as a first-line drug (45%), when granulocytopenia occurred (53%), or"
		glucocorticoids were given (55%). CONCLUSION: Candida non-albicans constitute a
		high proportion among the pathogens of CE. A number of risk factors influencing
		survival rates in CE have been identified. It is crucial to use echinocandin as a
		first-line agent as soon as possible after isolation of Candida spp. from blood
		cultures.

TI	-	Impact of high-dose granulocyte transfusions in patients with cancer with
		candidemia: retrospective case-control analysis of 491 episodes of Candida
		species bloodstream infections.
PG	-	2859-65
AB	-	BACKGROUND: The efficacy and feasibility of donor granulocyte transfusion therapy
		(GTX) have changed considerably over the past four decades. The authors sought to
		determine the impact of high-dose (approximately 5.5 x 10(10) cells) GTX in
		patients with candidemia. METHODS: The authors' case-control retrospective
		analysis comprised 491 consecutive patients treated at The University of Texas M.
		"D. Anderson Cancer Center (Houston,TX) from 1993 to 2000. The cohort included 29"
		patients with Candida species bloodstream infection who had received GTX and 462
		"who had not. RESULTS: Both groups were comparable in age, gender, APACHE II"
		"score, recent chemotherapy received, broad-spectrum antibiotics, systemic"
		"corticosteroids, radiotherapy, intravascular catheter, and concordant antifungal"
		therapy (P > or = 0.1). The patients who received GTX compared with those who did
		"not had a higher incidence of underlying leukemia (86% vs. 29%, P <0.001),"
		"persistent neutropenia (59% vs. 18%, P <0.001), non-Candida albicans candidemia"
		"(Candida glabrata, 35%; Candida krusei, 31%: 90% vs. 67%, P=0.01), and"
		"breakthrough invasive mycosis (62% vs. 23%, P <0.001). Neutropenia was more"
		"prolonged in patients who received GTX (28 vs. 10 days, P <0.001). Also, more of"
		the patients who received GTX had received hematopoietic stem cell
		"transplantations (28% vs. 13%, P = 0.03), exposure (within 4 weeks) to"
		"antifungals (79% vs. 38%, P <0.001), and stays in critical care units (62% vs."
		"40%, P=0.02). The overall attributable mortality rate for 25 evaluable recipients"
		"of GTX was 48% (n=12), compared with 45% (n=115) of 254 evaluable patients in the"
		"control group (P=0.5). Of the 158 patients with leukemia, 25 (16%) had received"
		"GTX. In patients with leukemia, more of those who had received GTX experienced"
		disseminated candidiasis (44% vs. 26%; P <0.07) and persistent neutropenia (68%
		"vs. 43%, P <0.02), had candidemia that was more prolonged (> 72 hours, P <0.02),"
		"and had more stays in critical care units (68% vs. 44%, P <0.03). On the bases of"
		"a reduced multivariate model, a significantly increased risk of death was found"
		for patients with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (odds ratio [OR]=2.51;
		"95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.99-6.31; P <0.05), for patients with"
		"persistent neutropenia (OR=4.57; 95% CI, 1.99-10.47; P <0.0003), and for patients"
		"with leukemia who also had prolonged candidemia (OR=3.59; 95% CI, 1.61-7.98; P"
		"<0.002), disseminated candidiasis (OR=5.19; 95% CI, 2.17-12.42; P <0.0002), or"
		"non-C. albicans candidemia (OR=5.02; 95% CI, 1.07-23.64; P <0.04). In patients"
		"with leukemia, death was attributable to candidemia in 50% of the GTX recipients,"
		compared with 59% of the non-GTX patients who had received antifungal therapy
		alone (P=0.4). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the presence of multiple predictors of
		"increased mortality, high-dose GTX therapy in these high-risk patients with"
		cancer was associated with better than expected survival rates.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify yeasts from commercial attiéké. PATIENTS
		AND METHODS: This descriptive cross-sectional survey involving 103 samples of
		attiéké sold on the market from August to September 2017. It was conducted from
		the mycology laboratory of the Institut Pasteur of Côte d'Ivoire. The samples
		were seeded on YGC medium. The colonies of positive culture were counted and
		seeded again on chromogen medium. Identification of yeasts species was carried
		"out by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Vitek MS bioMérieux). RESULTS: As a whole,"
		63 samples were contaminated with fungi i.e. an overall prevalence of 61.1 %.
		Fifty-nine of yeasts were identified i.e. 57.2 %. Candida rugosa was most
		"frequently isolated (62.7 %), followed by Ccandida albicans (8.5 %), Candida"
		krusei (8.5 %) et Candida tropicalis (8.5 %). Geotrichum candidum represented
		"6.8 % isolated yeasts. The yeast average load is 10,124×10(2) CFU/g with high"
		contamination of commercial attiéké in the commune of Abobo. CONCLUSION: The
		contamination of attiéké by yeasts is a reality. C. rugosa was most frequently
		isolated. It would be necessary to investigate the food chain to determine the
		source of contamination.

PG	-	177-81

AB	-	We describe a case of congenital acquired candidiasis in a preterm female
		delivered through Caesarean section due to the premature rupture of the amniotic
		membrane. The neonate presented with suspected chorioamnionitis and erythematous
		"desquamative skin. Candida albicans was isolated from the placenta, mouth, groin,"
		and periumbilical lesions. The infant developed candidemia due to Candida
		albicans and the same yeast was also isolated from a catheter. Culture inoculated
		with swabs from the mouth and vagina of the mother yielded C. albicans and C.
		krusei. All C. albicans isolates from the mother and the neonate were visually
		indistinguishable by molecular typing techniques which included chromosomal
		karyotyping and restriction endonuclease analysis followed by pulsed-field gel
		electrophoresis. These findings allowed the clinical condition to be confirmed as
		congenital acquisition of candidiasis in this case.

PG	-	679-82
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To determine the various oral Candidal species among healthy Malaysian
		adults. DESIGN: Case-control study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: This study was
		"collaborated between the Department of Medical Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine"
		"and Department of Oral Pathology, Oral Medicine and Periodontology, Faculty of"
		"Dentistry, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, between September 2002"
		till January 2004. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred adults (50 smokers and 50
		"non-smokers), aged between 40 and 70 years were studied. Swabs and carbohydrate"
		"assimilation (Saboraud Dextrose Agar, Corn Meal Agar, API 20C AUX System) were"
		"performed. Specimens were collected from dorsum of the tongue, buccal mucosa and"
		commissures (right and left each). Colony forms were established by positive
		"colony forming units, on SDA medium (24-48 hours). Germ tube test for"
		(true/pseudohyphae) growth was done on Corn Meal Agar Medium. Candida biotypes
		"were evaluated by API 20C AUX system, which had a numerical 7 digit profile,"
		added to evaluate a definite Candida species. RESULTS: Thirty-five percent of
		Malaysian adults harbored Candida intraorally. Candidal species identified among
		"100 subjects had C. albicans (27) 77%, C. glabrata (3) 8%, C. famata, C."
		"tropicalis, C. krusei, C. lusitaniae and C. guilliermondii (1) 3% each."
		Thirty-three positive cases comprised of 35 species i.e. two cases had two
		species each. Fifty seven percent of these were smokers and 43% non-smokers.
		"These included 40% Chinese, 36% Malays and 24% Indians. Species were, however,"
		"not specified according to intra-oral sites i.e. buccal, commissural mucosa and"
		dorsum of tongue. CONCLUSION: On this series C. albicans is the most common
		species found in the oral cavity of Malaysian adults. It is equally frequent in
		"smokers and non-smokers, but showed a predilection for the ethnic Chinese group."

AB	-	The Epidemiological Investigation Committee for Human Mycoses in Japan performed
		a retrospective epidemiological survey of candidemia and causative Candida
		species. Data from 2003 to 2014 were collected from 10 Japanese university
		"hospitals. A total of 328,318 blood cultures were included. The prevalence of"
		"fungi in all cultures and in positive cultures were 0.58±0.09% and 4.46±0.66%,"
		"respectively. Among the results that were positive for Candida species (N=1,921),"
		Candida albicans was the most common species (39.5%) and was followed by Candida
		"parapsilosis (23.3%), Candida glabrata (13.2%), Candida tropicalis (7.1%),"
		"Candida krusei (3.2%), and others (13.7%). During the last 6 years, the frequency"
		"of C. albicans has significantly decreased in Japan, while that of C. glabrata"
		has increased. Additional surveys are needed to continuously monitor the trends
		in the distribution of candidemia.

PG	-	15-20
AB	-	A forty-eight-year old male diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia was further
		complicated by Candida krusei fungemia despite introduction of fluconazole
		prophylaxis during antileukemic therapy. The fungemia subsided after intravenous
		amphotericin B therapy followed by itraconazole therapy. Multiple ulcerative
		"lesions and a carcinoid lesion were observed in the transverse colon, and it was"
		thought that the C. krusei had invaded from the ulcerative lesions. Azole
		"antifungal agents, especially fluconazole, have frequently been used for therapy"
		and the prophylaxis of fungal infections. Though infections due to
		"fluconazole-resistant Candida species such as C. krusei are a growing problem, in"
		the hematology division of our hospital there is no evidence of an increasing
		incidence of C. krusei fungemia or an increasing rate of C. krusei in
		"surveillance culture from admitted patients. However, future increases in"
		infections due to fluconazole-resistant Candida species like C. krusei and C.
		"glabrata are entirely possible, making it necessary to identify isolated fungi,"
		"perform susceptibility tests on antifungal agents against isolates, measure the"
		"serum concentrations of antifungal agents, and then to treat patients with the"
		appropriate therapies.

PG	-	290-4
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: (1) To identify and characterize the Candida species isolates from
		lower respiratory tract infection. (2) to determine the rate of isolation of
		Candida species from sputum samples. METHODS: This study was carried out in the
		"Department of Microbiology, Manipal Teaching Hospital, Pokhara, Nepal from June"
		2002 to January 2003. A total of 462 sputum samples were collected from patients
		suspected lower respiratory tract infection. The samples were processed as Gram
		"staining to find out the suitability of the specimen, cultured on Sabouraud's"
		Dextrose Agar (SDA) and also on blood agar and chocolate agar to identify the
		"potential lower respiratory tract pathogens. For the identification of Candida,"
		"sputum samples were processed for Gram stain, culture, germ tube test, production"
		"of chlamydospore, sugar fermentation and assimilation test. For the"
		"identification of bacteria, Gram stain, culture, and biochemical tests were"
		"performed by standardized procedure. RESULT: Out of 462 samples, 246 (53.24%)"
		samples grew potential pathogens of lower respiratory tract. Among them
		Haemophilus influenzae 61(24.79%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae 57 (23.17%) were
		the predominant bacterial pathogens. Candida species were isolated from 30
		samples (12.2%). The majority of Candida species amongst the Candida isolates
		were Candida albicans 21(70%) followed by Candida tropicalis 4(13.33%). Candida
		"krusei 3(10%), Candida parapsilosis 1(3.33%) and Candida stellatoidea 1(3.33%)."
		The highest rate of isolation of Candida was between the age of 71 and 80.
		CONCLUSION: Candida isolation from sputum samples is important as found in the
		present study in which Candida species were the third most common pathogen
		isolated from patients with lower respiratory tract infection.

AB	-	Infections of the pleural cavity remain an important cause of morbidity and
		mortality despite advancement in diagnostic modalities and therapy. Community
		acquired empyema thoracis due to Candida species are rarely reported in
		paediatric literature. We hereby report an interesting case of empyema due to
		co-infection of Candida krusei with Candida tropicalis. A 11-year-old female
		child presented with respiratory distress. Chest X-ray showed massive pleural
		"effusion, thoracocentesis showed it as purulent exudate and she was empirically"
		treated with antibiotics. C. tropicalis and C. krusei were isolated from the pus
		sample proving to be fungal empyema. Inspite of antifungal agents and mechanical
		"ventilation, her general condition rapidly deteriorated and she succumbed."

TI	-	Emergence of disseminated candidiasis caused by Candida krusei during treatment
		with caspofungin: case report and review of literature.
PG	-	559-64
AB	-	Current data indicate that caspofungin has in vitro activity against virtually
		"all Candida species. However, we report herein a case of disseminated candidiasis"
		due to Candida krusei which emerged during caspofungin treatment. Lung and brain
		secondary sites were then successfully treated using a combination of
		"amphotericin B plus flucytosine, amphotericin B lipid complex, and voriconazole,"
		sequentially. Among the total of four well documented cases of refractory
		"invasive candidiasis during caspofungin therapy, the common risk factors appear"
		"to involve prior abdominal surgery, persistent foreign body, and anatomical sites"
		where drug concentrations may be sub-optimal for Candida species with increased
		MICs. Caspofungin failure should be suspected in patients with persistent or
		emergent signs and symptoms of deep-seated invasive candidiasis.

TI	-	Evaluating the effect of soft lining materials on the growth of yeast.
PG	-	404-9
AB	-	STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Soft lining materials continue to have a place in clinical
		"removable prosthodontics. However, there is an increased probability of yeast"
		colonization on soft lining materials. PURPOSE: This study (1) assessed a method
		of evaluating the effect of long-term soft lining materials on the growth of
		yeast and (2) investigated the effect five soft lining materials had on the
		"growth of three species of yeast. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Coe Supersoft, Novus, and"
		three experimental soft lining materials were investigated together with Candida
		"albicans, Candida tropicalis, and Issatchenkia orientalis (formerly Candida"
		krusei) yeasts. Strips of soft lining material incubated on blood agar plates
		were examined for inhibition of the growth of yeast. Soft lining materials soaked
		in sterile trypticase soya broth or water were inoculated with yeast and
		incubated. The change in colony forming units per milliliter from the initial
		load of yeast at 3 days was measured. Statistical analysis was performed with an
		independent paired Student t test. RESULTS: Inhibition of yeast growth occurred
		for two soft lining materials. Despite the presence of sufficient viable
		"organisms, differences between the initial load of yeast and the 3-day results"
		"were mostly small, both for the test and control groups, suggesting that the"
		material does not support the growth of the tested yeast during this period.
		CONCLUSIONS: The often described increased prevalence of yeast associated with
		soft lining materials in the oral environment is likely related to readily
		available nutrients in the mouth and the difficulty in maintaining and cleaning
		these materials.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: The aim of our study was to evaluate the concordance between the
		two antifungal susceptibility testing of Candida sp. isolates using agar
		diffusion method: Neo-Sensitabs(®) tablets and Bio-Rad(®) disks. MATERIALS AND
		METHODS: This is a prospective study conducted in the Laboratory of Parasitology
		and Mycology of the Mohammed V military teaching hospital from February to August
		"2012. Upon receiving blood cultures and peripheral sites samples, the"
		identification of Candida isolates performed using routine phenotypic standard
		tests and the realization of the antifungal susceptibility was carried out on
		Neo-sensitabs(®) tablets and Bio-Rad(®) disks. RESULTS: A total of 38 Candida
		"strains were isolated: 15 C. albicans (39%), 13 C. glabrata (34%), 5 C."
		"tropicalis (13%), 4 C. krusei (11%) and 1 C. dubliniensis (3%). There were no"
		significant difference (P>0.05) in susceptibility rate between both methods for
		all antifungal agents tested except for 5-fluorocytosine. The concordance
		"percentage between two methods was 100% for amphotericin B, 97.4% for"
		"fluconazole, 94.7% for voriconazole and 73% for 5-fluorocytosine. CONCLUSION:"
		"Both methods are easy to perform, rapid and cost effective. Our results showed"
		the best agreement between the two methods for testing the susceptibility of
		"Candida isolates to amphotericin B, fluconazole and voriconazole while for the"
		"5-fluorocytosine, the concordance rate was low."

TI	-	Oral itraconazole in treatment of candidemia in a pediatric intensive care unit.
PG	-	973-7
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To examine efficacy of itraconazole in the treatment of candidemia in
		critically ill children. METHODS: We studied retrospectively cases of candidemia
		seen consecutively in our Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) over three and
		"half years. Candida isolates from those patients included. Candida albicans--19,"
		"C. tropicalis--31, C. guillermondii--9, C.krusei--4 and C. glabrata--1. RESULTS:"
		"Of the 64 patients, 48 (75%) had symptoms suggestive of septicemia and 16 had no"
		symptoms suggestive of septicemia. No antifungal therapy was given to
		asymptomatic patients; they recovered from candidemia without development of any
		sequelae. Of the 48 symptomatic patients 11 died before results of fungal culture
		became available and antifungal therapy could be started. Thirty seven patients
		were treated with itraconazole (10 mg/kg/day orally or through gastric tube).
		"Seven (18.9 %) of 37 patients died, 3 within first week of antifungal therapy."
		Thirty (81%) patients recovered; microbiological cure was noted on average by day
		14 (range 4-30 days). The mean +/- SD duration of therapy in patients who
		responded was 24 +/-7 days (range 21-42 days). None had any major side effect.
		CONCLUSION: We conclude that oral itraconazole may be effective in treatment of
		candidemia in children in a PICU where non-C. albicans candida species
		constituted majority (70%) of all Candida isolates.

		unit].
PG	-	382-5
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To conduct a retrospective analysis of the invasive fungal infection
		(IFI) in surgical intensive care unit (SICU). METHODS: The IFI data of the
		patients who were admitted in SICU during January 2003 to December 2008 was
		retrospectively analyzed. A total of 3743 patients were admitted into SICU. Among
		"them, 271 patient's SICU duration was more than 48 hours, who had fungi"
		"examination. RESULTS: Seventy-five patients were diagnosed IFI, the morbidity was"
		"2.00% (75/3743), the incidence of fungemia was 0.27% (10/3743), the mortality of"
		IFI patients was 49.33% (37/75). The morbidity rate of each year was almost the
		same. The mortality of 2007 and 2008 was higher than before (both P < 0.05).

		in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia.
LID	-	13030/qt52j7w4g1 [pii]
AB	-	Candida krusei (C. krusei) is a multidrug-resistant opportunistic fungal pathogen
		"that may cause disseminated infections in immunocompromised hosts. However, its"
		clinical and histologic features are not well-characterized. We present a unique
		case to contribute to the growing knowledge base associated with this organism.
		"During hospitalization for neutropenic fever, a 19-year-old man with acute"
		"myeloid leukemia, who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation,"
		developed a generalized folliculocentric eruption following initiation of
		antifungal therapy for newly diagnosed C. krusei fungemia. Despite adequate
		"antifungal coverage and negative blood cultures, the follicular-based"
		erythematous papules persisted. Biopsies demonstrated yeast within ruptured
		"follicles, without angiotropism or involvement of the interfollicular dermis,"
		"subcutaneous tissue, or stratum corneum. Concurrent skin tissue cultures"
		confirmed C. krusei. The patient remained febrile despite aggressive antifungal
		"therapy, with relapse of leukemia and subsequent death. Our case is unusual given"
		"the development of cutaneous lesions following clearance of fungemia, with yeast"
		"limited to ruptured follicular lumina, possibly indicating a primary cutaneous"
		source or early transfollicular/transepidermal elimination. Given the limited
		"available descriptions of cutaneous histopathology for C. krusei, we seek to add"
		to the understanding of its pathophysiology and aid in the diagnosis and
		treatment of this often fatal infection.

AB	-	Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is diagnosed almost exclusively in immunocompromised
		"patients. It is located mainly in the lungs or paranasal sinuses, but"
		occasionally other organs and the gastrointestinal tract may also be affected
		either alone or as a part of a disseminated disease. The main risk factors
		"predisposing to IA are neutropenia, immunosuppressive and steroid therapy, as"
		well as severe underlying disease. Despite progress in diagnostics and therapy of
		"IA, it is still characterized by a high mortality rate. In the disseminated"
		"aspergillosis of the gastrointestinal tract, mainly the small or large intestine"
		"are affected, rarely the upper gastrointestinal tract. To our best knowledge only"
		a very few cases of IA of the gastric wall have been reported so far in the
		literature. We describe a unique case of this very rare location of IA in the
		stomach in a patient who underwent orthotopic liver transplantation in the course
		of active IA and Candida krusei infection of the stomach wall. The patient's
		condition improved on combination therapy of voriconazole and caspofungin.

AB	-	"A 10-year prospective survey of fungaemia in the Slovak Republic, involving 31"
		"microbiology laboratories and 71 hospitals, was conducted from 1989-1998 (10"
		"years): 310 fungaemias were analyzed for etiology, clinical characteristics,"

TI	-	Do clinical features allow for accurate prediction of fungal pathogenesis in
		bloodstream infections? Potential implications of the increasing prevalence of
		non-albicans candidemia.
PG	-	1077-83
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To describe the evolving epidemiology of fungal bloodstream infections
		in critically ill and noncritically ill patients and to identify predictors of
		infection with non-albicans yeast species. DESIGN: Retrospective case series.
		"SETTING: Two academic, tertiary care centers. PARTICIPANTS: All persons during a"
		4-yr period who developed fungemia. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN
		RESULTS: We initially compared subjects with Candida albicans vs. alternative
		"yeast. In a sensitivity analysis, we compared persons with potentially"
		fluconazole-resistant organisms (Candida glabrata and Candida krusei) to those
		with other fungi. We also repeated these analyses in the subgroup of persons in
		the intensive care unit when they developed fungemia. The study cohort included
		"245 patients (60% in the intensive care unit), and C. albicans accounted for 52%"
		"of infections, whereas C. glabrata represented 20% of cases. The distribution of"
		isolates was similar in both intensive care unit patients and those on the wards.
		"In the entire population, no variable, including both previous fluconazole"
		"exposure and severity of illness, correlated with the fungemia due to a"
		"non-albicans species. In our sensitivity analysis, no factor was independently"
		associated with a potentially fluconazole-resistant yeast. For the subgroup of
		"subjects whose fungemia was diagnosed while they were in the intensive care unit,"
		no variable differentiated C. albicans from non-albicans isolates. CONCLUSIONS:
		Non-albicans yeast are common both in the intensive care unit and on the wards.
		Simple clinical factors do not allow the clinician to effectively identify
		patients likely infected with non-albicans pathogens or with possible
		fluconazole-resistant fungi.

TI	-	[Epidemiology of candidemia: results of a one month French hospitals-based
		surveillance study in 2004].
PG	-	523-30
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: The aim of our study was to determinate the frequency of
		"candidemia, the species encountered and their susceptibility to antifungal agents"
		"in French hospitals in 2004. METHODS: A prospective survey of septicaemia,"
		including candidaemia was conducted among 193 non teaching French hospitals
		during October 2004. All bloodstream infections were reported and the bloodstream
		isolates sent to two coordinating centers. Species identification and
		"susceptibility were performed by biologists as usual, and further confirmed by"
		"use of alternative methods, including Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC)"
		"determination. RESULTS: The survey was effective in 93 hospitals, where 2013"
		"bloodstream infections were noticed, including 46 candidaemia (2.3%). Candida sp."
		"Is the 7th pathogen responsible for bloodstream infection, without concern of the"
		origin of the infection. Candidaemia was hospital acquired in 80.4% of cases
		(N=37/46). Candidaemia represents 0.7% (N=9/1211) of community-acquired
		"bloodstream infections but 4.5% (N=37/802) of nosocomial cases, placing Candida"
		sp. at the 5th row of frequency in this last group. No mistakes were noticed
		"during identification, but two strains were not named. After confirmation of"
		"identification, species are distributed as follows: 23 C.albicans (50%), 13"
		"C.glabrata (28.3%), 5 C.tropicalis (10.9%), 3 C.parapsilosis (6.5%), 1 C.krusei"
		"(2.2%), and 1 C.kefyr (2.2%). The overall susceptibility is 97.7% for"
		"amphotericin B, 93.2% for 5-fluorocytosin, 88.6% for fluconazole, 70.5% for"
		"itraconazole, 95.5% for voriconzole and 100% of strains had very low MIC for"
		"caspofungin. Concerning the two main species isolated, 95.5% of C.albicans"
		"strains remain susceptible to fluconazole, but only 69% of C.glabrata strains."
		"Two strains, 1 C.albicans and 1 C.glabrata exhibit cross resistance to azoles."
		"The majority of amphotericin, fluconazole, and itraconazole decreased"
		"susceptibility strains are found into C.glabrata strains, but susceptibility to"
		5-fluorocytosin and very low MCI to caspofungin remained in this species.
		CONCLUSION: Our survey allowed us to get data from French non-teaching hospitals
		in 2004 about frequency of candidaemia among septicaemia. Candida species
		distribution and in vitro susceptibility patterns of the strains isolated.
		"Candidaemia is not a rare event, specially when septicaemia is nosocomially"
		acquired. C.albicans is the main species isolated and remains highly in vitro
		susceptible to antifungals. One important feature is the frequency of C.glabrata
		"in our survey. Considering its decreased susceptibility to azoles, this finding"
		confirms the need for rapid identification of yeast isolated from bloodstream
		"samples, and antifungal susceptibility testing each time it is available."

PG	-	531-6
AB	-	This study aimed to retrospectively evaluate the adequate use of antifungal drugs
		"in the treatment of the candidaemia. A collection of clinical, biological and"
		therapeutic data was carried out for the patients who had a positive blood
		culture for Candida species during the year 2004. The antifungal therapy was
		"compared to the guidelines of the French Conference of consensus named ""Prise en"
		"charge des candidoses et aspergilloses invasives de l'adulte"". The degree of"
		"conformity was classified as follows: complying, partly complying (molecule in"
		conformity but delay of treatment or unsuited dosing) and not complying with the
		"guidelines. The analysis was performed, according to the guidelines, before and"
		after knowledge of Candida species growing from the blood culture. On 29
		"candidaemia, the found species were: Candida albicans 55%, Candida glabrata 14%,"
		"Candida krusei 10%, Candida parapsilosis and Candida lusitaniae 7%, Candida"
		pelliculosa and Candida tropicalis 3.5%. Only 19 candidaemia were included in
		this study because blood cultures were known positive for Candida on the day of
		death (N=7) or medical charts were not available (N=3). For treatment before
		"identification of Candida species, 37% were complying, 37% in partly complying"
		and 26% not complying with the guidelines. For the treatment after identification
		"of the species, 26% were complying, 63% partly complying and 11% not complying"
		"with the guidelines. As a whole, antifungal therapy was totally or partly"
		complying in 74 to 89% of candidaemia in adult patients. Lower dosages of
		fluconazole explained most of the treatments that partly complied with
		guidelines.

PG	-	18-24
AB	-	The results of the microbiological diagnosis of infective inflammatory
		complications in patients with iatrogenic esophageotracheal fistula and the
		tactics of their antibacterial prophylaxis and therapy within a 9-year
		observation period (2003-2011) were analysed. The main organisms colonizing the
		"tracheobronchial tree in the patients were S. epidermidis, S. aureus, enteric"
		"bacteria, P. aeruginosa and Candida. An increase of the S. epidermidis resistance"
		"to rifampicin, moxifloxacin and especially ciprofloxacin was observed. The"
		resistance of S. aureus did not significantly change. Within the observation
		"period, high susceptibility of all the Staphylococcus isolates to vancomycin and"
		"linezolid remained stable. Among the nonfermenting gramnegative bacteria, the P."
		aeruginosa isolates were the most frequent and characterized by a lower portion
		of the isolates with preserved susceptibility to the agents (except polymyxin B)
		"known earlier as antipyocyanic antibiotics, i.e. to imipenem and cefepim. Since"
		the proportion of P. aeruginosa in the etiology of pyoinflammatory processes in
		"the region of esophageotracheal fistula ranged within 9.3 to 17.5%, the fact"
		should be considered in the antibiotic therapy. There was observed an increase in
		the frequency of infectious complications due to other nonfermenting gramnegative
		bacteria (acinetobacters) and first of all A.baumannii. Various Candida isolates
		were characterized by dependence of the susceptibility on the selective pressure
		"of irrational therapy, as well as their species (the presence of such species as"
		"C. Krusei and C. glabrata with natural resistance), that required not only the"
		species identification but also determination of the Candida isolates resistance
		in every particular case.

AB	-	"The emergence of fluconazole-resistant Candida (FRC) is worrisome, but little is"
		known about susceptibility patterns in different nosocomial settings. We
		prospectively analysed Candida bloodstream isolates in 18 medical centres in
		Israel (six tertiary-care and 12 community hospitals). The study included 444
		"episodes of candidaemia (450 patient-specific isolates, 8.5%"
		fluconazole-resistant). Institutional FRC bloodstream infection rates correlated
		"with annual inpatient days, and were strongly associated with the presence and"
		activity of haematology/oncology services. Infection with Candida krusei and
		fluconazole-resistant Candida glabrata occurred exclusively in hospitals with
		>600 beds. These findings suggest that empirical antifungal strategies should be
		tailored to the nosocomial setting.

		"Department, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital. Antifungal susceptibility"
		testing was performed using a commercial agar diffusion test. RESULTS: Of the
		"1,070 cases of VVC reported in this study, 36.5% were uncomplicated VVC, and"
		63.5% were complicated VVC. Twenty-four patients were identified as having two
		species of Candida. Candid albicans alone was isolated from 89.5% of cases (n =
		"958). Candida glabrata was isolated from 85 cases (7.9%), Candida tropicalis from"
		"10 (0.9%), Saccharomyces cerevisiae from eight (0.7%), Candida parapsilosis from"
		"six (0.6%), Candida famata from two (0.2%), and Candida krusei from one case"
		(0.1%). All isolates of Candida albicans were susceptible to nystatin. The
		resistant rate of Candida albicans to azole agents was 0-4.9%. CONCLUSION:
		Candida albicans was the predominant Candida species isolated from this series of
		patients with VVC. Resistance of vaginal Candida albicans isolates to antifungal
		agents was infrequent.

TI	-	The epidemiology of non-albicans Candida in oropharyngeal candidiasis in HIV
		patients.
PG	-	178-81
AB	-	Oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) is the most common fungal infection in patients
		with HIV infection. Fluconazole has been proven to be very effective in treating
		"this infection, but decreased susceptibility of Candida to this drug has emerged."
		Certain non-albicans species such as C. glabrata and C. krusei are commonly less
		susceptible to fluconazole than C. albicans and are being isolated with increased
		frequency in HIV patients. The purpose of this study was to determine if the
		presence of non-albicans Candida with OPC in HIV patients had an impact on
		clinical presentation. This study shows that late-stage HIV patients have a high
		"prevalence of Candida with decreased susceptibility to fluconazole, especially"
		non-albicans species. OPC episodes with non-albicans isolates were more likely to
		"require higher doses of fluconazole to achieve clinical cure. Also, the presence"
		of non-albicans Candida was more frequently associated with severe symptoms.

		burn wounds. Ten patients (7.6%) were infected with Candida species. All patients
		with yeast infections were also infected with bacteria with the exception of one
		patient who was infected with Candida tropicalis alone. The predominant yeast
		recovered was Candida krusei. Yeast infection was found to be more common in the
		younger age group. The isolation of a Candida species alone from one patient and

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Candidiasis is usually a superficial infection of the moist areas
		of the body and is generally caused by Candida albicans. Visceral infections
		"occur in diabetes, lymphomas and leukemias, malnutrition, avitaminosis and they"
		"are associated with antibiotic, corticosteroid and immunosuppressive therapy."
		Candida albicans was isolated from middle ear inflammation. The diagnosis is made
		on the basis of microscopic appearance of colonies and characteristic smell.
		"Candidiasis is successfully treated with nystatin, imidazol derivatives"
		"(fluconazole, ketoconazole and intraconazole), amphotericin B, 5-fluorocystosine"
		and 1% iodine solution. CASE DESCRIPTION: This is a case report of a 46-year-old
		"patient with a persistent nasal, sinus and ear infection of unknown origin. The"
		patient first received antibiotic and steroid therapy and trepanation of the
		right maxillary sinus was performed. As the patient's condition aggravated with
		"increase of temperature and bad laboratory findings, he was hospitalized."
		Radiography revealed a pathological process in both maxillary sinuses and both
		"mastoids, so mastoidectomy and left maxillary sinus trepanation were performed."
		Histopathological examination of the right mastoid revealed a mould infection.
		The immunologic status pointed to hypogammaglobulinemia IgG. The following
		"diseases were excluded: systemic diseases, blood diseases, Reiter's syndrome,"
		"AIDS, Hepatitis B, other viral diseases, toxoplasmosis, trichinellosis,"
		"borreliosis, typhus, paratyphus and exanthematous typhus. The diagnosis of"
		candidiasis caused by Candida crusei and Candida kefyr was made on the basis of
		macroscopic and microscopic findings and biochemical identification. Ketoconazole
		was introduced (400 mg/per day) as well as high doses of vitamins and
		povidone-iodine locally. After a period of remission the patient died due to
		"myocarditis, sepsis, acute kidney failure associated with severe mucosal necrosis"
		"of the mouth, esophagus and throat. Differential diagnosis in fever of unknown"
		"origin must include the possibility of mycotic infection, whereas the therapy of"
		mycotic diseases must include two antimycotics at the same time. DISCUSSION AND
		CONCLUSION: Candida albicans is often found in the oral cavity and skin as well
		as in intestines of 18% of healthy subjects. It is unknown why it causes clinical
		illness. Antibiotic therapy of bacterial infections enables candida colonization
		especially in immunosuppressed patients. In our patient two types were found:
		Candida krusei and Candida kefyr. It is of special importance to perform
		differential diagnosis in cases with fever of unknown origin in order to include
		"the possibility of mycotic infections, whereas treatment of systemic fungal"
		infections requires a team of physicians.

AB	-	"The demographic, clinical and microbiological data of patients with candidemia at"
		"the ""Hopital Universitario La Fe"", a tertiary-care hospital in Valencia, Spain,"
		from 1995 to 1997 was analyzed retrospectively. Candida spp. were isolated in
		"blood cultures from 145 patients, 32% of whom were children (25% of these were"
		"neonates). The most common species isolated was Candida albicans, followed by"
		"Candida parapsilosis, Candida krusei and Candida tropicalis. Risk factors for"
		"candidemia included underlying disease, therapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics"
		and the presence of a central venous catheter. The majority of children were
		"treated with amphotericin B, whereas 52% of adults received fluconazole. Overall"
		"mortality was 44% (30% in children and 50% in adults), and attributable mortality"
		was 30% (24% in children and 33% in adults). Multivariate analysis indicated that
		"neutropenia, corticosteroid therapy, lack of antifungal treatment, and failure to"
		replace the central venous catheter were factors associated with
		"candidemia-related death. Among the adult population, an APACHE II score greater"
		than 15 predicted candidemia-related death.

AB	-	"OBJECTIVE: A one-year prospective, observational study was conducted in the west"
		"of France, to evaluate the epidemiology of candidemia. METHOD: During the year"
		"2004, each patient with at least one blood culture yielding Candida sp. was"
		"included. For each episode of candidemia, mycological, demographical, clinical,"
		"and therapeutic data, as well as outcome, were collected. RESULTS: One hundred"
		"and ninety-three strains of Candida sp. were isolated in 186 patients, Candida"
		"albicans accounting for 54.9%, Candida glabrata for 18.7%, Candida parapsilosis"
		"for 12.9%, Candida tropicalis for 4.7% and Candida krusei for 4.1% of these"
		isolates. A percentage of 84% of the Candida isolates were fully susceptible to
		fluconazole in vitro. Dose-dependent susceptibility or resistance to fluconazole
		"was detected in more than one third of the Candida glabrata strains, of which 36%"
		"were also resistant to voriconazole. Two-thirds of the patients were males, and"
		the mean age was 61.5 years. A percentage of 37% of patients were hospitalized in
		intensive care units. The main predisposing factors for candidemia were
		"broad-spectrum antibiotics (75.8%), central venous catheter (72.6%), cancer or"
		"hematologic malignancy (47.3%), recent surgery (42.5%), total parenteral"
		nutrition (37.6%). One hundred and fifty-four patients were treated with
		"antifungal therapy, two-thirds of whom received fluconazole as first-line agent."
		"Mortality was 49% overall, and was significantly higher in case of septic shock,"
		"advanced age, and absence of catheter removal."

TI	-	[Evaluation of risk factors in patients with candiduria].
PG	-	318-24
AB	-	"Urinary system infections are usually bacterial, however, fungal etiology,"
		particularly Candida spp. are encountered in about 10% of these infections.
		C.albicans is still the most frequently isolated species in candiduria. This
		study was aimed to identify the risk factors of candiduria and to determine
		species distribution of Candida which cause candiduria in hospitalized patients.
		"The study was carried out in a total of 93 hospitalized patients (68 female, 25"
		"male; age range: 17-84 yrs, mean age: 59.5 ± 1.7 yrs) of which 50 presented with"
		"candiduria (case group) and 43 with bacteriuria (control group), between January"
		2009 to December 2009. The most frequently isolated species was C.albicans (n=
		"32; 64%), followed by C.glabrata (n= 13; 26%), C.tropicalis (n= 4; 8%) and"
		"C.krusei (n= 1; 2%). All of the isolates except one, were found susceptible to"
		"fluconazole and voriconazole by E-test (AB Biodisk, Sweden), however, C.krusei"
		isolate was resistant to fluconazole and susceptible to voriconazole. The mean
		hospitalization period and the period of stay in intensive care unit (ICU) of the
		"case group (9.56 ± 9.09 and 4.12 ± 7.05 days, respectively) were found"
		"statistically significant compared to control group (4.42 ± 3.71 and 0.53 ± 1.78,"
		respectively) (p< 0.005). Nosocomial origin of infection was higher in control
		"group (n= 45, 90%) than the case group (n= 30, 69.8%), (p= 0.014). The rate of"
		antibiotic use prior to candiduria in the case group was detected significantly
		higher (n= 43; 86%) than the controls (n= 14; 32.6%) (p= 0.000). The most
		frequently used antibiotic prior to candiduria/bacteriuria was the quinolone
		"group of agents both in case and control groups (42% and 21%, respectively). The"
		other risk factors for candiduria found to be higher in the case group than the
		"controls were as follows; presence of urinary system intervention (32% and 0,"
		"respectively; p= 0.000), catheter use (76% and 46.5%, respectively; p= 0.003) and"
		"immunosuppression history (24% and 9.3%, respectively; p= 0.041). However, there"
		was no significant relationship between candiduria and history of surgical
		"intervention, diabetes mellitus and renal failure (p> 0.05). In conclusion, rate"
		"of candiduria might be reduced by judicious antibiotic use, by implementation of"
		"guidelines for urinary catheter use, care and maintenance, and shortening the"
		duration of ICU and hospital stay.

TI	-	Endophthalmitis in patients with disseminated fungal disease.
PG	-	67-70; discussion 70-1
AB	-	BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Fungal endophthalmitis caused by dissemination from
		extraocular fungal infections has been reported to vary between 9% and 45%.
		"However, recent clinical experience disagrees with that. This study is an"
		"investigation of patients in an inner city teaching hospital, the risks"
		"associated with endogenous fungal endophthalmitis, and this incidence. METHODS:"
		All ophthalmology consultations between February 1995 and August 2000 that might
		be associated with disseminated fungal infection were examined in a prospective
		manner. Patients were excluded if there was no evidence of a positive fungal
		culture from any site at any time. Visual symptoms were recorded along with
		"ophthalmologic and systemic examination features. Information was gathered,"
		"including the identity of cultured organisms, the sites from which the organisms"
		"were obtained, and the patients' disposition. RESULTS: During this interval, 170"
		"consultation requests contained the words ""endophthalmitis"" or ""retinitis"" and/or"
		indicated concern about disseminated fungal infections. Extraocular fungal
		"infections were found in 114 patients, but only 82 of them had evidence of"
		systemic dissemination. Some patients had more than one organism. The following
		"are listed in decreasing frequency of occurrence: Candida albicans, Torulopsis"
		"glabrata, Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis, Candida krusei, Aspergillus"
		"niger, and others. Only two patients had evidence of chorioretinitis and"
		progressed to fungal endophthalmitis. CONCLUSIONS: Endophthalmitis was rare among
		these patients with known fungal infections. Less than 2% had any related
		"ophthalmic manifestations. Nevertheless, since treatment can save vision,"
		evidence of intraocular infection should be sought as eagerly as before.

TI	-	[Infections by Candida sp. in intensive care. Survey of French practices].
PG	-	440-9
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: The isolation of Candida sp in nosocomial infections is on the
		"increase and over the past 10 years many guidelines for ""good"" practices and"
		recommendations have been published on the modalities for the management of
		systemic candidiasis. The aim of this paper was to assess the habits in the
		intensive care units in this domain in France. METHOD: A transversal survey on
		"the habits was conducted from March to May 2001, using a questionnaire mailed to"
		200 intensive care units. RESULTS: One hundred eighty questionnaires (surgical
		"reanimation: 12%, medical: 18%, medico-surgical: 70%) out of 200 (92.5%) were"
		"returned. The indirect diagnostic examinations: serology, search for antigenemia"
		"and PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) were never used in 21, 35 and 65% of cases."
		The systematic search for colonisation (a mean of 4 areas sampled) was conducted
		"in all the patients by 19% of the investigators, in some patients by 53%, and"
		never by 28%. An antifungal treatment was prescribed: in the presence of a
		"positive haemoculture alone, once out of twice if the sample had been taken from"
		a central catheter and in 2 cases out of 3 when the sample was peripheral. It was
		prescribed 6 times out of 10 after isolation of Candida sp following surgery or
		"on needle aspiration of an intra-abdominal abscess, varyingly in the case of"
		"cadiduria, isolation of a Candida sp in a broncho-pulmonary sample or in"
		"abdominal draining and positive culture of a catheter, depending on the intensity"
		"of the colonisation, the severity of the clinical picture and the presence of"
		factors of risk for Candida infection. It is still prescribed empirically

AB	-	The aim of this study was to evaluate the distributions of yeast species
		according to the years and to detect the emerging pathogens in intensive care
		"units (ICU). For this purpose, yeast isolation rates were detected"
		"retrospectively, in the following time periods: Period I: April-December 2001;"
		period II: January-December 2002; period III: January-December 2003; period IV:
		January-December 2004. A total of 490 yeast isolates recovered from 462 clinical
		specimens obtained from 360 different ICU patients were investigated during these
		"periods. Urine (62.1%), blood (13.6%) and tracheal aspirate (8.7%) samples were"
		"detected as the most common specimens. Of these isolates, 53.3% were identified"
		"as Candida albicans, 14.5% as C. tropicalis, 12.2% as C. glabrata, 6.5% as C."
		"parapsilosis, 4.5% as Trichosporon spp., 3.9% as C. kefyr, 1.6% as C. krusei,"
		1.4% as Geotrichum candidum and 2.1% as other Candida species. The isolation
		"rates of C. albicans in the periods of I to IV were found as 47.7%, 55.5%, 41.7%"
		"and 62.4%, respectively. The decrease between the second and third periods, and"
		increase between third and fourth periods were statistically significant (chi2 =
		"4.15, p = 0.04 and chi2 = 8.32, p = 0.004). C. glabrata was the second most"
		"common species in the first and second periods (14.8% and 15.5%, respectively),"
		"followed by C. tropicalis (12.5% and 10.0%, respectively), however this array has"
		changed in the third and fourth periods (C. tropicalis was the second with the
		"rates of 16.7% and 16.8%, while C. glabrata placed in the third line with the"
		"rates of 14.8% and 7.6%, respectively). It was concluded that C. albicans has"
		still been the most frequent species among yeast isolates of ICU's in our
		"hospital; however, the incidence of non-albicans species like C. glabrata and C."
		tropicalis has increased.

PG	-	107-12
AB	-	The importance of epidemiological monitoring of yeasts involved in pathologic
		processes is unquestionable due to the increase of these infections over the last
		"decade, the changes observed in species causing candidiasis, and empirical"
		"antifungal treatment. At the Mycology Center, 1006 isolates from a wide range of"
		clinical samples were studied during 1999-2001. Candida albicans (40.3%) was the
		"most isolated species, although, the Candida no albicans species with 54.9%"
		"showed the major prevalence. In blood cultures Candida parapsilosis (34.9%), C."
		albicans (30.2%) and C. tropicalis (25.6%) were recovered most frequently while
		C. glabrata represented only 2.3%. C. albicans with 60%-80% was the predominant
		"specie in mucosal surface. We also detected Candida mediastinistis, which alert"
		us over the importance at this location. Urinary tract infections caused by
		"yeasts were more frequent in hospitalized patients, being C. albicans (47.7%),"
		"the most commonly isolated, followed by C. glabrata (24.8%) and C. tropicalis"
		"(20.0%). In the candidal onychomycoses, C. parapsilosis (37.7%) outplaced C."
		albicans (22.0%). Fluconazole susceptibility studies of Candida species allowed
		"us to conclude that the majority of C. albicans islolates are susceptible, and"
		that the highest resistance averages were observed in C. glabrata (21.41%) and C.
		krusei (69.23%).

TI	-	Cross-sectional study of the susceptibility of Candida isolates to antifungal
		drugs and in vitro-in vivo correlation in HIV-infected patients.
PG	-	945-50
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To investigate (1) the frequency of clinical resistance to oral
		"polyenes or azole treatment for oral candidiasis, (2) the frequency of resistant"
		"in vitro Candida strains, (3) the relationship between the susceptibilities of in"
		vitro Candida species and in vivo status in HIV patients. DESIGN: Prospective
		"cross-sectional study. SETTING: Tertiary care clinic at Bocage Hospital, Dijon,"
		France. PATIENTS: HIV-infected patients with and without oral candidiasis.
		"INTERVENTIONS: Clinical examination, oral swab for mycologic investigations. MAIN"
		"OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical diagnosis of oral candidiasis, identification of the"
		"antifungal treatment given within the previous month, identification of Candida"
		"species, antimycogramm and determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration"
		"(MIC) for fluconazole, and measurement of T-helper cell count. RESULTS: Within a"
		"2-month period, 154 HIV-infected patients were studied: 46 heterosexuals, 51"
		"intravenous drug users (IVDU), 52 homosexuals and five blood transfusion"
		"recipients. The percentages of patients with oral candidiasis were: 41, 80, 44"
		"and 20%, respectively (P < 0.05); the mean T-helper cell counts were 200, 135,"
		"210 and 238 x 10(6)/l cells, respectively (P < 0.05). Twenty-two patients (14.3%)"
		had received recent azole treatment and 29 (18.8%) recent oral polyene treatment.
		"Among the 84 patients with and the 70 patients without oral candidiasis, 78 and"
		"28 Candida strains were isolated, respectively. Although Candida albicans"
		"represented the majority of Candida species (88 strains, 83%), the non-albicans"
		strains were isolated more frequently in patients who had received recent
		"antifungal treatment. No strains were resistant to ketoconazole, miconazole or"
		"econazole; however, six (5.6%), 16 (15%) and 10 (9.5%) were intermediately"
		"susceptible to the three drugs, respectively. Twelve (13.6%) of the 88 C."
		"albicans, five of the six C. (Torulopsis) glabrata, one of the five C. tropicalis"
		and all three C. krusei strains were resistant to fluconazole. These resistant
		strains were separated as follows: 41.1% of C. albicans strains resistant to
		"fluconazole were isolated from patients who had received recent azole therapy,"
		"17.6% from patients who received recent oral polyene, and 3.7% from patients who"
		had not received any recent antifungal treatment (P = 0.004). The mean MIC of
		"these three categories of isolates were 3.6, 1.6 and 0.6 mg/l, respectively (P ="
		0.06). CONCLUSIONS: Oral candidiasis and fluconazole-resistant Candida isolates
		are more frequently found in IVDU. Treatments using azoles select non-albicans
		strains and are associated with decreased susceptibilities of C. albicans strains
		to fluconazole in particular. These findings show that prolonged azole treatment
		in severely immunocompromised patients should be avoided.

AB	-	A 71year old female Caucasian farmer without any known immunosuppression
		presented with a painful ulcer of her right lower leg after a trauma caused by a
		wood billet. There was no response to empirical antibacterial treatment. An ulcer
		biopsy showed an invasive Candida infection of the soft tissue and
		leucocytoclastic vasculitis. Voriconazole treatment was followed by wound
		healing. Invasive Candida infection and localized Candida vasculitis represent a
		rare cause of persisting leg ulcers. The similar clinical picture of chronic
		venous leg ulcers might blur the true cause and refractory cases should therefore
		promptly be processed by histopathological diagnostics.

		intraspecific features].
PG	-	373-9
AB	-	The aim of this study was to detect fungi in three ontocenoses of 947 women (aged
		20-45). The prevalence of multifocal fungal infections in women varied from 62.2
		+/- 2.99% to 81.0 +/- 3.92% in different ontocenoses. They assumed the following
		"mean values: 38.4 +/- 1.77% for the vagina, 42.2 +/- 1.80% for the oral cavity,"
		and 25.0 +/- 1.58% for the anus. The clinical manifestations of sexual organs
		inflammations were statistically significantly (p < 0.01) more frequent in women
		infected with fungi than in those without fungi in the vaginal ontocenosis. The
		highest convergence of the fungi presence with subjective and objective symptoms
		(assessed using the Yule Q index value) concerned: pruritus of the vulva or/and
		"vaginal walls, burning sensation or painful urethra, as well as oedema of the"
		"external opening of the urethra, vulva or/and the vagina (Q from +0.808 to"
		"+0.970). However, there was no statistically significant convergence between"
		occurrence of the fungi and vaginal discharge and painful hypogastrium. Based on
		"more than 40 phenotypical features (morphological, biochemical) of the axenic"
		"strains originating from vaginal, oral, and anal ontocenoses, a total of 12"
		"species of fungi were identified: Candida albicans, C. guilliermondii, C. krusei,"
		"C. tropicalis, C. kefyr, C. utilis, C. humicola, C. viswanathii, C. glabrata, C."
		"parapsilosis, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, and Geotrichum candidum. For"
		"intraspecific features, depending on the profile of the compounds used for"
		"auxanogram, 9 codes were read for Candida albicans and only one code for each of"
		other species was detected. In API ZYM test based on assessment of 19 hydrolase
		activities the enzymograms of species included from 6 to 11 enzymes.

TI	-	Successfully treated Candida krusei infection of the lumbar spine with combined
		caspofungin/posaconazole therapy.
PG	-	79-83
AB	-	Candidal vertebral osteomyelitis represents an extremely rare invasive mycosis
		and can be difficult to treat due to poor drug penetration into bony tissue. We
		report on a case of vertebral osteomyelitis caused by Candida krusei in a patient
		who had neutropenia as a result of chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukaemia.
		The patient received prophylactic liposomal amphotericin B during chemotherapy
		but became febrile and experienced severe lumbar pain. Magnetic resonance imaging
		revealed vertebral osteochondrosis. C. krusei was recovered from blood cultures
		and voriconazole monotherapy was initiated but proved unsuccessful. The patient
		"was then started on caspofungin monotherapy, which was discontinued after Candida"
		"krusei was no longer recoverable from blood cultures. However, as lumbar pain"
		"increased and spinal biopsy confirmed the presence of Candida krusei, caspofungin"
		therapy was resumed. Oral posaconazole was added to the regimen when the patient
		did not improve after 30 days of caspofungin therapy. Combined antimycotic
		therapy resulted in a successful outcome.

TI	-	Changes in the spectrum of fungal isolates: results from clinical specimens
		gathered in 1987/88 compared with those in 1991/92 in the University Hospital
		"Göttingen, Germany."
PG	-	247-53
AB	-	"In the University Hospital in Göttingen, the spectra of fungal species in"
		"clinical specimens of respiratory secretions, bronchial secretions and urine were"
		compared over periods of 15 months (10/87 to 12/88 and 1/91 to 3/92) before and
		after the introduction of fluconazole. The following changes could be
		demonstrated: 1. In all specimens analysed the number of Candida albicans
		"isolates decreased, while the number of Candida tropicalis isolates remained"
		almost unchanged. 2. During the observation period the number of Candida glabrata
		isolates doubled. In 1991 C. glabrata was second to C. albicans as the most
		"common of all fungal isolates, appearing in 8.6% of all specimens. 3. The total"
		"number of Candida krusei isolates increased only slightly, but the rise in the"
		number of isolates in bronchial secretions was statistically significant. 4. The
		"prevalence of rarely isolated Candida yeasts, such as Candida guilliermondii,"
		"Candida lipolytica and Candida kefyr, and Candida isolates which were not further"
		differentiated increased. 5. During the observation period the number of mixed
		cultures showed a fourfold increase. C. glabrata and C. krusei were associated in
		more than 75% of all isolates with C. albicans or C. tropicalis respectively. 6.
		The number of mould isolates increased. These changes in the spectra of fungal
		isolates are discussed with respect to the broad therapeutic and prophylactic
		usage of fluconazole in the University Hospital of Göttingen.

TI	-	Isolation of Exophiala dermatitidis from endotracheal aspirate of a cancer
		patient.
PG	-	504-9
AB	-	Exophiala (Wangiella) dermatitidis is a melanised (darkly pigmented) yeast-like
		organism that has been reported from the environment and wild animals. The
		organism is a frequent coloniser of lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis and
		causes occasional disseminated phaeohyphomycosis and fungaemia. Exophiala
		"dermatitidis is distributed worldwide, but cerebral cases are restricted to East"
		Asia. We report a case of 54-year-old Qatari female patient with a known history
		"of cancer, suffering from pulmonary disorder. Culture of endotracheal aspirate"
		revealed the growth of E. dermatitidis concomitant with Candida krusei. The final
		diagnosis of E. dermatitidis and attribution to genotype B was achieved by
		sequencing the rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. The present case
		"concerns a pulmonary colonisation by E. dermatitidis, similar to that commonly"
		seen in cystic fibrosis patients. For the detection of E. dermatitidis in
		clinical specimens culturing techniques are required. The patient finally expired
		with persistent cancer and C. krusei fungaemia. Review of literature and listing
		of E. dermatitidis cases published after 1992 show a sharp increase in clinical
		cases during the 1990s.

TI	-	"Triazole cross-resistance among Candida spp.: case report, occurrence among"
		"bloodstream isolates, and implications for antifungal therapy."
PG	-	529-35
AB	-	Candida spp. are common causes of bloodstream infections among hospitalized
		patients. Fluconazole (FLC) remains a first-line therapy for candidemia; and
		"voriconazole (VRC), an expanded-spectrum triazole, was recently approved for the"
		treatment of candidemia in nonneutropenic patients. In vitro studies have
		suggested that VRC has potent activity against Candida spp. with reduced
		susceptibilities to FLC. We present a case report of invasive candidiasis and
		candidemia due to a Candida glabrata isolate that developed resistance to all
		currently available triazole antifungals after a course of FLC treatment. This
		case prompted us to determine the frequency of cross-resistance among bloodstream
		"Candida isolates collected during a recent 12-month period at a large, academic"
		medical center. FLC MICs were determined for 125 of 153 isolates (81.7%). Thirty
		of 125 isolates (24%) were resistant or showed reduced susceptibilites to FLC
		(MICs >/= 16 microg/ml). When 28 of these 30 isolates were tested for their VRC
		"susceptibilities, 9 (32%) had MICs that were >/=2 microg/ml. Five of these nine"
		"isolates were C. glabrata, two isolates were Candida tropicalis, one isolate was"
		"Candida albicans, and one isolate was Candida parapsilosis. All five Candida"
		krusei isolates tested had VRC MICs </=0.5 microg/ml. These data have prompted
		the introduction of reflexive FLC susceptibility testing of first bloodstream
		Candida isolates at our institution. The case report and our data also suggest
		that VRC should be avoided as initial therapy in unstable patients with invasive
		"candidiasis, particularly in the setting of prior azole exposure. Studies are"
		needed to define the clinical significance of in vitro resistance to the newer
		antifungal agents.

PG	-	542-5
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the risk factors associated with breakthrough candidemia
		in patients with cancer and to compare them with those of de novo candidemia in
		this patient population. DESIGN: Retrospective case series of 120 episodes of
		"candidemia, 90 de novo and 30 breakthrough candidemias. SETTING:"
		"University-affiliated, tertiary-care cancer center in Houston, Texas. PATIENTS:"
		All patients with cancer who acquired candidemia between January 1993 and
		December 1998 were included if they had non-catheter-related candidemia and
		"information about quantitative blood cultures. RESULTS: Although less frequent,"
		breakthrough candidemia was seen more often in neutropenic patients with
		leukemia. The intensity of breakthrough candidemia was comparable to that of de
		novo candidemia. Most (70%) of the breakthrough candidemias were due to Candida
		"glabrata or C. krusei. CONCLUSIONS: In breakthrough candidemia, the same risk"
		"factors seen in de novo candidemia were encountered, although more frequently. C."
		glabrata and C. krusei are the leading causes of breakthrough candidemia in
		patients with cancer.

PG	-	79-84
AB	-	"Otomycosis, which is otitis externa caused by fungi, is common throughout the"
		"world especially in tropical and subtropical countries. However, the"
		epidemiologic data about the etiologic agents of otomycosis in Turkey is limited.
		The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the agents of otomycosis in
		patients living at Manisa region (located at western Anatolia of Turkey). A total
		"of 2279 cases [1465 male, 813 female; age range 1-87 (mean: 41.7) years] who were"
		"clinically prediagnosed as otomycosis at Celal Bayar University Hospital, between"
		"February 1995 and July 2011, were included in the study. External ear swab"
		samples from patients with suspicion of otomycosis have been evaluated by routine
		mycological methods. Identification of mold-like fungi was based on colony
		"morphology and microscopic examination of fungal structure, whereas germ tube"
		"test, growth characteristics on cornmeal-Tween 80 agar and API 20C AUX"
		"(bio-Mérieux, France) system were used for the identification of yeast-like"
		"fungi. Of the samples, 28% (638/2279) were found positive by direct microscopy"
		and 24% (544/2279) by culture methods. Among culture-positive cases the isolation
		"rates of mold-like and yeast-like fungi were 66% (359/544) and 34% (185/544),"
		respectively. The number of distribution of the molds were as follows;
		"Aspergillus niger (180), Aspergillus fumigatus (95), Aspergillus terreus (32),"
		"Aspergillus flavus (23), Aspergillus spp. (14), Penicillium spp. (13),"
		"Trichophyton spp. (T.rubrum 1, T.mentagrophytes 1); while this distribution was"
		"as follows for the yeasts; Candida tropicalis (97), Candida albicans (39),"
		"Candida parapsilosis (21), Candida glabrata (19), Candida kefyr (4),"
		"C.guilliermondii (2), Candida krusei (1), Geotrichum candidum (1) and"
		Trichosporon capitatum (1). It was notable that 96% (344/359) of mold-like fungi
		"were Aspergillus spp., and 99% (183/185) of yeast-like fungi were Candida spp."
		The results of this study indicated that the most frequent agents of otomycosis
		"were non-dermatophyte species such as Aspergillus, followed by Candida."
		Dermatophytes were isolated in a small number of otomycosis cases. These data
		will provide support to the establishment of antifungal therapy guidelines for
		otomycosis.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: Analysis of the prevalence and species representation of pathogenic
		yeasts in patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis. Determination of in vitro
		susceptibility of yeast isolates to clinically used antimycotic agents. DESIGN: A
		retrospective clinical study of patients with positive vaginal cultures for the
		presence of pathogenic yeast species. SETTING: I. gynekologicko-pôrodnícka
		"klinika LF UK a FN, Zochova 7,811 03 Bratislava, Slovenská republika. METHODS:"
		Identification of yeast pathogens on the chromogenic medium CHROMagar CANDIDA and
		with API-CANDIDA identification system. In vitro susceptibility assays of
		"clinical yeast isolates to antifungal agents using the plate dilution method,"
		NCCLS method and ATB-FUNGUS test system. RESULTS: The highest prevalence of
		vulvovaginal candidasis was found in women aged between 20-30 years. Candida
		albicans was the most commonly identified species of pathogenic yeasts (87.4%).
		"Of the non-albicans species, C. glabrata (6.3%) was the most prevalent species."
		C. glabrata and C. krusei clinical isolates were found to be generally less
		susceptible to several antifungals in vitro as compared to C. albicans strains. A
		"minimal number of resistant yeast isolates was observed for econazole,"
		clotrimazole and nystatin. A relatively high number of resistant strains was
		"observed for some other azole antifungals (miconazole, ketoconazole,"
		"itraconazole, fluconazole). CONCLUSION: A successful treatment of vaginal mycotic"
		infections requires the results of the microbiological analyses. They will bring
		"evidence to a physician of the presence and fate of the pathogen, of its"
		"sensitivity to antifungals, both of which are essential for the rational and"
		successful therapy of Candida vaginitis.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Normothermic and hypothermic oxygenated perfusion for donation after
		"circulatory death in kidney transplantation are becoming popular in Italy, with"
		the purpose of reducing the risk of primary non function and delayed graft
		function due to the prolonged warm ischemia time. Potential complications related
		to these procedures are currently under investigation and are continuously
		emerging with the increasing experience. Post-operative infections - in
		particular graft arteritis - are a rare complication but determine high risk of
		mortality and of graft loss. The acute onset of the arterial complications makes
		"it very difficult to find an effective treatment, and early diagnosis is crucial"
		for saving both patient and graft. Prevention of such infections in this
		particular setting are advisable. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a patient with an
		acute arterial rupture after transplantation of a DCD graft treated in-vivo
		hypothermic oxygenated perfusion. The cause was a severe arteritis of the renal
		artery caused by Candida krusei and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We discussed our
		treatment and we compared it to the other reported series. CONCLUSION: Fungal
		infections in DCD transplant may be treacherous and strategies to prevent them
		should be advocated.

TI	-	Candidemia and the susceptibility pattern of Candida isolates in blood.
PG	-	1060-3
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: Candida species has become one of the most common blood isolates as
		well as one of the leading causes of nosocomial bloodstream infections. The
		purpose of our study was to determine the prevalence of Candida species among our
		bloodstream infecting organisms and the susceptibility pattern of the Candida
		isolates to antifungal agents. METHODS: A prospective study was carried out in
		"the Division of Microbiology, King Khalid National Guard Hospital, Jeddah,"
		Kingdom of Saudi Arabia of all positive blood cultures for Candida species. The
		study took place from 1st January 1998 to March 2002. Identification and
		susceptibility pattern of isolates were determined by the Candifast technique to
		"amphotericin B, fluconazole, nystatin, Flucytosine, econazole, ketoconazole and"
		"miconazole. RESULTS: Over a 2-year period, 17,916 blood cultures were performed"
		"in our hospital. There were 2,972 positive cultures, of which 83 (2.8%) patients"
		"had Candida species isolated from their bloodstream. Of these, 38 (46%) were"
		Candida albicans (C.albicans). The remaining 45 strains were made up of Candida
		tropicalis 9 (10.8%); Candida parapsilosis 9 (10.8%); Candida species 9 (10.8%);
		Candida guilliermondi 6 (7.2%); Candida krusei 5 (6%); Candida glabrata 4 (4.8%);
		Candida pseudotropicalis 2 (2.4%) and Trichosporon species 1 (1.2%). All Candida
		"species were susceptible to amphotericin B. However, only 18 (47%) out of 38"
		"C.albicans were susceptible to fluconazole, while only 8 (17.7%) of 45"
		non-C.albicans strains were susceptible to this drug. CONCLUSION: The
		susceptibility of C.albicans to fluconazole in our hospital using the Candifast
		method is very low (47%). These results need to be confirmed by carrying out the
		Etest or the NCCLS M27-A method to confirm the true susceptibilities of Candida
		strains in our locality.

PG	-	523-7
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To make an analysis of fungemia in HIV-infected patients in our
		hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively (1989-1997) studied all
		"HIV-infected patients with positive blood cultures for Candida sp., Cryptococcus"
		neoformans or any other fungal infection. RESULTS: C. neoformans was isolated in
		11 patients (10 men and 1 woman): Six were treated with amphotericin B and 5 with
		fluconazole. 2 patients died during the acute phase and the infection relapsed in
		3. Blood culture for Candida sp. were positive in 9 (8 men and 1 woman): only a
		case was nosocomial. Seven patients were intravenous drug users and the
		"presenting manifestations were autolimited candidemia in 3, aortic and tricuspid"
		endocarditis in 1 and 2 cases respectively and pneumonia in another one. Six C.
		"albicans, 2 C. krusei and 1 C. glabrata were isolated. 3 patients received"
		amphotericin B and 3 received fluconazole. 2 patients suffering from endocarditis
		"died and so did the patient with C. glabrata infection. A patient, who denied"
		"having travelled to endemic areas, developed histoplasmosis; blood culture was"
		positive for H. capsulatum. He initially had a good response to amphotericin B
		and itraconazole. CONCLUSIONS: Fungemia is not frequent in HIV-infected patients.
		Cryptococcosis and histoplasmosis occur in advanced HIV-patients and candidemia
		is fundamentally associated with intravenous drug use.

PG	-	278-80
AB	-	The fungal isolates (n = 191) from 1970 consecutive blood cultures over a 9-year
		period were identified. Candida tropicalis was the predominant isolate accounting
		for 66% of all isolates whereas Candida albicans ranked only a distant second
		with 21%. The difference was highly significant (P < 0.00001) The other isolates
		"included C. parapsilosis (5.8%), C. glabrata (2.1%), C. pelliculosa (1.2%), C."
		lipolytica (1.0%) C. krusei (1.0%) and Trichosporon beigelii (2.6%). The isolates
		were obtained predominantly from postoperative patients on therapy with more than

PG	-	70-2
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: The efficiency of a novel differential culture medium, CHROM-agar"
		"Candida, is evaluated in order to differentiation and presumptive identification"
		"of clinically important yeasts. METHODS: We studied 600 clinical yeast strains,"
		"pertaining to 8 genera (Candida, Cryptococcus, Geotrichum, Rhodotorula,"
		"Trichosporon, Kluyveromyces, Pichia and Saccharomyces) and 27 species. Strains"
		were previously identified by conventional methods and by commercial system ATB
		"ID32C (Bio-Mérieux). RESULTS: Four species (C. albicans, C. krusei, C. tropicalis"
		"and t. beigelii) were presumptive recognized after 48-72 hours of incubation,"
		regarding their colonial morphology and color. Colony color of other species
		showed low specificity. CONCLUSION: CHROM-agar Candida medium is recommended for
		recognition of mixed yeast cultures and differentiation of the common clinically
		yeast species.

PG	-	1195-7
AB	-	A 79-year-old male with acute myelogenous leukemia developed acute right knee
		"arthritis during admission, after the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics before"
		chemotherapy. The initial synovial fluid sample appeared to be mildly
		inflammatory with a low white cell count. The fungal septic arthritis was not
		"diagnosed until Candida tropicalis, a rare species of Candida, was isolated in"
		the synovial fluid. Although fluconazole is effective in treating the
		"microorganism, the untreated leukemia rendered the infection incurable and led to"
		the growth of fluconazole-resistant Candida krusei. We reported the unusual case
		of fungal arthritis and reviewed the literature.

AB	-	Results from a cross-sectional observational study on candidemia conducted at
		"Hospital de Clínicas, Federal University of Paraná, are presented. From January"
		"2001 to December 2004, one hundred candidemia cases were evaluated. The incidence"
		"was 1.27 episodes per 1,000 hospitalizations and Candida was the eighth most"
		frequently isolated agent from bloodstream infections. The patients ages ranged
		"from five days to 89 years, with a mean of 32 years. Sixty percent of the cases"
		occurred in adults (66% > 50 years old) and 40% in children (52% < one year old).
		Fifty-nine percent had been admitted to medical wards and 41% to the intensive
		care unit. Candida albicans was the most (59%) frequent species followed by
		Candida tropicalis (15%) and Candida parapsilosis (9%). The most (97%) prevalent
		"coexisting conditions were the use of antibacterial drugs, central venous"
		"catheter (77%), H2 blockers (57%), total parenteral nutrition (49%) and admission"
		"to the intensive care unit (41%). Out of the 51 isolates tested, three of Candida"
		glabrata presented dose-dependent susceptibility to fluconazole and resistance to
		itraconazole. One sample of Candida krusei presented dose-dependent
		susceptibility to fluconazole and one of Candida pelliculosa presented
		"dose-dependent susceptibility to itraconazole. Among the study population, 68%"
		"received antifungal therapy, but the mortality was 56%."

AB	-	Candida krusei infections are increasing in neutropenic patients. This is the
		first report of a case of C. krusei arthritis in a neutropenic leukemic patient.
		The organism colonized the patient's respiratory tract and most likely seeded the
		right knee by hematogenous spread. Knee swelling and tenderness were minimal.
		Joint fluid Gram stain and fungal smears did not show the organism despite
		"positive results on cultures. With therapy, the joint fluid converted from"
		neutrophilic predominance to lymphocytic predominance. Despite sterilization of
		"knee fluid, clinical relapse occurred after therapy with 256 mg of systemic"
		amphotericin B; the infection was cured after a total dose of 456 mg.

		were identified as Candida albicans. Only 2 strains belonged to other species of
		Candida (C. parapsilosis and C. krusei). The sensitivity of Candida spp. strains
		to chemotherapeutic was also estimated. All strains of C. albicans were sensitive
		to nystatin. Incidence of faecal strains of C. albicans in children with acute
		"diarrhoea (19,4%) and children with other disease (21,1%) was comparable"
		"(p>0,05). Candida albicans yeasts caused diarrhoea in small percent of studied"
		"children. Only in 2 (0,6%) children C. albicans as aetiological agent of"
		"diarrhoea was found. In 16 (16,3%) cases secondary fungal infections were"
		acquired during hospitalization children (4 children with fungal diarrhoea).
		Resolution of diarrhoea caused by C. albicans in 6 children after treatment with
		nystatin was observed.

TI	-	Triple antifungal therapy for severe systemic candidiasis allowed performance of
		allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
PG	-	337-40
AB	-	Systemic candidiasis is a rare but life threatening complication in
		immunosuppressed patients undergoing allogeneic SCT. Combination of new
		"antifungal agents may improve outcome in this patient population. Here, triple"
		anti-mycotic therapy is described in an relapsed ALL patient in urgent need of
		allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. The patient with T-cell acute
		lymphoblastic leukemia of thymic differentiation achieved remission after
		treatment according to the German ALL protocol 07/03. Two months after the
		consolidation therapy relapse occurred requiring high dose chemotherapy with
		allogeneic stem cell transplantation. One day after start of the conditioning
		regimen the patient showed skin manifestations typical for septic mycosis and
		blood cultures became positive for Candida krusei while on fluconazole
		prophylaxis. Because of the limited sensibility of fluconazole resistant candida
		species to liposomal amphotericin B and the high mortality rate in patients with
		"systemic candidiasis, voriconazole was added immediately to liposomal"
		amphotericin B. Since fever did not resolve and the conditioning therapy for
		allogeneic transplantation was not yet completed caspofungin was added. Skin
		manifestation responded to this triple anti-mycotic combination and peripheral
		blood stem cells from an unrelated donor were transplanted. With the triple
		"antifungal therapy the patient finally became afebrile, skin manifestations"
		showed complete resolution and blood cultures became negative. Three months after
		the onset of systemic candidiasis the patient was fully active with no signs of
		fungal infection and in haematological and molecular remission. Mycotic sepsis at
		the start of myeloablative conditioning therapy in heavily pretreated acute
		leukemia patients is usually considered as not allowing successful allogeneic
		"transplantation. Thus this case demonstrates, that allogeneic stem cell"
		transplantation is feasible in patients presenting with systemic candidiasis if
		"combined antifungal therapy with liposomal amphotericin B, caspofungin and"
		voriconazole is given.

PG	-	170-2

AB	-	The prevalence of fungal infections in newborns and small infants is on the rise
		consequent to the improved care and survival of preterm babies. Most of these
		premature infants are immunocompromised and subjected to invasive monitoring and
		therapy in neonatal intensive care units making them susceptible to nosocomial
		infections. We report a rare case of right ventricular mass secondary to candida
		krusei infection which was excised surgically. This article reemphasizes the
		importance of stringent aseptic practices in neonatal intensive care units to
		prevent nosocomial infections and the early use of echocardiography in neonates
		presenting with atypical unexplained symptoms to hasten diagnosis and facilitate
		timely intervention.

		"(CML), who was treated for 4.5 years with imatinib and developed pneumonia caused"
		"by two Candida species, i.e., C. krusei and C. glabrata. The patient was in"
		complete hematologic remission and molecular analyses did not display the

PG	-	422-5
AB	-	"Two female patients, aged 75 and 59 years, respectively, with candidal sternal"
		osteomyelitis were successfully treated by the administration of triazoles. Both
		had developed post-operative wound infection after sternotomy for coronary artery
		by-pass grafting. Sternal osteomyelitis was confirmed by bone scans with
		"technetium 99Tc and gallium 67Ga. The cultures, from the pus draining at the site"
		"of the sternotomy scar, grew Candida krusei in the first case. The fistula closed"
		"after a 9-week course of itraconazole therapy (800 mg daily, followed by 600 mg"
		daily) and the patient completed a 6-month period of therapy. The second patient
		had underlying diabetes mellitus. Post-operatively she developed two fistulae
		draining pus on the sternum. The pus cultures grew C. albicans. Initial treatment
		with oral fluconazole (400 mg daily) failed. Subsequent treatment with liposomal
		amphotericin B also failed. A dramatic improvement was noted when the patient
		received high doses of fluconazole (800 mg daily). The fistulae gradually closed
		after 1 month. Oral fluconazole was continued for 6 months. The cure was
		"confirmed by bone scans. Three years later, both patients remained well."

		"gastropleural fistula, and esophageal perforation. Case report and review of the"
		literature. A fatal case of a 45-year-old pregnant woman with Candida krusei
		empyema thoracis secondary to spontaneous esophagus perforation associated with
		candida esophagitis is reported. The case is contextualized among similar cases
		found through a PubMed search. CONCLUSIONS: A suspect of esophagus rupture should
		arise in the presence of a fungal empyema. Candida esophagitis should be always
		considered as a possible cause or con-cause of esophagus rupture. An empirical
		systemic antimycotic therapy should always be considered in an ideal
		multidisciplinary approach to the management of patients with esophagus rupture.

		infections in immunocompromised patients. We present the first case of C. krusei
		"renal cyst infection, occurring in a post-liver and kidney transplant patient"
		with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Her persistent candiduria and
		fevers were refractory to prolonged therapy with AmBisome (Fujisawa

		nephrectomies of her native kidneys. Cystic fluid was aspirated from six
		hemorrhagic and six nonhemorrhagic cysts. Cystic fluid cultures yielded C.
		krusei. Fluid from the nonhemorrhagic cysts was also analyzed for amphotericin B
		"levels, measured using a bioassay. Free amphotericin B levels in the cysts were"
		lower than the minimal inhibitory concentration for amphotericin B for this
		organism. We provide the first description of amphotericin B levels in cystic

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive fungal diseases have increased in recent years. Candida
		"species are the most common aetiology. Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis,"
		"Candida tropicalis, Candida glabrata and Candida krusei are the cause of most of"
		them. The aim of this work is to describe the first isolation of Candida fabianii
		in the blood of a non-neonatal paediatric patient. CASE REPORT: A 2 year-old male
		"with short bowel syndrome, severe malnutrition, and hypophosphataemic rickets"
		deficiency was admitted to paediatric intensive care due to a respiratory tract
		infection and suspicion of an intestinal pseudo-obstruction. He received several
		cycles of broad-spectrum antibiotics for several infections due to Pseudomonas
		aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. After the surgical correction of the intestinal
		disorder he suffered a new episode of sepsis where yeasts were isolated by
		culture. The species identification was performed by means of mass spectrometry
		"(MALDI-TOF system, Bruker Daltonic). The identity of the isolate was C.fabianii"
		(anamorph)/Pichia fabianii (teleomorph) with a score of 2.149. Antifungal
		"treatment with caspofungin was prescribed, with good progress of the patient."
		CONCLUSIONS: Molecular techniques are important for the identification of these
		"species, although mass spectrometry offered a reliable and rapid diagnosis."
		Treatment with caspofungin was effective.

TI	-	Concurrent isolation of Candida krusei and Candida tropicalis from multiple blood
		cultures in a patient with acute leukemia.
PG	-	521-3
AB	-	Reports of the concurrent isolation of more than one non-albicans species of
		Candida from blood cultures of immunocompromised patients with disseminated
		candidiasis are extremely infrequent. We report on the isolation of Candida
		krusei and Candida tropicalis from 17 blood cultures that were taken from a
		67-year-old white man with a diagnosis of acute biphenotypic leukemia during a
		2-week period of hospitalization for induction chemotherapy. Despite receiving
		"high-dose amphotericin B throughout this period, the status of the patient"
		"worsened, and he experienced pancytopenia, hypernatremia, azotemia, and"
		"disseminated intravascular coagulation, which led to his death. Candida krusei"
		"and C tropicalis were isolated concurrently from 10 of the 17 blood cultures,"
		while C krusei was the single isolate in three cultures and C tropicalis was
		isolated alone in four cultures. Each species manifested markedly different
		colonial morphological features. This case report serves to emphasize to
		microbiologists that they must exercise extreme suspicion when non-albicans
		species of Candida are isolated singly or concurrently from blood cultures in
		"neutropenic patients, given the increasing clinical significance of these yeasts."

PG	-	44-8
AB	-	The sputum specimens from 1363 patients at the age of 16 to 65 years with
		nonspecific pulmonary diseases and the pleural exudate specimens from 325
		patients were tested for fungi in 1989-1994. The etiological significance of
		Candida was stated at a concentration of > 10(5) GFU per 1 ml of the sputum. The
		identification was performed by the routine methods. An increase in the rate of
		the fungi isolation was studied in the time course of the observation: 15.3 +/-
		1.9 per cent in 1989 and 31.6 +/- 3.4 per cent in 1994. The fungi were more
		frequently isolated from the patients with lung abscesses (38.0 +/- 4.1 per cent
		of the cases). In the patients with pyothorax the fungi were isolated from the
		pleural exudate specimens only in 6.8 +/- 1.4 per cent of the cases. The groups
		of risk of the susceptibility to Candida were revealed. They included patients at
		the age of 21 to 30 years and above 60. Out of 484 Candida isolates 80.7 per cent
		"belonged to C. albicans, 4.2 per cent to C. tropicalis, 2.1 per cent to C. kefyr"
		"and 1.8 per cent to C. krusei. The isolates of C. parapsilosis, C. guillermoudii,"
		C. utilis and C. brumptii were rate. The isolates were highly susceptible to
		"nystatin (91,8 per cent) and lowly susceptible to levorin (35.4 per cent),"
		amphoglucamine (24.7 per cent) and ketokonazol (16.8 per cent).

AB	-	Evaluation of the fungal involvement in the etiology of ventilator-associated
		pneumonia (VAP) after cardiac surgery. The study had as target the patients
		diagnosed with VAP after cardiac surgery at the Institute of Cardiovascular
		"Diseases in Iaşi, between April 2nd 2002 and December 31st 2009. MATERIAL AND"
		METHOD: Our study included only cases with fungal etiology of VAP. We examined
		quantitatively the tracheal aspirates with cytology quality score Q = 2+:
		microscopy and cultivation. The isolates with clinical significance (=
		10(6)UFC/mL significantly associated to inflammatory cells) were identified by
		standard methods or based on the API system (bioMérieux) and tested by the
		breakpoints method for susceptibility to antifungal agents. RESULTS: Among the
		"2167 operated patients, 35 of them were diagnosed with VAP through the clinical"
		pulmonary infection score = 6. Fungi caused 15 of 44 VAP episodes. With a
		"frequency of 30.19%, fungi are on 2nd place within the etiologic agents of VAP"
		after non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli (45.28%). The fungi involved in VAP
		"were: Candida albicans (16.97%), Pneumocystis jirovecii (3.77%), while Candida"
		"glabrata, Candida sake, Candida krusei, Geotrichum capitatum and Cryptococcus"
		"humicola, amounted 1.89% each. The widespread use of broad spectrum antibiotics"
		led to the emergence of fungi as a common cause of ventilator-associated
		"pneumonia. The involvement in the VAP etiology of P. jirovecii, an un-cultivable"
		"fungus with special sensitivity to antibiotics, requires a careful microscopy of"
		specimens.

TI	-	Pulmonary aspergillosis and the importance of oxalate crystal recognition in
		cytology specimens.
PG	-	1176-9
AB	-	"A 62-year-old man, previously healthy but alcoholic, and who was clinically"
		"thought to have bacterial pneumonia, presented with a pulmonary infiltrate in the"
		"right apex, and suddenly died of exsanguinating hemoptysis. Sputum cultures"
		yielded Aspergillus niger and Candida krusei while sputum cytology revealed
		numerous birefringent crystals in a background of acute inflammatory exudate.
		Autopsy findings showed invasive aspergillosis with a large mycetoma-containing
		cavity in the lung that was associated with localized massive oxalosis. This case
		further substantiates the fact that the presence of calcium oxalate crystals in
		pulmonary biopsy and cytology specimens can be regarded as an important
		diagnostic aid in the diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis due to A niger.

PG	-	527-9
AB	-	We present a case of young male treated for a recurrence of Acute Non Lymphoid
		Leukemia who presented a colonization by C. krusei during prophylaxis with
		"Fluconazole. The fever episode, which he developed while neutropenic, was"
		resolved with the addition of Amphotericin B after the failure of empiric
		antibiotic therapy. No isolation was performed in blood cultures. A second cycle
		of antiblastic chemotherapy was needed because of the resistance shown to the
		first. Despite the prophylaxis with Fluconazole a stream of C. krusei grew in all
		the blood cultures collected while febrile. Amphotericin B administered did not
		control the fungemia. We discuss the resistance of C. krusei to Fluconazole.

TI	-	Unusual case of bowel infarction with invasive Aspergillus in an
		immunocompromised patient.
PG	-	122-5
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: We report a patient with bowel infarction due to invasive
		Aspergillus infection as a result of prolonged chemotherapy-induced neutropenia.
		CLINICAL PICTURE: The patient was given neoadjuvant chemotherapy with
		"doxorubicin, docetaxel, and capecitabine for a breast tumour. She developed"
		"prolonged neutropenia, Escherichia coli and Candida krusei sepsis, acute arterial"
		"thrombosis of the left lower limb, and invasive aspergillus infection. TREATMENT:"
		"She underwent a subtotal colectomy, small intestine resection and an above-knee"
		amputation. OUTCOME: The hospitalisation was complicated with
		methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia and short gut syndrome. She
		subsequently underwent simple mastectomy with axillary clearance and received
		adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation without complication. CONCLUSION:
		"Chemotherapy should be protocol-directed. In a non-trial situation, protocol must"
		"have a sound basis, proven safety, and efficacy. Aspergillus infection is"
		uncommon in patients with solid tumours; prompt treatment must be started on high
		suspicion.

AB	-	Only a handful of cases of human Candida lambica infections have been published
		up to now. We report a Candida lambica fungemia in a young intravenous drug
		"abuser. Using a popular chromogenic agar and a commercial phenotyping gallery,"
		the fungus was initially misidentified as Candida krusei. Key tests to
		distinguish these closely related species are maximum growth temperature and
		assimilation of certain substrates present in more elaborate phenotyping assays.
		Definite confirmation is possible using molecular techniques. Susceptibility
		testing of the isolate demonstrated amphotericin B (MIC 0.125 microg/ml)
		"susceptible, flucytosine (MIC 2 microg/ml) susceptible, itraconazole (MIC 0.064"
		"microg/ml) susceptible, voriconazole (MIC 1 microg/ml) susceptible, and"
		"fluconazole (MIC >64 microg/ml, resistant)."

		nystatin].
PG	-	959-63
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: The rates of Candida species and susceptibility to nystatin were
		"evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the period from January 1, 1998 to December"
		"31, 1998 mycological tests have been carried out for identification of yeast"
		species in the group of pregnant and delivering women hospitalized in the
		Obstetrics-Gynecological Departments of the Municipal Hospital in Bydgoszcz. We
		used two commercial media: Albicans ID and CHROMagar Candida. Noted have been 389
		positive inoculation results for Candida from vaginal secretions. RESULTS AND
		CONCLUSIONS: From the total number of 416 differentiated fungus strains decidedly
		dominant was the species Candida albicans--constituting 81.97% of all strains.
		The second frequently occurring fungus species was Candida glabrata--11.06%.
		"Further species were C. krusei--2.16%, C. tropicalis--1.20% and C."
		guilliermondii--1.20%. In 10 cases (2.41%)--in spite of carrying out the
		laboratory activities that are necessary in such a situation--the species type of
		tested strains could not be determined. The simultaneous occurrence of two
		Candida species has been noted in material originating from 27 women (6.94% of
		cases). Defining the drug-resistance of 93 Candida species strains against
		nystatin by means of the disk-diffusion method--it has been started that this
		drug is highly effective--81.72% of sensitive strains.

AB	-	We undertook a retrospective review of all patients with hematologic malignancies
		in whom candidemia developed during chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in 1989 and
		1990. Candidemia developed in 11 patients; five were receiving therapeutic doses
		of amphotericin B at the time of infection. Disseminated infection occurred in 2
		of 5 patients with breakthrough infection and 3 of 6 patients with candidemia
		before receipt of amphotericin B. Among patients with breakthrough candidemia
		there was a trend toward more-prolonged neutropenia prior to infection (P =
		".069), but otherwise they were indistinguishable from other candidemic patients"
		with regard to risk factors for candidemia. Amphotericin B-susceptible Candida
		albicans was isolated from two patients and Candida krusei from three patients
		with breakthrough infection. All patients were treated with amphotericin B; all
		breakthrough infections responded to treatment. Neutropenic patients with
		breakthrough candidemia were clinically similar to those whose candidemia
		"preceded amphotericin B therapy, and there was no increase in morbidity and"
		mortality among individuals with breakthrough infection.

PG	-	313-6
AB	-	Four patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation were treated with
		liposomal (3 patients) and conventional (one patient) amphotericin-B for
		"disseminated candidosis. Candida krusei was isolated from 3, and C. glabrata from"
		1 patient. The patients were treated with liposomal amphotericin-B in doses from
		3 to 5 mg/kg. The fourth patient received conventional amphotericin-B in a
		reduced dose due to renal impairment. The patients died from multiorgan failure
		"due to disseminated fungal infection. In 1 case, the switch to the conventional"
		"drug resulted in clearance before death. The 3 fungus isolates, together with the"
		fourth strain obtained from patient no. 4 without any exposition to liposomal
		"amphotericin-B were tested for their susceptibility to conventional, liposomal"
		and discoidal amphotericin-B. All strains showed good sensitivity to the
		conventional and discoidal drug. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of
		liposomal amphotericin-B were 1 to 3 titre steps higher indicating a reduced
		sensitivity of the tested strains to this preparation. We conclude that the use
		of liposomal amphotericin-B is recommended mainly on the base of the low
		"incidence of side-effects. Intensive microbial resistance tests, pharmacokinetic"
		investigations and randomized studies are necessary before the conventional drug
		is replaced as the gold standard for systemic antimycotic therapy.

		university hospitals.
PG	-	909-12
AB	-	The aim of this study was to identify retrospectively trends in fungal
		bloodstream infections in The Netherlands in the period from 1987 to 1995.
		"Results of over 395,000 blood cultures from five Dutch university hospitals were"
		"evaluated. Overall, there were more than 12 million patient days of care during"
		"the nine-year study period. The rate of candidemia doubled in the study period,"
		"reaching an incidence of 0.71 episodes per 10,000 patient days in 1995. The"
		general increase in candidemia was paralleled by an increase in non-Candida
		"albicans bloodstream infections, mainly due to Candida glabrata. However, more"
		than 60% of the infections were caused by Candida albicans. Fluconazole-resistant
		species such as Candida krusei did not emerge during the study period. The
		increasing rate of candidemia found in Dutch university hospitals is similar to
		"the trend observed in the USA, but the rate is lower and the increase is less"
		pronounced.

AB	-	We report a case of candidemia due to Candida krusei after subarachinoid
		hemorrhage. A 51 year-old male patient consulted us for high fever and increase
		of CRP 10 days post operation against subarachinoid hemorrhage. There was a
		temporary decrease in the CRP after administration of ceftazidime (CAZ) but it
		again when treatment with CAZ was stopped. Because of detected Candida sp. by
		"blood culture, fluconazole was administered i.v. for 5 days, but C. krusei was"
		"positive during the treatment. Therefore, fluconazole was replaced with"
		micafungin. The patient became better after the administration with micafungin
		for 14 days without side effect. Micafungin is effective against candidemia due
		to C. krusei.

PG	-	1231-4
AB	-	This paper describes a case of Candida Parapsilosis endocarditis in a patient
		with a mitral valve prosthesis implanted two years previously. This history
		started with a cerebrovascular accident associated with pyrexia. A complex
		medico-surgical therapeutic approach controlled the infection. This consisted of
		"systemic and local (immersion of the prosthesis) antifungal therapy, bathing the"
		left heart chambers in 5 p. 100 iodine solution and two valve replacements at 8
		months intervals. The second surgery was not related to recurrence of the candida
		infection but to a perivalvular leak attributed to the insertion of the
		prosthesis into tissues inflamed by recent infection. Despite the improvement in
		"the prognosis of fungal infection due to an early surgical approach, it is still"
		"essential to try and prevent the disease, the mortality rate still being over 80"
		p. 100. It is essential to be very careful when using intravenous catheters and
		aerosols; the indications of antibiotherapy must also be respected.
