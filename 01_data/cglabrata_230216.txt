TI	-	Epidemiology of invasive candidiasis: a persistent public health problem.
PG	-	133-63
AB	-	Invasive candidiasis (IC) is a leading cause of mycosis-associated mortality in
		the United States. We examined data from the National Center for Health
		Statistics and reviewed recent literature in order to update the epidemiology of
		"IC. IC-associated mortality has remained stable, at approximately 0.4 deaths per"
		"100,000 population, since 1997, while mortality associated with invasive"
		aspergillosis has continued to decline. Candida albicans remains the predominant
		"cause of IC, accounting for over half of all cases, but Candida glabrata has"
		"emerged as the second most common cause of IC in the United States, and several"
		"less common Candida species may be emerging, some of which can exhibit resistance"
		to triazoles and/or amphotericin B. Crude and attributable rates of mortality due
		to IC remain unacceptably high and unchanged for the past 2 decades.
		"Nonpharmacologic preventive strategies should be emphasized, including hand"
		"hygiene; appropriate use, placement, and care of central venous catheters; and"
		prudent use of antimicrobial therapy. Given that delays in appropriate antifungal
		"therapy are associated with increased mortality, improved use of early empirical,"
		"preemptive, and prophylactic therapies should also help reduce IC-associated"
		mortality. Several studies have now identified important variables that can be
		used to predict risk of IC and to help guide preventive strategies such as
		"antifungal prophylaxis and early empirical therapy. However, improved"
		non-culture-based diagnostics are needed to expand the potential for preemptive
		"(or early directed) therapy. Further research to improve diagnostic, preventive,"
		and therapeutic strategies is necessary to reduce the considerable morbidity and
		mortality associated with IC.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: The oral mucosa is likely to be compromised by acquired systemic
		disease. There are no data available on the prevalence of oral candidiasis and
		"the species distribution among patients with oral mucosal diseases. Therefore, it"
		is necessary to conduct a study assessing the characterization of oral
		candidiasis and the species profiles in such patients. METHODS: Over a period of
		"four consecutive years, patients with oral mucosal diseases were screened for"
		oral candidiasis by a combination of clinical presentation and laboratory
		"findings (smear test and Candida cultures). In addition, Candida species were"
		"isolated and identified for further analysis. RESULTS: In total, 9769 (6.09%) of"
		"the 160,357 patients screened were diagnosed with oral candidiasis on the basis"
		of both clinical manifestations and laboratory testing. The ratio of females to
		"males was 1:0.61, and females had higher overall infection rates than males in"
		"all age subgroups. Patients with HIV infection, anaemia-related stomatitis,"
		"Sjögren's syndrome/xerostomia, pemphigoid, and radiation-induced stomatitis were"
		"highly susceptible to oral candidiasis. Of the 11,161 isolated Candida strains,"
		"C. albicans remained the most common species (75.37%), followed by C. tropicalis"
		"(6.06%), C. krusei (2.79%), and C. glabrata (2.02%). Surprisingly, both the"
		proportion and the number of C. glabrata isolates increased dramatically over the
		"4 consecutive years. CONCLUSIONS: In this large-scale population-based study, the"
		features of oral candidiasis prevalence and the species profile among patients
		with oral mucosal diseases were summarized. The information gleaned will enhance
		the understanding of and improve management strategies for oral candidiasis and
		the underlying systemic and oral conditions.

		antifungal susceptibility pattern.
PG	-	3292-3303
LID	-	10.1111/jog.15442 [doi]
AB	-	"AIM: Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), is a common fungal infection that remains a"
		global concern. The objectives of this study were molecular identification and
		"assessment of the antifungal susceptibility profile of Candida species, causing"
		VVC in southeast Iran. METHODS: A cross-sectional investigation was carried out
		on 119 nonpregnant females suspected of VVC between February 2019 and May 2021.
		Yeast samples were characterized to the species level by conventional and
		molecular methods. All Candida isolates were examined for in vitro susceptibility
		profile to six conventional antifungal drugs using Clinical and Laboratory
		"Standards Institute guidelines. RESULTS: Out of 119 subjects, 52 (43.7%) cases"
		"were affected by VVC, out of whom 11 (21.15%) cases had recurrent vulvovaginal"
		candidiasis (RVVC). The species distribution was as follows; Candida albicans
		"(n = 21; 40.4%), C. glabrata (n = 11; 21.2%), C. tropicalis (n = 9; 17.3%), C."
		"parapsilosis (n = 5; 9.7%), C. africana (n = 3; 5.7%), C. famata (n = 1; 1.9%),"
		"C. lusitaniae (n = 1; 1.9%), and C. dubliniensis (n = 1; 1.9%). The resistance"
		"rate of Candida isolates to fluconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole were"
		"15.38%, 11.5%, and 3.8%, respectively. Resistance to fluconazole was obtained in"
		46% (5/11) of RVVC cases but only in 7% (3/41) of VVC cases. CONCLUSION: This
		study demonstrated that the majority of VVC cases were caused by non-albicans
		"Candida species which also were resistant to some antifungal agents. Hence, our"
		findings revealed the importance of conducting periodical epidemiological studies
		"to determine changes in species distribution. Moreover, for effective management"
		"of treatment and infection, it is imperative to evaluate the susceptibility"
		profiles of Candida species isolated from VVC patients.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Neonatal Candida spp. infections are serious events due to their
		"morbidity and mortality, however, epidemiological information is insufficient in"
		developing countries. The objective of this study was to describe the incidence
		and factors associated with invasive infection by Candida spp. in a Neonatal
		Intensive Care Unit in Mexico. METHODS: Case-control study nested in a cohort and
		matched for birth weight. We estimated the incidence of invasive neonatal
		"infection by Candida spp. For the bivariate analysis of the studied factors,"
		McNemar's test was used to contrast hypotheses and multivariate analysis was made
		with logistic regression. RESULTS: The incidence of infection was 2.27
		"events/1000 live newborns. The species identified were C. albicans 35.3% (n 30),"
		"C. parapsilosis 30.6% (n 26), C. glabrata 31.8% (n 27) and two events with C."
		lipolytica. The factors associated with a higher risk were mechanical ventilation
		"(OR 3.04, 95% CI 1.13-8.14), systemic antibiotics (OR 7.48, 95% CI 1.30-42.9),"
		"number of antimicrobial regimens (OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.01-4.03), and days with total"
		"parenteral nutrition (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.04-1.25) or with venous catheter central"
		"(OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.02-1.20). Fluconazole prophylaxis decreased the risk (OR 0.32,"
		"95% CI 0.12-0.84). CONCLUSIONS: Invasive interventions (central catheter,"
		"mechanical ventilation, and parenteral nutrition) and the use of antimicrobials"
		"increase the risk of neonatal Candida spp. Infection, while prophylactic"
		fluconazole is protective.

LID	-	10.4103/ijdr.IJDR_827_20 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: The study was undertaken to estimate the species-specific prevalence
		"of oral candidiasis in diabetic individuals in India, and further find the"
		relationship of oral carriage of Candida in diabetes with degree of diabetic
		"control, duration of disease, type of diabetes and its effect on the status of"
		"oral hygiene status and decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMFT) score."
		METHODOLOGY: The prospective cross-sectional study involved 900 individuals (470
		diabetic and 430 non-diabetic) visiting a tertiary care hospital. Informed
		consent was obtained from all the individuals participating in the study. The
		"demographic details, medical history and oral cavity examination were recorded in"
		a specially designed proforma. Swabs were taken for microbiological evaluation
		for specific prevalence of Candida. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of Candida in
		"diabetics was 22.1% as compared to 9.7% in non-diabetic individuals. However,"
		"among the type 1 and type 2 diabetics, the prevalence of Candida was equally"
		"distributed as 22.6% and 20.8%, respectively. C. albicans was the most common"
		"species (97.1%), while isolated cases of other species like C. rugosa, C."
		"tropicalis, C. glabrata were also observed. The individuals with higher glycaemic"
		score (HbA1c >7) showed higher prevalence of oral candidiasis. Oral hygiene
		status was observed to be lower among diabetics as compared to non-diabetic
		individuals. CONCLUSION: Oral candidiasis was more prevalent in diabetic
		"patients, and C. albicans was the most common species. The diabetics also showed"
		higher mean DMFT with lower oral hygiene status as compared to non-diabetic
		individuals.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Accurate identification Candida is important for successful therapy
		and epidemiology study. The aim of research is to study API 20C yeast
		identification system identification rate by using molecular identification as
		gold standard and tested the antifungal susceptibility of Candida from patients
		"with vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC). METHODS: In total, 3574 yeast isolates were"
		"obtained from patients with VVC. API 20C yeast identification, molecular"
		identification and in vitro antifungal susceptibility were performed. RESULTS: C.
		"albicans was the predominant Candida species [2748 isolates, 76.9%] in VVC. The"
		isolates from vaginal samples represented 22 species based on molecular
		identification. The API 20C system identifies only 11 of the species encountered
		"during the study period. Based on the API 20C system, 3273 (91.78%) isolates were"
		correctly identified to the species level. The correct identification rate of the
		API 20C system for rare yeast was 15.29% (26/170 isolates). Antifungal
		susceptibility was tested in a total of 1844 isolates of Candida from patients
		with VVC. C. albicans was susceptible to most of the tested antifungals. The MICs
		of azoles for C. glabrata were higher than those for C. albicans. The MICs of
		echinocandins for C. parapsilosis were higher than those for C. albicans.
		CONCLUSIONS: The API 20C yeast identification system can be used to reliably
		identify the most common Candida species while molecular methods are necessary
		"for the identification of closely related, emerging, and rare yeast species. The"
		results from this study suggest that much of the previous studies on the
		epidemiology of VVC should be re-thought. C. albicans was susceptible to most of
		the tested antifungals.

AB	-	Vaginal candidiasis (VC) continues to be a health problem to women worldwide.
		"Although the majority of VC cases are caused by Candida albicans (C. albicans),"
		non-albicans Candida spp. like C. glabrata and C. tropicalis are emerging as
		important and potentially resistant opportunistic agents of VC. The objective of
		this study was to evaluate the prevalence and epidemiology of VC in the UAE
		through retrospective analysis of pertinent data compiled by the microbiology and
		"infection control unit at Latifa Hospital, Dubai between 2005 and 2011. The"
		incidence of VC significantly increased from 10.76% in 2005 to 17.61% in 2011;
		"average prevalence was 13.88%. C. albicans occurred at a frequency of 83.02%, C."
		glabrata at 16.5% and C. tropicalis at 1.2%. A single C. dubliniensis isolate was
		identified in the sample population. The percentage of C. albicans significantly
		decreased from 83.02% in the sample population as a whole to 60.8% in subjects
		"over 45 years of age (P < 0.01) and that of C. glabrata, C. tropicalis and C."
		"krusei significantly increased from 13.88%, 0.9% and 0.03% to 29.7%, 6.7% and"
		1.4% (P < 0.05) respectively. The incidence of VC in the UAE is on the rise and
		the frequency of non-albicans Candida spp. is noticeably increasing especially in
		postmenopausal women.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Spondylodiscitis is an infection of the vertebral column, the"
		incidence of which is increasing due to an increase in the susceptible population
		and improved ascertainment. This disease has been associated with a wide range of
		microorganisms. Fungal spondylodiscitis is uncommon (0.5-1.6%) and strongly
		"associated with immunosuppression and diabetes (Gouliouris et al., 2010). A rare"
		case of Candida glabrata spondylodiscitis in a non-neutropenic diabetic patient
		"is reported herein, along with a review of the literature. CASE REPORT: A case of"
		C. glabrata spondylodiscitis of L3-L4 metameres was diagnosed. The diagnosis was
		obtained through open biopsy of an abscess and culture examination. The patient
		was treated with anidulafungin and surgical debridement of the lesion.
		CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of spondylodiscitis is often delayed or missed.
		Physicians should consider this entity in the differential diagnosis of lumbar
		pain in order to initiate an appropriate therapy to prevent spinal cord lesions
		"and disability. This is particularly relevant in the case of a fungal aetiology,"
		as there is a recognized global shift towards invasive candidiasis due to
		"non-albicans Candida species, in particular C. glabrata, which has variable"
		susceptibility to antifungal drugs.

AB	-	Emphysematous pyelonephritis (EPN) is a rare acute necrotizing infection of the
		"kidney and surrounding tissues, with gas in the renal parenchyma, collecting"
		system or perirenal tissue. The bacterial etiology predominates; mainly
		Gram-negative bacilli; Candida spp. and C. albicans are rarely described. We
		"describe a case of EPN caused by C. glabrata, sensitive to fluconazole in a"
		"young, hypertensive woman with undiagnosed diabetes mellitus (DM), with renal"
		dysfunction upon admission; her abdominal CT scan found a volumetric increase in
		"the left kidney, signs of gas collections and perirenal blurring. Despite the"
		"antimicrobial therapy instituted, due to clinical refractoriness, a double J"
		"catheter and subsequent total nephrectomy were indicated, with good postoperative"
		"evolution. Her uroculture showed C. glabrata sensitive to fluconazole, and the"
		pathology study showed tubular atrophy and intense interstitial inflammatory
		"infiltrate. Despite the serious, potentially fatal condition, we could control"
		the infection and the patient recovered fully. Poor DM management is an important
		"triggering factor, and it is of great relevance to identify the EPN through"
		imaging exams due to the peculiarities of its clinical and potentially surgical
		management.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is the second most common infection of
		the genital tract affecting millions of women worldwide. Data concerning the
		distribution and antifungal resistance of Candida species responsible of VVC vary
		among countries and population studied. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this work was to
		"determine the prevalence, species distribution and antifungal susceptibility"
		patterns of Candida species among symptomatic women over a 20-year period.
		"METHODS: A total of 5,820 unique samples were retrospectively identified. Out of"
		"them, 1,046 (18%) were diagnosed with VVC. RESULTS: Women between 18 and 30 years"
		had the highest prevalence rate of VVC (21%). Women aged less than 18 years and
		greater than 51 years had the highest prevalence rates of vaginal bacterial
		infections. Thirty-five (3.3%) women presented recurrent VVC. The most common
		"yeast isolated was C. albicans, followed by C. glabrata, C. krusei, and C."
		parapsilosis. Non-Candida albicans species (NAC) were more significantly isolated
		"among women aged 51 or above, than in women included in other groups (p < 0.01)."
		Resistance to fluconazole and amphotericin B was infrequent in C. albicans
		strains. Resistance to fluconazole and amphotericin B was infrequent in C.
		albicans strains. NAC species presented higher resistance rates against
		fluconazole (30%) and voriconazole (25%). C. krusei and C. glabrata isolates
		showed lower MICs than most of the strains against amphotericin B (1 mg/L) and
		flucytosine (1 mg/L). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated that continued
		surveillance on Candida species distribution and non-susceptibility rates to
		antifungals should be routinely reported to help the selection of the most
		"appropriate drug, to avoid the emergence of resistant strains, and to improve the"
		patient's outcomes.

AB	-	The incidence of deep fungal infection due to non-albicans Candida species
		(especially Candida glabrata) has significantly increased in recent decades.
		Candida glabrata is an opportunistic pathogen of low virulence which mainly
		"invades the gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and respiratory tracts, but has"
		rarely been reported as complication of articular surgery in the literature. We
		present a case of knee fungal arthritis caused by C. glabrata after a minimally
		"invasive arthroscopic surgery. In this case, the patient's knee got infected"
		"after arthroscopic treatment for a recurrent popliteal cyst, and she was unable"
		to be cured by either debridement or antifungal drugs. Mycological and molecular
		identification of the necrotic tissues isolate revealed C. glabrata as etiologic
		"agent. We originally planned to conduct a debridement once again, but it was"
		found that the articular cartilage was extensively damaged during the operation.
		"Besides, the magnetic resonance imaging of the affected knee also showed that the"
		infection had invaded the subchondral bone. So we treated this case with a
		two-stage primary total knee arthroplasty with an antibiotic-laden cement spacer
		"block. After a 10-month follow-up, the patient had completely recovered and has"
		"not experienced any recurrence to date. In addition, we review 21 cases of C."
		glabrata-induced infectious arthritis described to date in the literature.

PG	-	20-25
LID	-	10.1177/0897190020938219 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Case reports and pharmacokinetic data suggest off-label echinocandin
		dosing may be needed to reach adequate serum concentrations in obese patients.
		Few outcome studies exist evaluating this population. OBJECTIVES: Of this study
		were to (1) determine the association of body mass index (BMI) with clinical
		outcomes of candidemia patients on standard doses of anidulafungin and (2)
		characterize fungal infections by body weight. METHODS: A retrospective cohort
		was conducted to evaluate hospitalized patients treated for candidemia with
		anidulafungin at Food and Drug Administration-labeled dosing for at least 72
		"hours from January 1, 2014, through January 31, 2018. Candidemia was diagnosed by"
		blood culture or T2 magnetic resonance (T2MR). Patients were compared according
		to BMI category. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-three patients were included.
		Candida albicans and Candida glabrata were identified in 58 (33%) and 57 (33%)
		"patients, respectively. Mortality was comparable according to BMI category: 4"
		"(36.4%) underweight, 8 (25.8%) normal weight, 16 (32.0%) overweight, 20 (33.9%)"
		"obese, and 7 (31.8%) morbidly obese, P = .976. Variables associated with"
		"mortality included: severe sepsis (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 5.1, 95% CI:"
		"1.7-14.8) and liver disease (adjusted OR = 3.2, 95% CI: 1.1-9.4). Variables that"
		"were protective of mortality included: line removal (adjusted OR = 0.05, 95% CI:"
		"0.02-0.2) and receipt of anidulafungin for at least 5 days (adjusted OR = 0.35,"
		95% CI: 0.15-0.8). CONCLUSION: There was no difference detected in mortality
		among patients with candidemia across BMI category. Larger studies are needed to
		confirm whether standard doses of anidulafungin are sufficient for candidemia in
		obese patients.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Pregnant women are more susceptible to vaginal colonization and
		infection by yeast. The role of Candida colonization in the occurrence of preterm
		birth is well established. The knowledge of local epidemiology and identification
		of risk factors for preterm birth is important for the prevention and management
		strategies. The purpose of the study was to determine the prevalence of
		Candida sp. in vaginal swabs of pregnant women. METHODS: Pregnant women attending
		routine antenatal visits in three primary health centres in Bobo-Dioulasso
		(Burkina Faso) were enrolled into a cross-sectional study carried out from
		February to April 2015. Vaginal swabs samples were taken from participants after
		obtaining oral consent. The swabs were inoculated into Sabouraud's glucose agar
		supplemented with chloramphenicol and incubated at 37°C for 24 to 48hours under
		aerobic conditions in order to perform fungal culture. The identification of the
		Candida species was done by culture on HiCrome Candida Differential Agar at 35°C
		for 48h for production of species-specific colors. RESULTS: A total of
		229 pregnant women were included. The prevalence of vulvovaginal candidiasis
		"(VVC) was 22.71%, (95% CI [17.45-28.69]). Candida albicans accounted for 40.39%"
		"and non-Candida albicans species for 59.61% of the isolates, with mainly"
		"C. glabrata (32.69%), C. tropicalis (15.38%) and C. krusei (11.54%). CONCLUSIONS:"
		This study revealed a high prevalence of non-C. albicans species. The syndromic
		management guidelines for VVC in Burkina Faso will be revised to include a
		specific protocol for pregnant women.

PG	-	753-762
LID	-	10.1111/myc.13278 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candida bloodstream infections (BSI) became an important invasive
		"disease in the late 20th century, in particular among immunocompromised patients."
		Although considerable progress has been made in the management of patients with
		"invasive mycoses, Candida BSI are still widespread among hospitalised patients"
		and are associated with relatively high mortality. OBJECTIVES: We conducted a
		"retrospective study to evaluate patient characteristics, incidence, species"
		distribution and antifungal susceptibility of BSI isolates of Candida spp. as
		"well as outcomes of Candida BSI from 2001 to 2012, before the widespread use of"
		echinocandins. This is the first epidemiological study of Candida BSI in Slovenia
		so far. METHODS: All documented candidaemia cases from 2001 to 2012 in two major
		"hospitals-University Medical Centre and Institute of Oncology in Ljubljana,"
		Slovenia-were taken into consideration. Candida BSI were identified in 422
		"patients (250 male, 172 female). Laboratory and clinical data of these patients"
		were retrospectively analysed. Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare continuous
		variables and Fisher's exact test or chi-squared test for categorical variables.
		RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The average incidence of Candida BSI was 0.524/10.000
		"patient-days (0,317/1000 admissions); 16/422 were younger than 1 year and 251/422"
		patients were over 60 years old. The most commonly isolated species were Candida
		"albicans and Candida glabrata, followed by Candida parapsilosis. Majority of the"
		"patients had a single episode of Candida BSI, multiple episodes of Candida BSI"
		occurred in 18/434 patients (4.1%); in 25/434 patients (5.8%) mixed Candida BSI
		were observed. Crude 30-day case-fatality rate was 55.4%.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Biliary obstruction and cholangitis are common problems in
		gastroenterology. Infections of the biliary tract with Candida and other fungal
		species have increasingly been seen in the last few years. OBJECTIVE: To
		"investigate the prevalence, associations, and trends of biliary-tract"
		"candidiasis. DESIGN: A prospective, observational, diagnostic study. SETTING:"
		"University Hospital, Muenster, Germany. PATIENTS: Consecutive patients undergoing"
		"ERCP for various indications. RESULTS: In 54 of 123 patients, we found Candida"
		"species in bile samples (44%). In only 7 patients, candidiasis was suspected on"
		endoscopy before mycologic proof. Only 4 of these 7 patients were correctly
		diagnosed with biliary candidiasis by simple morphologic aspects. The fungus was
		mainly differentiated as Candida albicans or Candida glabrata and rarely as
		"Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, or other subspecies. Immunosuppression"
		for various reasons was significantly associated with bile-duct candidiasis (P <
		.02). No significant association was found between positive fungal cultures and
		prior endoscopic sphincterotomy (P = .0824) or prior ERCP (P = .1152). Biliary
		candidiasis was neither associated with positive fungal cultures of buccal smears
		(P = .0722) nor with positive findings in stool samples (P = .0860). LIMITATIONS:
		Highly selected patient population. Buccal smears and stool samples were not
		obtained from all patients. Contamination artifacts cannot totally be excluded
		with the ERCP procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Candida species very frequently can be
		detected in the bile. Positive fungal cultures of bile samples are not just
		contamination artifacts. This has to be taken into account when designing an
		anti-infectious treatment for recurrent cholangitis or even more cholangiosepsis.
		Especially in immunosuppressed patients or recipients of long-term antibiotic
		"therapy, physicians should screen for biliary-tract candidiasis during endoscopic"
		examination.

		epidemiology of pathogenic yeasts in China.
PG	-	566-572
LID	-	10.1111/jdv.17874 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is frequent in women of reproductive
		"age, but very limited data are available on the epidemiology in cases of VVC in"
		"China. OBJECTIVES: The current study has been conducted to reveal the prevalence,"
		species distribution of yeast causing VVC and molecular genetics of Candida
		albicans in China. METHODS: Vaginal swabs were collected from 543 VVC outpatients
		recruited in 12 hospitals in China between September 2017 and March 2018. They
		were preliminarily incubated on Sabouraud dextrose agar and then positive
		subjects of which were then transmitted to our institute for further
		"identification. CHROMagar™ was used to isolate Candida species, and all isolates"
		were finally identified by DNA sequencing. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was
		used to analyse phylogenetic relationships of the various C. albicans isolates.
		"RESULTS: Eleven different yeast species were identified in 543 isolates, among"
		"which C. albicans (84.7%) was the most frequent, followed by C. glabrata (8.7%)."
		We obtained 117 unique diploid sequence types from 451 clinical C. albicans
		isolates and 92 isolates (20.4%) belonged to a New Clade. All the strains
		appearing in the New Clade were from northern China and they were isolated from
		non-recurrent VVC. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that C. albicans are still
		the main cause of VVC in China and the majority of C. albicans isolates belongs
		"to Clade 1 with DST 79 and DST 45 being two most common. Moreover, the New Clade"
		revealed in our study seems to be specific to northern China.

PG	-	99-100
LID	-	10.1136/sti.2009.040386 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: It is thought that widespread use of 'over-the-counter' azoles may
		increase the incidence of resistant Candida species such as Candida glabrata.
		Infections with species other than Candida albicans frequently do not respond to
		standard azole treatments. Intravaginal nystatin is an option but is no longer
		"available in the UK. In this paper, the authors review the prevalence of"
		"non-albicans candida over the past 5 years, and assess the efficacy of"
		amphotericin and flucytosine vaginal cream in the treatment of non-albicans VVC.
		METHODS: Retrospective review of all vaginal yeast isolates collected from women
		attending a city centre sexual-health clinic between 2004 and 2008. The women
		prescribed amphotericin and flucytosine vaginal cream were identified through
		"pharmacy records, and their clinical notes reviewed for treatment outcome."
		"RESULTS: Between 2004 and 2008, the number of isolates of all Candida species"
		"increased with increasing clinic workload, but the prevalence of non-albicans"
		yeasts remained stable at between 0.87 and 1.06%. Eighteen patients were
		"prescribed amphotericin and flucytosine vaginal cream. At follow-up, all 18 were"
		"clear of their initial yeast isolate on culture, but two had persistent symptoms"
		and had positive cultures for C albicans. CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence of
		any increase in prevalence of non-albicans Candida species such as C glabrata.
		The authors have treated 18 women who had non-albicans VVC with amphotericin and
		flucytosine vaginal cream and achieved clearance of the non-albicans species in
		all of them.

PG	-	e954-66
LID	-	10.1016/j.ijid.2010.04.006 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candidemia is among the leading causes of nosocomial bloodstream
		infections and is associated with significant mortality. Several centers have
		published data regarding the incidence and relative frequency of Candida spp.
		OBJECTIVE: We performed a systematic review to summarize and evaluate the
		available evidence regarding the distribution of the relative frequency of
		"Candida spp isolated from blood, according to geographic region and study design,"
		during the period 1996 to 2009. METHODS: We searched PubMed and Scopus and
		retrieved 81 relevant articles reporting data on the relative frequency of
		Candida spp. RESULTS: C. albicans was the predominant species in almost all
		studies. The highest proportion of C. albicans was found in North and Central
		"Europe and the USA. Non-albicans species were more common in South America, Asia,"
		and South Europe. C. glabrata was commonly isolated in the USA and North and
		"Central Europe; C. parapsilosis in South America, South Europe, and several parts"
		of Asia; and C. tropicalis in South America and Asia. The relative frequency of
		C. krusei was low in all regions. Significant differences were noted depending on
		"study design (surveillance study, multicenter or single centre, prospective or"
		retrospective) and setting (hospital or intensive care unit). CONCLUSIONS:
		Significant geographic variation is evident among cases of candidemia in
		different parts of the world. Local epidemiological data continue to be of major
		significance.

TI	-	Oral Candidiasis in children and adolescents with cancer. Identification of
		Candida spp.
PG	-	E419-23
AB	-	Oral candidiasis represents a serious problem for children with cancer. The
		"mortality rate of this infection has increased due to fungal septicemia,"
		associated with a primary buccal infection. OBJECTIVE: Identify the Candida spp.
		"in buccal lesions of patients with cancer, establish the predominant species and"
		"correlate them to age and sex of the patient, clinical presentation, type of"
		"neoplasic disease and cytostatic therapy received. STUDY DESIGN: 62 patients,"
		"between 0-16 years, were investigated in a cross sectional study. SAMPLE"
		INCLUSION CRITERIA: Patients with malignant neoplasic disease that were receiving
		cytostatic treatment and had suspicious lesions of oral candidiasis. Patients
		"with antifungal therapy, active caries, calculus or intraoral appliances were"
		excluded. A clinical evaluation was carried out. The lesion sample was taken and
		studied by direct exam and culture in CHROMagar-Candida and Sabouraud-Dextrose
		Agar with chloramphenicol. The identification of the isolated yeast was done by
		"the filamentation test, carbohydrate fermentation and assimilation. RESULTS: Most"
		"of the cases (69.35%) were positive to oral candidiasis, C. albicans was the most"
		"frequent species found, followed by C. parapsilosis (14.89%), C. tropicalis"
		"(12.77%), C. krusei (4.26%), C. glabrata (2.13%) and C. lusitaniae (2.13%). In"
		some cases more than one specie were isolated (9.30%). The most frequent location
		of the lesion was in the tongue (72.70%). The pseudomembranous candidiasis was
		the most frequent clinical presentation found (78.71%). There were not
		"significant statistically differences with regard to sex and age of the patient,"
		type of neoplasic disease and cytostatic agent received. CONCLUSION: The results
		suggest that oral candidiasis is a frequent complication in the pediatric
		"oncological population, being C. albicans the main etiological agent, however,"
		there is an important participation of other Candida species.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive candidiasis is an important nosocomial infection associated
		with high mortality among immunosuppressive or critically ill patients. We
		described the incidence of invasive candidiasis in our hospital over 6 years and
		showed the antifungal susceptibility and genotypes of the isolated yeast. METHOD:
		The yeast species were isolated on CHROMagar Candida medium and identified using
		"an yeast identification card, followed by analysis of the D1/D2 domain of 26S"
		"rDNA. The susceptibilities of the isolates to flucytosine, amphotericin B,"
		"fluconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole were tested using the ATB FUNGUS 3"
		"system, and that to caspofungin was tested using E-test strips. C. albicans was"
		genotyped using single-strand conformation polymorphism of CAI (Candida albicans
		I) microsatellite DNA combined with GeneScan data. RESULTS: From January 2006 to
		"December 2011, a total of 259 isolates of invasive Candida spp. were obtained"
		"from 253 patients, among them 6 patients had multiple positive samples."
		"Ninety-one stains were from blood and 168 from sterile fluids, accounting for"
		6.07% of all pathogens isolated in our hospital. Most of these strains were C.
		"albicans (41.29% in blood/59.06% in sterile body fluids), followed by C."
		"tropicalis (18.06%/25.72%), C. parapsilosis (17.42%/5.43%), C. glabrata"
		(11.61%/3.99%) and other Candida spp. (11.61%/5.80%). Most Candida spp. were
		isolated from the ICU. The new species-specific CLSI candida MIC breakpoints were
		applied to these date. Resistance to fluconazole occurred in 6.6% of C. albicans
		"isolates, 10.6% of C. tropicalis isolates and 15.0% of C. glabrata isolates. For"
		"the 136 C. albicans isolates, 54 CAI patterns were recognized. The C. albicans"
		strains from blood or sterile body fluids showed no predominant CAI genotypes. C.
		albicans isolates from different samples from the same patient had the same
		genotype. CONCLUSIONS: Invasive candidiasis has been commonly encountered in our
		"hospital in the past 6 years, with increasing frequency of non-C. albicans."
		Resistance to fluconazole was highly predictive of resistance to voriconazole.
		CAI SSCP genotyping showed that all C. albicans strains were polymorphic.
		Invasive candidiasis were commonly endogenous infection.

PG	-	391-8
LID	-	10.1111/myc.12488 [doi]
AB	-	Major burn patients have characteristics that make them especially susceptible to
		"candidemia, but few studies focused on this have been published. The objectives"
		"were to evaluate the epidemiological, microbiological and clinical aspects of"
		"candidemia in major burn patients, determining factors associated with a poorer"
		prognosis and mortality. We conducted a retrospective observational study of
		candidemia between 1996 and 2012 in major burn patients admitted to the La Fe
		"University Hospital, Valencia, Spain. The study included 36 episodes of"
		"candidemia in the same number of patients, 55.6% men, mean age 37.33 years and"
		low associated comorbidity. The incidence of candidemia varied between 0.26 and
		6.09 episodes/1000 days stay in the different years studied. Candida albicans was
		the most common species (61.1%) followed by Candida parapsilosis (27.8%).
		"Candidemia by C. krusei, C. glabrata or C. tropicalis were all identified after"
		2004. Central vascular catheter (CVC) was established as a potential source of
		"candidemia in 36.1%, followed by skin and soft tissues of thermal injury (22.2%)"
		and urinary tract (8.3%). Fluconazole was used in 19 patients (52.7%) and its in
		"vitro resistance rate was 13.9%. The overall mortality was 47.2%, and mortality"
		related to candidemia was 30.6%. Factors associated with increased mortality were
		those related to severe infection and shock. CVC was the most usual focus of
		candidemia. Fluconazole was the most common antifungal drug administered. The
		management of candidemia in major burn patients is still a challenge.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Multidrug resistant Candida auris is an emerging threat worldwide.
		"It has been identified in Africa, however, there is minimal data available"
		comparing C. auris to other Candida species in Africa. METHODOLOGY:
		"Retrospective, case control study at a tertiary South African Hospital. Clinical"
		and laboratory features of patients with positive C. auris clinical cultures from
		1 January 2015 to 31 August 2018 were compared to patients who cultured C.
		albicans and C. glabrata. RESULTS: Forty-five clinical cases with C. auris
		cultures were identified. The median age was 32 years (IQR = 26-46). The median
		duration of hospital stay was 64 days (IQR = 39-88) and median time from
		admission to diagnosis 35 days (IQR = 21-53). Indwelling devices and previous
		antibiotic exposure were found to be significant risk factors. All C. auris
		isolates were susceptible to amphotericin B and micafungin. Patients treated with
		"amphotericin B alone, had a higher mortality (73.33%, n = 11/15) than patients"
		"treated with an echinocandin (54.55%, n = 6/11), however this was not"
		statistically significant. All C. auris isolates were healthcare associated with
		80% (n = 36/45) acquired in ICU. The 30-day all-cause in-patient mortality was
		"42% (n = 19/45) for C. auris, 36% (n = 16/45) for C. albicans and 53% (n = 24/45)"
		for C. glabrata. CONCLUSIONS: C. auris is an emerging multi drug resistant threat
		in South Africa. Improved access to echinocandins and improvement of infection
		prevention and control strategies are imperative to prevent further morbidity and
		mortality due to this pathogen.

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To identify the epidemiology and antifungal susceptibilities of
		Candida spp. among blood culture isolates to identify the epidemiology and
		antifungal susceptibilities of Candida spp. among blood culture isolates in
		"Sweden. METHODS: The study was a retrospective, observational nationwide"
		laboratory-based surveillance for fungaemia and fungal meningitis and was
		"conducted from September 2015 to August 2016. RESULTS: In total, 488 Candida"
		blood culture isolates were obtained from 471 patients (58% males). Compared to
		"our previous study, the incidence of candidaemia has increased from 4.2/100 000"
		(2005-2006) to 4.7/100 000 population/year (2015-2016). The three most common
		"Candida spp. isolated from blood cultures were Candida albicans (54.7%), Candida"
		glabrata (19.7%) and species in the Candida parapsilosis complex (9.4%). Candida
		"resistance to fluconazole was 2% in C. albicans and between 0% and 100%, in"
		non-albicans species other than C. glabrata and C. krusei. Resistance to
		"voriconazole was rare, except for C. glabrata, C. krusei and C. tropicalis."
		Resistance to anidulafungin was 3.8% while no Candida isolate was resistant to
		amphotericin B. CONCLUSIONS: We report an overall increase in candidaemia but a
		minor decrease of C. albicans while C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis remain
		constant over this 10-year period.

AB	-	"The infection rate of arteriovenous (AV) grafts is high, but fungal etiology is"
		rare. Only five cases of graft infection due to Candida albicans (C. albicans) or
		"C. tropicalis have been described in the literature. Herein, we report the first"
		case of AV graft infection caused by C. glabrata. A 60-year-old woman on
		maintenance hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease was admitted because of
		"intermittent fever, for 10 days. Upon physical examination, tenderness over the"
		AV graft site was noticed. Blood culture yielded C. glabrata and her clinical
		"symptoms improved after she was treated with micafungin for 1 month. However, C."
		glabrata candidemia reoccurred 5 weeks later. Cure was achieved after removal of
		"the AV graft and anidulafungin treatment. Pus was observed in the removed graft,"
		from which C. glabrata was isolated. The outcome of our case and patients from
		the literature review suggest that removal of the infected graft is important for
		treatment success of AV graft Candida infection.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: The goal of the study was to measure the prevalence of Candida spp. in
		the oral cavity of patients with diabetes types 1 and 2 when compared to healthy
		individuals and to study antifungal resistance profile of the isolates. DESIGN:
		There were 162 subjects in the study: diabetes type 1 (n=39); control group 1
		"(n=50): healthy individuals matched in gender, age, and oral conditions to"
		diabetes type 1 patients; diabetes type 2 (n=37); control group 2 (n=36) who were
		matched to each patient of the diabetes type 2 group. Stimulated saliva was
		collected and isolates were identified with phenotypic tests. The presence of C.
		dubliniensis was determined by multiplex PCR. RESULTS: There were no
		statistically significant differences in Candida spp. frequency between the
		diabetes 1 group and its control (p=0.443) nor between the diabetes 2 group and
		its control (p=0.429). C. albicans was the most frequently isolated yeast in all
		"groups. In the diabetes groups, C. stellatoidea, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis,"
		"C. lipolytica, C. glabrata, and C. krusei were also identified. Additionally, in"
		"control groups, C. kefyr was also detected. None of the isolates were resistant"
		to amphotericin B and flucytosine. A low percentage of the isolates were
		resistant to ketoconazole. CONCLUSIONS: No differences were detected in
		colonization of Candida spp. oral isolates from type 1 and type 2 diabetes when
		compared to matched controls. The antifungal resistance of Candida spp. isolates
		for ketoconazole from type 1 diabetes patients was significantly higher than that
		of its matched control.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Active surveillance is necessary for improving the management and
		outcome of patients with candidemia. The aim of this study was to describe
		epidemiologic and clinical features of candidemia in children and adults in
		"tertiary level hospitals in Chile. METHODS: We conducted a prospective,"
		"multicenter, laboratory-based survey study of candidemia in 26 tertiary care"
		"hospitals in Chile, from January 2013 to October 2017. RESULTS: A total of 780"
		"episodes of candidemia were included, with a median incidence of 0.47/1,000"
		"admissions. Demographic, clinical and microbiological information of 384 cases of"
		"candidemia, from 18 hospitals (7,416 beds), was included in this report. One"
		hundred and thirty-four episodes (35%) occurred in pediatric patients and 250
		"(65%) in adult population. Candida albicans (39%), Candida parapsilosis (30%) and"
		"Candida glabrata (10%) were the leading species, with a significant difference in"
		the distribution of species between ages. The use of central venous catheter and
		antibiotics were the most frequent risk factors in all age groups (> 70%). Three
		hundred and fifteen strains were studied for antifungal susceptibility; 21
		"strains (6.6%) were resistant to fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole,"
		anidulafungin or micafungin. The most commonly used antifungal therapies were
		"fluconazole (39%) and echinocandins (36%). The overall 30-day survival was 74.2%,"
		significantly higher in infants (82%) and children (86%) compared with neonates
		"(72%), adults (71%) and elderly (70%). CONCLUSIONS: Our prospective, multicenter"
		"surveillance study showed a low incidence of candidemia in Chile, with high"
		"30-day survival, a large proportion of elderly patients, C. glabrata as the third"
		"most commonly identified strain, a 6.6% resistance to antifungal agents and a"
		frequent use of echinocandins.

AB	-	"OBJECTIVES: To determine the epidemiology of Candida bloodstream infections,"
		"variables influencing mortality, and antifungal resistance rates in ICUs in"
		"Spain. DESIGN: Prospective, observational, multicenter population-based study."
		SETTING: Medical and surgical ICUs in 29 hospitals distributed throughout five
		metropolitan areas of Spain. PATIENTS: Adult patients (≥ 18 yr) with an episode
		of Candida bloodstream infection during admission to any surveillance area ICU
		from May 2010 to April 2011. INTERVENTIONS: Candida isolates were sent to a
		reference laboratory for species identification by DNA sequencing and
		susceptibility testing using the methods and breakpoint criteria promulgated by
		the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing. Prognostic
		factors associated with early (0-7 d) and late (8-30 d) mortality were analyzed
		using logistic regression modeling. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We detected
		"773 cases of candidemia, 752 of which were included in the overall cohort. Among"
		"these, 168 (22.3%) occurred in adult ICU patients. The rank order of Candida"
		"isolates was as follows: Candida albicans (52%), Candida parapsilosis (23.7%),"
		"Candida glabrata (12.7%), Candida tropicalis (5.8%), Candida krusei (4%), and"
		others (1.8%). Overall susceptibility to fluconazole was 79.2%. Cumulative
		mortality at 7 and 30 days after the first episode of candidemia was 16.5% and
		"47%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that early appropriate antifungal"
		"treatment and catheter removal (odds ratio, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.08-0.91), Acute"
		"Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (odds ratio, 1.11; 95% CI,"
		"1.04-1.19), and abdominal source (odds ratio, 8.15; 95% CI, 1.75-37.93) were"
		independently associated with early mortality. Determinants of late mortality
		"were age (odds ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.07), intubation (odds ratio, 7.24; 95%"
		"CI, 2.24-23.40), renal replacement therapy (odds ratio, 6.12; 95% CI,"
		"2.24-16.73), and primary source (odds ratio, 2.51; 95% CI, 1.06-5.95)."
		CONCLUSIONS: Candidemia in ICU patients is caused by non-albicans species in 48%
		"of cases, C. parapsilosis being the most common among these. Overall mortality"
		remains high and mainly related with host factors. Prompt adequate antifungal
		treatment and catheter removal could be critical to decrease early mortality.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Candidemia is a nosocomial infection of increasing importance,"
		associated with high morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study is to
		"describe the species distribution, risk factors, management and outcomes of"
		patients with candidemia. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study at Centro
		"Hospitalar Universitário de São João, Portugal, between January 2016 and December"
		2017. RESULTS: A total of 117 candidemia episodes (n=114 patients) were included.
		"Median age was 65 years, with an increased prevalence of older ages. Candida"
		"albicans (51.3%) was the most prevalent species, followed by C. glabrata (22.2%),"
		"C. parapsilosis (15.4%), C. tropicalis (4.3%) and C. lusitaniae (2.6%). Forty-two"
		patients (35.9%) did not receive antifungal drugs after diagnosis of candidemia.
		Echinocandins were used as first-line drug therapy in half of the treated
		patients (50.7%). The median EQUAL Candida Score was 6/17 (IQR 6-9) for patients
		without central venous catheter (CVC) and 11/20 (IQR 6-14) for patients with CVC.
		"The 30 days-mortality was 31,6% and was not significantly associated with the"
		timing of antifungal therapy and the EQUAL Candida Score. CONCLUSION: The
		"distribution of Candida species has changed in recent years, with an increase in"
		"the proportion of C. albicans and C. glabrata. Rapid diagnostic tests, empiric"
		antifungal therapy and source control are essential to improve the prognosis of
		patients with candidemia. More multicentric prospective studies are needed to
		evaluate the association of mortality with the timing of antifungal therapy or
		the EQUAL Candida Score.

AB	-	PURPOSE: To analyze trends in incidence and mortality of candidemia in intensive
		care units (ICUs) vs. non-ICU hospitalized patients and to determine risk factors
		for infection by specific species and for death. METHODS: Active hospital-based
		surveillance program of incident episodes of candidemia due to common species in
		"24 tertiary care hospitals in the Paris area, France between October 2002 and"
		"September 2010. RESULTS: Among 2,507 adult cases included, 2,571 Candida isolates"
		"were collected and species were C. albicans (56 %), C. glabrata (18.6 %), C."
		"parapsilosis (11.5 %), C. tropicalis (9.3 %), C. krusei (2.9 %), and C. kefyr"
		"(1.8 %). Candidemia occurred in ICU in 1,206 patients (48.1 %). When comparing"
		"ICU vs. non-ICU patients, the former had significantly more frequent surgery"
		"during the past 30 days, were more often preexposed to fluconazole and treated"
		"with echinocandin, and were less frequently infected with C. parapsilosis. Risk"
		factors and age remained unchanged during the study period. A significant
		increased incidence in the overall population and ICU was found. The odds of
		being infected with a given species in ICU was influenced by risk factors and
		preexposure to fluconazole and caspofungin. Echinocandins initial therapy
		"increased over time in ICU (4.6 % first year of study, to 48.5 % last year of"
		"study, p < 0.0001). ICU patients had a higher day-30 death rate than non-ICU"
		patients (odds ratio [OR] 2.12; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.66-2.72; p <
		0.0001). The day-30 and early (<day 8) death rates increased over time in ICU
		(from 41.5 % the first to 56.9 % the last year of study (p = 0.001) and 28.7-38.8
		"% (p = 0.0292), respectively). Independent risk factors for day-30 death in ICU"
		"were age, arterial catheter, Candida species, preexposure to caspofungin, and"
		lack of antifungal therapy at the time of blood cultures results (p < 0.05).
		CONCLUSIONS: The availability of new antifungals and the publication of numerous
		guidelines did not prevent an increase of candidemia and death in ICU patients in
		the Paris area.

PG	-	649-655
LID	-	10.1007/s10096-016-2841-3 [doi]
AB	-	The primary aim of this study was to collect national epidemiological data on
		candidaemia and to determine the reporting time of species identification and
		antifungal susceptibility in clinical practice. During a 1-year period (March
		"2013 until February 2014), every first Candida isolate from each episode of"
		candidaemia was included prospectively from 30 Belgian hospitals. Identification
		and susceptibility testing were performed according to local procedures and
		isolates were sent to the National Reference Center for Mycosis. Species
		identification was checked by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation
		time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and internal transcribed spacer
		(ITS) sequencing in case no reliable identification was obtained by MALDI-TOF MS.
		Antifungal susceptibility testing was performed according to the European
		Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) methodology. A total
		of 355 isolates were retrieved from 338 patients. The mean incidence rate of
		candidaemia was 0.44 (range: 0.07 to 1.43) per 1000 admissions or 0.65 (range:
		"0.11 to 2.00) per 10,000 patient days. Candida albicans was most frequently found"
		"(50.4 %), followed by C. glabrata (27.3 %) and C. parapsilosis sensu lato"
		"(9.8 %). The overall resistance to fluconazole was 7.6 %, ranging from 3.9 % in"
		C. albicans to 20.0 % in C. tropicalis. Only one C. glabrata isolate was
		"resistant to the echinocandins. Four days after blood culture positivity, 99.7 %"
		of the identifications and 90.3 % of the antifungal profiles were reported to the
		treating clinician. Candidaemia incidence rates differed up to 20-fold among
		Belgian hospitals; no clear factors explaining this difference were identified.
		The overall antifungal resistance rates were low but high azole resistance rates
		were recorded in C. tropicalis.

		Literature Review.
PG	-	417-421
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-017-0228-3 [doi]
AB	-	The incidence of candidiasis due to non-albicans Candida species (especially
		Candida glabrata) has significantly increased in recent decades. Candida glabrata
		"often invades immunocompromised hosts and causes systemic or mucosal infections,"
		whereas cutaneous infections are rarely reported. We present a rare case of
		cutaneous infection caused by C. glabrata and review all similar cases available
		in the PubMed database. A patient was admitted to the hospital with a 2-month
		history of a plaque on the face. Histopathological examination displayed typical
		"infectious granulomas in the deep dermis, and the pathogen was finally confirmed"
		"as C. glabrata using a series of microbial examinations (fungal culture,"
		"biochemical test, and PCR-directed sequencing). The patient was completely cured"
		after 4 months of treatment with oral itraconazole combined with topical
		terbinafine. We reviewed similar reports of cutaneous infection caused by C.
		glabrata. All the data suggested that an accurate diagnosis of cutaneous
		"candidiasis depends mainly on histological and fungal examinations, especially"
		molecular biological assays. Antifungal agents based on microbial susceptibility
		"tests are the first-line treatment choice for C. glabrata infection, but the"
		prognosis might be more dependent on the basic condition of the host.

AB	-	"PURPOSE: Candidemia is an important issue of nosocomial bloodstream infections,"
		"and is associated with a high mortality rate. However, little information is"
		"available before final species identification, which takes days after the episode"
		of candidemia. This study tried to determine whether time to positivity (TTP) for
		yeast helps in predicting the species of candidemia. METHODS: A retrospective
		"cohort study was conducted in Taiwan, which included 434 episodes of"
		nonduplicated candidemia during the period between 2006 and 2009. The demographic
		"features, clinical characteristics, TTP for yeast, and acute illness scores were"
		included for analysis. RESULTS: The mean age of patients with candidemia was 70.4
		"± 15.2 years, and the 30-day crude mortality rate was 48.2%. Forty-five percent"
		of patients suffered from shock status with a mean Acute Physiological and
		Chronic Health Evaluation II score of 27.0 ± 8.7 and a mean Sequential Organ
		"Failure Assessment score of 9.7 ± 4.5, whereas 50% were admitted to the intensive"
		care units. Candida albicans was still the most commonly identified pathogen
		"(58.1%), followed by C. tropicalis (14.7%), C. parapsilosis (13.1%), and C."
		glabrata (8.3%). Results of multivariate logistic regression showed that TTP for
		"yeast within 48 hours would more favor C. tropicalis (p = 0.044), and less favor"
		C. glabrata (p = 0.025) and C. parapsilosis (p < 0.001). Patients with parenteral
		nutrition usage were more frequently associated with a TTP for yeast within 48
		"hours, whereas those with previous exposure to an antifungal agent had a longer"
		TTP for yeast. CONCLUSION: The TTP for yeast might provide a hint of the
		responsible Candida species before final identification among critical patients
		with candidemia. The association between antifungal agents and TTP would need
		more evidence for elucidation.

PG	-	284-290
LID	-	10.1111/myc.12859 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Emergence of highly inflammatory genital dermatophyte infections has
		"been reported from Southeast Asia. In view of this, knowledge of the non-outbreak"
		fungal flora of the genitals is required as a baseline study. OBJECTIVES: We
		present our 12-year experience in a tertiary clinic with the diagnosis of scrotal
		fungal infections. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of patients with
		a diagnosis of scrotal fungal infections proven by direct microscopy and culture.
		"Clinical, mycological and treatment data were collected. RESULTS: In total, 35"
		"male patients were identified, of which 27 concerned dermatophyte infections and"
		"eight were yeasts. Nannizzia gypsea was the most common agent (48.6%), presenting"
		as thick pseudomembraneous lesions limited to the scrotum. Trichophyton rubrum
		"(22.9%) and Epidermophyton floccosum (5.7%) mainly presented erythematous, dry"
		and scaly lesions and involving more sites besides the scrotum. Candida albicans
		"(n = 3), C. glabrata (n = 2), C. guilliermondii (n = 1) and Trichosporon"
		"asteroides (n = 1), presented various lesions. Sports, sweating and concurrent"
		tineas are hypothesised as predisposing factors. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalent
		"causative agent of scrotum infections is N. gypsea, but wide species diversity is"
		observed. All infections show mild skin inflammation. It is suggested that this
		genital fungal flora represents the current situation prior to clonal
		dermatophyte outbreaks.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Different yeast species have different susceptibilities to commonly
		"prescribed antifungal drugs. Thus, it is important to accurately determine the"
		"species of pathogenic yeasts, especially when more than one species are in a"
		specimen. METHODS: Clinically significant yeast isolates were collected via the
		Taiwan Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance of Yeasts from July to September
		in 2010. The identifications of isolates were assessed in the core laboratory at
		"the National Health Research Institutes. RESULTS: Of the 1127 isolates recovered,"
		"1088 were of Candida genus, accounting for 96.53% of the total isolates, followed"
		"by Cryptococcus (15, 1.33%), Trichosporon (12, 1.06%), Kodamaea (4, 0.35%),"
		"Pichia (4, 0.35%), and three others. In all, 38 out of 1116 (3.4%) specimens had"
		"mixed yeast cultures. One ascites specimen had three species, Candida albicans,"
		"Candida glabrata, and Candida tropicalis. In the remaining 37 specimens, 16 had a"
		"combination of C. albicans and C. glabrata, eight C. albicans and C. tropicalis,"
		"five C. glabrata and C. tropicalis, three Candida krusei and C. tropicalis, and"
		five with different combinations. CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of cultures
		"with mixed yeasts may be an emerging issue. Thus, to determine mixed yeast"
		"cultures in the same specimen, we highly recommend CHROMagar Candida medium to"
		culture yeast isolates directly from the specimen.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To determine Candida colonisation/infection in renal transplant
		patients and to determine the resistance pattern against antifungal drugs.
		"METHODS: This prospective, observational study was conducted at Al-Sayyed"
		"Hospital, Rawalpindi, Pakistan, from January to October 2014, in collaboration"
		"with the Microbiology and Public Health Laboratory's, Islamabad campus..The"
		"clinical specimens investigated included respiratory tract secretions, blood,"
		"urine, high vaginal swab, skin scrapings, and plastic devices samples. RESULTS:"
		"Of the 7,850 samples, 164(2.08%) were positive for Candida. Candida albicans were"
		"most prevalent as they were found in 114(69%) samples. Besides, 56(34%) of the"
		positive samples were resistant to one or more antifungal agents. Highest
		resistance was obtained against fluconazole. We found only 5(3.04%) positive
		"samples of Candida glabrata; of them, 3(60%)were resistant. In case of Candida"
		"spp, 27(48%) resistance was observed. In Candida albicans, 23(41%) of the samples"
		were found to be resistant. Most of the Candida isolates was recovered from
		bronchial alveolar lavage. CONCLUSIONS: Although Candida albicans remained the
		"main responsible species for Candida infections, but non-albican Candida species"
		are also emerging.

AB	-	Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC) is a major health problem for sexually
		active women because of its severe effect on their quality of life. A thorough
		"knowledge of their epidemiology leads to their efficient management. Therefore, a"
		cross-sectional study was conducted in 2014 in women with leucorrhoea associated
		or not with other clinical signs. Recurrence was based on the occurrence of at
		least four annual episodes of Candida vulvo-vaginitis. An individual interview
		based on a questionnaire was conducted to identify the socio-demographic
		parameters that could be associated with the RVVC. Vaginal samples were collected
		at the obstetrical gynaecology department of the University Hospital of Cocody
		"and at the Pasteur Institute of Côte d'Ivoire. On each sample, a direct"
		examination and culture on Sabouraud-chloramphenicol medium with or without
		actidione were performed. Yeast identification was performed using chromogenic
		media (CandiSelect(®)4 [Bio-Rad]) and the study of sugar assimilation using the
		Auxacolor(®) 2 gallery (Bio-Rad). A total of 400 patients were included. The
		"average age was 29.2 years (SD=7.2 years). Of these, 94 had recurrent"
		"vulvovaginal candidiasis, with a prevalence of 23.5% (CI(95%): 19.49-28.02). Five"
		"species of the genus Candida have been identified: Candida albicans (59.6%),"
		"Candida glabrata (19.1%), Candida tropicalis (16%), Candida krusei (4.2%) and"
		"Candida inconspicua (1.1%). Some factors such as education level, history of"
		"sexually transmitted infection, type of underwear used, frequency of personal"
		hygiene and type of product used for these hygiene have been associated with the
		occurrence of RVVCs. The occurrence of RVVCs is relatively high in our study
		population. Non-albicansCandida species occupy a significant place in this
		disease epidemiology. By addressing the factors associated with the occurrence
		"and/or persistence of RVVCs, it will be possible to reduce their incidence in"
		sexually active women.

PG	-	32

LID	-	32
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Vaginal candidiasis is frequent in pregnant women and is associated
		with sepsis and adverse neonatal outcomes. This study determined the prevalence
		of candida species in symptomatic pregnant women and evaluated the antifungal
		susceptibility profile of the isolated Candida strains. It also aimed to explore
		whether Candida species predicts gestational complications and adverse neonatal
		outcomes. METHODS: A total of 258 pregnant women with vaginal discharge at 35 to
		37 week of gestation participated in this study. Vaginal swabs from these
		patients were collected at various obstetrics and gynecology clinics in Lebanon
		for a period of 14 months. Candida isolates were identified at species level and
		"antifungal susceptibility of Candida albicans to fluconazole (FCZ), amphotericin"
		"B (AMB), itraconazole (ICZ) and voriconazole (VCZ) was determined by the"
		"agar-based E-test method. RESULTS: Among 258 women tested, 100 (39%) were"
		"positive for Candida species. C. albicans, C. glabrata and C. krusei were"
		"isolated from 42, 41 and 17% of the women, respectively. C. albicans was"
		significantly associated only with gestational diabetes while C. krusei or C.
		glabrata had significant positive associations with other gestational
		complications. The antifungal susceptibility tests of C. albicans isolates
		"revealed 97.5, 90, 87.5 and 97.5% susceptibility to AMB, FCZ, ICZ and VCZ,"
		respectively. CONCLUSION: The current study revealed high incidence of both C.
		albicans and non-C. albicans Candida strains causing vulvovaginitis among
		"pregnant women in Beirut, Lebanon. Candida screening as antenatal follow up is"
		advised to minimize the risk of adverse neonatal outcome or gestational
		complications.

		"least one episode of infection in their lives, with pregnancy being a"
		"predisposing factor. If left untreated, vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) can lead"
		"to chorioamnionitis with subsequent abortion, prematurity and congenital"
		"infection of the neonate. We aimed to determine the prevalence of VVC, identify"
		"the recent and most frequently occurring species of Candida in pregnant women,"
		and determine the most effective antifungal drug of choice for treatment. METHOD:
		A prospective cross-sectional study in which 176 high vaginal swab samples of
		consented pregnant women visiting the antenatal clinic from February 2018 to
		April 2018 were subjected to direct gram smear and culture for Candida isolation.
		Candida isolates were identified using a germ tube test and HiCrome Candida
		differential agar. Candida isolates were then subjected to a disk diffusion
		"method using fluconazole (25 μg), nystatin (100 units), and voriconazole (1 μg)"
		on Mueller-Hinton agar supplemented with 2% (w/v) glucose and 0.5 μg/ml methylene
		blue dye to determine the susceptibility pattern as per the guidelines of the
		Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI). Chi-square analysis was used to
		ascertain the significant association of participants' sociodemographics and
		clinical presentations to VVC. A univariate logistic regression model was used to
		identify potential risk factors of VVC. RESULTS: The prevalence of VVC among our
		study participants was 30.7%. Non-albicans Candida (NAC) and Candida albicans had
		"a prevalence of 74.1 and 25.9%, respectively. Candida glabrata was the most"
		"common species, followed by Candida albicans, Candida krusei, and Candida"
		"parapsilosis. 50.0, 18.5 and 3.7% of Candida species were susceptible to"
		"voriconazole, fluconazole and nystatin, respectively, whereas 37.0, 48.1 and 9.3%"
		"of Candida species were resistant to voriconazole, fluconazole and nystatin,"
		respectively. The majority of isolates were susceptible dose dependent to all
		"three antifungal agents, with voriconazole being the most efficacious antifungal"
		agent. There was no significant association between participants'
		socio-demographic information and clinical presentations to VVC. CONCLUSION: The
		prevalence of VVC was high in the study area. C. glabrata was found to be the
		"most common cause of VVC among the pregnant women attending antenatal clinics, in"
		the Ho Municipality region of Ghana. The majority of the Candida isolates were
		"susceptible and resistant to voriconazole and fluconazole, respectively."

AB	-	"Systematic candidemia studies, especially in southern Iran, are scarce. In the"
		"current prospective study, we investigated candidemia in three major healthcare"
		"centers of Shiraz, the largest city in southern Iran. Yeast isolates from blood"
		and other sterile body fluids were identified by matrix-assisted laser
		desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and subjected to
		antifungal susceptibility testing (AFST) using the broth microdilution method.
		"Clinical data were retrieved from patients' medical records. In total, 113 yeast"
		"isolates were recovered from 109 patients, over 60% of whom received fluconazole."
		Antifungal drugs were prescribed without considering species identification or
		AFST. The all-cause mortality rate was 28%. Almost 30% of the patients were from
		intensive care units (ICUs). Candida albicans (56/113; 49.5%) was the most
		"prevalent species followed by C. glabrata (26/113; 23%), C. parapsilosis (13/113;"
		"11.5%), C. tropicalis (7/113; 6.2%), and C. dubliniensis (5/113; 4.4%). Only five"
		isolates showed antifungal resistance or decreased susceptibility to fluconazole:
		"one C. orthopsilosis isolate from an azole-naïve patient and two C. glabrata, one"
		"C. albicans, and one C. dubliniensis isolates from patients treated with azoles,"
		who developed therapeutic failure against azoles later. Our results revealed a
		low level of antifungal resistance but a notable rate of azole therapeutic
		"failure among patients with candidemia due to non-albicans Candida species, which"
		"threaten the efficacy of fluconazole, the most widely used antifungal in southern"
		regions of Iran. Candidemia studies should not be confined to ICUs and treatment
		should be administered based on species identification and AFST results.

		"extensively explored the epidemiology of candidemia. However, candidemia data"
		"from the other regions are notoriously scarce, which precludes from reaching a"
		"consensus regarding species distribution, the burden of antifungal resistance,"
		"and the clinical features of infected patients. Therefore, we conducted the"
		"current prospective candidemia study in Shiraz, one of the largest cities located"
		"in the south of Iran, from April 2016 to April 2018. More than 63% of the"
		candidemia infections were treated by fluconazole and species identification and
		antifungal susceptibility testing were not used for decision making regarding the
		choice of antifungal treatment. Approximately 70% of the candidemia cases
		"occurred in the wards outside of the ICUs. Candida albicans, C. glabrata, C."
		"parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, and C. dubliniensis were the five leading causative"
		agents of candidemia. Antifungal resistance was rare and fluconazole resistance
		"and/or non-wild type phenotypes were noticed in five isolates, only one was C."
		"albicans and the rest were non-albicans Candida (NAC) species, including C."
		"glabrata, C. dubliniensis, and C. orthopsilosis. Except for C. orthopsilosis,"
		"which was isolated from an azole-naïve patient, the rest of isolates were"
		recovered from patients treated with azoles and all showed therapeutic failure to
		"azoles. Collectively, our data will complete the candidemia picture in Iran and"
		"show that, although the level of resistance was rare, the therapeutic failure was"
		"notable among NAC species, which threatens the efficacy of fluconazole, the most"
		"widely used antifungal in Southern regions of Iran. Moreover, we showed that"
		candidemia is poorly managed in Iran since species identification tools along

AB	-	Vaginal swab samples were collected both from women with signs of acute
		vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC; n=270) and from healthy controls (n=100). The
		microscopic examination revealed a significant difference in the proportion of
		positive cultures of Candida between the VVC (33%) and control (21%) groups. To
		"determine the frequency of different species, positive cultures were analyzed"
		"using the germ tube test, CHROMagar medium, API 20 AUX System and DNA analysis."
		CHROMagar and API 20 AUX System tests identified 67% of samples as C. albicans.
		"Out of these, 42% appeared to be C. dubliniensis when the specific primers in the"
		polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used. We observed the prevalence of Candida
		species isolated from the vagina in descending order as follows: C. albicans
		"(38-39%), C. glabrata (32-33%), C. dubliniensis (28-29%) and C. tropicalis (0-1%)"

PG	-	70-80
LID	-	10.5578/mb.67599 [doi]
AB	-	Invasive candidiasis is a common and serious infection in premature newborns.
		Preventing and treating fungal infections is very important to improve the
		prognosis of premature infants. Fluconazole and amphotericin B are used as the
		first choice in the treatment of invasive fungal infections of the newborns. In
		"some cases, fluconazole and amphotericin B cannot be used due to nephrotoxicity,"
		"hepatotoxicity or resistant strains. Micafungin, which is among recently"
		"developed echinocandins, is the drug of choice in these cases. The use of"
		micafungin in newborns is new and there is a limited experience about the effect
		of high dose usage in the central nervous system. The aim of this study was to
		evaluate the electronic files of patients who used micafungin for the treatment
		of culture-proven or possible invasive fungal infection during their hospital
		stay in the neonatal intensive care unit during a 24-month period (2016-2017) in
		the third-level intensive care unit. A total of 15 patients (10 premature and 5
		term babies) were included in the study. The mean birth weight of the patients
		was 1732 ± 999 g and the mean gestational age was 32.2 ± 5.8 weeks. All patients
		had long-term intensive care and increased risk of invasive candidiasis
		infection. Central venous catheterization and multiple antibiotics usage were the
		most common risk factors in these patients. The other risk factors included
		"intubation, total parenteral nutritional use and surgical procedure application."
		Candida species were isolated from the cultures of four patients. Candida species
		"isolated from patients were Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida"
		"catenulata, Candida parapsilosis. The mean time for onset of micafungin was 29.9"
		± 16.6 days. Mean duration of micafungin therapy was 22.4 ± 11.2 days. Eight
		"patients received amphotericin B, three patients received fluconazole therapy and"
		four patients did not receive any antifungal therapy before the onset of
		micafungin. None of these patients had an abnormal kidney or liver function tests
		"due to micafungin use. As a conclusion, high dose (10 mg/kg/day) micafungin is a"
		safe and effective treatment choice both in the treatment of neonatal culture
		proven or probable invasive candida infections that were caused by refractory
		"Candida strains, and in the case of nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity."

PG	-	207-215
LID	-	10.1093/mmy/myx030 [doi]
AB	-	Candida glabrata is often the second most common causative agent for candidiasis
		"following Candida albicans. Despite the importance of C. glabrata infections, few"
		epidemiological studies have been conducted on this issue. The goal of this study
		was genotyping of clinical isolates of C. glabrata by multilocus sequence typing
		(MLST) technique for determination of the endemic prevalent genotypes and any
		association between isolation source and drug resistance. A total of 50 C.
		glabrata clinical isolates from Iran were analyzed by MLST and tested for
		"in-vitro susceptibilities to amphotericin-B, caspofungin, fluconazole, and"
		voriconazole according to the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
		"M27-A4 document guidelines. Among these isolates, 16 distinct STs were"
		"identified, indicating a discriminatory power index of 0.9029. The three major"
		"sequence types (STs) were ST-59, ST-74, and ST-7 with 10, 8, and 7 isolates,"
		"respectively. Furthermore, a total of 11 new sequences were found, to which no"
		allele numbers were assigned in the MLST database. All the isolates were
		susceptible to amphotericin B and caspofungin. Fluconazole resistance was shown
		"in four isolates. Also, a sole isolate was voriconazole resistant. This study"
		shows that the population structure of C. glabrata in Iran consists of groups
		closely related to the global database as well as to some new clonal clusters and
		"STs. Regarding the high prevalence of 11 new sequences found in this study, it"
		"can be concluded that, these new alleles are among the endemic genotypes of Iran."
		The genotypes or STs were independent of drug susceptibility and anatomic
		sources.

TI	-	"Chronic vulvovaginal candidiasis: characteristics of women with Candida albicans,"
		C glabrata and no candida.
PG	-	304-7
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Although as many as 5% of all women complain of chronic
		"vulvovaginitis, little is known about these women. They may often be misdiagnosed"
		and the role of vaginal yeast culture in diagnosing vulvovaginal candidiasis
		(VVC) among them has not been clearly defined. METHODS: To address these
		"deficiencies, we tabulated initial diagnoses among new patients and conducted a"
		"medical record-based, unmatched case-control study among women reporting a"
		history of chronic vulvovaginitis (four or more episodes in the past year) at a
		vulvovaginitis specialty clinic. Clinical presentation and medical history were
		compared for women who had a positive vaginal yeast culture for either Candida
		"albicans or C glabrata, or who had a negative culture. RESULTS: One-third of the"
		women had no apparent vulvovaginal disease at their initial visit. All women
		"reported similar symptoms, except for an increased prevalence of painful sexual"
		intercourse in women with C albicans (chi 2 p = 0.014 versus women with C
		glabrata and p < 0.001 versus women with no candida). Women with C glabrata were
		more likely to be non-white (chi 2 p = 0.071 compared with women with C albicans)
		and to report an underlying medical condition (chi 2 p < or = 0.001 versus both
		women with C albicans and women with no candida). Physical examination was normal
		only in women with no candida. C albicans cases were more likely to have positive
		potassium hydroxide microscopy (chi 2 p = 0.016) and a pH < or = 4.5 (chi 2 p =
		0.011) than were C glabrata cases. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that
		reliance on symptoms and signs alone will result in significant misdiagnosis of

TI	-	Epidemiology and predictive factors for early and late mortality in Candida
		bloodstream infections: a population-based surveillance in Spain.
PG	-	O245-54
LID	-	10.1111/1469-0691.12380 [doi]
AB	-	"A prospective, multicentre, population-based surveillance programme for Candida"
		bloodstream infections was implemented in five metropolitan areas of Spain to
		"determine its incidence and the prevalence of antifungal resistance, and to"
		"identify predictors of death. Between May 2010 and April 2011, Candida isolates"
		were centralized to a reference laboratory for species identification by DNA
		sequencing and for susceptibility testing by EUCAST reference procedure.
		Prognostic factors associated with early (0-7 days) and late (8-30 days) death
		were analysed using logistic regression modelling. We detected 773 episodes:
		"annual incidence of 8.1 cases/100 000 inhabitants, 0.89/1000 admissions and"
		1.36/10 000 patient-days. Highest incidence was found in infants younger than 1
		year (96.4/100 000 inhabitants). Candida albicans was the predominant species
		"(45.4%), followed by Candida parapsilosis (24.9%), Candida glabrata (13.4%) and"
		"Candida tropicalis (7.7%). Overall, 79% of Candida isolates were susceptible to"
		fluconazole. Cumulative mortality at 7 and 30 days after the first episode of
		"candidaemia was 12.8% and 30.6%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that"
		therapeutic measures within the first 48 h may improve early mortality:
		"antifungal treatment (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27-0.95) and central venous catheter"
		"removal (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.21-0.87). Predictors of late death included host"
		"factors (e.g. patients' comorbid status and signs of organ dysfunction), primary"
		"source (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.03-2.61), and severe sepsis or septic shock (OR 1.77,"
		"95% CI 1.05-3.00). In Spain, the proportion of Candida isolates non-susceptible"
		to fluconazole is higher than in previous reports. Early mortality may be
		improved with strict adherence to guidelines.

TI	-	Prior antimicrobial therapy and risk for hospital-acquired Candida glabrata and
		Candida krusei fungemia: a case-case-control study.
PG	-	4555-60
AB	-	"The incidence of infections caused by Candida glabrata and Candida krusei, which"
		"are generally more resistant to fluconazole than Candida albicans, is increasing"
		"in hospitalized patients. However, the extent to which prior exposure to specific"
		antimicrobial agents increases the risk of subsequent C. glabrata or C. krusei
		candidemia has not been closely studied. A retrospective case-case-control study
		"was performed at a university hospital. From 1998 to 2003, 60 patients were"
		identified with hospital-acquired non-C. albicans candidemia (C. glabrata or C.
		"krusei; case group 1). For comparison, 68 patients with C. albicans candidemia"
		(case group 2) and a common control group of 121 patients without candidemia were
		"studied. Models were adjusted for demographic and clinical risk factors, and the"
		risk for candidemia associated with exposure to specific antimicrobial agents was
		assessed. After adjusting for both nonantimicrobial risk factors and receipt of
		"other antimicrobial agents, piperacillin-tazobactam (odds ratio [OR], 4.15; 95%"
		"confidence interval [CI], 1.04 to 16.50) and vancomycin (OR, 6.48; CI, 2.20 to"
		19.13) were significant risk factors for C. glabrata or C. krusei candidemia. For
		"C. albicans candidemia, no specific antibiotics remained a significant risk after"
		adjusted analysis. Prior fluconazole use was not significantly associated with
		either C. albicans or non-C. albicans (C. glabrata or C. krusei) candidemia. In
		"this single-center study, exposure to antibacterial agents, specifically"
		"vancomycin or piperacillin-tazobactam, but not fluconazole, was associated with"
		subsequent hospital-acquired C. glabrata or C. krusei candidemia. Further studies
		are needed to prospectively analyze specific antimicrobial risks for nosocomial
		candidemia across multiple hospital centers.

		from familiar Candida albicans to multiresistant Candida auris.
PG	-	107-119
LID	-	10.1007/s10123-018-0014-1 [doi]
AB	-	Recent changes in the aetiology and epidemiology of invasive candidiasis have
		"serious implications for current and future diagnosis, treatment and prognosis."
		The aim of the current review was to discuss the epidemiology of invasive
		"candidiasis, the distribution of Candida species in different regions of the"
		"world, the medical concerns of the changing aetiology and the emergence of"
		"antifungal resistance. Overall burden of invasive candidiasis remains high,"
		"especially in vulnerable persons, such as the elderly, immunosuppressed or"
		"debilitated patients. Moreover, there is a progressive shift in the aetiology of"
		"invasive candidiasis from Candida albicans to other species of Candida, probably"
		related to the increased use of azole drugs with a clear trend towards increased
		"antifungal resistance. Finally, the emergence and rise of multiresistant species,"
		"such as Candida auris or Candida glabrata, is a major threat making necessary"
		invasive candidiasis worldwide surveillances. These changes have serious
		"implications for the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of invasive candidiasis."
		Updated knowledge of the current local epidemiology of invasive candidiasis is
		critical for the clinical management.

TI	-	Factors Influencing Non-albicans Candidemia: A Case-Case-Control Study.
PG	-	665-672
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-017-0146-4 [doi]
AB	-	The study identified factors predisposing to non-albicans candidemia with special
		"interest to prior antimicrobial treatment. A retrospective, case-case-control"
		"study was performed at the University Hospital of Heraklion, Greece, from"
		November 2007 through September 2011 including adult patients. The study had
		"three groups. The first included 58 patients with non-albicans candidemia, the"
		"second 48 with C. albicans candidemia, while the third (control) 104 without"
		candidemia. Each of the two candidemia groups was compared with the control using
		"multivariate logistic regression model. The mean (SD) age of the non-albicans,"
		"the albicans and the control patients was 67 (12), 67 (18) and 59 (19) years,"
		respectively. The most common non-albicans Candida spp. isolated were C.
		"parapsilosis in 19 patients (33%), C. glabrata in 17 (29%) and C. tropicalis in"
		15 (26%). Independent risk factors for non-albicans candidemia were prior
		"treatment with quinolones (p < 0.001), b-lactam-b-lactamase inhibitors"
		"(p = 0.011) and presence of central venous catheter (p = 0.05), while for C."
		"albicans candidemia were prior treatment with quinolones (p < 0.001), carbapenems"
		(p = 0.003) along with cardiac disease (p < 0.001). Neither duration of
		hospitalization nor in-hospital mortality [41% for the non-albicans vs 29% for C.
		albicans group (p = 0.192)] was significantly different between the two
		candidemia groups. The study reveals the role of antimicrobial exposure as a risk
		factor for candidemia caused by different species. Prior treatment with
		"b-lactam-b-lactamase inhibitors was associated with non-albicans, while with"

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive candidiasis (IC) is the most common invasive fungal
		infection. The epidemiology of IC in hospitalized patients has been widely
		"investigated in many metropolitan cities; however, little information from medium"
		and small cities is known. METHODS: A 5-year retrospective study was carried out
		"to analyze the prevalence, species distribution, antifungal susceptibility, risk"
		factors and mortality of inpatients with invasive Candida infection in a regional
		tertiary teaching hospital in Southwest China. RESULTS: A total of 243 inpatients
		with invasive Candida infection during the five-year study period were
		"identified, with a mean annual incidence of 0.41 cases per 1000 admissions and a"
		"30-day mortality rate of 12.3%. The species distributions of Candida albicans,"
		"Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, Candida krusei, Candida parapsilosis and"
		"other Candida species was 45.3, 30.0, 15.2, 4.9, 2.1 and 2.5%, respectively. The"
		"total resistance rates of fluconazole (FCA), itraconazole (ITR) and voriconazole"
		"(VRC) were 18.6, 23.1 and 18.5%, respectively. Respiratory dysfunction, pulmonary"
		"infection, cardiovascular disease, chronic/acute renal failure, mechanical"
		"ventilation, abdominal surgery, intensive care in adults, septic shock and IC due"
		to C. albicans were associated with 30-day mortality (P < 0.05) according to the
		"univariate analyses. Respiratory dysfunction [odds ratio (OR), 9.80; 95%"
		"confidence interval (CI), 3.24-29.63; P < 0.001] and IC due to C. albicans (OR,"
		"3.35; 95% CI, 1.13-9.92; P = 0.029) were the independent predictors of 30-day"
		mortality. CONCLUSIONS: This report shows that the incidence and mortality rates
		are lower and that the resistance rates to azoles are higher in medium and small
		cities than in large cities and that the species distributions and risk factors
		in medium and small cities are different from those in large cities in China. It
		is necessary to conduct epidemiological surveillance in medium and small cities
		to provide reference data for the surveillance of inpatients with IC infections.

		"population-based laboratory surveillance in Atlanta and Baltimore, 2008-2011."
PG	-	1352-61
LID	-	10.1093/cid/cis697 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candidemia is common and associated with high morbidity and
		mortality; changes in population-based incidence rates have not been reported.
		"METHODS: We conducted active, population-based surveillance in metropolitan"
		"Atlanta, Georgia, and Baltimore City/County, Maryland (combined population 5.2"
		"million), during 2008-2011. We calculated candidemia incidence and antifungal"
		"drug resistance compared with prior surveillance (Atlanta, 1992-1993; Baltimore,"
		1998-2000). RESULTS: We identified 2675 cases of candidemia with 2329 isolates
		during 3 years of surveillance. Mean annual crude incidence per 100 000
		person-years was 13.3 in Atlanta and 26.2 in Baltimore. Rates were highest among
		"adults aged ≥65 years (Atlanta, 59.1; Baltimore, 72.4) and infants (aged <1 year;"
		"Atlanta, 34.3; Baltimore, 46.2). In both locations compared with prior"
		"surveillance, adjusted incidence significantly declined for infants of both black"
		"and white race (Atlanta: black risk ratio [RR], 0.26 [95% confidence interval"
		"{CI}, .17-.38]; white RR: 0.19 [95% CI, .12-.29]; Baltimore: black RR, 0.38 [95%"
		"CI, .22-.64]; white RR: 0.51 [95% CI: .29-.90]). Prevalence of fluconazole"
		resistance (7%) was unchanged compared with prior surveillance; 32 (1%) isolates
		"were echinocandin-resistant, and 9 (8 Candida glabrata) were multidrug resistant"
		to both fluconazole and an echinocandin. CONCLUSIONS: We describe marked shifts
		in candidemia epidemiology over the past 2 decades. Adults aged ≥65 years
		replaced infants as the highest incidence group; adjusted incidence has declined
		"significantly in infants. Use of antifungal prophylaxis, improvements in"
		"infection control, or changes in catheter insertion practices may be contributing"
		to these declines. Further surveillance for antifungal resistance and efforts to
		determine effective prevention strategies are needed.

TI	-	Factors influencing the presence of Candida dubliniensis and other non-albicans
		species in patients with oral lichen planus: a retrospective observational study.
PG	-	333-342
LID	-	10.1007/s00784-021-04004-5 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: The epidemiologic distribution of non-albicans species in the oral
		"cavity of oral lichen planus (OLP) patients remains uncertain. Therefore, the aim"
		of this study was to identify factors associated with the presence of C.
		"dubliniensis and other non-albicans species. Furthermore, independent risk"
		factors for Candida superinfection in OLP should be identified. MATERIAL AND
		METHODS: Epidemiologic data and microbiological findings from 268 symptomatic OLP
		patients who underwent continuous oral swab culture over a 5-year period
		(2015-2019) were retrospectively reviewed. Candida species identification and
		"semi-quantification were obtained by culture on CHROMagar Candida, followed by"
		matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry
		(MALDI-TOF MS). RESULTS: C. albicans was the most frequently isolated species
		"(72.3%), followed by C. glabrata (7.3%), C. dubliniensis (5.8%), C. krusei and C."
		parapsilosis (both 2.6%). The presence of C. dubliniensis was significantly
		associated with tobacco smoking. Other non-albicans spp. were significantly more
		often detected in patients using removable dentures. Increasing age and the
		intake of psychotropic drugs were identified as independent risk factors of
		"Candida superinfection in OLP. CONCLUSION: In OLP patients, certain local and"
		systemic factors increase the risk of carrying potentially drug-resistant Candida
		species and the development of Candida superinfection of OLP lesions. CLINICAL
		"RELEVANCE: Due to the frequent detection of non-albicans species in OLP,"
		resistance or at least reduced sensitivity to azole antifungals should be
		"expected, especially in smokers and patients using removable dentures. In the"
		"case of oral complaints, a superinfection with Candida should be considered,"
		whereby older patients and patients taking psychotropic drugs have an increased
		risk for oral infection with Candida.

TI	-	Species-specific prevalence of vaginal candidiasis among patients with diabetes
		mellitus and its relation to their glycaemic status.
PG	-	162-6
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: Non- C. albicans Candida species are increasingly being recognized as
		the cause of vulvo-vaginal candidiasis. These species are often less susceptible
		to antifungal agents. Patients with diabetes mellitus are at risk for
		vulvo-vaginal candidasis. We assessed the species-specific prevalence rate and
		risk of candidiasis in patients with diabetes mellitus and healthy controls.
		"METHODS: Genital tract examination, direct microscopy and fungal cultures of"
		discharge collected by high vaginal swab were undertaken among 78 consecutive
		patients with diabetes mellitus (mean (+/-sd) age 32+/-12 years and body mass
		index (BMI) 22.3+/-5.5kg/m(2)) and 88 age- and BMI-matched healthy females.
		Glycaemic control in the diabetic cohort was assessed by measuring total
		glycosylated haemoglobin. RESULTS: Candida species were isolated in 36 of 78
		(46%) subjects with diabetes mellitus and in 21 of 88 (23%) healthy subjects
		"(Chi-squared 9.11, P=0.0025). The predominant Candida species isolated in"
		"diabetics with vulvo-vaginal candidiasis were Candida glabrata (39%), C. albicans"
		"(26%) and C. tropicalis (17%). In contrast, in the control group, C. albicans, C."
		"glabrata and C. hemulonii comprised 30% each, with none having C. tropicalis"
		"infection (for C. tropicalis: diabetic vs. control; 17% vs. nil, P=0. 05). Among"
		"the diabetic group, subjects with vulvo-vaginal candidiasis had significantly"
		higher mean HbA1 when compared to those who had no such infection (12.8+/-2.6%
		"vs. 9.7+/-1.7% respectively, P=0.001). The overall accuracy of direct microscopy"
		and clinical examination for predicting vulvo-vaginal candidiasis was only 77%
		"and 51%, respectively, in the diabetic group, and 83% and 65% in the control"
		group. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with diabetes mellitus had a high prevalence rate
		(46%) of vulvo-vaginal candidiasis with relative risk of 2.45. The non- C.
		albicans species such as C. glabrata and C. tropicalis were the predominant
		species isolated among them. There seems to be a significant link between
		hyperglycaemia and vulvo-vaginal candidiasis.

TI	-	Prevalence of candiduria in diabetic patients attending Gondar University
		"Hospital, Gondar, Ethiopia."
PG	-	102-7
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: About 10% to 15% of in-hospital urinary tract infections (UTIs) are
		"due to Candida species, and the prevalence is still increasing. A cross-sectional"
		study was conducted to determine fungal causative agents of UTI in asymptomatic
		and symptomatic diabetic patients and associated risk factors. MATERIALS AND
		"METHODS: Between May and June 2010, a total of 422 diabetic patients with"
		asymptomatic UTI (n = 387) and symptomatic UTI (n = 35) were investigated for UTI
		at Gondar University Hospital. Clean-catch midstream urine specimens were
		collected from each participant. Fungal urine culture and identification were
		done using standard microbiologic procedure. RESULTS: The age range of the
		"participants was 20 to 84 years (mean, 42.3 years). Significant candiduria was"
		"detected in 7.5% and 17.1% of asymptomatic and symptomatic diabetic patients,"
		respectively. The overall prevalence of significant candiduria in both groups was
		"8.3%. Candida species were isolated in 38 urine samples. Of these, 84.2% were"
		from the asymptomatic diabetic patients and the remaining 15.8% were from the
		"symptomatic patients. The most common species were C albicans (42.0%), C glabrata"
		"(34.2%), and C tropicalis (15.8%). Significant candiduria was strongly associated"
		with being female. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of candiduria in diabetic patients
		should not be neglected. Although C albicans is the organism most often
		"associated with serious fungal infection, other Candida species are also isolated"
		as clinically important opportunistic pathogens in type 2 diabetic patients.

		"had candidemia at Barnes Hospital, St. Louis, between 1 September 1988 and 1"
		September 1989 were retrospectively reviewed. One hundred six candidemic patients
		"were identified, representing 0.5% of all medical and surgical discharges and"
		0.33% of total patient discharges. These percentages represent a 20-fold increase
		in the incidence of candidemia at our hospital in comparison with that during
		"1976-1979. Candida albicans was the most frequently isolated species (63%),"
		"followed by Candida tropicalis (17%), Candida glabrata (13%), Candida"
		"parapsilosis (6.5%), and Candida krusei (0.9%). Overall mortality was 57%, and 14"
		(23%) of 60 deaths occurred within 48 hours of the detection of candidemia.
		Mortality was associated with higher APACHE II scores (25 for nonsurvivors vs. 16
		"for survivors; P = .0001), the presence of a rapidly fatal underlying illness (P"
		"= .0009), and sustained positivity of blood cultures (P = .02). In cases of"
		"sustained candidemia, the isolation of non-albicans Candida species also"
		correlated with increased mortality (8 of 8 vs. 10 of 21; P = .005). Thirty
		"candidemic patients (28%) did not receive any antifungal therapy, and 19 (63%) of"
		these untreated patients died. Eleven untreated patients (37%) survived without
		sequelae. There has been a marked increase in the incidence of candidemia in our
		institution that is associated with a high overall mortality. Candidemia lasting
		less than 24 hours was associated with a lower mortality than was that of longer
		duration. Severity of illness and duration of candidemia should be used as
		stratifying factors in prospective studies to determine optimum therapy.

PG	-	997-1003
LID	-	10.3855/jidc.6550 [doi]
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Infection with and antifungal resistance of Candida species have
		been on the rise globally. Relevant data on these pathogens are relatively few in
		"our region, including Lebanon, thus warranting this study. METHODOLOGY: This"
		retrospective study of Candida spp. profiles and their in vitro antifungal
		susceptibility was based on analysis requests for 186 Candida non-albicans and 61
		"C. albicans during three periods (2005-2007, 2009-2011, and 2012-2014) over the"
		span of the last 10 years at the American University of Beirut Medical Center
		"(AUBMC), a major tertiary care center in Lebanon. Identification of Candida was"
		"done using the API 20C AUX system, and the E-test was used to determine the"
		minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of antifungal agents. RESULTS: Among the
		"1,300-1,500 Candida isolates recovered yearly, C. albicans rates decreased from"
		"86% in 2005 to around 60% in 2014. Simultaneously, the non-albicans rates"
		"increased from 14% in 2005 to around 40% in 2014, revealing 11 species, the most"
		"frequent of which were C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, and C. parapsilosis. All these"
		"demonstrated high resistance (35%-79%) against itraconazole, but remained"
		uniformly susceptible (100%) to amphotericin B. Though C. albicans and the other
		"species maintained high susceptibility against fluconazole and voriconazole,"
		"their MIC90 showed an elevated trend over time, and C. glabrata had the highest"
		resistance rates. CONCLUSIONS: The observed rise in resistance among Candida spp.
		in Lebanon mandates the need for close surveillance and monitoring of antifungal
		drug resistance for both epidemiologic and treatment purposes.

LID	-	10.1007/s00134-017-4743-y [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: To assess the risk factors and outcomes associated with fungemia caused
		by the six most commonly occurring Candida species in patients with and without
		malignancies. METHODS: Analysis of the episodes of fungemia due to common Candida
		"species in adults, based on an active hospital-based surveillance program (Paris"
		"area, France, 2002 to 2014). RESULTS: Of the 3417 patients (3666 isolates), 1164"
		(34.1%) had a solid tumor (45.7% digestive tract) and 586 (17.1%) a hematological
		"malignancy (41.8% lymphoma, 33.5% acute leukemia). The hematology patients were"
		"significantly younger, more often pre-exposed to antifungals, more often infected"
		"by C. tropicalis, C. krusei, or C. kefyr, and more often treated in the first"
		instance with an echinocandin. Compared with inpatients who were not in ICU at
		"the time of fungemia, those in ICU were less frequently infected by"
		"C. parapsilosis (p < 0.02), had more recent surgery (p < 0.03), and died more"
		frequently before day 8 and day 30 (p < 0.0001). An increase in crude mortality
		over time in ICU was observed only in oncology patients (p < 0.04). For all
		"patients, lack of prescription of antifungals despite knowledge of positive blood"
		culture increased the risk of death. The odds of being infected by a given
		"Candida species compared with C. albicans were uneven regarding age, gender, type"
		"of malignancy, hospitalization in ICU, central venous catheter, HIV status,"
		"intravenous drug addiction, and previous exposure to antifungal drugs. Compared"
		"with C. albicans, C. glabrata (OR = 0.69 [0.54-0.89]) and C. parapsilosis"
		(OR = 0.49 [0.35-0.67]) were associated with a decreased risk of death by day 8
		and day 30. CONCLUSION: The clinical context of underlying malignancy and
		hospitalization in ICU may be relevant to the initial management of candidemia.

LID	-	10.1111/ggi.12329 [doi]
AB	-	AIM: The present retrospective study was carried out to investigate the
		epidemiological characteristics and the prognostic factors of candidemia among
		"elderly patients. METHODS: From 2009 to 2012, elderly patients with candidemia"
		"were identified at the Chi Mei medical center, a 900-bed regional hospital in"
		"southern Taiwan, and their medical records retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS:"
		"During the 4-year period, a total of 175 episodes of candidemia among elderly"
		patients were identified. The patients ranged in age from 65 to 98 years (mean
		76.4 years) and the mean (±standard deviation) Charlson Comorbidity Index score
		"was 7.6 (±2.7). Cancer was the most common underlying disease (n = 127, 72.6%),"
		"followed by diabetes mellitus (n = 69, 39.4%). Candida albicans (n = 96, 54.9%)"
		"was the most common pathogen, followed by C. tropicalis (n = 39, 22.3%),"
		"C. parapsilosis (n = 24, 13.7%), C. glabrata (n = 22, 12.6%), C. guilliermondii"
		"(n = 2, 1.1%) and Candida species (n = 3, 1.7%). The ratio of C. albicans causing"
		candidemia was significantly higher in young-old than old-old patients (64.1% vs
		"47.4%, P = 0.027). The overall in-hospital mortality was 50.3%. Multivariate"
		analysis showed that the in-hospital mortality was only significantly associated
		"with jaundice (P = 0.004), no use of antifungal agent (P = 0.021) and intensive"
		care unit admission (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Candidemia can develop in elderly
		"patients, especially patients with cancer or other risk factors. C. albicans is"
		"the most common Candida species causing candidemia among elderly patients,"
		followed by C. tropicalis. The mortality of candidemia among elderly patients
		remains high.

TI	-	Change in species distribution and antifungal susceptibility of candidemias in an
		intensive care unit of a university hospital (10-year experience).
PG	-	325-333
LID	-	10.1007/s10096-020-03994-6 [doi]
AB	-	Candidemia is a nosocomial infection mostly found in critically ill patients. Our
		objectives were to evaluate the change in distribution and resistance profile of
		Candida spp. isolated from candidemic patients in our intensive care unit over
		two 5-year periods spanning 15 years and to evaluate the risk factors. Records
		"from the microbiology laboratory were obtained, from January 2004 to December"
		"2008 and from January 2013 to December 2017, retrospectively. Antifungal"
		susceptibility was performed by E-test and evaluated according to EUCAST
		breakpoints. A total of 210 candidemia cases occurred; 238 Candida spp. were
		"isolated in 197 patients (58.8% male; mean age, 59.2 ± 19.6 years). The most"
		predominant risk factor was central venous catheter use. Species distribution
		"rates were 32%, 28%, 17%, and 11% for C. albicans (n = 76), C. parapsilosis"
		"(n = 67), C. glabrata (n = 40), and C. tropicalis (n = 27), respectively."
		Resistance rate to anidulafungin was high in C. parapsilosis over both periods
		and increased to 73% in the second period. Fluconazole showed a remarkable
		decrease for susceptibility in C. parapsilosis (94 to 49%). The prevalence of MDR
		C. parapsilosis (6%/33%) and C. glabrata (0%/44%) increased in the second period.
		"We observed a predominance of non-albicans Candida spp., with C. parapsilosis"
		being the most frequent and C. glabrata infections presenting with the highest
		mortality. High level of echinocandin resistance in C. parapsilosis and
		increasing prevalences of MDR C. parapsilosis and C. glabrata seem emerging
		challenges in our institution.

		(2009-2020) from a tertiary care hospital laboratory in Pakistan.
LID	-	10.1099/jmm.0.001459 [doi]
AB	-	Introduction. Invasive infections with Candida glabrata are a global concern due
		to poor clinical outcomes and propensity to acquire resistance to antifungal
		agents. Hypothesis/Gap Statement. Monitoring emerging resistance and trends in
		"Candida glabrata, an important agent of candidemia in Pakistan, is critical for"
		"patient management; data that is missing from Pakistan. Aim. Thus, this study"
		evaluated antifungal resistance and MICs) distribution in invasive C. glabrata
		isolates from Pakistan. Methods. This cross-sectional and retrospective study was
		conducted from January 2009 to March 2020 at a clinical laboratory in Pakistan
		"that has a nation-wide network. Antifungal susceptibility data of 277 candidemia,"
		deep organ and soft tissue (invasive) C. glabrata sensu lato isolates against
		"fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, anidulafungin, micafungin,"
		caspofungin and amphotericin B was retrieved. Susceptibility testing was
		performed using colorimetric broth microdilution and interpreted using CLSI
		"criteria. Demographics, clinical history and outcome were studied. Chi-square"
		test was used to demonstrate association between antifungal resistance and
		clinical characteristics of the patients. Results. We identified 277 patients
		with invasive C. glabrata infection. Of which 48 (18.4%) isolates were resistant
		"to fluconazole (MIC ≥64 mg l(-1)), one isolate each was resistant to amphotericin"
		"(MIC=2 mg l(-1)), anidulafungin (MIC=1 mg l(-1)) and micafungin"
		(MIC=0.5 mg l(-1)). MIC(90) for fluconazole was 64 mg l(-1) and other triazoles
		"2 mg l(-1), caspofungin 0.12 mg l(-1), anidulafungin 0.06 mg l(-1), micafungin"
		"0.03 mg l(-1) and amphotericin 0.5 mg l(-1). Fluconazole MIC ≥64 mg l(-1),"
		caspofungin MIC >0.06 mg l(-1) and amphotericin MIC >0.25 mg l(-1) (above
		MIC(50)) were significantly associated with patient being alive at the time of
		"reporting, no use of healthcare devices, nor infection with other fungi."
		Fluconazole resistance was significantly associated with prior antifungal use by
		the patient. Conclusion. Surveillance data of antifungal resistance among common
		Candida species should be monitored closely for identification of resistant
		strains.

AB	-	The surveillance and analysis of candidemia risk factors are necessary to reduce
		treatment failures in cancer patients. By understanding the geographic
		distribution of Candida spp. and their in vitro minimal antifungal inhibitory
		"concentrations in cancer patients, optimal treatment protocols may be developed."
		On reviewing the candidemia data of cancer patients in Tianjin Medical University
		"Cancer Institute and Hospital (TMUCIH), we found that the incidence rate was"
		"0.34-0.53 cases per 1,000 admissions from 2008-2010, and the crude mortality was"
		"31.7% during 2006-2010. Candida albicans was the most common species (48.8%),"
		"followed by C. parapsilosis (24.4%), C. glabrata (9.8%), C. tropicalis (9.8%), C."
		"lusitaniae (4.9%), and C. famata (2.3%). All species were susceptible to azoles"
		and showed low MICs to amphotericin B. Surgery was an independent risk factor in
		"candidemia caused by C. albicans. Furthermore, among all cancer patients, those"
		with digestive system neoplasms were most likely to develop candidemia. In
		"addition, cancer patients with metastasis to distant organs were significantly"
		more prone to non-C. albicans Candida infection. This study provided data on the
		epidemiology of candidemia in cancer patients in North China which may be of
		value in such individuals with yeast infections.

AB	-	This study reviews data on patients with fungemia and confirms the high
		prevalence (50%) of infections caused by non-albicans species of Candida.
		Fungemia due to C. albicans or Torulopsis glabrata occurred significantly more
		"often in patients with a solid tumor, while fungemia due to Candida tropicalis or"
		Candida krusei was significantly more common in patients with hematologic
		"malignancy (P = .001). For 31% of patients, only a single blood culture was"
		"positive for yeasts, and the prognosis for these patients was not significantly"
		different than that for patients with three or more positive blood cultures (P =
		"1), including those who had C. albicans fungemia. The overall mortality rate was"
		"41.8%, which is much lower than that previously reported in studies of patients"
		with cancer. No significant difference was observed between patients treated with
		amphotericin B and those treated with fluconazole in this retrospective analysis.
		Although no significant difference was observed in the mortality rate among
		"patients who had fungemia with or without neutropenia, the incidence of"
		disseminated candidiasis was significantly higher among neutropenic patients (P =
		.03).

AB	-	BACKGROUND: The outcomes of deep-seated abscesses attributed to chronic
		disseminated candidiasis (CDC) in patients with hematological malignancies have
		rarely been reported in recent years. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed and
		analyzed the data of patients with hematological malignancies who received a
		diagnosis of CDC at a medical center in Taiwan between 2008 and 2013. RESULTS:
		Sixty-one patients (32 men and 29 women) were diagnosed with CDC. The median age
		was 51 years (range: 18-83). The overall incidence of CDC was 1.53 per 100
		patient-years in patients with hematological malignancies between 2008 and 2013.
		The highest incidence of CDC was 4.3 per 100 patient-years for acute
		"lymphoblastic leukemia, followed by 3.6 for acute myeloid leukemia. We detected 3"
		"(4.9%) proven, 13 (21.3%) probable, and 45 (73.8%) possible cases of CDC. A total"
		of 13 patients had positive blood cultures for Candida species: C. tropicalis
		"(8), C. albicans (2), C. glabrata (2), and C. famata (1). The median duration of"
		antifungal treatment was 96 days (range: 7-796 days). Serial imaging studies
		revealed that the resolution rate of CDC was 30.0% at 3 months and 54.3% at
		6 months. Five patients (8.2%) had residual lesions that persisted beyond one
		year. A multivariate analysis of the 90-day outcome revealed that shock was the
		only independent prognostic factor of 90-day survival in patients with CDC.
		CONCLUSION: The incidence of CDC did not decrease between 2008 and 2013. Patients
		with acute leukemia had a higher risk of CDC than those with other hematological
		malignancies. Imaging studies conducted at 6 months after diagnosis revealed that
		only half of the patients showed complete resolution. CDC requires prolonged
		"treatment, and serial imaging at 6 months interval is suggested. Shock is the"
		only independent prognostic factor of 90-day survival in patients with CDC.

TI	-	Risk factors predicting Candida infective endocarditis in patients with
		candidemia.
PG	-	593-599
LID	-	10.1093/mmy/myz104 [doi]
AB	-	Candida infective endocarditis (CIE) is a rare but serious complication of
		candidemia. Incidence and risk factors associated with CIE among candidemic
		patients are poorly defined from small cohorts. Identification of clinical
		predictors associated with this entity may guide more judicious use of cardiac
		imaging. We conducted a retrospective analysis of all inpatients aged ≥18 years
		diagnosed with candidemia at our institution. CIE was diagnosed by fulfilling two
		of the major Duke criteria: specifically a vegetation(s) on echocardiogram and
		positive blood cultures for Candida spp. We used univariable and multivariable
		"regression analyses to identify risk factors associated with CIE. Of 1,873"
		"patients with candidemia, 47 (2.5%) were identified to have CIE. In our"
		"multivariable logistic model, existing valvular heart disease was associated with"
		"a higher risk for CIE (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 7.66; 95% confidence interval"
		"[CI], 2.95-19.84). Predictors that demonstrated a decreased risk of CIE included"
		"infection with C. glabrata (aOR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.04-0.69), hematologic malignancy"
		"(aOR, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.01-0.68), and receipt of total parenteral nutrition (aOR,"
		"0.38; 95% CI, 0.16-0.91). The 90-day crude mortality for CIE was 48.9%, similar"
		to the overall non-CIE mortality of 41.9% (P = .338). We identified a set of
		clinical factors that can predict the presence of CIE among patient with
		candidemia. These findings may reduce the need for unnecessary expensive and
		invasive imaging studies in a subset of patients with a lower risk profile for
		endocarditis and alternative infection source.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: There are no current national estimates of the candidaemia burden in
		"China, and epidemiological candidaemia data from the underdeveloped region of"
		China are lacking. METHODS: A 7-year retrospective study was carried out to
		"analyse the prevalence, species distribution, antifungal susceptibility, risk"
		factors and inpatient mortality of candidaemia among paediatric and adult
		patients in a regional tertiary teaching hospital in China. RESULTS: During the
		"seven-year study period, a total of 201 inpatients with candidaemia were"
		"identified. The median age of the patients was 65 years (range, 1 day to"
		"92 years), and 114 of the patients (56.7%) were male. The mean annual incidence"
		of candidaemia was 0.26 cases per 1000 admissions (0.42 cases per 1000 paediatric
		"admissions vs 0.24 cases per 1000 adult admissions, P < 0.05). Candida albicans"
		"was the most common fungal species (81/201, 40.3%) in all patients, Candida"
		"glabrata was the most common fungal species (18/35, 51.4%) in paediatric"
		patients. Most isolates were susceptible to flucytosine (99.0%) and amphotericin
		"B (99.0%), and the activity of antifungal agents against Candida species was no"
		significant difference in satisfaction between paediatric and adult patients
		(P > 0.05). The all-cause mortality rate was 20.4% (paediatric patients: 11.4% vs
		"adult patients:22.3%, P > 0.05). Fewer univariate predictors of poor outcomes"
		were identified for paediatric patients than for adult patients (4 vs 11
		predictors). Respiratory dysfunction and septic shock were independent predictors
		of 30-day mortality for all patients. CONCLUSIONS: The epidemiological data of
		candidaemia in paediatric and adult patients are only different in the
		distributions of Candida species and the mean annual incidence of candidaemia.
		Flucytosine and amphotericin B can be used as first-choice agents when no
		antifungal susceptibility test results are available.

AB	-	PURPOSE: This study examined the prevalence of Candida species in the saliva of
		oral squamous cell carcinoma patients and its effect on the mortality rate.
		MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred patients with oral cavity squamous cell
		carcinoma undergoing protocol treatment at Helsinki University Hospital were
		"recruited into the study from March 2011 through 2014. For comparison, 75"
		age-matched controls with no current or previously treated oral cancer were
		recruited. Paraffin-stimulated whole saliva samples were collected and cultivated
		"on CHROMagar Candida medium (CHROMagar, Paris, France) to establish possible"
		"Candida growth. The API ID 32C yeast identification kit (bioMérieux, Lyon,"
		"France) and Bichro-Dubli Fumouze latex agglutination test (Fumouze Diagnostics,"
		"Levallois-Perret, France) were used for further identification of different"
		Candida species. Patients' medical records were studied for information on their
		"health habits and general health status, as well as tumor-related data. The"
		patients' status regarding being alive and cancer free was checked at a follow-up
		point in December 2017. Descriptive statistics and cross tabulation were carried
		"out, and the P value was set at .05. RESULTS: Candida species were detected in"
		"74% of the oral cancer patients' samples, with C. albicans being the most common"
		"species (84%). Other species identified were C. dubliniensis (8%), C. tropicalis"
		"(4%), C. glabrata (3%), C. parapsilosis (3%), C. sake (3%), C. krusei (1%), and"
		"C. guilliermondii (1%). After the follow-up period, 63% of the patients were"
		alive and 86% of them were cancer free. Harboring Candida species in the saliva
		was not associated with any increase in the mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS: C.
		albicans was common in the oral cavity of the oral squamous cell carcinoma
		"patients. However, in this patient population, we did not observe a statistically"
		significant effect of the yeast on the mortality rate.

TI	-	Antifungal susceptibility of invasive Candida bloodstream isolates from the
		Asia-Pacific region.

LID	-	10.1093/mmy/myv114 [doi]
AB	-	Bloodstream infections caused by Candida species are of increasing importance and
		associated with significant mortality. We performed a multi-centre prospective
		observational study to identify the species and antifungal susceptibilities of
		invasive bloodstream isolates of Candida species in the Asia-Pacific region. The
		"study was carried out over a two year period, involving 13 centers from Brunei,"
		"Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam."
		"Identification of Candida species was performed at each study center, and"
		reconfirmed at a central laboratory. Susceptibility testing was performed using a
		"commercial broth dilution panel (Sensititre YeastOne YST-010, Thermofisher,"
		"United Kingdom) with susceptibility categorisation (S = susceptible, S-DD ="
		susceptible dose-dependent) applied using breakpoints from the Clinical
		Laboratory Standards Institute. Eight hundred and sixty-one Candida isolates were
		"included in the study. The most common species were C. albicans (35.9%),"
		"C. tropicalis (30.7%), C. parapsilosis (15.7%), and C. glabrata (13.6%)."
		Non-albicans species exceeded C. albicans species in centers from all countries
		except Taiwan. Fluconazole susceptibility was almost universal for C. albicans
		"(S = 99.7%) but lower for C. tropicalis (S = 75.8%, S-DD = 6.1%), C. glabrata"
		"(S-DD = 94.9%), and C. parapsilosis (S = 94.8%). Echinocandins demonstrated high"
		"rates of in vitro susceptibility (S>99%) against C. albicans, C. tropicalis, and"
		C. parapsilosis This study demonstrates that non-albicans species are the most
		common isolates from bloodstream infections in most countries in the Asia-Pacific
		"region, with C. tropicalis as the predominant species. Because of the prevalence"
		"of reduced susceptibility to fluconazole in non-albicans species, the study"
		indicates that echinocandins should be the antifungal of choice in clinically
		unstable or high-risk patients with documented candidemia.

AB	-	AIM: The study of candidemia in cancer patients has been limited. This
		retrospective study aims to investigate the epidemiologic characteristics and
		prognostic factors of candidemia among cancer patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
		"From 2009 to 2012, cancer patients with candidemia were identified at a hospital"
		in Taiwan. The medical records of all patients with bloodstream infections due to
		Candida species were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: During the four-year
		"period, a total of 242 episodes of candidemia were identified among cancer"
		"patients. Half of these patients were classified as elderly (≥65 years old), and"
		more than 95% of the candidemia episodes were classified as healthcare-associated
		"infections. Among the 242 cancer patients with candidemia, head and neck cancer"
		"was the most common, followed by gastrointestinal tract and lung cancer."
		"Additionally, most of the patients had variable underlying conditions, such as"
		the presence of CVC (99%) or prior exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics (93%)
		"and were receiving an immunosuppressant (86%). Overall, C. albicans (n = 132,"
		"54.5%) was the most common pathogen, followed by C. tropicalis (n = 52, 21.5%),"
		"C. parapsilosis (n = 38, 15.7%), and C. glabrata (n = 29, 12.0%). Seventeen"
		"patients had polycandidal candidemia, and 77 patients had concomitant bacteremia."
		Approximately one-third of the patients required admission to the intensive care
		"unit (ICU) or mechanical ventilation, and the overall in-hospital mortality was"
		50.8%. Multivariable analysis showed that the in-hospital mortality was
		significantly associated with only the non-use of antifungal agents and acute
		respiratory failure (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Candidemia can develop in patients
		"with both solid cancer and hematological malignancy, especially for patients with"
		"underlying conditions. Overall, the associated morbidity and mortality due to"
		Candidemia remain high. It was also determined that the non-use of antifungal
		agents and acute respiratory failure conditions were associated with in-hospital
		mortality.

AB	-	Candida albicans is the most frequently isolated yeast from the oral cavity of
		HIV/AIDS individuals. The use of fluconazole has increased the number of
		resistant or less-sensitive Candida species different than C. albicans. The
		purpose of this study was to identify the Candida species producing
		"pseudomembranous candidiasis in patients suffering from AIDS, their relationship"
		with CD4(+) counts and their sensitivity to fluconazole and itraconazole. We
		studied 71 patients at a hospital in the city of Cali. Samples of white plaque
		"were seeded on CHROMagar Candida, yeast identification was done with API 20C Aux,"
		and susceptibility testing was determined by E test. Ninety-three yeast isolates
		"were obtained, 52 single and 41 mixed. C. albicans was the most isolated,"
		followed by C. glabrata. An increased frequency of isolates and variety of
		Candida species occurred in patients with a CD4(+) cell count ≤100 cells/mm(3)
		without significant differences (p = 0.29). The susceptibility study showed that
		"8 (8.6%) isolates were resistant to fluconazole and 11 (11.8%) to itraconazole,"
		while 6 (8.8%) C. albicans were simultaneously resistant. No association was
		found between the isolates of C. albicans or Candida species different than C.
		albicans and the use of fluconazole (p = 0.21). The results of this study
		"indicate that in the tested population, fluconazole continues to be the best"
		treatment option for oropharyngeal candidiasis in patients suffering from AIDS
		"(HIV/AIDS); however, susceptibility tests are necessary in patients who present"
		therapeutic failure.

AB	-	Candida blood steam infection is a life-threatening disease that seems to be
		under estimated. Understanding epidemiology of such disease is crucial for
		"improved diagnosis, optimized treatment, and better outcome. Through this"
		"retrospective study, we aimed to determine the incidence of candidemia in a"
		"secondary care hospital, and to describe the epidemiology and outcome of"
		candidemia among adult patients. The incidence of candidemia for all age groups
		"was 0.24, 0.16 and 0.15 cases/1000 patient-days in 2014, 2015 and 2016"
		"respectively. Among adult patients, 82 cases were identified. The patients had"
		"the following clinical characteristics with varying proportions: old age,"
		"diabetes, antibiotic exposure, use of vascular catheter, abdominal surgery, ICU"
		"hospitalization, haemodialysis, and total parenteral nutrition. All-cause 30-day"
		mortality was 54% and ICU hospitalization was a recognized risk factor for death.
		"The leading causative agents were Candida albicans (32%), and Candida"
		"parapsilosis (32%), followed by Candida tropicalis (20%), Candida glabrata (13%)"
		"and one each by Candida dubliniensis, Candida famata, and Candida auris. Almost"
		all tested isolates were susceptible to caspofungin and amphotericin B. With
		"regard to fluconazole, C. glabrata showed variable susceptibility. Other species"
		"were susceptible except one isolate, each of C. parapsilosis and C. auris. The"
		study highlights the growing importance of non-C. albicans Candida species in the
		etiology of candidemia. Emergence of C. auris is a warning sign and needs to be
		closely monitored.

AB	-	Candidemia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing
		hemodialysis but it has not been well defined in this patient population. We
		"performed a retrospective case-control study to characterize the epidemiology,"
		"microbiology, and outcomes of hemodialysis-associated candidemia. All cases of"
		candidemia at our institution were evaluated from 1 January 2000 until 1
		"September 2004. For each case, two non-candidemic dialysis patients served as"
		"controls. Among 350 cases of candidemia, 78 (22%) occurred in adult hemodialysis"
		"patients. Cases and controls were similar with respect to age, corticosteroid,"
		"antibiotics use, prevalence of diabetes mellitus, liver cirrhosis, surgical"
		"procedures, and cancer. Multivariate analysis found total parenteral nutrition"
		(TPN) (19.5% vs. 1.3%; P<0.0001) and dialysis through a vascular catheter (74%
		vs. 46.8%; P=0.0001) to be independently associated with candidemia.
		Non-C.albicans Candida spp. particularly C. glabrata and C. krusei were more
		common in hemodialysis recipients than in candidemic patients not receiving
		hemodialysis (31% vs. 17% p = 0.009). In-hospital mortality was significantly
		elevated for candidemic vs. non-candidemic hemodialysis recipients (51.9% vs.
		7.8%; P<0.0001). Candidemia in hemodialysis recipients is frequently caused by
		"non-C. albicansCandida species, is associated with TPN and dialysis via a"
		vascular catheter (vs. shunt or fistula) and carries a high mortality rate.

TI	-	Candidaemia in polish hospitals - a multicentre survey.
PG	-	576-81
LID	-	10.1111/myc.12077 [doi]
AB	-	Significant changes in the frequency of candidaemia and the distribution of
		causative species have been noted worldwide in the last two decades. In this
		"study, we present the results of the first multicentre survey of fungaemia in"
		Polish hospitals. A total of 302 candidaemia episodes in 294 patients were
		identified in 20 hospitals during a 2-year period. The highest number of
		"infections was found in intensive care (30.8%) and surgical (29.5%) units,"
		"followed by haematological (15.9%), 'others' (19.2%) and neonatological (4.6%)"
		units. Candida albicans was isolated from 50.96% of episodes; its prevalence was
		"higher in intensive care unit and neonatology (61.22% and 73.33%, respectively),"
		and significantly lower in haematology (22%; P < 0.001). The frequency of C.
		krusei and C. tropicalis was significantly higher (24% and 18%) in haematology
		"(P < 0.02); whereas, the distribution of C. glabrata (14.1%) and C. parapsilosis"
		(13.1%) did not possess statistically significant differences between compared
		departments. Obtained data indicates that species distribution of Candida blood
		"isolates in Polish hospitals reflects worldwide trends, particularly a decrease"
		in the prevalence of infections due to C. albicans.

TI	-	Epidemiology and predictors of mortality in cases of Candida bloodstream
		"infection: results from population-based surveillance, barcelona, Spain, from"
		2002 to 2003.
PG	-	1829-35
AB	-	We conducted population-based surveillance for Candida bloodstream infections in
		"Spain to determine its incidence, the extent of antifungal resistance, and risk"
		factors for mortality. A case was defined as the first positive blood culture for
		"any Candida spp. in a resident of Barcelona, from 1 January 2002 to 31 December"
		2003. We defined early mortality as occurring between days 3 to 7 after
		candidemia and late mortality as occurring between days 8 to 30. We detected 345
		"cases of candidemia, for an average annual incidence of 4.3 cases/100,000"
		"population, 0.53 cases/1,000 hospital discharges, and 0.73 cases/10,000"
		"patient-days. Outpatients comprised 11% of the cases, and 89% had a central"
		venous catheter (CVC) at diagnosis. Overall mortality was 44%. Candida albicans
		"was the most frequent species (51% of cases), followed by Candida parapsilosis"
		"(23%), Candida tropicalis (10%), Candida glabrata (8%), Candida krusei (4%), and"
		other species (3%). Twenty-four isolates (7%) had decreased susceptibility to
		"fluconazole (MIC > or = 16 microg/ml). On multivariable analysis, early death was"
		"independently associated with hematological malignancy (odds ratio [OR], 3.5; 95%"
		"confidence interval [CI], 1.1 to 10.4). Treatment with antifungals (OR, 0.05; 95%"
		"CI, 0.01 to 0.2) and removal of CVCs (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1 to 0.9) were"
		"protective factors for early death. Receiving adequate treatment, defined as"
		"having CVCs removed and administration of an antifungal medication (OR, 0.2; 95%"
		"CI, 0.08 to 0.8), was associated with lower odds of late mortality; intubation"
		"(OR, 7.5; 95% CI, 2.6 to 21.1) was associated with higher odds. The incidence of"
		candidemia and prevalence of fluconazole resistance are similar to other European
		"countries, indicating that routine antifungal susceptibility testing is not"
		warranted. Antifungal medication and catheter removal are critical in preventing
		mortality.

AB	-	Surveillance of candidemia is essential to monitor trends in species distribution
		"and change in the incidence and antifungal resistance. In this study, we aimed to"
		"investigate prevalence, resistance rates, antifungal utilization and costs. A"
		6-year retrospective analysis of the data belonging to patients with candidemia
		hospitalized between 2010 and 2016 was performed. The annual usage of fluconazole
		and caspofungin and the usage of these antifungals in different units were
		"described in defined daily doses (DDD) per 1000 patient days. In total, 351"
		patients of candidemia were included. Median age of the patients was 45 (0-88)
		"and 55.1% of them were male. Overall, 48.1% of the candidemia episodes (169/351)"
		"were due to C. albicans, followed by C. parapsilosis (25.1%), C. glabrata"
		(11.7%). Length of hospital stay was longer with a median of 20 days among
		patients with non-albicans candidemia. Presence of a central venous catheter was
		found to be an associated risk for candidemia caused by non-albicans strains.
		Annual incidence of candidemia increased from 0.10 to 0.30 cases/1000 patient
		days. Antifungal use was increased over years correlated with the cost paid for
		it. The policy against candidemia should be specified by each institution with
		"respect to candidemia prevalence, resistance rates, antifungal use and costs."

		Refractory Invasive Candidiasis in a Liver Transplant Recipient: A Case Report
		and Literature Review.
PG	-	113-120
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-021-00599-1 [doi]
AB	-	Invasive fungal infections in liver transplant recipients are associated with
		elevated morbidity and mortality and pose a challenge to the treating physicians.
		"Despite of lacking clinical data, the use of antifungal combination therapy is"
		often considered to improve response rates in an immunocompromised patient
		population. We herein report a case of refractory invasive candidiasis in a liver
		transplant recipient treated successfully with a combination of isavuconazole und
		high-dose liposomal amphotericin B. The antimycotic combination treatment was
		able to clear a bloodstream infection with C. glabrata and led to regression of
		bilomas among tolerable side effects. The use of the above-mentioned antifungal
		combination therapy in a liver transplant recipient has not been reported
		previously. This case highlights the efficacy and safety of antifungal
		combination therapy in immunocompromised patients with refractory invasive
		candidiasis.

PG	-	1328-35
LID	-	10.1017/S0950268809991531 [doi]
AB	-	The incidence of nosocomial candidaemia was evaluated in a retrospective study in
		"a Turkish tertiary-care hospital. Over a 12-year period (1996-2007), a total of"
		"743 episodes of candidaemia occurred in 743 patients, accounting for an average"
		incidence of 1.9 episodes/1000 admissions and 2.9 episodes/10 000 patient-days
		per year. The annual incidence was almost constant during the study period except
		for 1996 when it was significantly higher in comparison with other years
		"(P<0.05). The most common species isolated was Candida albicans (45%), followed"
		"by C. parapsilosis (26%), C. tropicalis (7%), C. krusei (7%), and C. glabrata"
		(3.5%). A significant increase in C. albicans isolates causing candidaemia linked
		to a decrease in C. parapsilosis isolates in adult patients and C. krusei
		isolates in children was found between the two 6-year study periods. This trend
		reflects improved infection control at Uludağ University Hospital. Ninety percent
		of isolates were susceptible to fluconazole (8 microg/ml) and resistance was
		found only in C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis isolates. Regular local
		surveillance of Candida spp. is important in order to develop empirical treatment
		protocols to reduce the incidence and mortality of candidaemia.

AB	-	Candidemia has been considered a persistent public health problem with great
		impact on hospital costs and high mortality. We aimed to evaluate the
		epidemiology and prognostic factors of candidemia in a tertiary hospital in
		Northeast Brazil from January 2011 to December 2016. Demographic and clinical
		data of patients were retrospectively obtained from medical records and
		antifungal susceptibility profiling was performed using the broth microdilution
		method. A total of 68 episodes of candidemia were evaluated. We found an average
		incidence of 2.23 episodes /1000 admissions and a 30-day mortality rate of 55.9%.
		"The most prevalent species were Candida albicans (35.3%), Candida tropicalis"
		"(27.4%), Candida parapsilosis (21.6%) and Candida glabrata (11.8%). Higher"
		mortality rates were observed in cases of candidemia due to C. albicans (61.1%)
		"and C. glabrata (100%), especially when compared to C. parapsilosis (27.3%)."
		Univariate analysis revealed some variables which significantly increased the
		"probability of death: older age (P = 0.022; odds ratio [OR] = 1.041), severe"
		"sepsis (P < 0.001; OR = 8.571), septic shock (P = 0.035; OR = 3.792), hypotension"
		"(P = 0.003; OR = 9.120), neutrophilia (P = 0.046; OR = 3.080), thrombocytopenia"
		"(P = 0.002; OR = 6.800), mechanical ventilation (P = 0.009; OR = 8.167) and"
		greater number of surgeries (P = 0.037; OR = 1.920). Multivariate analysis showed
		"that older age (P = 0.040; OR = 1.055), severe sepsis (P = 0.009; OR = 9.872) and"
		hypotension (P = 0.031; OR = 21.042) were independently associated with worse
		"prognosis. There was no resistance to amphotericin B, micafungin or itraconazole"
		"and a low rate of resistance to fluconazole (5.1%). However, 20.5% of the Candida"
		isolates were susceptible dose-dependent (SDD) to fluconazole and 7.7% to
		"itraconazole. In conclusion, our results could assist in the adoption of"
		strategies to stratify patients at higher risk for developing candidemia and
		"worse prognosis, in addition to improve antifungal management."

AB	-	The aims of this study were to establish the incidence of invasive candidiasis
		"(IC) in a Beijing hospital, to identify risk factors associated with IC caused by"
		"non-C. albicans Candida (NAC), and to determine risk factors for infection caused"
		by NAC species not susceptible to fluconazole. Clinical data from 141 patients
		admitted to Beijing Chaoyang Hospital (from 2001-2010) diagnosed with IC were
		retrospectively analyzed. The incidence of IC increased during the 10-year
		"period, but the proportion due to NAC did not change significantly in that of 141"
		"cases, 55 (39%) were due to NAC and 86 (61%) to C. albicans (CA). The NAC species"
		"isolated included C. tropicalis (25 of 141, 18%), C. glabrata (14 of 141, 9.9%),"
		"C. parapsilosis (eight of 141, 5.7%), C. krusei (three of 141, 2.1%) and C."
		"lusitaniae (one of 141, 0.71%); other Candida species accounted for four of the"
		141 cases (2.8%). Twenty-one isolates (38%) of NAC were not susceptible to
		fluconazole. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) (OR 4.2; 95% CI 3.5-58; P < 0.001)
		and previous fluconazole therapy (OR 7.7; 95% CI 2.2-27; P = 0.001) were risk
		"factors for invasive NAC candidiasis, whereas patient age ≥65 years (OR 0.37; CI"
		0.16-0.88; P = 0.025) and invasive mechanical ventilation (OR 0.22; CI
		0.069-0.70; P =0.010) were connected with invasive CA candidiasis. Prior
		fluconazole therapy was a risk factor (P = 0.007) for infections caused by NAC
		"not susceptible to fluconazole. In conclusion, TPN and prior fluconazole therapy"
		"are independent risk factors for NAC infection, while prior fluconazole therapy"
		is a risk factor for infection due to NAC not susceptible to fluconazole.

PG	-	284-7
LID	-	10.1177/0897190014568387 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To report a case of Candida glabrata and tropicalis pneumonia in an
		immunocompetent patient. CASE SUMMARY: A 72-year-old male was transferred from an
		"outside institution due to worsening respiratory status, acute kidney injury"
		"secondary to intravenous contrast media, sepsis, and pneumonia with fever and"
		"leukocytosis. Upon admission, he was initiated on treatment for hospital-acquired"
		"pneumonia, but was also concomitantly tested for many other opportunistic"
		infections due to his recent month-long trip to Ecuador where he participated in
		a tribal treatment for neuropathy that involved direct exposure to dead guinea
		"pigs. With completion of cultures and bronchoalveolar lavage, C. glabrata was"
		identified in the blood culture and C. glabrata and C. tropicalis in the
		"bronchoalveolar lavage specimen. One month later, he was admitted due to"
		recurrent pneumonia. The patient unfortunately expired during the second
		"admission, due to complications from chronic respiratory pulmonary disease and"
		"pneumonia. DISCUSSION: Initially, this patient was treated for hospital-acquired"
		"pneumonia, but due to a recent trip to Ecuador, it was soon discovered that this"
		patient had developed an invasive Candida pneumonia. His pulmonary biopsies
		"showed growth of invasive C. glabrata and C. tropicalis, while his blood culture"
		showed C. glabrata. Candida-related lower respiratory tract infections are
		exceptionally rare in immunocompetent patients and require histopathologic
		evidence to confirm the diagnosis. A second blood culture showed that the C.
		"glabrata was still present and the patient had worsening leukocytosis, so"
		micafungin was added to his antimicrobial therapy. CONCLUSION: It is understood
		that pneumonia is rarely caused by Candida species in patients who are admitted
		"to the hospital. However, health care professionals should be aware that Candida"
		pneumonia should be suspected as part of the differential diagnosis even in
		"immunocompetent patients, particularly if they have recently traveled outside the"
		United States.

		as a guide for implementation of T2MR (T2CANDIDA®) for rapid diagnosis of
		candidemia.
PG	-	350-354
LID	-	10.1093/mmy/myaa056 [doi]
AB	-	The aim of this work was to study the epidemiology of candidemia in our hospital
		in order to determine whether the T2MR system might be a useful tool for early
		diagnosis of candidemia in selected units. We perform a retrospective review of
		all candidemia episodes registered in the last 12 years in selected units of our
		hospital in adult and pediatric patients. Candida species and antifungal
		"susceptibility patterns were registered. A total of 686 isolates were registered,"
		of which 625 were infections due to the five most common species of Candida. C.
		albicans (45.6%) and C. parapsilosis (33.1%) were the predominant species found
		in our institution. In adults these species were closely followed by C. glabrata
		(12-21%) in all units. While in pediatric medical and intensive care units
		"(PICU), these species were followed by other uncommon yeasts. Resistance rates to"
		triazoles were low in C. albicans and C. parapsilosis. In C. glabrata and C.
		tropicalis the resistance rates to fluconazole ranged from 10.86 to 6.67%.
		Resistance rates for echinocandins were very low and all strains were susceptible
		to amphotericin B. T2Candida® might be useful to guide antifungal targeted
		treatment and discontinuation of antifungal empirical treatment in those units
		where the five most common Candida species represent more than the ninety percent
		of the isolates. The selection of medical and surgical units should be based on
		local epidemiology and antifungal susceptibility patterns. Incidence should be
		taken into account in order to make clinical decisions based on negative results.
		LAY ABSTRACT: T2Candida® might be useful selectively in clinical units according
		"to their local epidemiology, antifungal resistance patterns, and incidence of"
		candidemia. It optimizes the clinical value of positive results supporting
		decisions about targeted therapies or discontinuations based on negative results.

		surgical patients in Shenyang from 2012 to 2018. METHODS: We designed a
		retrospective observational study of adult patients with candidemia in a teaching
		hospital including three hospital campuses. Data regarding clinical and
		demographic characteristics were collected from the patient's medical records.
		"RESULTS: Of the 236 cases of candidemia, 172 (72.9%) were identified in surgical"
		"patients, including 146 (84.9%) general surgeries, 11 (6.4%) urologic surgeries,"
		"6 (3.5%) thoracic surgeries, and others. Higher proportions of solid tumors,"
		"total parenteral nutrition, the presence of a urinary catheter, and the presence"
		of a gastric tube were observed in surgical patients with candidemia versus
		"non-surgical ones, whereas the percentages of hematological malignancy, diabetes"
		"mellitus, and renal replacement therapy were relatively lower in surgical"
		"patients. Renal failure, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia were less common"
		laboratory findings in surgical patients with candidemia than compared to
		"non-surgical ones. Among surgical patients with candidemia, Candida parapsilosis"
		"was the predominant species (43%), followed by C. albicans (33.7%), C. glabrata"
		"(11%), C. tropicalis (8.1%), and others (4.1%). Overall susceptibility,"
		"susceptible dose dependent or intermediate susceptibility, and resistance to"
		"fluconazole were detected in 73.3, 19.8, and 3.5% Candida isolates from surgical"
		"patients, respectively, but no resistance to amphotericin B was observed."
		"Overall, the 30-day mortality in surgical patients was 19.2%. At multivariable"
		"analysis, independent risk factors for death in surgical patients with candidemia"
		"were ICU stay, thrombocytopenia, and C. albicans infection. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical"
		patients account for the majority of candidemia cases. Among patients with recent
		"surgery, risk factors for species distribution, antifungal sensitivity patterns"
		"of Candida isolates causing candidemia, and independent risk factors for"
		mortality should be evaluated and considered for a better outcome in the
		antifungal treatment.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Oral candidiasis is one of the most common opportunistic infection
		in HIV/AIDS patient and it is caused by Candida species. The low absolute
		CD4+T-lymphocyte count has traditionally been cited as the greatest risk factor
		for the development of Oral Candidiasis. The aim of this study was to identify
		"Candida species isolated from the oral cavity of HIV/AIDS patients, to determine"
		their in vitro antifungal susceptibility and to investigate the possible risk
		factors associated with oral candidiasis. METHODS: This was a hospital based
		cross sectional study that was carried out for a period of 3 months amongst
		"HIV/AIDS patients in Kumba District Hospital, whether on HAART or not. Mouth"
		swabs were collected from 378 participants using sterile cotton wool swabs and
		5ml venous blood were collected for determination of CD4 cell. Candida species
		were isolated and identified. Antifungal sensitivity testing was performed using
		modified kirby-bauer susceptibility testing technique. RESULTS: Candida species
		were present in 42.86% of the samples and Candida albicans was the most prevalent
		"(60.2%) amongst the six Candida isolates identified, followed by Candida glabrata"
		"(16.9%), Candida krusei (12.3%), Candida tropicalis (6.4%), Candida parapsilosis"
		"(2.3%) and Candida pseudotropicalis (1.8%). Pregnancy, oral hygiene and"
		antibiotic usage were significantly associated with oral candidiasis in HIV/AIDS
		patients (P<0.05). Oral candidiasis was mostly frequent in HIV/AIDS patients
		between 21-40 years. A CD4 cell count less than 200 cells/μl was a significant
		risk factor for acquiring oral candidiasis in HIV/AIDS patients (P<0.001).
		Nystatin was the most sensitive drug (83.6%) meanwhile ketonazole was the most
		"resistant drug (29.2%), followed by fluconazole (24.6%) to all oral Candida"
		isolates. CONCLUSION: Oral Candida colonization occurs more frequently in
		HIV/AIDS patients and the is a need for the government to implement regular
		"checks for opportunistic infections in HIV/AIDS patients, including oral"
		candidiasis in HIV/AIDS patients to monitor disease progression and prevent
		subsequent complications such as candidemia and diarrhea.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Fungal bloodstream infections (FBI) among intensive care unit (ICU)
		patients are increasing. Our objective was to characterize the fungal pathogens
		that cause bloodstream infections and determine the epidemiology and risk factors
		"for patient mortality among ICU patients in Meizhou, China. METHODS: Eighty-one"
		ICU patients with FBI during their stays were included in the study conducted
		from January 2008 to December 2017. Blood cultures were performed and the
		antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of the resulting isolates were determined.
		Logistic multiple regression and ROC curve analysis were used to assess the risk
		factors for mortality among the cases. RESULTS: The prevalence of FBI in ICU
		"patients was 0.38% (81/21,098) with a mortality rate of 36% (29/81). Ninety-eight"
		"strains of bloodstream-infecting fungi, mainly Candida spp., were identified from"
		these patients. Candida albicans was most common (43%). Two strains of C.
		"parapsilosis were no-sensitive to caspofungin, C. glabrata were less than 80%"
		"sensitive to azole drugs. Logistic multiple regression showed that age, serum"
		"albumin, APACHE II score, three or more underlying diseases, and length of stay"
		in ICU were independent risk factors for mortality in FBI. ROC curve analysis
		showed that APACHE II scores > 19 and serum albumin ≤25 g/L were the best
		predictors of mortality. CONCLUSION: Candida spp. predominated with high
		"mortality rates among cases of FBI in ICU. Thus, clinical staff should enhance"
		overall patient monitoring and concurrently monitor fungal susceptibility to
		reduce mortality rates.

		"Ruijin University Hospital were enrolled. Underlying diseases, clinical severity,"
		"species distribution, antifungal therapy and its impact on the outcome were"
		"analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 121 episodes of Candida BSI were identified, with"
		"an incidence of 0.32 episodes/1,000 admissions (0.21 in 2008 and 0.42 in 2012)"

		with Lower Reproductive Tract Infections in Women from Southern
		Poland-Retrospective Laboratory-Based Study.
LID	-	10.3390/ijerph18010335 [doi]
LID	-	335
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: Female infections affecting the genital tract include sexually
		"transmitted diseases, endogenous infections such as vulvovaginal candidiasis,"
		bacterial vaginosis (BV) or aerobic vaginitis (AV) and healthcare-associated
		infections. The aim of the study was to analyze the etiological factors of the
		"vaginal dysbacteriosis, and the antimicrobial susceptibility of the dominant"
		bacterial and fungal infections in different age groups of outpatient women from
		the Silesian Region. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective laboratory-based
		multi-center study encompassed 4994 women of different ages in Silesian
		"Voivodeship, in the south of Poland; patients who had vaginal swabs collected as"
		per physicians' orders during the period from 1 January 2017 until 30 June 2018
		"were included in the study. The inclusion criteria were: non-hospitalized female,"
		"aged ≤80, with suspected vulvovaginal candidiasis or bacterial vaginosis and"
		clinical sings of infections. RESULTS: Gram-positive cocci were the ones most
		often isolated: Enterococcus faecalis (29.2%) and Streptoccoccus agalactiae
		"(13.1%), followed by bacilli from the Enterobacteriaceae group, including"
		Escherichia coli (26.3%). The presence of Streptococcus agalactiae was confirmed
		"in 13.1%, slightly more often in the 45-80 age group, and Gardnerella vaginalis"
		"in 6.4%, most often in women aged 15-24. The prevalence of yeast-like infections"
		"was 24.3%, Candida albicans accounted for 78.3%, whereas among C. non-albicans"
		spp.-C. glabrata dominated (14.9%) followed by C. parapsilosis (3.8%). The
		highest resistance was observed only in Streptococcus agalactiae as the MLSB
		mechanism (Macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B) was identified in 38.6% of
		"strains. The prevalence of vulvovaginal candidiasis was 24.3%, the highest in"
		women aged 15-44. CONCLUSIONS: Drug resistance in studied vulvovaginitis was
		associated only with Streptococcus agalactiae. A high proportion of yeast-like
		"aetiology was found, probably associated with recurrent infections. In the"
		analyzed cases only the Amsel criteria and culture methods were used for
		diagnosis without preparations and microbiological Nugent criteria.

PG	-	406-415
LID	-	10.1093/mmy/myx077 [doi]
AB	-	Candidemia is the main invasive fungal disease among hospitalized patients.
		"Several breakthrough candidemia (BrC) cases have been reported, but few studies"
		"evaluate the epidemiology, risk factors, molecular characterization, antifungal"
		"susceptibility profile and outcome of those patients, especially in developing"
		countries and including patients using broad spectrum antifungals. We conducted a
		"retrospective study from 2011 to 2016, including patients aged 12 years or older"
		with candidemia. Epidemiological characteristics and risk factors for candidemia
		were evaluated and compared with patients with BrC using univariate and
		multivariate analysis. Sequential Candida isolates from BrC were identified by
		"internal transcribed spacer sequencing, genotyped with amplified fragment length"
		"polymorphism fingerprinting (AFLP), and tested for antifungal susceptibility."
		"From 148 candidemia episodes, 27 breakthrough episodes (18%) were identified,"
		with neutropenia and mucositis being independent risk factors for BrC. Candida
		non-albicans was more frequent in the BrC group (P < .001). AFLP showed high
		correlation with conventional methods of identification among breakthrough
		isolates and a high genetic similarity among isolates from the same patient was
		observed. C. albicans was the most susceptible species with low MIC values for
		"all antifungal agents tested. In contrast, we found isolates of C. glabrata, C."
		parapsilosis and C. tropicalis resistant to triazoles and echinocandins. In
		"conclusion, BrC occurred mainly in severely immunosuppressed patients, with"
		neutropenia and mucositis. Mortality did not differ between the groups. Candida
		"non-albicans species were more recovered from BrC, with C. albicans being the"
		most susceptible to antifungals.

LID	-	10.1093/jac/dku460 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To define the antifungal susceptibility patterns of the most common
		non-albicans Candida spp. in China. METHODS: We evaluated the susceptibilities to
		"nine antifungal drugs of Candida parapsilosis species complex, Candida"
		"tropicalis, Candida glabrata species complex and Candida krusei isolates from"
		patients with invasive candidiasis at 11 hospitals over 3 years. Isolates were
		identified by MALDI-TOF MS supplemented by DNA sequencing. MICs were determined
		by Sensititre YeastOne(TM) using current clinical breakpoints/epidemiological
		"cut-off values to assign susceptibility (or WT), and by CLSI M44-A2 disc"
		"diffusion for fluconazole and voriconazole. RESULTS: Of 1072 isolates, 392"
		"(36.6%) were C. parapsilosis species complex. C. tropicalis, C. glabrata species"
		"complex and C. krusei comprised 35.4%, 24.3% and 3.7% of the isolates,"
		respectively. Over 99.3% of the isolates were of WT phenotype to amphotericin B
		and 5-flucytosine. Susceptibility/WT rates to azoles among C. parapsilosis
		"species complex were ≥97.5%. However, 11.6% and 9.5% of C. tropicalis isolates"
		"were non-susceptible to fluconazole and voriconazole, respectively (7.1% were"
		resistant to both). Approximately 14.3% of C. glabrata sensu stricto isolates
		"(n = 258) were fluconazole resistant, and 11.6% of C. glabrata sensu stricto"
		isolates were cross-resistant to fluconazole and voriconazole. All C. krusei
		"isolates were susceptible/WT to voriconazole, posaconazole and itraconazole."
		"Overall, 97.7%-100% of isolates were susceptible to caspofungin, micafungin and"
		"anidulafungin, but 2.3% of C. glabrata were non-susceptible to anidulafungin."
		There was no azole/echinocandin co-resistance. Disc diffusion and Sensititre
		YeastOne(TM) methods showed >95% categorical agreement for fluconazole and
		"voriconazole. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, reduced azole susceptibility was seen"
		among C. tropicalis. Resistance to echinocandins was uncommon.

		in a Sri Lankan cohort.
PG	-	508-516
LID	-	10.1080/00016357.2019.1607547 [doi]
AB	-	Aims: Oral candidiasis is a major oral manifestation of uncontrolled diabetes
		"mellitus, and a number of cofactors are associated with the pathogenesis of this"
		"infection. Here, we describe the prevalence of oral Candida in a Sri Lankan"
		cohort of type 2 diabetes mellitus and risk factors that predispose them to this
		common fungal infection. Methods: A case-control study was conducted in 250
		diabetics with type 2 diabetes and 81 nondiabetic controls. Clinical and
		"demographic data were collected using an interviewer administered questionnaire,"
		and patient records. Oral rinse samples were collected to determine the candidal
		"carriage, and the resultant yeast growth was quantified and speciated using"
		multiplex-PCR and phenotypic analyses. Chi-square test (χ(2) test) and Fisher
		exact test were used for the determination of the significant relationships
		between risk factors and oral candidiasis. Results: The oral prevalence of
		Candida species among both groups was similar (81%) although a significantly
		higher proportion of diabetics (32.8%) yielded >2000 CFU/mL of yeasts compared
		with only 12.3% of the healthy controls (p < .05). Significant associations were
		"noted between oral candidal carriage amongst diabetics, and (i) denture wearing,"
		"(ii) female gender and (iii) cigarette smoking (all, p < .05). Amongst both"
		"groups, C.albicans was the most common Candida species isolated followed by C."
		"parapsilosis, C. tropicalis and C. glabrata. Conclusions: The oral infestation of"
		Candida in our Sri Lankan cohort of diabetics is significantly higher than their
		"healthy counterparts, and co-carriage of multiple yeast species is a common"
		finding in the study population. As there are no previous such reports of the
		"latter phenomenon particularly from the Asian region it is noteworthy, mainly in"
		view of the recent data on the emergence of drug-resistant yeast species the
		world over.

TI	-	Blood stream infections by Candida glabrata and Candida krusei: a single-center
		experience.
PG	-	263-9
LID	-	10.3904/kjim.2009.24.3.263 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND/AIMS: The increasing incidence of Candida glabrata and Candida krusei
		infections is a significant problem because they are generally more resistant to
		fluconazole. We compared the risk factors associated with C. glabrata and C.
		krusei fungemia with Candida albicans fungemia and examined the clinical
		manifestations and prognostic factors associated with candidemia. METHODS: We
		"retrospectively reviewed demographic data, risk factors, clinical manifestations,"
		and outcomes associated with C. glabrata and C. krusei fungemia at a
		tertiary-care teaching hospital during a 10-years period from 1997 to 2006.
		"RESULTS: During the study period, there were 497 fungemia episodes. C. glabrata"
		fungemia accounted for 23 episodes and C. krusei fungemia accounted for 8.
		Complete medical records were available for 27 of these episodes and form the
		"basis of this study. Compared to 54 episodes of C. albicans fungemia, renal"
		insufficiency and prior fluconazole prophylaxis were associated with development
		of C. glabrata or C. krusei fungemia. The overall mortality was 67%. The
		fungemia-related mortality of C. glabrata and C. krusei was higher than that of
		"C. albicans (52 vs. 26%, p=0.021). Empirical antifungal therapy did not decrease"
		the crude mortality. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that high
		"APACHE II scores, catheter maintenance, and shock were independently associated"
		with an increased risk of death. CONCLUSIONS: Renal insufficiency and prior
		fluconazole prophylaxis were associated with the development of C. glabrata or C.
		krusei fungemia. Fungemia-related mortality of C. glabrata or C. krusei was
		higher than that of C. albicans. Outcomes appeared to be related to catheter
		"removal, APACHE II scores, and shock."

TI	-	Characteristics and outcomes of patients with postoperative Candida versus
		bacterial mediastinitis: a case-matched comparative study.
PG	-	523-530
LID	-	10.1093/ejcts/ezab437 [doi]
AB	-	"OBJECTIVES: Postoperative mediastinitis, a feared complication after cardiac"
		"surgery, is associated with high mortality, especially of critically ill"
		"patients. Candida species infections are rare and severe, with poorly known"
		"outcomes. We conducted a case-control study to describe the characteristics,"
		management and outcomes of patients with postoperative Candida mediastinitis.
		"METHODS: This French, monocentre, retrospective study included all patients with"
		postoperative Candida mediastinitis (January 2003-February 2020) requiring
		intensive care unit admission. Candida mediastinitis patients (henceforth cases)
		"were matched 1:1 with postoperative bacterial mediastinitis (henceforth control),"
		"based on 3 factors during mediastinitis management: age >40 years, cardiac"
		transplantation and invasive circulatory device used. The primary end point was
		the probability of survival within 1 year after intensive care unit (ICU)
		admission. RESULTS: Forty cases were matched to 40 controls. The global
		"male/female ratio was 2.1, with mean age at admission 47.9 ± 13.8 years. Candida"
		"species were: 67.5% albicans, 17.5% glabrata, 15% parapsilosis, 5.0% tropicalis,"
		2.5% krusei and 2.5% lusitaniae. The median duration of mechanical ventilation
		"was 23, 68.8% of patients received renal replacement therapy and 62.5%"
		extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. The probability of survival within
		the first year after ICU admission was 40 ± 5.5% and was significantly lower for
		"cases than for controls (43 ± 8% vs 80 ± 6.3%, respectively; Log-rank test: P <"
		0.0001). The multivariable Cox proportional hazards model retained only renal
		"replacement therapy [hazard ratio (HR) 3.7, 95% confidence interval (CI)"
		"1.1-13.1; P = 0.04] and Candida mediastinitis (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.1-5.6; P = 0.04)"
		as independently associated with 1-year mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Candida
		mediastinitis is a serious event after cardiac surgery and independently
		associated with 1-year mortality. Further studies are needed to determine whether
		deaths are directly attributable to Candida mediastinitis.

LID	-	10.1016/j.jinf.2017.12.018 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: Breakthrough candidemia (BTC) on fluconazole was associated with
		non-susceptible Candida spp. and increased mortality. This nationwide FUNGINOS
		study analyzed clinical and mycological BTC characteristics. METHODS: A 3-year
		prospective study was conducted in 567 consecutive candidemias. Species
		identification and antifungal susceptibility testing (CLSI) were performed in the
		FUNGINOS reference laboratory. Data were analyzed according to STROBE criteria.
		"RESULTS: 43/576 (8%) BTC occurred: 37/43 (86%) on fluconazole (28 prophylaxis,"
		median 200 mg/day). 21% BTC vs. 23% non-BTC presented severe sepsis/septic shock.
		Overall mortality was 34% vs. 32%. BTC was associated with gastrointestinal
		"mucositis (multivariate OR 5.25, 95%CI 2.23-12.40, p < 0.001) and"
		"graft-versus-host-disease (6.25, 1.00-38.87, p = 0.05), immunosuppression (2.42,"
		"1.03-5.68, p = 0.043), and parenteral nutrition (2.87, 1.44-5.71, p = 0.003)."
		Non-albicans Candida were isolated in 58% BTC vs. 35% non-BTC (p = 0.005). 63% of
		"16 BTC occurring after 10-day fluconazole were non-susceptible (Candida glabrata,"
		"Candida krusei, Candida norvegensis) vs. 19% of 21 BTC (C. glabrata) following"
		"shorter exposure (7.10, 1.60-31.30, p = 0.007). Median fluconazole MIC was 4 mg/l"
		vs. 0.25 mg/l (p < 0.001). Ten-day fluconazole exposure predicted non-susceptible
		BTC with 73% accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes of BTC and non-BTC were similar.
		Fluconazole non-susceptible BTC occurred in three out of four cases after
		prolonged low-dose prophylaxis. This implies reassessment of prophylaxis duration
		and rapid de-escalation of empirical therapy in BTC after short fluconazole
		exposure.

AB	-	"Use of cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIED), including permanent"
		"pacemakers (PPM) and implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD), has increased"
		dramatically over the past two decades. Most CIED infections are caused by
		staphylococci. Fungal causes are rare and their prognosis is poor. To our
		"knowledge, there has not been a previously reported case of multifocal Candida"
		endocarditis involving both a native left-sided heart valve and a CIED lead.
		"Here, we report the case of a 70-year-old patient who presented with nausea,"
		"vomiting, and generalised fatigue, and was found to have Candida glabrata"
		endocarditis involving both a native aortic valve and right atrial ICD lead. We
		review the literature and summarise four additional cases of CIED-associated
		"Candida endocarditis published from 2009 to 2014, updating a previously published"
		review of cases prior to 2009. We additionally review treatment guidelines and
		discuss management of CIED-associated Candida endocarditis.

TI	-	Invasive Candidiasis in Critically Ill Patients: A Prospective Cohort Study in
		Two Tertiary Care Centers.
PG	-	542-553
LID	-	10.1177/0885066618767835 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive candidiasis is not uncommon in critically ill patients but
		has variable epidemiology and outcomes between intensive care units (ICUs). This
		"study evaluated the epidemiology, characteristics, management, and outcomes of"
		patients with invasive candidiasis at 6 ICUs of 2 tertiary care centers. METHODS:
		This was a prospective observational study of all adults admitted to 6 ICUs in 2
		different hospitals between August 2012 and May 2016 and diagnosed to have
		invasive candidiasis by 2 intensivists according to predefined criteria. The
		"epidemiology of isolated Candida and the characteristics, management, and"
		outcomes of affected patients were studied. Multivariable logistic regression
		analyses were performed to identify the predictors of non-albicans versus
		albicans infection and hospital mortality. RESULTS: Invasive candidiasis was
		"diagnosed in 162 (age 58.4 ± 18.9 years, 52.2% males, 82.1% medical admissions,"
		and admission Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score 24.1 ± 8.4)
		"patients at a rate of 2.6 cases per 100 ICU admissions. On the diagnosis day, the"
		Candida score was 2.4 ± 0.9 in invasive candidiasis compared with 1.6 ± 0.9 in
		"Candida colonization (P < .01). The most frequent species were albicans (38.3%),"
		"tropicalis (16.7%), glabrata (16%), and parapsilosis (13.6%). In patients with"
		"candidemia, antifungal therapy was started on average 1 hour before knowing the"
		"culture result (59.6% of therapy initiated after). Resistance to fluconazole,"
		"caspofungin, and amphotericin B occurred in 27.9%, 2.9%, and 3.1%, respectively."
		The hospital mortality was 58.6% with no difference between albicans and
		"non-albicans infections (61.3% and 54.9%, respectively; P = .44). The independent"
		predictors of mortality were renal replacement therapy after invasive candidiasis
		diagnosis (odds ratio: 5.42; 95% confidence interval: 2.16-13.56) and invasive
		candidiasis leading/contributing to ICU admission versus occurring during
		critical illness (odds ratio: 2.87; 95% confidence interval: 1.22-6.74).
		"CONCLUSIONS: In critically ill patients with invasive candidiasis, non-albicans"
		"was responsible for most cases, and mortality was high (58.6%). Antifungal"
		therapy was initiated after culture results in 60% suggesting low preclinical
		suspicion. Study registration: NCT01490684; registered in ClinicalTrials.gov on
		"February 11, 2012."

AB	-	Candidemia is a growing problem in hospitals all over the world. Despite advances
		"in the medical support of critically ill patients, candidiasis leads to prolonged"
		"hospitalization, and has a crude mortality rate around 50%. We conducted a"
		multicenter surveillance study in 16 hospitals distributed across five regions of
		"Brazil to assess the incidence, species distribution, antifungal susceptibility,"
		and risk factors for bloodstream infections due to Candida species. From June
		"2007 to March 2010, we studied a total of 2,563 nosocomial bloodstream infection"
		(nBSI) episodes. Candida spp. was the 7th most prevalent agent. Most of the
		"patients were male, with a median age of 56 years. A total of 64 patients (46.7%)"
		were in the ICU when candidemia occurred. Malignancies were the most common
		underlying condition (32%). The crude mortality rate of candidemia during the
		hospital admission was 72.2%. Non-albicans species of Candida accounted for 65.7%
		"of the 137 yeast isolates. C. albicans (34.3%), Candida parapsilosis (24.1%),"
		Candida tropicalis (15.3%) and Candida glabrata (10.2%) were the most prevalent
		species. Only 47 out of 137 Candida isolates were sent to the reference
		"laboratory for antifungal susceptibility testing. All C. albicans, C. tropicalis"
		and C. parapsilosis isolates were susceptible to the 5 antifungal drugs tested.
		"Among 11 C. glabrata isolates, 36% were resistant to fluconazole, and 64% SDD."
		All of them were susceptible to anidulafungin and amphotericin B. We observed
		that C. glabrata is emerging as a major player among non-albicans Candida spp.
		and fluconazole resistance was primarily confined to C. glabrata and C. krusei
		strains. Candida resistance to echinocandins and amphotericin B remains rare in
		Brazil. Mortality rates remain increasingly higher than that observed in the
		"Northern Hemisphere countries, emphasizing the need for improving local practices"
		"of clinical management of candidemia, including early diagnosis, source control"
		and precise antifungal therapy.

TI	-	Initial treatment and outcome of Candida glabrata versus Candida albicans
		bloodstream infection.
PG	-	152-7
LID	-	10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2009.03.007 [doi]
AB	-	Candida glabrata is a common cause of bloodstream infection (BSI) and exhibits
		decreased susceptibility to fluconazole. We sought to determine whether patients
		with C. glabrata infection were at increased risk of inappropriate initial
		therapy and mortality compared with the more fluconazole-susceptible species
		Candida albicans by performing a matched case-control study using the Prospective
		Antifungal Therapy Alliance registry of invasive fungal infections. C. glabrata
		"BSI patients were matched to those with C. albicans BSI by age, sex, and"
		underlying illness after screening all C. glabrata patients entered into the
		registry from March 2004 through September 2007. Of 161 patients with C. glabrata
		"BSI included and matched to 161 C. albicans patients, those with C. glabrata were"
		less likely to receive an adequate dose of fluconazole as initial therapy (12%
		"versus 52%, P < 0.05) and more likely to receive an echinocandin (44% versus 26%,"
		"P < 0.05) or inadequately dosed fluconazole (32% versus 8%, P < 0.05) as initial"
		therapy. Although time to initiation of therapy did not differ by species (P =
		"0.2), time to receipt of adequate therapy was longer for those with C. glabrata"
		"BSI (P < 0.001). Overall, C. glabrata patients were more likely to receive"
		"inadequate initial therapy (34% versus 11%, P < 0.05), but 4-week mortality was"
		"no different between groups (30% for C. glabrata versus 29% for C. albicans, P ="
		"0.80). We found hematologic malignancy, age greater than 60, the presence of a"
		"central venous catheter at diagnosis, mechanical ventilation, and dialysis"
		dependence to be independent predictors of 4-week mortality. The lack of
		difference in mortality between species may reflect the overriding importance of
		host variables and/or a difference in virulence by species: further study is
		needed to investigate these hypotheses.

TI	-	Prevalence and antifungal susceptibility of 442 Candida isolates from blood and
		other normally sterile sites: results of a 2-year (1996 to 1998) multicenter
		"surveillance study in Quebec, Canada."
PG	-	949-53
AB	-	"During a 2-year surveillance program (1996 to 1998) in Quebec, Canada, 442"
		strains of Candida species were isolated from 415 patients in 51 hospitals. The
		"distribution of species was as follows: Candida albicans, 54%; C. glabrata, 15%;"
		"C. parapsilosis, 12%; C. tropicalis, 9%; C. lusitaniae, 3%; C. krusei, 3%; and"
		"Candida spp., 3%. These data, compared to those of a 1985 survey, indicate"
		"variations in species distribution, with the proportions of C. glabrata and C."
		"parapsilosis increasing by 9 and 4%, respectively, and those of C. albicans and"
		"C. tropicalis decreasing by 10 and 7%, respectively. However, these differences"
		are statistically significant for C. glabrata and C. tropicalis only. MICs of
		"amphotericin B were > or =4 microg/ml for 3% of isolates, all of which were"
		non-C. albicans species. Three percent of C. albicans isolates were resistant to
		flucytosine (> or =32 microg/ml). Resistance to itraconazole (> or =1 microg/ml)
		"and fluconazole (> or =64 microg/ml) was observed, respectively, in 1 and 1% of"
		"C. albicans, 14 and 9% of C. glabrata, 5 and 0% of C. tropicalis, and 0% of C."
		parapsilosis and C. lusitaniae isolates. Clinical data were obtained for 343
		"patients. The overall crude mortality rate was 38%, reflecting the multiple"
		serious underlying illnesses found in these patients. Bloodstream infections were
		"documented for 249 patients (73%). Overall, systemic triazoles had been"
		administered to 10% of patients before the onset of candidiasis. The frequency of
		isolation of non-C. albicans species was significantly higher in this group of
		"patients. Overall, only two C. albicans isolates were found to be resistant to"
		"fluconazole. These were obtained from an AIDS patient and a leukemia patient,"
		"both of whom had a history of previous exposure to fluconazole. At present, it"
		appears that resistance to fluconazole in Quebec is rare and is restricted to
		patients with prior prolonged azole treatment.

AB	-	Vulvovaginal candidosis (VVC) is a common infection of the female genital tract
		affecting 75% women at least once in their lifetime. The aim of this study was to
		determine the incidence and potential risk factors associated with VVC and
		recurrent vulvovaginal candidosis (RVVC). A prospective study of women with
		vaginitis symptoms was conducted over 2 years in the regional clinic of
		population and family education in Sfax. A discriminant analysis was used to
		evaluate the association between the incidence of Candida vaginitis and potential
		risk factors. Sporadic and recurrent VVC were documented respectively in 48% and
		6.1%. The most frequent factors associated with positive Candida culture were
		"employed women, uncontrolled diabetes, history of genital infection and"
		intrauterine device contraception. Increased episode numbers of VVC and
		condom/spermicidal contraception were positively associated with recurrences.
		Candida albicans was the predominantly isolated species (76.3%) followed by
		Candida glabrata (19.3%). Infection with C. glabrata occurred in 34% and 17.5% of
		patients with RVVC and VVC respectively. The discriminant investigation had
		provided further insights into the basis for prevention and control of RVVC.
		Increased prevalence of C. glabrata in patients with RVVC and observed risk
		factors should be taken into consideration to achieve success in the management
		of this infection.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: This paper aimed to identify and quantify Candida on head and neck
		irradiated patients with two comparative elderly populations. MATERIALS AND
		METHODS: Saliva was sampled from 29 head and neck irradiated patients (group 1)
		34 non-institutionalized elderly patients (group 2) and 29 institutionalized
		"elders (group 3) and matched by age. For quantification, the obtained saliva was"
		"sewed on CHROMagar Candida(®), which was used also for presumptive identification"
		"of Candida, API 20C AUX(®), microculture and RAPD (OPE-18) were used for the"
		"final identification. RESULTS: Among the 92 patients surveyed, 51 (55.4%) had"
		"scores classified as positive for Candida, and among individuals of groups 1 and"
		"3, 58.6% had Candida. There was higher positive/carrier conditions (CFU/sample)"
		"in groups 1 and 3, comparing with group 2 (P=0.011). Gender was not associated"
		with Candida portability (P=0.334). Candida portability was significantly
		associated with the presence of candidosis (P=0.031) and xerostomic state
		"(P=0.007). The isolates and definitive confirmed colonies were Candida albicans,"
		"Candida dubliniensis, Candida tropicalis, Candida krusei, Candida glabrata,"
		"Candida parapsilosis, Candida guilliermondii, Candida lusitaniae, and Candida"
		"kefyr. Among the species identified, C. albicans was the most frequent, followed"
		"by C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis and C. glabrata. C. albicans was more prevalent"
		"in group 2 and 3, 45% and 41.2%, respectively, whereas, the most prevalent"
		"species in group 1 were C. tropicalis (27%), C. albicans and C. parapsilosis"
		"(16.2% for both). On multiple statistical models, only radiotherapic treatment"
		was associated with positiveness to Candida. CONCLUSIONS: Diversification and
		major prevalence of non-albicans species were observed in irradiated patients on
		head and neck and this treatment is straightly associated with fungus
		positiveness.

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of
		Candida in the buccal cavity of diabetic and non-diabetic individuals in and
		"around Pondicherry, India and to analyse the antifungal susceptibility profile of"
		"the selected isolates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 400 buccal samples, 200"
		each from diabetic and non-diabetic healthy individuals were included in the
		study. Sabouraud's dextrose agar was used for isolation of Candida species.
		"Identification was performed through microscopy, germ tube test, sugar"
		"fermentation test, sugar assimilation test and by using Hichrome agar. Distinct"
		and phenotypically representative colonies were selected and subjected to ITS
		analysis. In vitro antifungal susceptibility testing for the isolated Candida
		species was performed using E-test. RESULTS: Results revealed that the prevalence
		of Candida species in diabetic individuals was higher when compared with
		non-diabetic healthy individuals. The most predominantly isolated species in
		diabetic and non-diabetic individuals from buccal cavity was Candida albicans.
		C. tropicalis was predominant among the non-albicans Candida isolated from both
		diabetic and non-diabetic individuals. Among denture wearers C. glabrata was
		"predominant. In vitro antifungal susceptibility testing shows that ketoconazole,"
		fluconazole and itraconazole were effective against the isolated Candida species.
		CONCLUSIONS: The rate of candidal carriage in diabetic individuals is higher.
		Different species of Candida are present in the oral cavity of diabetic
		individuals. There may be a positive correlation between glycemic control and
		candidal colonization. In vitro antifungal susceptibility testing of Candia
		species are required for proper management and treatment of candidal infections.

PG	-	266-269
LID	-	10.1111/myc.12736 [doi]
AB	-	Non-albicans Candida prosthetic joint infection (PJI) is extremely rare. A case
		"of a Candida glabrata knee PJI is a 68-year-old splenectomised female smoker,"
		suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and alcoholism is
		"reported. The patient presented with a peri-prosthetic fracture, 15 years after"
		total knee replacement surgery. Cultures of the intraoperative peri-prosthetic
		"tissue and materials yielded C. glabrata, as well as a methicillin-resistant"
		S. epidermitis. The patient was treated with anidulafungin and vancomycin. The
		knee prosthetic joint was removed and cement-spacer with vancomycin and
		"gentamycin was placed. Additionally, an external fixation was performed. A second"
		"stage revision surgery was planned, after completion of the antimicrobial and"
		"antifungal treatment. The patient is followed up for 4 months without signs,"
		symptoms or findings of infection. PJI Candida infections require a high clinical
		"suspicion index. It is of utmost importance to report these cases, since there is"
		"no consensus yet of the proper antifungal treatment. Furthermore, a literature"
		review regarding treatment of those cases is provided. First-line treatment with
		"an echinocandin seems most proper, due to their fungicidal properties, their"
		"effectiveness against biofilm, as well as their minimal toxicity, making them"
		"ideal for long-term use. Further experience is needed, for better understanding"
		the disease's pathogenesis and optimal treatment.

TI	-	Accuracy of Sensititre YeastOne echinocandins epidemiological cut-off values for

		national survey of the Fungal Infection Network of Switzerland (FUNGINOS).

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: Echinocandins represent the first-line treatment of candidaemia.
		Acquired echinocandin resistance is mainly observed among Candida albicans and
		Candida glabrata and is associated with FKS hotspot mutations. The commercial
		Sensititre YeastOne™ (SYO) kit is widely used for antifungal susceptibility
		"testing, but interpretive clinical breakpoints are not well defined. We"
		determined echinocandins epidemiological cut-off values (ECV) for
		C. albicans/glabrata tested by SYO and assessed their ability to identify FKS
		mutants in a national survey of candidaemia. METHODS: Bloodstream isolates of
		C. albicans and C. glabrata were collected in 25 Swiss hospitals from 2004 to
		2013 and tested by SYO. FKS hotspot sequencing was performed for isolates with an
		"MIC≥ECV for any echinocandin. RESULTS: In all, 1277 C. albicans and 347"
		"C. glabrata were included. ECV 97.5% of caspofungin, anidulafungin and micafungin"
		"were 0.12, 0.06 and 0.03 μg/mL for C. albicans, and 0.25, 0.12 and 0.03 μg/mL for"
		"C. glabrata, respectively. FKS hotspot sequencing was performed for 70 isolates."
		No mutation was found in the 52 'limit wild-type' isolates (MIC=ECV for at least
		one echinocandin). Among the 18 'non-wild-type' isolates (MIC>ECV for at least
		"one echinocandin), FKS mutations were recovered in the only two isolates with"
		"MIC>ECV for all three echinocandins, but not in those exhibiting a"
		'non-wild-type' phenotype for only one or two echinocandins. CONCLUSION: This
		10-year nationwide survey showed that the rate of echinocandin resistance among
		C. albicans and C. glabrata remains low in Switzerland despite increased
		echinocandin use. SYO-ECV could discriminate FKS mutants from wild-type isolates
		tested by SYO in this population.

PG	-	423-7
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candida genus has various species. The incidence of C. glabrata has
		presented itself with more frequency over the past years with clinical
		importance. METHODS: A case study was made to determine the frequency of C.
		glabrata in 468 patients who presented clinical symptomatology for vulvovaginal
		candidiasis and the in vitro response for fluconazole using two methods:
		diffusion in agar plates and microdilution in liquid medium [NCLSI (NCCLS)
		"method]. RESULTS: The frequency for this specie was 12.6%, almost double the"
		frequency observed 10 years ago. The resistance of C. glabrata to fluconazole
		"treatment was confirmed in this study, representing 68.2% resistance in all"
		strains on test plates and 51.2% on NCLSI method with a MIC of 16 microg/ml.
		CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of Candida glabrata has increased over the past years.
		"It presents resistance to usual treatments, which promotes the persistence and"
		recurrence of genital and systemic infections.

		susceptibilities of isolates collected from 1998 to 2000 in a population-based
		active surveillance program.
PG	-	1519-27
AB	-	To determine the incidence of Candida bloodstream infections (BSI) and antifungal
		"drug resistance, population-based active laboratory surveillance was conducted"
		from October 1998 through September 2000 in two areas of the United States
		"(Baltimore, Md., and the state of Connecticut; combined population, 4.7 million)."
		"A total of 1,143 cases were detected, for an average adjusted annual incidence of"
		"10 per 100,000 population or 1.5 per 10,000 hospital days. In 28% of patients,"
		Candida BSI developed prior to or on the day of admission; only 36% of patients
		were in an intensive care unit at the time of diagnosis. No fewer than 78% of
		"patients had a central catheter in place at the time of diagnosis, and 50% had"
		undergone surgery within the previous 3 months. Candida albicans comprised 45% of
		"the isolates, followed by C. glabrata (24%), C. parapsilosis (13%), and C."
		tropicalis (12%). Only 1.2% of C. albicans isolates were resistant to fluconazole
		"(MIC, > or = 64 microg/ml), compared to 7% of C. glabrata isolates and 6% of C."
		tropicalis isolates. Only 0.9% of C. albicans isolates were resistant to
		"itraconazole (MIC, > or = 1 micro g/ml), compared to 19.5% of C. glabrata"
		isolates and 6% of C. tropicalis isolates. Only 4.3% of C. albicans isolates were
		"resistant to flucytosine (MIC, > or = 32 microg/ml), compared to < 1% of C."
		parapsilosis and C. tropicalis isolates and no C. glabrata isolates. As
		"determined by E-test, the MICs of amphotericin B were > or = 0.38 microg/ml for"
		"10% of Candida isolates, > or =1 microg/ml for 1.7% of isolates, and > or = 2"
		microg/ml for 0.4% of isolates. Our findings highlight changes in the
		epidemiology of Candida BSI in the 1990s and provide a basis upon which to
		conduct further studies of selected high-risk subpopulations.

TI	-	CAND-LO 2014-15 study: changing epidemiology of candidemia in Lombardy (Italy).
PG	-	765-780
AB	-	PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to monitor recent changes in the epidemiology
		of candidemia and in the antifungal susceptibility profiles of Candida isolates
		in one Italian region (Lombardy) in 2014-2015 in comparison with two other
		studies performed in the same area in 1997-1999 and in 2009. METHODS: A
		laboratory-based surveillance was conducted in 11 microbiology laboratories.
		Identification of Candida isolates from 868 episodes and antifungal
		susceptibility testing (YeastOne) was performed locally. RESULTS: A progressive
		"increase in the rate of candidemia up to 1.27/1000 admissions and 1.59/10,000"
		"patient days was documented. In all the three surveys, Candida albicans remains"
		"the most frequently isolated species, ranging from 52 to 59 % of the etiology of"
		"BSIs. The epidemiological shift to the more resistant C. glabrata, observed"
		"between 1997-1999 and 2009 surveys, was not confirmed by our more recent data."
		The pattern of etiology of BSIs occurred in 2014-2015 overlaps that of the 90s.
		Acquired antifungal resistance is a rare event. No isolate had an amphoterin B
		"minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC, mg/L) value higher than the"
		epidemiological cutoff. All the echinocandin MIC distributions are typical for
		wild-type organisms except for those of two C. glabrata isolates. Fluconazole
		resistance declined from 24.9 % in the 2009 survey to 5.4 % in the recent one.
		CONCLUSIONS: Data from regional surveys may highlight the influence of
		therapeutic practices on the epidemiology of Candida BSIs and may optimize
		empirical therapies.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of oral candidiasis and multiple oral
		"Candida infections in patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome (SS), and the"
		clinical and drug susceptibility profile. METHODS: Thirty patients with primary
		SS were enrolled in our study. The diagnosis of oral candidiasis was based on the
		"clinical manifestation, and confirmed by a concentrated rinse culture. Candida"
		spp. assessment was accomplished using standard methods: Sabouraud dextrose agar
		with 50 mg/l chloramphenicol and CHROMagar were used for the rapid screening of
		"clinical species, followed by the API 20C system for further species"
		identification. In vitro antifungal drug susceptibility of Candida isolates was
		"determined by the minimal inhibitory concentrations. RESULTS: In our study, 87%"
		"(26/30) of subjects had oral candidiasis, in which 42% (11/26) had multiple"
		"Candida spp. infection. Although C. albicans remains the predominant isolate,"
		"other rare species such as C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, and C."
		"krusei were present, alone or in combination. Chronic atrophic candidiasis is the"
		most common clinical type of oral candidiasis in patients with SS. The
		susceptibilities of the 44 Candida isolates to 7 antifungal agents varied
		"dramatically. The resistance to azoles was remarkable, and the phenomenon of"
		cross-resistance between itraconazole and fluconazole was observed. CONCLUSION:
		Patients with primary SS carry a high risk of oral candidiasis and a high
		frequency of multiple Candida infections. The azole resistance patterns of
		Candida spp. support the necessity for drug susceptibility testing as a routine
		procedure for patients with oral Candida infections.

PG	-	2034-9
LID	-	10.1097/CCM.0b013e3181760f42 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the clinical features
		associated with candidemia caused by non-albicans Candida spp. and with
		potentially fluconazole-resistant Candida spp. (C. glabrata and C. krusei) among
		candidemic intensive care unit patients. DESIGN: The authors conducted a
		nationwide prospective cohort study. SETTING: The study was conducted in
		Australian intensive care units. PATIENTS: All patients with intensive care
		unit-acquired candidemia over a 3-yr period were included in the study.
		"MEASUREMENTS: Clinical risk factors occurring up to 30 days before candidemia,"
		"Candida spp. associated with candidemia, and outcomes were determined. Risk"
		factors associated with either non-albicans Candida spp. or with potentially
		fluconazole-resistant Candida spp. (C. glabrata or C. krusei) were assessed using
		multivariate logistic regression. MAIN RESULTS: Among 179 episodes of intensive
		"care unit-acquired candidemia, C. albicans accounted for 62%, C. glabrata 18%, C."
		"krusei 4%, and other Candida spp. 16%. Independently significant variables"
		associated with non-albicans Candida bloodstream infection included recent prior
		"gastrointestinal surgery (adjusted odds ratio, 2.87; 95% confidence interval,"
		1.68-4.91) and recent prior systemic antifungal exposure (4.6; 1.36-15.53). Those
		associated with potentially fluconazole-resistant candidemia included recent
		prior gastrointestinal surgery (3.31; 1.79-6.11) and recent prior fluconazole
		exposure (5.47; 1.23-24.32). No significant differences in outcomes were
		demonstrated for non-albicans or potentially fluconazole-resistant candidemia.
		"CONCLUSIONS: Among candidemic intensive care unit patients, prior"
		gastrointestinal surgery and systemic antifungal exposure were significantly
		associated with both a non-albicans Candida spp. and a potentially
		fluconazole-resistant Candida spp.

AB	-	"A 12 month survey of candidaemia in Scotland, UK, in which every Scottish"
		"hospital laboratory submitted all blood isolates of yeasts for identification,"
		"strain typing and susceptibility testing, provided 300 isolates from 242"
		"patients, generating incidence data of 4.8 cases per 100,000 population per year"
		"and 5.9 cases per 100,000 acute occupied bed days; 27.9 % of cases occurred in"
		intensive care units. More than half the patients with candidaemia had an
		"underlying disease involving the abdomen, 78 % had an indwelling intravenous"
		"catheter, 62 % had suffered a bacterial infection within the 2 weeks prior to"
		candidaemia and 37 % had undergone a laparotomy. Candida albicans was the
		"infecting species in 50 % of cases, followed by Candida glabrata (21 %) and"
		Candida parapsilosis (12 %). Seven cases of candidaemia were caused by Candida
		"dubliniensis, which was more prevalent even than Candida lusitaniae and Candida"
		"tropicalis (six cases each). Among C. glabrata isolates, 55 % showed reduced"
		"susceptibility to fluconazole, but azole resistance among other species was"
		extremely low. Multilocus sequence typing showed isolates with high similarity
		"came from different hospitals across the country, and many different types came"
		"from the hospitals that submitted the most isolates, indicating no tendency"
		towards hospital-specific endemic strains. Multiple isolates of C. albicans and
		C. glabrata from individual patients were of the same strain type with single
		"exceptions for each species. The high prevalence of candidaemia in Scotland,"
		"relative to other population-based European studies, and the high level of"
		reduced fluconazole susceptibility of Scottish C. glabrata isolates warrant
		continued future surveillance of invasive Candida infections.

TI	-	Molecular epidemiology of candidemia: evidence of clusters of smoldering
		nosocomial infections.
PG	-	e17-24
LID	-	10.1086/589298 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive fungal infections pose a serious threat to hospitalized
		"patients worldwide. In particular, the prevalence of clusters of nosocomial"
		infection among patients with candidemia remains unknown. The aim of this study
		was to investigate the molecular epidemiology of candidemia in a nationwide
		setting in Iceland during a 16-year period. METHODS: The genotypes of all
		available fungal bloodstream isolates during 1991-2006 (n = 219) were determined
		by polymerase chain reaction fingerprinting with use of 4 separate primers.
		Clusters were defined as isolation of > or =2 strains with genotypes that had >
		or =90% relatedness in the same hospital within a period of 90 days. RESULTS:
		"Candida albicans represented 61.6% of isolates, followed by Candida glabrata"
		"(13.7%), Candida tropicalis (9.1%), and Candida parapsilosis (8.7%). Polymerase"
		"chain reaction fingerprinting revealed 35 clones of C. albicans, 10 clones of C."
		"glabrata, 7 clones of C. tropicalis, 4 clones of C. parapsilosis, and 5 clones of"
		"Candida dubliniensis. Overall, 18.7%-39.9% of all infections were part of"
		"nosocomial clusters, most commonly caused by C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, and C."
		tropicalis. Most clusters involved 2 cases and disproportionately affected
		patients in adult and neonatal intensive care units (P = .045). The 7-day (16%)
		and 30-day (32%) case-fatality rates among cluster-associated cases did not
		differ statistically significantly from those for sporadic nosocomial infections.
		None of the clusters were identified by the hospital surveillance team.
		"CONCLUSIONS: In an unselected patient population, as many as one-third of all"
		cases of candidemia may be attributable to nosocomial clusters. The risk is
		dependent on hospital wards and patient populations; it is highest in intensive
		care units. Small clusters are not identified by routine hospital surveillance.

TI	-	Increasing candidaemia incidence from 2004 to 2015 with a shift in epidemiology
		in patients preexposed to antifungals.
PG	-	127-133
LID	-	10.1111/myc.12714 [doi]
AB	-	Candidaemia is an important health problem in immunocompromised patients with an
		"epidemiology varying with region, period and patient population involved. The"
		occurrence of candidaemia and the associated species distribution over a 12-year
		period at a large tertiary care centre in Belgium were analysed. The trend in
		incidence in the intensive care units (ICUs) and non-ICUs was investigated as
		well as the influence of antifungal exposure on the species distribution. From
		"2004 until 2015, 865 candidaemia episodes occurred in 826 patients at the"
		University Hospitals Leuven. Candida albicans (59%) remained the most important
		"cause of candidaemia, followed by C. glabrata (22.4%) and C. parapsilosis (8%)."
		The mean incidence in the whole hospital was 1.48 per 10 000 patient days (PD).
		The incidence in ICUs increased reaching up to 10.7 per 10 000 PD whereas in the
		"non-ICUs, the incidence decreased. Prior exposure to fluconazole and"
		echinocandins was associated with candidaemia caused by less susceptible species.
		"Candidaemia incidence increased in the whole hospital, driven by ICUs."
		Surveillance of candidaemia epidemiology on a local scale is of high value to
		guide empirical treatment strategies.

TI	-	Intraabdominal candidiasis in surgical ICU patients treated with anidulafungin: A
		multicenter retrospective study.
PG	-	32-9
LID	-	maseda8jan2016 [pii]
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: Patients with recent intraabdominal events are at uniquely risk for
		intraabdominal candidiasis (IAC). Candida peritonitis is a frequent and
		life-threatening complication in surgically ill patients. International
		guidelines do not specifically address IAC. This study describes clinical
		features of IAC in critical patients treated with anidulafungin in Surgical ICUs
		(SICUs). METHODS: A practice-based retrospective study was performed including
		all adults with IAC admitted to 19 SICUs for ≥24h treated with anidulafungin. IAC
		was documented (Candida isolation from blood/peritoneal fluid/abscess fluid
		and/or histopathological confirmation) or presumptive (host factors plus clinical
		criteria without mycological support). Total population and the subgroup of
		septic shock patients were analyzed. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty nine
		"patients were included, 94 (67.6%) with septic shock, 112 (86.2%) after urgent"
		"surgery. Of them, 77.7% presented peritonitis and 21.6% only intraabdominal"
		"abscesses. Among 56.8% cases with documented IAC, C. albicans (52.8%) followed by"
		C. glabrata (27.8%) were the most frequent species. Anidulafungin was primarily
		"used as empirical therapy (59.7%), microbiologically directed (20.9%) and"
		anticipated therapy (15.8%). Favourable response was 79.1% (76.6% among patients
		with septic shock). Intra-SICU mortality was 25.9% (28.7% among patients with
		"septic shock). CONCLUSIONS: Among IACs managed at SICUs, peritonitis was the main"
		"presentation, with high percentage of patients presenting septic shock. C."
		albicans followed by C. glabrata were the main responsible species. Anidulafungin
		"treatment was mostly empirical followed by microbiologically directed therapy,"
		"with a favourable safety profile, even among patients with septic shock."

TI	-	Diagnosis and treatment of Candida glabrata proventriculitis in an eclectus
		parrot (Eclectus roratus).
PG	-	442-449
LID	-	10.2460/javma.20.12.0670 [doi]
AB	-	CASE DESCRIPTION: An 8-year-old sexually intact female eclectus parrot (Eclectus
		roratus) with a 4-day history of hyporexia and lethargy and a 1-day history of
		tenesmus was examined. CLINICAL FINDINGS: Severe leukocytosis characterized by
		severe heterophilia and moderate monocytosis was present. Marked dilation of the
		proventriculus and ventriculus and ascites were identified by means of
		"radiography, coelomic ultrasonography, and contrast-enhanced CT, with no"
		clinically relevant motility noted on ultrasonography. Results of coelomic fluid
		analysis were consistent with pyogranulomatous effusion. Endoscopy of the upper
		gastrointestinal tract following proventricular and ventricular lavage showed a
		thick caseous plaque occupying 30% of the caudal proventricular mucosa. Abundant
		yeast organisms were evident during cytologic examination of a proventricular and
		"ventricular wash sample, and fecal culture yielded Candida glabrata. TREATMENT"
		"AND OUTCOME: The bird was treated with SC fluids, assisted feedings, nystatin,"
		"fluconazole, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, enrofloxacin, gastroprotectants,"
		"maropitant, and analgesics and slowly improved during hospitalization. A marked"
		decrease in proventricular dilation was evident on serial radiographs obtained
		"over a 12-month period. One year after diagnosis, the bird was presented with a"
		"1-week history of hyporexia and lethargy, and fecal culture grew C glabrata."
		Antifungal treatment was resumed for 3 months. The bird had no clinical signs of
		"infection 16 months after this recurrence, and subsequent fecal cultures were"
		negative for fungal growth. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Findings illustrate the
		importance of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in diagnosing proventricular and
		ventricular dilation in birds and emphasize the need for long-term antifungal
		treatment and monitoring in birds with fungal infections.

AB	-	AIM: To report the management of recurrent postoperative fungal endophthalmitis
		(POFE) after failed pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) and antifungal therapy. SETTINGS
		"AND DESIGN: Tertiary Care Referral Centre in North India. Retrospective, single"
		"institution, interventional case-series. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six patients with"
		microbiologically proven recurrent post-operative fungal endophthalmitis
		refractory to conventional management were included. The final recurrence was
		managed with intraocular lens (IOL) explantation and re-PPV. Main outcome
		"measures included preserved globe anatomy, visual acuity and retinal status."
		"'Anatomical success' defined as preserved anatomy of the globe, and absence of"
		signs of inflammation. Functional success defined as an attached retina and a
		best corrected visual acuity of better than 20/400. RESULTS: Of the six cases of
		"POFE, five were culture positive [Aspergillus flavus (1), Aspergillus fumigatus"
		"(2), Candida albicans (1) and Candida glabrata (1)] and one was smear positive"
		"for yeast. All recurred (mean recurrences, 4) despite a mean of 2.17 PPVs and"
		intravitreal amphotericin B. No recurrences were observed after IOL explantation
		"with re - PPV (median follow-up, 37 months). Pre-study defined criteria for"
		successful 'anatomical' and 'functional' outcomes were achieved in 83.3% and 50%
		respectively. CONCLUSION: This report highlights the effective role of combined
		IOL explantation with PPV in managing recurrent POFE.

TI	-	Trends in candidemia and antifungal susceptibility in a university hospital in
		Northern Ireland 2001-2006.
PG	-	174-8
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To describe the species distribution and antifungal susceptibility
		"trends for documented episodes of candidemia at the Royal Hospitals, Belfast,"
		2001-2006. METHODS: Laboratory-based retrospective observational study of all
		episodes of candidemia. RESULTS: There were 151 episodes of candidemia. The
		species recovered were: 96 C. albicans; 26 C. glabrata; 18 C. parapsilosis; five
		C. tropicalis; four C. guilliermondii; one C. famata and one C. dubliniensis. We
		separated the data into two periods 2001-2003 and 2004-2006; contrary to the
		"findings of other investigators, there was a notable trends toward increasing"
		frequency of C. albicans and decreasing frequency of non-albicans species over
		"time. Although the proportion of C. albicans, C. parapsilosis and C. tropicalis"
		"isolates susceptible to fluconazole was unchanged over time, a trend of decreased"
		susceptibility of C. glabrata to fluconazole was noted over the six-year period.
		"Overall, 73% and 7.7% of C. glabrata isolates had susceptible-dose-dependent and"
		"resistant phenotypes, respectively. The percentage of C. glabrata isolates"
		susceptible to fluconazole (MIC <8 microg/ml) decreased from 36% in 2001-2003 to
		0% in 2004-2006. Flucytosine resistance was detected in only 4 (2.7%) isolates.
		None of the isolates had an amphotericin B MIC <1 microg/ml. CONCLUSION: A shift
		towards increasing dominance of C. albicans contrasts both with reports from
		other countries and previous data from Northern Ireland. Upwards fluconazole MIC
		drift among C. glabrata has important implications for empirical therapeutic
		decisions.

AB	-	"From 2006 to 2010, a retrospective study was conducted in a university referral"
		tertiary care hospital to study the frequency and distribution of Candida species
		"in different medical specialties. The use of mechanical ventilation, central"
		"venous catheter, and urinary catheter were recorded per 1,000 patient-days and"
		the use of antifungals was calculated using defined daily dose (DDD). A total of
		313 episodes were identified and the overall incidence was 0.54 (0.41-0.71)
		"episodes per 1,000 patient-days. Candida albicans caused 44% of the overall"
		"episodes, followed by C. tropicalis (21.7%), C. parapsilosis (14.4%), C. glabrata"
		"(11.2%), and C. krusei (3.5%). The incidence of C. glabrata significantly"
		increased from 2006-2010 (range: 4.8-23.5%) (P = 0.024). Candida glabrata was
		associated with malignancies (P = 0.004) and C. krusei with hematologic
		malignancies (P < 0.0001). The use of antifungals was higher in the
		hematology/bone marrow transplant units and represented 40% of all fluconazole
		prescription in the hospital. There was no correlation with the use of
		fluconazole and the increasing ratio of C. glabrata (r = 0.60). The use of
		invasive devices was significantly higher in the intensive care units (ICUs) than
		"the medical and surgical emergencies units (P < 0.001). In contrast, the"
		"emergencies had higher incidence of candidemia (2-2.1 episodes/1,000"
		"patient-days) than the ICUs (1.6 episodes 1,000 patient-days). Candida glabrata"
		candidemia showed a significant increase in contrast to the current national
		literature where C. parapsilosis remained the most important non-C. albicans
		Candida species in Brazilian hospitals. Our findings suggested that the
		increasing incidence of C. glabrata was not associated with use of fluconazole
		and other risk factors might play an important role.

		cases and a case report.
PG	-	81-94
AB	-	BACKGROUND: The clinical and microbiological characteristics of prosthetic joint
		"infection (PJI) caused by Candida species is described, including 72 cases in the"
		literature and a case of Candida glabrata infection handled at the present
		centre. METHODS: We describe one patient and using the key words 'fungal
		prosthetic joint infection' and 'candida prosthetic joint infection' we searched
		"MEDLINE (National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD), Web of Science, CINAHL and"
		Cochrane systematic review databases for case reports of this condition. RESULTS:
		"Out of the 73 patients, 38 were female; mean age at diagnosis was 65.7 (± SD 18)"
		yrs; 50 had risk factors for candidal infection such as systemic disease (e.g.
		"rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus) and/or"
		"immunosuppressive therapy in 18 (24.6%) cases, diabetes mellitus in 14 (19.1%),"
		immunosuppression due to malignant or chronic disease in 24 (32.8%) and long-term
		antibiotic use in four (5.4%) patients. Infection site was the knee in 36
		patients and hip in 35; pain was present in 43 patients and swelling in 23 and
		the mean surgery-diagnosis interval was 32 months. The most frequent species was
		"C. albicans, followed by C. parapsilosis. The diagnosis was obtained from joint"
		fluid aspirate in 33 cases and intra-operative samples in 16. Susceptibility to
		antifungals was tested in only 21 isolates. The most frequently used antifungals
		were fluconazole and amphotericin B. Two-stage exchange arthroplasty was
		performed in 30 patients and resection arthroplasty in 31; 56 patients were cured
		with a combination of medical and surgical treatment; one patient died from the
		infection. CONCLUSION: PJI caused by Candida requires a high index of suspicion;
		surgery with long-term antifungal therapy is recommended.

		incidence and outcome.
PG	-	873-8
AB	-	"Candidemia is a serious complication in patients following allogeneic blood,"
		"marrow, and organ transplantation. Fourteen patients developed nosocomial"
		fungemia among 204 allogeneic marrow transplants performed during 1997-1999.
		Incidence of hematogenous candidiasis was 6.8 per 100 allogeneic BMT. All 14 had
		an indwelling central venous catheter (CVC) and fluconazole (100-200 mg daily)
		"was given prophylactically. In 11 (78.5%) neutropenic patients, duration between"
		"agranulocytosis and diagnosis of fungemia was (median, +/- s.d.) 10 +/- 8 days."
		"Candida glabrata (53.3%) was the most common yeast species, followed by C. krusei"
		"(33.3%), and C. parapsilosis (13.3%). Candida albicans was conspicuously absent."
		Ten patients (71.4%) had primary transplant-related complication (>2 days)
		including hemolytic uremic syndrome/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (HUS/TTP)
		"(n = 5), severe hemorrhagic cystitis (n = 3), and bacteremia (n = 2). Seven"
		(50.0%) patients expired and in three (21.4%) deaths were attributed to fungemia.
		The impact of a primary transplant-related complication on short-term survival in
		this setting was not significant (P = 0.07) (HUS/TTP (P > 0.5); neutropenia (P >
		0.5); GVHD (P = 0.35)). Removal of CVC did not alter outcome in our group (P > or
		"= 0.5) although in patients with persistent fungemia (>72 h), and those with"
		"preceding bacteremia, mortality was significantly higher (P = 0.002)."
		Conventional prognosticators of poor outcome did not adversely effect short-term
		survival in our transplant recipients with hematogenous candidiasis. The
		predominance of C. glabrata and C. krusei breakthrough infections was similar to
		"what is seen with high-dose fluconazole (400 mg) prophylaxis, and no adverse"
		effects of low-dose fluconazole in terms of increased incidence of
		non-susceptible Candida species was seen.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although not all candidemias are hospital-acquired, data"
		on clinical epidemiology for the community-onset candidemia are limited. This
		retrospective study was conducted to describe predisposing factors and outcomes
		of community-onset candidemias. METHODS: Medical records of patients who were
		"admitted to the National Taiwan University Hospital between January 1, 1995 and"
		"May 31, 2005 and had Candida isolated from their blood in the outpatient setting"
		and/or within 48 h of hospitalization (community-onset) were reviewed. RESULTS: A
		"total of 56 episodes of candidemia were reviewed, which included 8 episodes"
		(14.3%) of true community-acquired candidemia occurring in patients with no
		record of hospitalization within the previous 30 days and without histories of
		"invasive procedures either just before or at the time of admission, and 48"
		episodes (85.7%) that were health care-associated. The latter included 24
		episodes (42.9%) in patients recently discharged from hospitals (within 2-30 days
		"of current admission), 23 episodes (41.1%) associated with invasive procedures"
		"and/or central intravascular lines placed for outpatient therapy, and 1 episode"
		(1.8%) in patients admitted from nursing homes. Gastrointestinal bleeding
		"(46.4%), immunosuppressive therapy (42.9%) and previous antibiotics use (37.5%)"
		were the most common predisposing factors. Diabetes was the single most important
		predisposing factor in true community-acquired candidemia (62.5%) and had a
		significantly higher prevalence among these patients than in those with health
		care-associated candidemias (p=0.035). Candida albicans was the most common
		"isolate (39.7%), followed by Candida tropicalis (22.4%) and Candida glabrata"
		"(17.2%). The overall case fatality rate was 55.4% (31/56), and 58.1% (18/31) of"
		this was attributable to candidemia. Multivariate analysis identified higher
		severity score and lack of antifungal therapy as having an independent and
		adverse influence on outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Up to 85.7% of community-onset
		candidemias are health care-associated. There is a conceptual and practical need
		"for a new classification for the spectrum of acquisition of infection, wherein"
		the new category of health care-associated infection will have implications for
		the selection of empirical therapy.

		"rate, epidemiology, and predictors of mortality."
PG	-	570-6
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Studies conducted in tertiary care hospitals of different European
		countries and the United States have shown incidence rates of candidemia ranging
		"from 0.17 to 0.76 and 0.28 to 0.96 per 1,000 admissions, respectively. So far,"
		only 1 study has evaluated the incidence rates of candidemia in tertiary care
		hospitals in Latin American countries. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the epidemiology of
		"candidemia in 4 tertiary care hospitals in São Paulo, Brazil. DESIGN:"
		"Multicenter, laboratory-based surveillance of candidemia. RESULTS: A total of"
		"7,038 episodes of bloodstream infection were identified, and Candida species"
		accounted for 282 cases (4%). The incidence rate of candidemia was 1.66
		"candidemic episodes per 1,000 hospital admissions. Candida albicans was the most"
		"frequently isolated Candida species in all hospitals, but Candida species other"
		"than C. albicans accounted for 62% of isolates, including predominantly Candida"
		parapsilosis and Candida tropicalis. Azole resistance was restricted to only 2%
		of all Candida isolates (1 isolate of Candida glabrata and 4 isolates of Candida
		rugosa). Candidemia was mostly documented in surgical patients with long
		"durations of hospital stay. The crude mortality rate was 61%, and advanced age"
		and high Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score were both
		conditions independently associated with risk of death. CONCLUSIONS: We observed
		in our series a higher incidence rate of candidemia than that reported in
		European countries and the United States. Advanced age and a high Acute
		Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score were factors associated with a
		higher probability of death in candidemic patients. Fluconazole-resistant Candida
		strains are still a rare finding in our case-based study of candidemia.

AB	-	We report a case of arthritis due to Candida (Torulopsis) glabrata in two
		different joints at different times in the same patient. The first episode of
		arthritis was situated in the right ankle and lasted more than 1 year before the
		patient agreed to the proposed treatment. Therapy with intravenous amphotericin B
		and oral fluconazole failed. A cure was achieved with weekly intra-articular
		"administration of amphotericin B, which was continued for more than 20 weeks and"
		combined with oral itraconazole. Several weeks later the patient developed
		Candida glabrata arthritis of the left knee while still taking itraconazole.
		"Immediately, intravenous amphotericin B therapy was started and was successful."
		"Because there were no previous invasive point manipulations or trauma, the"
		infections were considered to be haematogenously disseminated. Chronic
		corticosteroid and repeated antibiotic therapy for infectious exacerbations of
		chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and alcohol abuse are the presumed risk
		factors in this otherwise immunocompetent patient.

AB	-	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Candida infections are frequent in necrotising
		pancreatitis. Candidemia is associated with very high mortality and its risk due
		to infected pancreatic necrosis is unknown. So we aimed to assess potential risk
		factors and the risk of candidemia in necrotising pancreatitis. METHODS: We
		retrospectively searched our clinical database for the diagnosis necrotising
		pancreatitis from 2007 till March 2017 and entered relevant information in a
		"database for statistical analysis. RESULTS: in total, 136 patients met the"
		inclusion criteria. Candida infected pancreatic necrosis were found in 54
		patients and 7 patients developed candidemia. Patients with Candida infected
		"necrosis had a significantly higher in hospital mortality (35.2% versus 13.4%,"
		p = 0.003). The highest mortality was observed in patients with candidemia (57.1%
		"versus 20.2%, p = 0.042). Male gender (OR 0.32, CI 0.13-0.78, p = 0.013) and"
		"post-ERCP pancreatitis (OR 4.32, CI 1.01-18.36, p = 0.048) had a significant"
		impact on the risk of Candida infections of pancreatic necrosis. Candidemia was
		significantly more frequent in patients with Candida infected necrosis (11.1%
		"versus 1.2%, p = 0.016). Candida albicans was the most common species followed by"
		Candida glabrata. CONCLUSION: Candidemia is a relevant complication of
		necrotising pancreatitis and associated with high mortality. If patients do not
		respond to antibiotic therapy empiric antifungal therapy should be discussed.

PG	-	e22343
LID	-	10.1002/jcla.22343 [doi]
LID	-	e22343
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Among the fungal pathogens, Candida species are the most common cause"
		of urinary tract infection (UTI). Some predisposing factors such as diabetes
		"mellitus, urinary retention, urinary stasis, renal transplantation, and"
		hospitalization can increase the risk of candiduria. The aim of this
		cross-sectional study was to evaluate candiduria among type 2 diabetic patients
		and identification of the Candida isolates. METHOD: Four hundred clean-catch
		midstream urine specimens were obtained from patients with type 2 diabetes
		mellitus. The specimens were centrifuged and the sediments were examined by
		direct examination and cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar. The plates were
		incubated for 2-3 days at 35°C. The Candida colonies were counted and purified
		using CHROMagar Candida. The isolates were identified by matrix-assisted laser
		desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) system.
		"RESULTS: Of the 400 urine specimens, 40 (10%) had positive cultures for Candida"
		species with a colony count of ≥1 × 10(3) colony forming units (CFU)/mL. The
		"frequencies of the Candida species were as follows: C. albicans (n = 19, 47.5%),"
		"C. glabrata (n = 15, 37.5%), C. kefyer (n = 4, 10%) and C. krusei (n = 2, 5%)."
		Seventy-three (88%) of the patients with candiduria had hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)
		levels above 7%. CONCLUSION: The rate of candiduria was relatively high in type 2
		diabetic patients and they were also suffering from a lack of proper blood
		glucose control. Although the frequency of non-albicans Candida species had not
		"significantly higher than C. albicans, however, they obtained more from those"
		with symptomatic candiduria.

		care hospitals in Spain.
PG	-	4200-6
LID	-	10.1128/JCM.00920-10 [doi]
AB	-	Candidemia studies have documented geographic differences in rates and
		"epidemiology, underscoring the need for surveillance to monitor trends. We"
		"conducted prospective candidemia surveillance in Spain to assess the incidence,"
		"species distribution, frequency of antifungal resistance, and risk factors for"
		acquiring a Candida infection. Prospective laboratory-based surveillance was
		conducted from June 2008 to June 2009 in 40 medical centers located around the
		country. A case of candidemia was defined as the isolation of a Candida species
		"from a blood culture. Incidence rates were calculated per 1,000 admissions."
		Antifungal susceptibility tests were performed by using broth microdilution assay
		according to the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute.
		"We detected 984 cases, for an overall incidence of 1.09 cases per 1,000"
		admissions. The crude mortality was 20.20%. Candida albicans was the most common
		"species (49.08%), followed by C. parapsilosis (20.73%), C. glabrata (13.61%), and"
		"C. tropicalis (10.77%). Overall, decreased susceptibility to fluconazole occurred"
		"in 69 (7.01%) incident isolates. Antifungal resistance was rare, and a moderate"
		linear correlation between fluconazole and voriconazole MICs was observed. This
		is the largest multicenter candidemia study conducted to date and shows the
		substantial morbidity and mortality of candidemia in Spain.

TI	-	Early prediction of Candida glabrata fungemia in nonneutropenic critically ill
		patients.
PG	-	826-30
LID	-	10.1097/CCM.0b013e3181cc4734 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: Candida species represent the fourth cause of nosocomial bloodstream
		infections worldwide. Because Candida glabrata has become the second most
		frequently identified yeast and because the rate of fluconazole-resistant C.
		"glabrata strains reaches 10% to 15%, initial antifungal therapy based on"
		"fluconazole in nonneutropenic hemodynamically stable patients, as recommended by"
		"current guidelines, may be an ineffective option. Our aim was to determine"
		easy-to-identify risk factors for C. glabrata fungemia likely to guide and
		improve initial antifungal therapy. DESIGN: Prospective multicenter cohort study.
		SETTING: Five French intensive care units. PATIENTS: Consecutive nonneutropenic
		patients without known Candida colonization who had blood culture-confirmed
		fungemia over a 4-yr period. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:
		A total of 8206 patients were screened. One hundred fifty-four patients with
		"blood culture-confirmed fungemia constituted the cohort, of whom 48 had C."
		glabrata fungemia and 106 had nonglabrata fungemia. Patients' baseline
		characteristics and in-intensive care unit events potentially related to C.
		glabrata fungemia were systematically recorded. Compared with patients with
		"nonglabrata fungemia, patients with C. glabrata fungemia were older and more"
		"severely ill, had received more antibiotics, and were more likely to have"
		undergone surgery. The stepwise logistic regression analysis identified six
		"independent risk factors for C. glabrata fungemia: age >60 yrs, recent abdominal"
		"surgery, interval from intensive care unit admission to first positive blood"
		"culture <or=7 days, recent use of cephalosporins, solid tumor, and absence of"
		diabetes mellitus. The model showed satisfying goodness of fit (Hosmer-Lemeshow
		statistic = .26) and discrimination (c statistic = .89). CONCLUSIONS: We found
		six early available and easy-to-identify risk factors for C. glabrata fungemia.
		"When these factors are present, alternatives to fluconazole for initial"
		antifungal therapy should be considered.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Blood cultures are approximately 50% sensitive for diagnosing
		invasive candidiasis. The T2Candida nanodiagnostic panel uses T2 magnetic
		resonance and a dedicated instrument to detect Candida directly within whole
		"blood samples. METHODS: Patients with Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida"
		"parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, or Candida krusei candidemia were identified at"
		14 centers using diagnostic blood cultures (dBCs). Follow-up blood samples were
		collected concurrently for testing by T2Candida and companion cultures (cBCs).
		"T2Candida results are reported qualitatively for C. albicans/C. tropicalis, C."
		"glabrata/C. krusei, and C. parapsilosis. T2Candida and cBCs were positive if they"
		detected a species present in the dBC. RESULTS: Median time between collection of
		"dBC and T2Candida/cBC samples in 152 patients was 55.5 hours (range, 16.4-148.4)."
		"T2Candida and cBCs were positive in 45% (69/152) and 24% (36/152) of patients,"
		"respectively (P < .0001). T2Candida clinical sensitivity was 89%, as positive"
		results were obtained in 32/36 patients with positive cBCs. Combined test results
		"were both positive (T2+/cBC+), 21% (32/152); T2+/cBC-, 24% (37/152); T2-/cBC+, 3%"
		"(4/152); and T2-/cBC-, 52% (79/152). Prior antifungal therapy, neutropenia, and"
		C. albicans candidemia were independently associated with T2Candida positivity
		and T2+/cBC- results (P values < .05). CONCLUSIONS: T2Candida was sensitive for
		diagnosing candidemia at the time of positive blood cultures. In patients
		"receiving antifungal therapy, T2Candida identified bloodstream infections that"
		were missed by cBCs. T2Candida may improve care by shortening times to Candida
		"detection and species identification compared to blood cultures, retaining"
		sensitivity during antifungal therapy and rendering active candidemia unlikely if
		results are negative. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: NCT01525095.

		common and serious disease. AIM: To analyze incidence and susceptibility profile
		of species from the genus Candida in Hospital Base Valdivia. MATERIAL AND
		METHODS: All candidemia cases presented between March 2009 and August 2011 in our
		institution were identified. Species distribution and susceptibility were studied
		through the disk diffusion method. RESULTS: Twenty-seven candidemia episodes were
		studied. Incidence varied from 0.3 to 0.7 by a thousand discharges (according to
		"clinical service). Risk factors were hospitalization, preliminary use of"
		"antibiotics, aged people and underlying disease (renal failure, heart and lung"
		"disease). The most frequent species was C. albicans, followed by C. tropicalis,"
		C. glabrata and C. krusei. Voriconazole was the antifungal showing the best in
		"vitro performance. Amphotericin B, fluconazole and itraconazole presented"
		variable results. DISCUSSION: Incidence found was superior to that described in
		"developed countries. Candida albicans constitute the most frequent species, with"
		high sensitivity levels to fluconazole; Candida no albicans species must be
		monitored. Developing new research on the topic appears as fundamental to detect
		potential epidemiological variations.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Recent reports have demonstrated a decline in bacterial bloodstream
		infections (BSIs) following adherence to central line insertion practices;
		"however, declines have been less evident for BSIs due to Candida species."
		"METHODS: We conducted active, population-based laboratory surveillance for"
		"candidemia in metropolitan Atlanta, GA and Baltimore, MD over a 5-year period. We"
		calculated annual candidemia incidence and antifungal drug resistance rates.
		"RESULTS: We identified 3,848 candidemia cases from 2008-2013. Compared with 2008,"
		"candidemia incidence per 100,000 person-years decreased significantly by 2013 in"
		"both locations (GA: 14.1 to 9.5, p<0.001; MD: 30.9 to 14.4, p<0.001). A total of"
		"3,255 cases (85%) had a central venous catheter (CVC) in place within 2 days"
		"before the BSI culture date. In both locations, the number of CVC-associated"
		"cases declined (GA: 473 to 294; MD: 384 to 151). Candida albicans (CA, 36%) and"
		"Candida glabrata (CG, 27%) were the most common species recovered. In both"
		"locations, the proportion of cases with fluconazole resistance decreased (GA:"
		"8.0% to 7.1%, -10%; MD: 6.6% to 4.9%, -25%), while the proportion of cases with"
		"an isolate resistant to an echinocandin increased (GA: 1.2% to 2.9%, +147%; MD:"
		"2.0% to 3.5%, +77%). Most (74%) echinocandin-resistant isolates were CG; 17 (<1%)"
		"isolates were resistant to both drug categories (multidrug resistant [MDR], 16/17"
		were CG). The proportion of CG cases with MDR Candida increased from 1.8% to
		2.6%. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a significant decline in the incidence of
		"candidemia over a five-year period, and increases in echinocandin-resistant and"
		MDR Candida. Efforts to strengthen infection control practices may be preventing
		candidemia among high-risk patients. Further surveillance for resistant Candida
		is warranted.

		Jordan.
PG	-	103-7
AB	-	Due to the rising importance of Candida glabrata and other non-albicans Candida
		"as principle human opportunistic pathogens, 356 women with abnormal vaginal"
		"discharge who attended a private obstetrics and gynecology clinic in Amman,"
		"Jordan, between January 1999 and February 2001 were examined. The isolation rate"
		of Candida spp. from high-vaginal swabs was 44.9%. CHROMagar Candida and
		"conventional mycological methods identified six isolated Candida spp., including"
		"C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, C. krusei, and C."
		"kefyr. The percentages of C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. tropicalis isolates"
		"were 43.1%, 32.5%, and 8.1%, respectively. C. albicans was isolated in"
		combination with C. tropicalis and C. krusei in two patients. Statistical
		analysis of the present results clearly show an increase in the incidence of
		"vulvovaginal candidiasis caused by C. glabrata in the two study periods,"
		"1994-1996 and 1999-2001 (P = 0.0186). In contrast, comparing the proportions of"
		"vulvovaginal candidiasis caused by C. albicans in the two periods, there was no"
		"significant difference. These results may have significant clinical implications,"
		as C. glabrata are innately less susceptible to most antifungal agents than C.
		albicans; these findings support viewing this organism as a major pathogen.

AB	-	"Many uncommon Candida spp. (species other than C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, C."
		"glabrata, C. tropicalis, and C. krusei) have been shown to emerge in tertiary"
		care facilities. We aimed to investigate these uncommon candidemia in children.
		Forty-six cases of candidemia caused by uncommon Candida spp. were identified
		during 2003-2015 from a medical center in Taiwan. The most common specie was C.
		"guilliermondii (31.2%), followed by C. lusitaniae (18.8%) and C. metapsilosis"
		(18.8%). These cases were analyzed and compared with 148 episodes of C. albicans
		candidemia. The incidence density of uncommon Candida spp. candidemia and the
		proportion to all candidemia episodes increased substantively during the study
		"period. Prior exposure to azoles was uncommon in the 30 days prior to infection,"
		"but fluconazole resistant strains were significantly more common (n = 19, 41.3%)."
		The increased incidence density of uncommon Candida spp. candidemia was
		associated with increasing use of antifungal agents. No differences in
		"demographics, underlying comorbidities, risk factors, clinical features,"
		"dissemination, and 30-day mortality were found between uncommon Candida spp. and"
		C. albicans candidemia. Patients with uncommon Candida spp. candidemia were more
		likely to require modifications in antifungal treatment and receive echinocandin
		"drugs (43.5% vs 21.6%, p = 0.007). Candidemia caused by uncommon Candida spp. had"
		"poorer response to antifungal treatment, led to longer duration of candidemia"
		"(median 4.0 versus 2.5 days, p = 0.008), and had a higher treatment failure rate"
		"(56.5% vs 38.5%, p = 0.040)."

		incidence of fungaemia and numbers of isolates with reduced azole susceptibility.
PG	-	487-94
LID	-	10.1111/j.1469-0691.2008.01954.x [doi]
AB	-	A semi-national laboratory-based surveillance programme for fungaemia was
		initiated in 2003 that now covers c. 3.5 million inhabitants (64%) of the Danish
		"population. In total, 1089 episodes of fungaemia were recorded during 2004-2006,"
		corresponding to an annual incidence of 10.4/100 000 inhabitants. The annual
		number of episodes increased by 17% during the study period. Candida spp.
		accounted for 98% of the fungal pathogens. Although Candida albicans remained
		"predominant, the proportion of C. albicans decreased from 66.1% in 2004 to 53.8%"
		"in 2006 (p <0.01), and varied considerably among participating departments, e.g.,"
		from 51.1% at a university hospital in Copenhagen to 67.6% in North Jutland
		"County. Candida glabrata ranked second, and increased in proportion from 16.7% to"
		"22.7% (p 0.04). Candida krusei was isolated rarely (4.1%), but the proportion"
		doubled during the study period from 3.2% to 6.4% (p 0.06). MIC distributions of
		amphotericin B and caspofungin were in close agreement with the patterns
		"predicted by species identification; however, decreased susceptibility to"
		"voriconazole, defined as an MIC of >1 mg/L, was detected in one (2.5%) C."
		"glabrata isolate in 2004 and in 12 (14.0%) isolates in 2006 (p 0.03). Overall,"
		the proportion of isolates with decreased susceptibility to fluconazole exceeded
		30% in 2006. The incidence of fungaemia in Denmark was three-fold higher than
		that reported from other Nordic countries and is increasing. Decreased
		"susceptibility to fluconazole is frequent, and a new trend towards C. glabrata"
		isolates with elevated voriconazole MICs was observed.

		or aortic graft with an adjacent loop of the bowel. Aortic graft erosion is a
		rare complication of abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. We describe a case of a
		patient presenting with sepsis from Candida glabrata fungemia secondary to
		aortoenteric erosion without any symptoms or signs of gastrointestinal bleeding.
		This is a unique case of Candida glabrata fungemia from aortoenteric graft
		erosion. Case Summary. This patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of a
		prior aortobifemoral bypass graft in 2005. He presented with complaints of right
		paraspinal pain and chills. He had no symptoms of gastrointestinal bleeding or
		"abdominal pain. His white blood cell count was 25,600/mcl (4,000-11,000/mcL) with"
		"left shift. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 11 mm/hr (0-38 mm/hr), and"
		C-reactive protein was 95.5 mg/L (<=10.0 mg/L). Blood cultures were obtained and
		eventually grew Candida glabrata. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of
		abdomen and pelvis demonstrated inflammation surrounding the graft concerning for
		graft infection with additional inflammatory changes tracking down both femoral
		limbs. He underwent staged bilateral femoralaxillary bypass followed by the
		excision of aortobifemoral bypass. CONCLUSION: Patients with aortoenteric erosion
		can present with sepsis in absence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Emergent
		computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of abdomen and pelvis should be performed to
		assess for aortic graft erosion or fistula. Empiric treatment with antibiotics
		should include antifungal agent like micafungin until the final culture is
		"reported. The definite management is an extra anatomic bypass, followed by graft"
		excision.

PG	-	478-83
AB	-	The epidemiological features of 37 episodes of candidemia in HIV-infected
		subjects were analysed in a retrospective matched case-control study conducted
		over an 8-year period (1990-1997). Univariate analysis identified eight risk
		factors that were significantly associated with candidemia (P<0.05): i) use of
		central venous catheters; ii) administration of total parenteral nutrition; iii)
		previous antifungal therapy; iv) previous therapy with glycopeptides; v) presence
		of oral/ esophageal candidiasis; vi) concomitant bacterial infections; vii)
		neutropenia; and viii) concomitant AIDS dementia complex. Stepwise logistic
		regression analysis revealed that the only independent risk factor for developing
		candidemia was the use of central venous catheters (P = 0.0001). Candida albicans
		"was the most frequently isolated pathogen, accounting for 18 (48%) episodes of"
		"candidemia, followed by Candida tropicalis (19%) and Candida glabrata (11%). The"
		crude mortality rate was 62%. On univariate analysis concomitant opportunistic
		"infections, presence of non-Candida albicans species of Candida and neutropenia"
		were shown to be predictive of death. Multivariate analysis revealed that the
		presence of non-Candida albicans strains of Candida was the only significant
		"factor associated with a worse prognosis (P = 0.001). In conclusion, candidemia"
		appears to be more common in patients with advanced HIV disease. Of the factors
		"which influenced the onset of candidemia, use of central venous catheters seemed"
		to be the most important one.

TI	-	Population-Based Active Surveillance for Culture-Confirmed Candidemia - Four
		"Sites, United States, 2012-2016."
PG	-	15-Jan
LID	-	10.15585/mmwr.ss6808a1 [doi]
AB	-	PROBLEM/CONDITION: Candidemia is a bloodstream infection (BSI) caused by yeasts
		in the genus Candida. Candidemia is one of the most common health care-associated
		"BSIs in the United States, with all-cause in-hospital mortality of up to 30%."
		PERIOD COVERED: 2012-2016. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: CDC's Emerging Infections
		"Program (EIP), a collaboration among CDC, state health departments, and academic"
		"partners that was established in 1995, was used to conduct active,"
		population-based laboratory surveillance for candidemia in 22 counties in four
		"states (Georgia, Maryland, Oregon, and Tennessee) with a combined population of"
		approximately 8 million persons. Laboratories serving the catchment areas were
		recruited to report candidemia cases to the local EIP program staff. A case was
		defined as a blood culture that was positive for a Candida species collected from
		a surveillance area resident during 2012-2016. Isolates were sent to CDC for
		species confirmation and antifungal susceptibility testing. Any subsequent blood
		cultures with Candida within 30 days of the initial positive culture in the same
		patient were considered part of the same case. Trained surveillance officers
		"collected clinical information from the medical chart for all cases, and isolates"
		were sent to CDC for species confirmation and antifungal susceptibility testing.
		"RESULTS: Across all sites and surveillance years (2012-2016), 3,492 cases of"
		candidemia were identified. The crude candidemia incidence averaged across sites
		"and years during 2012-2016 was 8.7 per 100,000 population; important differences"
		"in incidence were found by site, age group, sex, and race. The crude annual"
		"incidence was the highest in Maryland (14.1 per 100,000 population) and lowest in"
		"Oregon (4.0 per 100,000 population). The crude annual incidence of candidemia was"
		"highest among adults aged ≥65 years (25.5 per 100,000 population) followed by"
		infants aged <1 year (15.8). The crude annual incidence was higher among males
		(9.4) than among females (8.0) and was approximately 2 times greater among blacks
		than among nonblacks (13.7 versus 5.8). Ninety-six percent of cases occurred in
		patients who were hospitalized at the time of or during the week after having a
		positive culture. One third of cases occurred in patients who had undergone a
		"surgical procedure in the 90 days before the candidemia diagnosis, 77% occurred"
		in patients who had received systemic antibiotics in the 14 days before the
		"diagnosis, and 73% occurred in patients who had had a central venous catheter"
		(CVC) in place within 2 days before the diagnosis. Ten percent were in patients
		who had used injection drugs in the past 12 months. The median time from
		admission to candidemia diagnosis was 5 days (interquartile range [IQR]: 0-16
		"days). Among 2,662 cases that were treated in adults aged >18 years, 34% were"
		"treated with fluconazole alone, 30% with echinocandins alone, and 34% with both."
		"The all-cause, in-hospital case-fatality ratio was 25% for any time after"
		admission; the all-cause in-hospital case-fatality ratio was 8% for <48 hours
		after a positive culture for Candida species. Candida albicans accounted for 39%
		"of cases, followed by Candida glabrata (28%) and Candida parapsilosis (15%)."
		"Overall, 7% of isolates were resistant to fluconazole and 1.6% were resistant to"
		"echinocandins, with no clear trends in resistance over the 5-year surveillance"
		"period. INTERPRETATION: Approximately nine out of 100,000 persons developed"
		culture-positive candidemia annually in four U.S. sites. The youngest and oldest
		"persons, men, and blacks had the highest incidences of candidemia. Patients with"
		candidemia identified in the surveillance program had many of the typical risk
		"factors for candidemia, including recent surgery, exposure to broad-spectrum"
		"antibiotics, and presence of a CVC. However, an unexpectedly high proportion of"
		candidemia cases (10%) occurred in patients with a history of injection drug use
		"(IDU), suggesting that IDU has become a common risk factor for candidemia. Deaths"
		"associated with candidemia remain high, with one in four cases resulting in death"
		during hospitalization. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: Active surveillance for candidemia
		yielded important information about the disease incidence and death rate and
		"persons at greatest risk. The surveillance was expanded to nine sites in 2017,"
		which will improve understanding of the geographic variability in candidemia
		incidence and associated clinical and demographic features. This surveillance
		"will help monitor incidence trends, track emergence of resistance and species"
		"distribution, monitor changes in underlying conditions and predisposing factors,"
		"assess trends in antifungal treatment and outcomes, and be helpful for those"
		developing prevention efforts. IDU has emerged as an important risk factor for
		"candidemia, and interventions to prevent invasive fungal infections in this"
		population are needed. Surveillance data documenting that approximately two
		"thirds of candidemia cases were caused by species other than C. albicans, which"
		"are generally associated with greater antifungal resistance than C. albicans, and"
		the presence of substantial fluconazole resistance supports 2016 clinical
		guidelines recommending a switch from fluconazole to echinocandins as the initial
		treatment for candidemia in most patients.

PG	-	S9-S12
LID	-	10.3928/23258160-20190108-03 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To evaluate an application of fluorescence in situ
		hybridization (FISH) for the rapid identification of bacterial and fungal
		pathogens causing endophthalmitis and keratitis and compare time to detection
		with other laboratory methods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Culture-positive isolates
		obtained from vitreous and corneal samples were tested. Organisms tested were
		"Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"
		"Candida albicans, C. glabrata, and C. parapsilosis. Inoculi were prepared to a"
		final concentration between 1 × 10(2) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL to 1 × 10(8)
		CFU/mL. Samples were hybridized with peptide nucleic acid probes for pathogens
		"using the QuickFISH protocol (AdvanDx; OpGen, Gaithersburg, MD), and the slides"
		"were read with fluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: Of the 29 total isolates tested,"
		28 yielded positive identification. S. aureus was identified in four out of five
		"vitreous samples, whereas coagulase-negative staphylococci were identified in all"
		vitreous samples. Mixed staphylococci culture was identified in all samples. P.
		"aeruginosa was identified in all six keratitis samples. C. albicans, C. glabrata,"
		"C. parapsilosis, and mixed fungal culture were identified respectively in eight"
		of eight samples at minimal concentration of 1 × 10(4) CFU/mL. There were no
		false-negatives. Time to detection was 20 minutes after the 12- to 18-hour
		inoculation period and provided an identification 6 hours sooner than by
		polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and 1 to 2 days sooner than by routine culture.
		"CONCLUSIONS: This small study demonstrates the sensitive, specific, and rapid"
		"detection of gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria and fungi using FISH"
		probes in isolates from endophthalmitis and keratitis samples. This method
		decreases time to identification and reduces labor intensity compared with
		routine PCR and culture methods. [Ophthalmic Surg Lasers Imaging Retina.

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of Candida
		spp. in periodontitis patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS: This
		cross-sectional study included 42 diabetic patients with periodontitis (aged
		21-70 years; 18 males and 24 females). Clinical measurements included probing
		"pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)"
		levels. Sub-gingival samples were collected from the mesio-buccal aspect of 3
		"teeth for fungal analysis. Candida species, including Candida albicans, Candida"
		"dubliniensis, Candida tropicalis and Candida glabrata, were identified using Gram"
		"staining, the germ tube test, CHROMagar, Staib agar and API 20C AUX. RESULTS: The"
		overall prevalence of Candida in diabetic patients with periodontitis observed in
		our study was 52%. The most common spp. of Candida identified were C. albicans
		"(38%), followed by C. dubliniensis (9.5%), C. tropicalis (4.7%) and C. glabrata"
		"(4.7%). Compared to females, male patients were characterized by increased levels"
		of Candida infections. Our results also indicate that individuals over the age of
		40 had increased levels of Candida infections compared to patients younger than
		40. Candida infections were higher among subjects with elevated blood sugar
		levels (HbA1c>9) compared to individuals with well-controlled blood sugar levels
		(HbA1c<6). Patients with PPDs≥5 had an increased risk of Candida infection
		compared to patients with PPDs between 3 and 4. CONCLUSION: This study indicates
		that the frequency of C. albicans is higher than the frequencies of C.
		"dubliniensis, C. tropicalis and C. glabrata in diabetic patients with"
		periodontitis. Candida infections were observed at increased frequencies among
		subjects with high blood sugar levels and PPDs≥5.

AB	-	Candida osteomyelitis is a rare infection. We present 17 cases of Candida
		osteomyelitis from our institution and review 194 patients from the literature.
		"The median age of patients was 57 ± 22 years (range, 18-90 years) with 68% male."
		"Comorbidities associated with this infection include prior surgery (62%),"
		"broad-spectrum antibiotics (40%), central venous catheter insertion (19%), and"
		immunosuppression (17%). The most common infecting species were Candida albicans
		"(69%), Candida tropicalis (15%), and Candida glabrata (8%). Most initial"
		"antifungal regimens included amphotericin B (59%); however, fluconazole is"
		increasingly being utilized for treatment of this infection (26%). Echinocandins
		"were used infrequently (4%). Median length of treatment was 3 ± 4.5 months (mean,"
		"4.2 months; range, 18 days to 36 months). The overall success rate of therapy was"
		"91%, with 75% of patients cured by 6 months. The crude mortality rate was 12%"
		with an attributable mortality rate of 6%.

TI	-	Molecular characterization and antifungal susceptibility testing of Candida
		nivariensis from blood samples - an Iranian multicentre study and a review of the
		literature.
PG	-	770-777
LID	-	10.1099/jmm.0.000963 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: Identification of the emerging yeast species Candida nivariensis among
		presumptively identified Iranian Candida glabrata isolates. METHODOLOGY: Clinical
		"C. glabrata species complex isolates from blood (n=71; 33.3 %), urine (n=100;"
		"46.9 %), vaginal swabs (n=20;9.4 %), BAL (n=10; 4.7 %), and sputum (n=12; 5.6 %)"
		"from Iran were investigated. Isolates were characterized by CHROMagar, multiplex"
		"PCRs, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass"
		"spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP)"
		"fingerprinting, internal transcribed spacer (ITS)/large subunit (LSU) rDNA and"
		"FKS1/FKS2 sequencing, and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility"
		Testing broth microdilution method. A comprehensive literature review was
		conducted and all the relevant clinical and microbiological data were collected.
		RESULTS: Four C. nivariensis isolates were recovered from blood samples of three
		"subjects and were all consistently identified by nine-plex PCR, Bruker MALDI-TOF"
		"MS, and LSU and ITS rDNA sequencing. AFLP genotyping clustered the isolates into"
		two groups. Sequencing of the FKS1 and FKS2 hotspots showed no accountable amino
		"acid substitutions. All isolates were susceptible to amphotericin B, fluconazole,"
		"itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, anidulafungin and micafungin."
		"CONCLUSION: In total, 4 out of 213 clinical C. glabrata species complex"
		candidemia isolates were C. nivariensis. Improvement of the BioMerieux Vitek MS
		database is required to accurately identify C. nivariensis and it is advised to
		alternatively use CHROMagar and/or PCR-based techniques. As other species within
		the Nakaseomyces clade may cause infection and showed high MIC values for
		"antifungals, inclusion of their spectra into the MALDI-TOF MS database seems"
		relevant. Due to developing resistance to fluconazole and insufficient efficacy
		"of caspofungin, the combination of catheter removal plus treatment with"
		"caspofungin, or voriconazole, or micafungin might be effective for patients."

PG	-	R115
LID	-	10.1186/cc7964 [doi]
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Candidaemia in critically-ill intensive care unit (ICU) patients is
		associated with high crude mortality. Determinants of mortality--particularly
		those amenable to potential modification--are incompletely defined. METHODS: A
		nationwide prospective clinical and microbiological cohort study of all episodes
		of ICU-acquired candidaemia occurring in non-neutropenic adults was undertaken in
		Australian ICUs between 2001 and 2004. Multivariate Cox regression analyses were
		performed to determine independently significant variables associated with
		mortality. RESULTS: 183 episodes of ICU-acquired candidaemia occurred in 183
		"patients during the study period. Of the 179 with microbiological data, Candida"
		"albicans accounted for 111 (62%) episodes and Candida glabrata, 32 (18%). Outcome"
		data were available for 173: crude hospital mortality at 30 days was 56%. Host
		"factors (older age, ICU admission diagnosis, mechanical ventilation and ICU"
		admission diagnosis) and failure to receive systemic antifungal therapy were
		significantly associated with mortality on multivariate analysis. Among the
		"subset who received initial fluconazole therapy (n = 93), the crude mortality was"
		"52%. Host factors (increasing age and haemodialysis receipt), but not organism-"
		"(Candida species, fluconazole MIC), pharmacokinetic- (fluconazole dose, time to"
		"initiation), or pharmacodynamic-related parameters (fluconazole dose:MIC ratio)"
		were associated with mortality. Process of care measures advocated in recent
		guidelines were implemented inconsistently: follow-up blood cultures were
		"obtained in 68% of patients, central venous catheters removed within five days in"
		80% and ophthalmological examination performed in 36%. CONCLUSIONS: Crude
		mortality remains high in Australian ICU patients with candidaemia and is
		overwhelmingly related to host factors but not treatment variables (the time to
		initiation of antifungals or fluconazole pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
		factors). The role and timing of early antifungal intervention in critically-ill
		ICU patients requires further investigation.

PG	-	851-859
LID	-	10.1111/myc.13325 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Although fungi are found relatively easily by microscopic examination
		"of pathological samples, identification of fungal genus and species in"
		pathological samples is not easy because the morphological features of fungi are
		similar among genera and species. OBJECTIVES: A multiple real-time PCR was
		"developed for identification of fungal genus/species, and morphological"
		characterizations of fungi were analysed in pathological samples.
		PATIENTS/METHODS: Seventy-five formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples
		morphologically proven to contain any fungus were examined. A multiple real-time
		PCR system was developed to identify 25 fungal genus/species in pathological
		samples. Morphology of fungus in the specimens was re-reviewed retrospectively
		based on the results of real-time PCR. RESULTS: Real-time PCR identified fungal
		genus/species in 56 of 75 (74.6%) specimens with histologically proven fungal
		"infection. In 53 specimens of filamentous fungi, Aspergillus spp. (22 specimens),"
		"Cladosporium (8), Scedosporium apiospermum (4), Malassezia sympodialis (1) and"
		Candida albicans (1) were identified. Pseudohyphae of Candida were confused with
		filamentous fungus in a case. Morphological observation suggested differences in
		"the presence of septated or non-septated hyphae, the filament size, and the"
		"branch angle among genus/species of filamentous fungi; however, genus/species was"
		not able to be determined by their morphological features. In 22 specimens of
		"yeasts, real-time PCR allowed for the identification of Candida albicans (12"
		"specimens), Candida glabrata (2), Cladosporium (2), Scedosporium apiospermum (2),"
		Pichia kudriavzevii (1) and Aspergillus sydowii (1). CONCLUSIONS: These data
		suggest that it is difficult to identify fungal genus/species by morphological
		features alone. Real-time PCR is useful to identify fungal genus/species in
		pathological samples.

TI	-	Intestinal aGVHD and infection after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
PG	-	802-6
AB	-	BACKGROUND: We aimed to guide clinical nursing by studying the relationship
		between intestinal acute graft-versus-host disease and intestinal infection after
		hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. MATERIAL/METHODS: We present an
		"effective nursing method by comparing and analyzing the degree, duration time,"
		"and volume of diarrhea, and the distribution of pathogens in 44 patients who"
		developed intestinal aGVHD after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (24
		patients with no intestinal infection). RESULTS: 21.4% of patients with grade
		I-II intestinal aGVHD developed into intestinal infection and 87.5% of patients
		with grade III-IV intestinal aGVHD developed into intestinal infection (P<0.05).
		Higher mortality was found in the grade III-IV intestinal aGVHD patients with
		intestinal infection. Patient age had no effect on the incidence of GVHD
		according to our data (P<0.05). We found remarkable differences in the amount and
		duration of diarrhea between patients with and without intestinal infection
		(P<0.05). The most common pathogens cultivated were Candida glabrata (24%) and
		Candida albicans (22.67%). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of intestinal infection
		increased remarkably after intestinal aGVHD occurred. Severe aGVHD can easily
		lead to fungus infection. Nursing care can decrease the incidence of intestinal
		infection in aGVHD.

TI	-	Fungal eye disease at a tertiary care center: the utility of routine inpatient
		consultation.
PG	-	1671-6
LID	-	10.1016/j.ophtha.2011.01.038 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: Hematogenous dissemination of fungus of the eyes can manifest as
		chorioretinitis or endophthalmitis. Early reports of this condition describe the
		"prevalence to range from 10% to 40%; however, more recent studies have suggested"
		"a declining prevalence, presumably because of widespread use of prophylactic"
		antifungal therapy and earlier diagnosis and treatment of systemic illness before
		ocular symptoms become apparent. This study estimates the current prevalence and
		microbial profile of fungal chorioretinitis and endophthalmitis among patients
		with positive fungal cultures at a tertiary care medical center. DESIGN:
		Retrospective case series. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 211 adult and pediatric
		inpatients with fungemia. METHODS: All inpatient consultations at our institution
		"to evaluate for ocular involvement by fungal organisms from June 3, 2006, to"
		"September 3, 2009, were reviewed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The presence or absence"
		of ocular lesions consistent with disseminated fungus. RESULTS: A total of 211
		"patients (83 pediatric, 128 adult) had consult requests indicating concern for"
		ocular fungal infection. More than 97% of these patients had at least 1 positive
		"fungal culture. In decreasing order of frequency, the organisms identified were"
		"Candida albicans, C. parapsilosis, C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, and others. More"
		than 98% of all patients were receiving systemic antifungal therapy (average
		duration 6.5 days) at the time of examination. No pediatric patients and only 2
		"adult patients had positive findings (i.e., chorioretinitis or endophthalmitis);"
		1 of these 2 patients was able to verbalize symptoms and reported floaters and
		"blurring, whereas the other patient was unable to verbalize. Visual symptoms were"
		rare (3.5%) among patients with negative findings who could verbalize visual
		symptoms. Three adults had nonspecific fundus lesions that were considered
		inconsistent with chorioretinitis. CONCLUSIONS: Disseminated ocular fungal
		infection is rare in the current era of widespread prophylactic antifungal
		therapy. Less than 1% of patients in our study had ocular involvement from
		"fungus, and no patients who were asymptomatic had involvement. We suggest that"
		routine ophthalmic consultation on fungemic inpatients is not an efficient use of
		"clinical resources; however, validation of these findings via a prospective study"
		is desired. FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE(S): The author(s) have no proprietary or
		commercial interest in any materials discussed in this article.

TI	-	Candidemia and candiduria in critically ill patients admitted to intensive care
		"units in France: incidence, molecular diversity, management and outcome."
PG	-	292-9
AB	-	"OBJECTIVE: To determine the concomitant incidence, molecular diversity,"
		management and outcome of nosocomial candidemia and candiduria in intensive care
		unit (ICU) patients in France. DESIGN: A 1-year prospective observational study
		in 24 adult ICUs. PATIENTS: Two hundred and sixty-two patients with nosocomial
		candidemia and/or candiduria. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Blood and urine samples
		were collected when signs of sepsis were present. Antifungal susceptibility of
		"Candida strains was determined; in addition, all blood and 72% of urine C."
		albicans isolates were analyzed by using multi-locus sequence type (MLST). The
		"mean incidences of candidemia and candiduria were 6.7 and 27.4/1000 admissions,"
		respectively. Eight percent of candiduric patients developed candidemia with the
		same species. The mean interval between ICU admission and candidemia was 19.0 +/-
		"2.9 days, and 17.2 +/- 1.1 days for candiduria. C. albicans and C. glabrata were"
		isolated in 54.2% and 17% of blood and 66.5% and 21.6% of urine Candida-positive
		"cultures, respectively. Fluconazole was the most frequently prescribed agent. In"
		"all candidemic patients, the prescribed curative antifungal agent was active in"
		vitro against the responsible identified strain. Crude ICU mortality was 61.8%
		for candidemic and 31.3% for candiduric patients. Seventy-five percent of the
		patients were infected with a unique C. albicans strain; cross-transmission
		between seven patients was suggested in one hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Candidemia is
		late-onset ICU-acquired infection associated with high mortality. No difference
		in susceptibility and genetic background were found between blood and urine
		strains of Candida species.

TI	-	Candiduria in kidney transplant recipients: Is antifungal therapy useful?
PG	-	298-304
LID	-	10.1111/myc.12740 [doi]
AB	-	A French single-centre retrospective study between 2010 and 2014 was undertaken
		"to assess candiduria's incidence in kidney transplant recipients (KTR), and the"
		use and impact of antifungal treatment on outcome. Candiduria was defined as a
		"urine culture with ≥10(3)  cfu/mL of Candida species. Candiduria clearance,"
		severe complications and death rates were estimated by Kaplan-Meier methods and
		the effect of treatment by Cox models. 52/1223 (4.3%) KTR had ≥1 episode of
		"candiduria, 42 (81%) were females, 18 (35%) had diabetes, with an incidence of"
		2.3/100 person-year of follow-up. Candiduria was asymptomatic in 51 (98%)
		patients. Candida glabrata was the most frequent pathogen identified. Overall
		fungal clearance rate was 89%. Antifungal therapy was initiated in only 14
		"episodes (12%), according to guidelines. Three patients (6%) developed severe"
		"complications in the first 2 weeks after transplantation, and 8 (15%) died."
		"Antifungal treatment had no impact on candiduria clearance (HR, 0.6; 95% CI,"
		"0.3-1.1; P = .10), on recurrence rate (HR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.1-2.3; P = .41) and on"
		"the risk of severe complications or death (HR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.3-4.8; P = .89)."
		Candiduria is rare and usually asymptomatic among KTR. Candiduria management in
		the immediate post-transplant period deserves careful attention.

TI	-	Candidemia in solid organ transplant recipients in Spain: Epidemiological trends
		and determinants of outcome.
PG	-	e13195
LID	-	10.1111/tid.13195 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Despite being considered a high-risk population for invasive fungal
		"disease, specific features of candidemia among solid organ transplant (SOT)"
		recipients remain poorly characterized. METHODS: We compiled prospective data
		from two multicenter studies on candidemia performed over two consecutive periods
		in Spain: the CANDIPOP Study (2010-2011) and the CANDI-Bundle Study (2016-2018).
		Episodes diagnosed in adult SOT recipients in 10 participating centers were
		included. Risk factors for clinical failure (all-cause 7-day mortality and/or
		persistent candidemia for ≥72 hours) and 30-day mortality were investigated by
		univariate analysis. RESULTS: We included 55 episodes of post-transplant
		candidemia (32 and 23 of which occurred during the first and second periods).
		Kidney (38.2%) and liver recipients (30.9%) were the most common populations.
		Candida albicans accounted for 27.3% of episodes. The proportion of C glabrata
		increased over time (18.8% vs 30.4% for the first and second periods). There were
		no differences in the rate of fluconazole non-susceptible isolates (50.0% vs
		"60.0%, respectively). Clinical failure and 30-day mortality occurred in 25.5% and"
		27.3% of episodes and were associated with the severity of candidemia (Pitt score
		and severe sepsis/septic shock). Kidney transplantation (unadjusted odds ratio
		"[uOR]: 0.17; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.03-0.85; P-value = .020), early"
		"catheter removal (uOR: 0.15; 95% CI: 0.03-0.76; P-value = .013), and appropriate"
		early antifungal therapy (uOR: 0.14; 95% CI: 0.02-0.89; P-value = .041) were
		protective for 30-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: High rates of non-albicans species
		and fluconazole non-susceptibility must be taken into account to optimize
		therapeutic management and outcomes in SOT recipients with candidemia.

TI	-	Candidemia in a pediatric intensive care unit.
PG	-	369-74
AB	-	"OBJECTIVE: To examine the incidence, epidemiology, and clinical characteristics"
		of candidemia in a pediatric intensive care unit. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort
		study. SETTING: Pediatric intensive care unit of a tertiary care teaching and
		referral hospital in north India. SUBJECTS: All patients with candidemia from
		March 1993 to December 1996. INTERVENTIONS: Patient-related data were analyzed to
		"study candidemia in relation to reason for fungal culture, underlying medical"
		"conditions, predisposing factors, Candida isolates, antimicrobial and antifungal"
		"treatment, and deaths. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Sixty-four patients with"
		candidemia were identified. The Candida species isolated were Candida tropicalis
		"(48.4%), C. albicans (29.7%), C. guillermondii (14.1%), C. krusei (6.3%), and C."
		glabrata (1.6%). Thirty-three patients were detected by a high-risk surveillance
		"blood culture, whereas 31 patients were detected while undergoing septic workup."
		Sixteen (25%) patients were asymptomatic; they recovered without any antifungal
		"therapy and without any sequelae. Of 48 symptomatic patients, 11 died before"
		institution of antifungal therapy; 37 received oral itraconazole (10
		mg.kg(-1).day(-1)). Seven (19%) of these 37 patients died. Those who recovered
		"had sterile culture on average by day 14 (range, 4-30) and received the"
		"antifungal therapy on average for 24 days (range, 9-42 days). Overall mortality"
		"rate was 28.1%, and bivariate analysis showed significant association with"
		"Pediatric Risk of Mortality score (p =.0001), presence of symptoms (p =.003),"
		isolation of nonalbicans Candida in general (p =.04) and C. tropicalis
		"specifically (p =.001), and failure to give presumptive antifungal therapy (p"
		"=.055). On multivariate analysis, Pediatric Risk of Mortality score and isolation"
		of C. tropicalis were the only significant predictors of mortality. CONCLUSIONS:
		Nonalbicans Candida accounted for 70% of candidemia in a pediatric intensive care
		unit. High-risk surveillance blood cultures aided diagnosis in about half the
		patients. Severity of illness and isolation of C. tropicalis were significant
		predictors of mortality.

TI	-	Distributions and antifungal susceptibility of Candida species from mucosal sites
		in HIV positive patients.
PG	-	282-7
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Mucocutaneous candidiasis (almost endogenous) is one of the most
		common manifestations of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The aim of
		"this study was the investigation of colonization patterns of Candida species,"
		"particularly C. dubliniensis, among mucosal sites of HIV-positive patients and"
		determining corresponding in vitro susceptibility patterns to the antifungals.
		"METHODS: From July 2006 to May 2008, specimens from the mucosal sites of 273"
		seropositive HIV patients were collected for Candida colonization. All isolates
		were identified by standard methods and carbohydrate assimilation patterns.
		Isolates phenotypically identified as C. albicans or C. dubliniensis were
		subjected to molecular identification. Susceptibility patterns of the isolated
		species to seven antifungal agents were determined using the broth microdilution
		method. RESULTS: The 359 samples from mucosal sites which consisted of 273 oral
		and 86 vaginal were collected and evaluated for Candida species distributions and
		their corresponding susceptibility patterns. The most commonly isolated species
		"were: C. albicans (50%) followed by C. glabrata (21.4%), C. dubliniensis (13.3%,"
		"reported for the first time in Iran), C. krusei (9.8%), C. kefyr (3.1%), C."
		"parapsilosis (1.6%), and C. tropicalis (0.8%). All species were sensitive to"
		"amphotencin B, ketoconazole, nystatin, voriconazole, and caspofungin. In some"
		"isolates, resistance to fluconazole and itraconazole was noted. CONCLUSION: As"
		"demonstrated, resistance to fluconazole and itraconazole, the most frequent"
		antifungals in use in the region suggests regular investigation into antifungal
		resistance in medical centers should be undertaken in order to promote the
		effective management of invasive candidiasis in HIV/AIDS patients.

TI	-	Identification of Candida strains isolated from Tanzanian pregnant women with
		vaginal candidiasis.
PG	-	226-34
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To identify Candida strains isolated from Tanzanian women (13 to 45
		years) with vaginal candidiasis. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. SETTING:
		"Antenatal clinic in Ilala district hospital in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania from March"
		1998 to December 2000. RESULTS: The identities of the 272 isolates tested with
		"API Candida were: Candida albicans 180(66.2%), Candida tropicalis 13(4.7%),"
		"Candida glabrata 20(7.35%), Candida famata 6(2.2%), Candida parapsilosis 6 (2.2%)"
		and Candida lusitaniae one (0.37%). API Candida could not speciate 43 (15.8%)
		"isolates of these; two (0.7%) fell between C. albicans and C. tropicalis,"
		"17(6.25%) C. lusitaniael, C. guilliermondii/C. famata, 14(5.15%) C. krusei, C."
		"inconspicua, and C. norvegensis and nine (3.3%) either C. parapsilosis, C."
		"krusei, C. incospicua or Geotrichum spp. Four (1.5%) isolates had an assimilation"
		"pattern of Trichosporo spp, but were all germ tube positive and had morphological"
		features on cornemeal agar that were consistent with C. albicans. API 20C AUX was
		"used for testing 29 isolates and results showed: 11/29 (37.9%) C. albicans, 1/29"
		"(3.4%) C. tropicalis, 4/29 (13.8%) C. glabrata, 1/29 (3.4%) C. parapsilosis, 1/29"
		"(3.4%) C. famata, 1/29 (3.4%) C. lusitaniae, 1/29 (3.4%) C. colliculosa/C."
		"magnoliae, 5/29(17.2%) C. albicans/ C. tropicals 2/29 (6.8%) C. norvegensis/C."
		"parapsilosis, and 2/29(6.8%) C. kruseil/C. inconspicua. Results of 20 isolates"
		identified by Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPID) technique showed a 95%
		agreement with API Candida and a 100% agreement with API 20C AUX. CONCLUSION:
		Although most (66.3%) of the species isolated from Dar es Salaam women with
		"vaginal candidiasis were C. albicans, a considerable percentage (33.7%) were"
		"non-albicans, mainly C. glabrata, C. krusei and C. tropicalis. The high"
		prevalence of non-albicans Candida spp observed in this population may have
		therapeutic implications.

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to determine the frequency of Candida species in
		women of different age groups as well as to suggest the criteria for the
		diagnosis of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC). STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study of
		"vulvovaginal candidiasis was carried out using laboratory diagnosis, with the"
		estimation of vaginal pH and the direct microscopic and biochemical examination
		of vaginal discharge/secretions. Vaginal cultures for Candida species were
		"collected from 1050 women with vulvovaginal symptoms. RESULTS: Out of 1050 women,"
		"215 (20.47%) were positive for Candida species. Of 215 women, 172 (80%) had pH"
		within the normal range and 167 (77.67%) were showing yeast cells and mycelia on
		"direct microscopic examination. Candida albicans accounted for 46.9% of cases,"
		"Candida glabrata 36.7%, Candida parapsilosis 10.2%, Candida tropicalis 2.8%,"
		"Candida krusei 1.4%, and Candida kiefer 1.9%. The frequency of culture positivity"
		"was related to pregnancy (P<0.001), an increase in parity (P<0.001), and use of"
		oral contraceptives (P<0.001) and antibiotics (P<0.001). The most common signs
		and symptoms in 215 women with positive cultures were pruritus with or without
		vaginal discharge and vaginal erythema. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that
		vulvovaginal candidiasis can only be diagnosed by using clinical criteria in
		correlation with vulvovaginal symptoms and Candida cultures.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: There are few recent studies evaluating trends in the epidemiology of
		candidemia including changes in species or utilization of antifungal agents in
		children. METHODS: We performed a retrospective case series of candidemia at our
		children's hospital from 2002 to 2006. Our objectives were to study trends in the
		"rates of candidemia, demographic characteristics, Candida species, antifungal"
		"susceptibility, and antifungal utilization. These data were obtained from the"
		electronic medical records. RESULTS: There were 203 episodes of candidemia in 154
		"subjects. During the study period, the average rate of candidemia was 5.52 per"
		1000 patient-discharges and did not change throughout the study. The mean and
		"median ages of subjects were 3 years versus 9 months, respectively, and 38% were"
		less than 3 months of age. Gastrointestinal disorders were a common comorbid
		"condition (33%), especially for subjects with multiple episodes of candidemia."
		"Overall, Candida parapsilosis and Candida albicans caused 43% and 26% of"
		"episodes, respectively, and candidemia caused by Candida glabrata (5.3%-23%) and"
		Candida krusei (0%-8.5%) increased during the study. Ninety-eight percent of C.
		albicans and C. parapsilosis isolates remained susceptible to all antifungal
		"drugs. From 2003-2006, the use of antifungal agents increased from 79 days to 150"
		days per 1000 hospital-days. CONCLUSIONS: While antifungal use at our hospital
		"increased, candidemia rates remained stable. C. parapsilosis was the most common"
		species but other non-C. albicans species increased during the study period.
		Local epidemiology should be monitored in pediatric populations for potential
		impact on management strategies.

		Birds.
PG	-	413-418
LID	-	10.1647/2018-419 [doi]
AB	-	A non-albicans Candida species was identified in 6 birds exhibiting clinical
		signs associated with gastrointestinal disease. The clinical disease signs noted
		"in these 6 birds included diarrhea, regurgitation, and melena, and were"
		considered concurrent or identified secondary to other comorbidities. Candida
		"glabrata was identified in a yellow-naped Amazon parrot (Amazona auropalliata), a"
		"ring-necked dove (Streptopelia capicola), a blue-and-gold macaw (Ara ararauna),"
		and 2 cockatiels (Nymphicus hollandicus). Candida krusei was identified in a
		white-crowned parrot (Pionus senilis). Fungal culture and matrix-assisted laser
		desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry identification was
		"correlated with results of fecal and/or crop Gram's stains, and DNA sequencing"
		"was used in one case. Three cases resolved after treatment, 2 birds died, and 1"
		was lost to follow-up. Non-albicans Candida infections are an emerging issue in
		human health care and are known to have an increased resistance to antifungal
		"drugs. Similar to Candida albicans, these non-albicans Candida species are often"
		identified in patients that have a history of prior antibiotic exposure. Recent
		data in human medicine describe a shift in species distribution away from C
		"albicans dominance and toward other species, including C glabrata and C krusei."
		Both species are considered normal flora within the human and bird mycobiota and
		"may emerge to cause disease, especially when the normal gastrointestinal"
		environment has been disrupted.

PG	-	537-543
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-020-00457-6 [doi]
AB	-	Candida species are common in the human oral microbiota and may cause oral
		candidiasis (OC) when the microbiota equilibrium is disturbed. Immunosuppressed
		individuals are susceptible to oral infections as individuals with Down syndrome
		"(IDS) due to particularities of their mouth morphoanatomy, saliva and"
		comorbidities. This study aimed to analyze the molecular epidemiology of Candida
		spp. from the oral cavity of IDS and their relatives. A case-control study with
		80 IDS and 80 non-syndromic (non-DS) was evaluated by oral swab collection for
		"culture on Sabouraud dextrose agar, selection of yeast colonies to Gram staining"
		and culturing on chromogenic media. DNA extraction was performed with the
		phenol/chloroform method for screening of 6 Candida species medically important
		"in PCR, applying SPSS for statistics. We confirmed four species in 46 IDS without"
		"use of antimicrobials (57.54%), with a high prevalence of C. albicans/Ca"
		"(93.48%/43) and 3 C. glabrata/Cg (6.52%), being 25 of these IDS (31.25%)"
		"colonized by species other than C. albicans: Ca + Cg (16), Ca + C. tropicalis/Ct"
		(7) and Ca + C. krusei/Ck (2). Only 10 non-DS were colonized by one species
		"(11.25%): 6 C. albicans, 2 C. glabrata, 1 C. tropicalis and 1 C. krusei. Previous"
		"OC was reported by 39 IDS (48.75%), being 33 positives for Candida spp. (84.61%)"
		and 17 with active OC (21.25%). Five non-DS reported OC previously and had no
		active lesions. Behavioral changes and buccal health programs directed to IDS may
		"help prevent OC and its recurrence, providing information on oral hygiene for"
		self-care.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candida is the commonest opportunistic fungi in human. Candida
		species cause diverse types of diseases. Vaginal candidiasis has been reported as
		one of the most common type of fungal diseases among pregnant women. However; In
		"Ethiopia, due to scarcity of data, much has not been documented regarding the"
		prevalence of Candida among pregnant women. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to
		"determine the prevalence, possible risk factors and antifungal susceptibility"
		profile of Candida species among pregnant women attending Debre Markos Referral
		"Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was conducted from"
		February to May 2017. A total of 384 pregnant women were included using a
		"systematic random sampling technique. Vaginal specimens were collected,"
		inoculated on Candida HiV eg culture Medium and incubated at 37 °C for
		24 h.Colonies were identified using standard microbiological methods and selected
		for further Candida Species identification using Hi Chrome agar and germ tube
		test. Fungal suspensions were made and adjusted at 0.5% MacFarland standard.
		Modified Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion technique was used for antifungal
		"susceptibility. Data was entered, cleaned using Ep info version 7.1and"
		transported to Statistical Packages for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21 for
		analysis. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were performed. P. value
		< 0.05 at 95% confidence interval was considered as statistically significant.
		"RESULT: From a total of 384 study participants, 96 (25%) were positive for"
		Candida species. The predominant Candida species was Candida albicans 54(56.25%)
		"followed by Candida krusei 21(21.9%), Candida glabrata 17(17.7%), Candida"
		tropicalis 1(1%) and 3(3.1%) were other Candida species. Contraceptive use (AOR:
		0.394; 95% CI = 0.20-0.74) and prolonged antibiotic uses (AOR: 0.393; 95%
		CI = 0.21-0.72) were risk factors. All isolates except Candida krusei were 100%
		susceptible to amphotericin-B. Resistance rate was high against itraconazole and
		Ketoconazole 55(57.3%). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of Candida species among
		symptomatic pregnant women was significantly higher than asymptomatic pregnant
		women. Age group between 26 and 40 years was significantly associated with
		Candida infection. Amphotericin B was the most sensitive antifungal drug. High
		rate of multiple drugs resistant Candida species was detected. Therefore
		Symptomatic women should be routinely screened and treated.

AB	-	PURPOSE: To determine the generalizability of recent data assessing the necessity
		"of ophthalmic consultation for fungemic patients, we examined the prevalence,"
		"microbial profile, and treatment of fungal chorioretinitis and endophthalmitis"
		among patients with positive fungal cultures referred for ophthalmologic
		consultation at a tertiary care medical center. DESIGN: Retrospective
		cross-sectional study. METHODS: All inpatient ophthalmology consultations from
		"Wills Eye Hospital at Thomas Jefferson University between January 1, 2006 and"
		"December 31, 2012 were retrospectively reviewed and cross-referenced to a"
		microbiologic database of positive fungal blood cultures. This included 227 adult
		consecutive inpatients with positive fungal blood cultures (n = 215) or suspected
		fungemia (n = 12). Clinical data were extracted from records held by the
		microbiology laboratory and inpatient records. Patients were deemed to have
		ocular fungal involvement if dilated fundus examination demonstrated evidence of
		chorioretinitis or endophthalmitis. RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty-seven
		consultations were requested to evaluate patients for ocular manifestations of
		"fungemia. Eleven patients (4.8%, 95% CI 2.4%-8.5%) were diagnosed with fungal"
		"chorioretinitis or endophthalmitis. Of these 11 patients, 5 had visual symptoms,"
		"2 were asymptomatic, and 4 were unable to communicate. A total of 5 patients"
		(2.2%) received intravitreal injections following funduscopic screening. An
		additional 11 patients (4.8%) had nonspecific fundus lesions considered to be
		inconsistent with ocular fungal involvement. The most common fungal species
		"identified were Candida albicans (n = 85), Candida glabrata (n = 63), and Candida"
		parapsilosis (n = 44). CONCLUSIONS: The current study found a low rate of
		disseminated ocular involvement in patients with positive fungal cultures
		"referred for ophthalmologic consultation. However, 2 patients with ocular fungal"
		involvement denied visual symptoms and over half of affected patients were
		asymptomatic or unable to communicate. As the presence and severity of ocular
		involvement in fungemic patients may dictate the mode and duration of antifungal
		"treatment, funduscopic screenings may still have an important role."

		"transplant recipients: prospective, multicenter, case-controlled study."
PG	-	2023-9
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: This study determines whether the spectrum, risk factors, and outcome"
		of invasive candidiasis in liver transplant recipients have changed. METHODS:
		Thirty-five consecutive liver transplant recipients with invasive candidiasis
		"were prospectively studied in a case-controlled, multicenter study. One control"
		was matched with the case for duration of hospitalization and the other for
		antibiotic use so that risk factors unique in liver transplantation could be
		"elicited. RESULTS: In matched-pair analysis, antibiotic prophylaxis for"
		"spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (odds ratio [OR] 8.3, P=0.002), posttransplant"
		"dialysis (OR 7.6, P=0.0009), and retransplantation (OR 16.4, P=0.0018) were"
		independently significant predictors of invasive candidiasis. Candida spp.
		"included C. albicans in 65% of patients, C. glabrata in 21%, C. tropicalis in 9%,"
		"C. parapsilosis in 3%, and C. guilliermondii in 3%. Patients with C. albicans"
		infections were less likely to have received antifungal prophylaxis than those
		"with non-albicans Candida infections (13.6% vs. 50%, P=0.04). The mortality rate"
		"was 36.1% for the cases and 2.8% for the controls (OR 25.0, 95% confidence"
		"interval, 6.2-100.5, P=0.0002). Non-albicans Candida infections (P=0.04) and"
		prior antifungal prophylaxis (P=0.05) correlated with poorer outcome in the
		cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our study has identified predictors for Candida infections in
		the current era that have implications relevant for targeting the prophylaxis
		toward the high-risk patients. Routine use of antifungal prophylaxis warrants
		concern given the emergence of non-albicans Candida spp. as significant pathogens
		after liver transplantation and higher mortality in patients with these
		infections.

		programme.
PG	-	259-71
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-012-9551-x [doi]
AB	-	The increasing diversity of opportunistic fungi causing serious invasive fungal
		infections (IFI) has been documented. Accurate identification (ID) is important
		"in guiding therapy, determining prognosis for IFIs and in epidemiological"
		surveys. We assessed the utility of PCR-based methods for the ID of yeasts and
		"moulds that either were uncommon, failed conventional ID, or represented unusual"
		"biochemical or phenotypic profiles of common species. Among 1,790 viable fungal"
		"clinical isolates received during the SENTRY Program in 2010, 322 strains from 40"
		study sites had ID confirmed by molecular methods. Isolates were previously
		identified in participant institutions. Yeasts that were not confirmed by
		"morphology on CHROMagar, growth at 45 °C (Candida albicans/dubliniensis), or"
		assimilation of trehalose (C. glabrata) as well as non-Candida yeasts and all
		moulds were amplified and sequenced using primers amplifying one or more of the
		"following genes: ITS, 28S, β-tubulin (Aspergillus spp.), TEF (Fusarium spp.), IGS"
		(Trichosporon spp.). The isolates selected for molecular ID included 149 isolates
		"of Candida species, 77 of Aspergillus species, 73 non-Candida yeasts, and 23"
		"other moulds (a total of 41 different species). Overall, the ID determined by the"
		submitting site was confirmed for 189 isolates (58.7 %): Aspergillus spp. (64.1 %
		correct); Candida spp. (60.1 % correct); non-Candida yeasts (58.9 % correct);
		non-Aspergillus moulds (30.4 % correct). Species with high levels of concordance
		"between conventional and molecular ID included A. fumigatus (95.0  %), C."
		"lusitaniae (100 %), C. dubliniensis (92.3 %), C. kefyr (100 %), and C. neoformans"
		(90.2 %). Only 50.0 % of isolates of C. albicans and 59.1 % of C. glabrata
		selected due to unusual phenotypic or biochemical features were found to be
		correctly identified by the submitting site. Molecular methods for the
		identification of fungal pathogens are an important adjunct to the conventional
		identification of many less common clinically relevant yeasts and moulds
		including species of Candida with unusual or erroneous phenotypic or biochemical
		profiles. Molecular confirmation of fungal identification is essential in
		epidemiological surveys such as SENTRY.

AB	-	Candidaemia still continues to be a serious medical concern and the epidemiology
		of candidaemia varies according to geographical areas. We aim to determine the
		"incidence, local epidemiology, Candida species distribution and crude mortality"
		rates of candidaemia. We retrospectively evaluated candidaemia episodes in
		"between January 2007 and August 2014. We compared demographic, clinical,"
		microbiological findings and mortality rates of episodes caused by Candida
		albicans and non-albicans Candida species. Overall the candidaemia incidences
		were 1.23 episodes/1000 admissions. A significant negative slope among
		candidaemia episodes and years was determined. Overall C. albicans (54.6%) was
		"the most common species followed by Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis and"
		Candida parapsilosis respectively. Preinfection hospital stay and length of
		hospital stay were statistically longer in patients with non-albicans Candida
		candidaemia than in patients with C. albicans candidaemia. The source of
		candidaemia was unknown in 52.5% of all episodes. Central venous catheters among
		non-albicans Candida candidaemia episodes and urinary system among C. albicans
		candidaemia episodes were common source of candidaemia compared to each other.
		Previous antifungal therapy preceding candidaemia and concomitant bacteraemia
		were significantly associated with non-albicans Candida candidaemia. Continuous
		local surveillance will preserve its pivotal importance in formulating empirical
		antifungal therapy and improving management of candidaemia.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive Candida spp. infections have been described more frequently.
		AIM: To characterize the epidemiological data of candidemia in recent years.
		METHODS: A retrospective study of adult patients in a University Hospital in
		"Santiago, Chile, with 1 or more documented episodes of candidemia, from January"
		2000 to December 2013. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty episodes of candidemia
		"were identified in 120 patients, annual incidence of 0.4 cases per 1000"
		"discharges, 53.3% were male patients, 58.3% > 60 years, 77,5% had at least one"
		"co-morbidity. Candida albicans was the species most frequently identified 55%,"
		"followed by C. glabrata 18.3%, C. tropicalis 11.7% and C. parapsilosis 9.2%."
		"Comparing 2000-2006 vs 2007-2013, increased the frequency of C. parapsilosis"
		among non-albicans and echinocandins prescription. Patients with C. albicans
		"showed higher APACHE-II, more requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation,"
		"greater association with CVC, and shorter incubation time compared with"
		non-albicans species. The 30-day mortality was 31.7%. CONCLUSIONS: During this

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Data suggests that invasive fungal infections (IFI) might
		complicate COVID-19. Our goal was to describe characteristics of IFI among
		critically ill COVID-19 adults. METHODS: A retrospective observational
		case-series analysis was done between March-July 2020. Consecutive patients with
		"critical COVID-19 were eligible, and have been included when proven or"
		putative/probable IFI could be confirmed during their course. For COVID-19
		"diagnosis, ECDC definitions and WHO severity criteria were followed. Candidaemia"
		was diagnosed according to the ESCMID 2012 guideline. Invasive pulmonary
		"aspergillosis (IPA) was defined following EORTC/MSG, ECMM/ISHAM and modified"
		"AspICU criteria. Outcome variables were rates of IFIs, in-hospital all-cause"
		"mortality, rate and time to negative respiratory SARS-CoV-2 PCR. RESULTS: From 90"
		"eligible patients, 20 (22.2%) fulfilled criteria for IFI. Incidence rate for IFI"
		was 2.02 per 100 patient-days at ICU. Patients were mostly elderly males with
		"significant comorbidities, requiring mechanical ventilation because of ARDS. IFI"
		"could be classified as candidaemia in 7/20 (40%), putative/probable IPA in 16/20"
		"(80.0%). Isolated species of candidaemia episodes were Candida albicans (4/9,"
		"44.4%), Candida glabrata (3/9, 33.3%), Candida parapsilosis (1/9, 11.1%), Candida"
		"metapsilosis (1/9, 11.1%). Mold isolates from lower respiratory tract were"
		"Aspergillus fumigatus, BAL galactomannan positivity was prevalent (16/20, 80.0%)."
		Mortality was 12/20 (60.0%) with a median time to death of 31.0±37.0 (5-89) days.
		Only 9/20 (45.0%) patients reached SARS-CoV-2 PCR negativity after a median time
		of 20.0±12.0 (3-38) days. CONCLUSION: In this small cohort of critically ill
		"COVID-19 adults, morbidity and mortality related to invasive fungal infections"
		proved to be significant.

AB	-	This analysis describes the epidemiology and outcomes of invasive candidiasis
		caused by non-albicans species of Candida in patients enrolled in the Prospective
		Antifungal Therapy Alliance (PATH Alliance) registry from 2004 to 2008. A total
		"of 2,496 patients with non-albicans species of Candida isolates were identified."
		"The identified species were C. glabrata (46.4%), C. parapsilosis (24.7%), C."
		"tropicalis (13.9%), C. krusei (5.5%), C. lusitaniae (1.6%), C. dubliniensis"
		(1.5%) and C. guilliermondii (0.4%); 111 infections involved two or more species
		of Candida (4.4%). Non-albicans species accounted for more than 50% of all cases
		of invasive candidiasis in 15 of the 24 sites (62.5%) that contributed more than
		"one case to the survey. Among solid organ transplant recipients, patients with"
		"non-transplant surgery, and patients with solid tumors, the most prevalent"
		"non-albicans species was C. glabrata at 63.7%, 48.0%, and 53.8%, respectively. In"
		"1,883 patients receiving antifungal therapy on day 3, fluconazole (30.5%) and"
		echinocandins (47.5%) were the most frequently administered monotherapies. Among
		"the 15 reported species, 90-day survival was highest for patients infected with"
		either C. parapsilosis (70.7%) or C. lusitaniae (74.5%) and lowest for patients
		infected with an unknown species (46.7%) or two or more species (53.2%). In
		"conclusion, this study expands the current knowledge of the epidemiology and"
		outcomes of invasive candidiasis caused by non-albicans species of Candida in
		North America. The variability in species distribution in these centers
		underscores the importance of local epidemiology in guiding the selection of
		antifungal therapy.

PG	-	19-28
AB	-	The incidence of nosocomial candidemia increased 27-fold over the past 13 years
		at National Taiwan University Hospital. In order to investigate its predisposing
		"factors, clinical manifestations and prognostic determinants, a prospective"
		observational study of nosocomial candidemia was undertaken at the hospital. From
		"1 May 1994 to 30 April 1995, 118 consecutive adult patients with 120 Candida spp"
		blood isolates were analyzed. Clinical presentations included fever (100%) with a
		"median duration of 3 days, diarrhea within 7 days of candidemia (27.9%) and"
		macronodular skin emboli (7.6%). Laboratory studies showed worsening azotemia
		"(35.6%), elevation of aminotransferase (28.3%), leukocytosis (27.1%) and"
		"thrombocytopenia (23.3%). Use of multiple antibiotics, retained vascular"
		catheters and parenteral nutritional support were the three most common
		predisposing factors for candidemia. C. albicans was the most common isolate
		"(50%), followed by C. tropicalis (20%), C. glabrata (14%), C. parapsilosis"
		"(9.2%). C. guilliermondii (2.5%), and C. Krusei (1.7%). C. tropicalis was more"
		"frequently the cause of candidemia in patients with leukemia and neutropenia,"
		while C. glabrata was more commonly seen in patients receiving fluconazole
		prophylaxis. A severity scoring system adopted from prospective bacteremia
		studies proved to be highly predictive of mortality in candidemic patients. The
		"overall case fatality rate was 70/118 (59.3%), and 51/70 (72.9%) were"
		"attributable to candidemia. In a multivariate analysis, the prognostic factors"
		"adversely influencing outcome were: higher severity scores, no removal of the"
		"catheter, persistent candidemia and lack of antifungal therapy."

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Bloodstream Candida infection is a life-threatening event among ICU
		admitted patients. This infection is caused by a diverse range of Candida species
		having varied minimum inhibitory concentrations. OBJECTIVES: To identify Candida
		species causing bloodstream infections with their antifungal susceptibility
		determination. METHODS: Candida species isolated from the blood of ICU admitted
		patients were identified by phenotypic as well as by molecular methods including
		PCR-RFLP using MspI restriction enzyme and MALDI TOF MS. The minimum inhibitory
		"concentration of fluconazole, voriconazole, amphotericin B and caspofungin was"
		determined against isolated Candida species by CLSI M27A(3) guidelines. RESULTS:
		"A total of 119 Candida species were isolated. Among them, C. tropicalis(n=29) was"
		"the predominant isolate followed by C. parapsilosis(n=18), C. glabrata (n=12), C."
		krusei (n=11) and C. albicans(n=11). Uncommon Candida species isolated were;
		"Wickerhamomyces anomalus(n=15), Kodaemia ohmeri(n=8), C. lusitaniae (n=5) and C."
		auris (n=2). A varied antifungal MIC values were observed. Caspofungin had the
		lowest MIC among the tested antifungals. Increased fluconazole MIC was observed
		against the isolated Candida species including C. tropicalis. All the isolated C.
		lusitaniae and C. auris strains have ≥1mcg/ml amphotericin B MIC. In comparison
		"to fluconazole, voriconazole was more effective when tested in vitro. CONCLUSION:"
		Emergence of uncommon Candida species having varied antifungal MIC warns the
		"physicians to have a prompt, accurate identification with antifungal MIC"
		determination in each case of bloodstream Candida infections.

AB	-	A prospective multicenter surveillance program on yeast bloodstream infections
		"was implemented in the Paris, France, area without restrictions on ward of"
		"hospitalization (intensive care unit, hematology, and surgery) or age (adults and"
		"children). The present analysis concerns 2,618 isolates collected over 7 years"
		"from 2,441 patients. Centralized species identification and antifungal"
		susceptibility testing using the EUCAST methodology were performed. Almost 10%
		"(232/2,441) of the patients had recently (≤30 days) been treated with antifungal"
		drugs. We analyzed the effect of recent exposure to fluconazole (n = 159) or
		caspofungin (n = 61) on the proportions of the five major Candida species. For
		"both drugs, preexposure was associated with a decreased prevalence of Candida"
		albicans in favor of less drug-susceptible species (C. glabrata and C. krusei for
		"the former and C. parapsilosis and, to a lesser extent, C. glabrata and C. krusei"
		"for the latter; P = 0.001). In the multivariate analysis, the risk of being"
		infected with an isolate with decreased susceptibility to fluconazole was
		independently associated with an age of ≥15 years (odds ratio [OR] = 2.45; 95%
		confidence interval [CI] = 1.39 to 4.31; P = 0.002) and with recent exposure to
		"fluconazole (OR = 2.17; 95% CI = 1.51 to 3.13; P < 0.001), while the risk of"
		being infected with an isolate with decreased susceptibility to caspofungin was
		independently associated with an age <15 years (OR = 2.53; 95% CI = 1.43 to 4.48;
		P = 0.001) and with recent exposure to caspofungin (OR = 4.79; 95% CI = 2.47 to
		9.28; P < 0.001). These findings could influence future recommendations for the
		management of candidemia.

AB	-	AIM: To assess the effects of copper T-380-A intrauterine device (IUD) insertion
		"on Candida species in cervicovaginal specimen by a molecular method, polymerase"
		chain reaction. METHODS: This is a longitudinal prospective study performed on 95
		"women attending Health Centers of Tehran, Iran in 2012, who selected copper"
		T-380-A IUD for contraception and had no history of local or systemic antibiotics
		or antifungals use during the previous 2 weeks. Cervicovaginal specimens were
		"twice collected and cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar and CHROMagar Candida,"
		"before and 3 months after IUD insertion. Finally, a molecular method, PCR-RFLP"
		was performed for identification of Candida species. P-values <0.05 were
		considered significant. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 28 ± 7.44
		years. Positive Candida cultures were significantly increased 3 months after IUD
		"insertion (25.3% vs 11.6%, P = 0.007). The most common identified species before"
		"and after IUD insertion, were Albicans, Glabrata and then both 'Albicans &"
		"Glabrata', respectively. The prevalence of Albicans and Glabrata decreased, while"
		both 'Albicans & Glabrata' increased insignificantly. CONCLUSION: There was more
		than about fourfold increase in positive Candida cultures after IUD insertion. As
		the prevalence of simultaneous infection with both 'Albicans & Glabrata' species
		"which are resistant to usual treatment, increased, it seems necessary to provide"
		more intensive follow-up care for IUD users.

TI	-	Epidemiology of candidemia--a nationwide survey in Israel.
PG	-	26-9
AB	-	Bloodstream infections with Candida are often lethal and have been reported to be
		increasing in frequency. The current retrospective study describes the magnitude
		and epidemiological characteristics of candidemia in all western-type hospital
		facilities in Israel in 1994. Comprehensiveness of the data from the reporting
		hospitals was checked by cross-study of the data from the infectious diseases
		records and from the hospitalization records. Vital status of all reported cases
		was evaluated 1 year after the diagnosis. Data on 298 newly diagnosed cases of
		candidemia were received from 14 of the 18 general hospitals in Israel. The
		proportion of candidemia in the Israeli hospitals ranged from 0.1 to 0.01% of all
		"admissions, with a mean of 0.05%. The incidence of candidemia differed"
		"significantly between the wards from 4-5/10,000 in general surgery and internal"
		"medicine wards to about 60/10,000 and 80/10,000 in intensive care and preterm"
		"units, respectively. Of all detected cases 53.6% were Candida albicans. Another"
		"nine specific species of Candida (mainly Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis"
		"and Candida glabrata) were detected, with major differences between the various"
		hospitals. The species of Candida differed significantly by sex and age. Of the
		cases of candidemia 21.5% died within 30 days of the isolation of the pathogen.
		The one-year mortality rate was 31.9%. Species-specific 30-day mortality rate was
		"highest for C. glabrata. Throughout the analysis, C. glabrata emerged as a unique"
		"cause of candidemia, producing higher mortality, appearing at a younger age and"
		predominating among females.

TI	-	Oral Candida carriage and prevalence of Candida species among Maras powder users
		and non-users.
PG	-	502-6
LID	-	10.1111/jop.12260 [doi]
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to investigate Candida carriage and
		species in Maras powder users and non-users. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study
		"included 100 volunteering men in 12 cafés in the city of Kahramanmaras, Turkey. A"
		questionnaire composed of questions about socio-demographic features and Maras
		powder use was filled in by the participants. Culture specimens were obtained
		from bilateral buccal mucosa and dorsum of the tongue with a sterile
		cotton-tipped swap. The specimens were inoculated in Sabouraud Dextrose Agar
		"(SDA). RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 48.0 ± 12.5 years (min = 20,"
		max = 70). Fifty-four percent of the Maras powder users and 22% of the non-users
		were Candida carriers. The difference between the groups was significant (P =
		0.001). The most frequently isolated species was Candida albicans at a rate of
		44% in the Maras powder users and at a rate of 18% in the non-users. Other
		frequent species were Candida glabrata at a rate of 6% in the Maras powder users
		and 2% in the control group and Candida tropicalis at a rate of 4% in the Maras
		powder users and 2% in the nonusers. CONCLUSION: We found that a significantly
		high rate of the Maras powder users was Candida carriers. It should be kept in
		mind that opportunistic infections may be caused by Candida species in Maras
		powder users especially with immunosuppressive conditions since Candida species
		are likely to lead to such infections in cases of immunosuppressive diseases.

		bloodstream isolates from critically ill patients: Focus on intravenous
		itraconazole.

LID	-	S0924-8579(19)30172-4 [pii]
LID	-	10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2019.06.019 [doi]
AB	-	In vitro and clinical data were analysed to evaluate the susceptibility profile
		of itraconazole in light of the new cut-off points. The in vitro activity of
		itraconazole was compared with that of eight comparators against 119 Candida
		bloodstream isolates from 2015 to 2018. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs)
		were measured by the colorimetric MICRONAUT-S assay. The content of wells without
		any color change was sub-cultured to measure killing efficacy. No major
		"differences were found against Candida albicans. Itraconazole, posaconazole and"
		amphotericin B were the most active agents against Candida parapsilosis. Of the
		"32 isolates of C. parapsilosis that were resistant to fluconazole, 96.9%, 78.1%"
		"and 93.8% were susceptible to itraconazole, voriconazole and posaconazole,"
		respectively. The ratio of the minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) to the MIC
		of itraconazole was lower than for the other azoles against C. parapsilosis and
		C. glabrata. Itraconazole achieved greater inhibition over-time of the growth of
		C. parapsilosis than fluconazole. Seventy-three critically ill patients who were
		unresponsive to antibiotics received intravenous empirical treatment with
		itraconazole (n = 28) or comparators (n = 45). Case-control matching was
		"conducted for severity, comorbidities, risk factors for candidemia, administered"
		antibiotics and days of antifungal treatment. Breakthrough candidemia was found
		in 3.6% of patients treated with itraconazole and in 32.1% of patients treated
		with comparators (P: 0.020); breakthrough candidemia by C. parapsilosis was found
		"in 3.6% and 28.6% of patients, respectively. Results indicate that itraconazole"
		"retains a valuable susceptibility profile against Candida isolates, particularly"
		C. parapsilosis. This superior profile may explain the clinical efficacy in the
		occurrence of breakthrough candidemia and warrants further clinical
		investigation.

LID	-	10.1099/jmm.0.47406-0 [doi]
AB	-	Candida species are the fourth most common cause of bloodstream infection (BSI)
		in the hospitalized patient. Candida glabrata is the most common non-Candida
		albicans Candida species in England and Wales with an attributed mortality of
		"48%. C. glabrata is known to demonstrate reduced susceptibility to fluconazole,"
		resulting in treatment failures when employing this agent for empirical treatment
		of Candida BSI. The first part of this study demonstrated a technique utilizing a
		blood culture system commonly used by many laboratories (BACTEC 9240 automated
		detection system) that reduced the time to identification of this potentially
		resistant organism by up to 72 h. A presumptive identification was achieved by
		observing a difference in the duration of incubation required before growth was
		detected automatically between Lytic Anaerobic and Plus Aerobic culture bottles.
		"Secondly, experiments exploring the growth characteristics of C. glabrata in"
		BACTEC blood culture bottles containing various media were carried out to explore
		possible reasons underpinning this clinical observation. The detection of yeast
		in the anaerobic bottle of a blood culture pair consisting of Lytic Anaerobic and
		Plus Aerobic in a BACTEC 9240 system was found to be highly predictive of the
		"isolation of C. glabrata (positive predictive value 93.3%, negative predictive"
		value 98.3%). The reason for this appeared to be a component of the Lytic
		Anaerobic blood culture medium enhancing the growth of C. glabrata in that
		medium.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Mexican diabetic population frequently presents mycosis under foot
		"hyperkeratosis; however, in another type of onychomycosis as the ones that is"
		"assumed Candida albicans is the causal agent, it is unknown the frequency, the"
		prevalence and if another Candida species or other yeasts are found. OBJECTIVE:
		Evaluate the frequency of yeasts causing onychomycosis in diabetic patients
		"looked after in public institutions of health of the State of Hidalgo, Mexico,"
		and its association with clinical epidemiological variables. MATERIALS AND
		"METHODS: An observational, descriptive and transversal study was made on 261"
		"patients, from which one nail sample of each one was obtained, used to isolate"
		and identify dermatophytes and yeasts; the results were statistically correlated
		with 24 epidemiological parameters. The clinical study was done through
		interrogation and by medical exploration in order to evaluate Tinea pedis and
		"onychomycosis. RESULTS: Onychomycosis were caused by Candida guilliermondii,"
		"Candida parapsilosis, Candida glabrata, Candida krusei, Candida spp., Kodamaea"
		"ohmeri, Prototheca wickerhamii and unidentified yeasts. The prevalence for"
		"general onychomycosis, by dermatophytes, mixed onychomycosis and by yeasts were:"
		"24.1, 19.5, 2.3 and 14.6%, respectively. Patients with significant probability to"
		be diagnosed as having onychomycosis by yeasts are those wearing open shoes
		(2.59%); technicians and professionals (10.49%) and alcohol drinkers (3.72%).
		CONCLUSION: The fact that Candida albicans is not present in this study as causal
		"agent of onychomycosis, and emerging and non-common yeasts were indeed isolated,"
		creates new challenges. It is remarked the clinical criterion that when
		"onychomycosis is suspected in diabetics, the diagnosis for culturing"
		dermatophytes and yeasts should be included.

TI	-	Predictors and outcomes of candiduria in renal transplant recipients.
PG	-	1413-21
AB	-	BACKGROUND: The epidemiology of candiduria in renal transplantation is unknown.
		METHODS: We performed a nested case-control study to evaluate the epidemiology of
		candiduria in renal transplant recipients at the University of Wisconsin
		(Madison) over an 8-year period. RESULTS: Renal transplantations were performed
		"on 1738 patients during this period, 192 of whom had 276 episodes of candiduria."
		"Candida glabrata, which was recovered from 98 (51%) of 192 case patients, was the"
		most common pathogen identified. Most case patients were asymptomatic.
		"Independent predictors of candiduria were female sex (odds ratio [OR], 12.5; 95%"
		"confidence interval [CI], 6.7-23.0), intensive care unit admission (OR, 8.8; 95%"
		"CI, 2.3-35.0), antibiotic use during the month before candiduria (OR, 3.8; 95%"
		"CI, 1.7-8.3), presence of an indwelling bladder catheter (OR, 4.4; 95% CI,"
		"2.1-9.4), diabetes (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.3-3.9), neurogenic bladder (OR, 7.6; 95%"
		"CI, 2.1-27), and malnutrition (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.3-4.4). Log-rank testing of"
		"Kaplan-Meier curves revealed that 60-day, 90-day, and cumulative survival rates"
		were significantly different between case and control patients; there was no
		difference in the survival rate during the first 30 days after transplantation. A
		variety of regimens were used for treatment; 119 case patients (62%) underwent
		removal of the indwelling bladder catheter within 1 week after diagnosis of
		candiduria. Candiduria cleared in 148 case patients (77%). Treatment of
		candiduria was not associated with an improved survival rate. CONCLUSIONS:
		Candiduria occurs commonly in renal transplant recipients. Risk factors for
		candiduria in such persons are similar to those in hospitalized patients who have
		not received a transplant. Candiduria is associated with reduced survival rates
		among persons who have undergone renal transplantation; this is likely a marker
		for severity of illness. Treatment of asymptomatic candiduria in renal transplant
		recipients does not appear to result in improved outcome.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Few studies exist on prevalence of fungemia by Candida orthopsilosis,"
		"with variable results. AIMS: To study the incidence, epidemiology and antifungal"
		susceptibility of C. orthopsilosis strains isolated from fungemias over two years
		at a tertiary hospital. METHODS: Candidemia episodes between June 2007 and June
		"2009 in a university hospital (Puerta del Mar, Cádiz, Spain) were studied. The"
		strains initially identified as Candida parapsilosis were genotypically screened
		"for C. parapsilosis sensu stricto, C. orthopsilosis and Candida metapsilosis, and"
		their antifungal susceptibility was evaluated. RESULTS: In this period 52 cases
		of candidemia were documented. Of the 19 strains originally identified as C.
		"parapsilosis, 13 were confirmed as C. parapsilosis sensu stricto and 6 as C."
		"orthopsilosis. Of the 52 isolates, the most frequent species were Candida"
		"albicans (30.8%), C. parapsilosis sensu stricto (25%), C. orthopsilosis, Candida"
		tropicalis and Candida glabrata in equal numbers (11.5%). C. orthopsilosis
		"isolates were susceptible to amphotericin B, caspofungin, voriconazole and"
		"fluconazole, with no significant differences in MIC values with C. parapsilosis"
		sensu stricto. The source of isolates of C. orthopsilosis were neonates (50%) and
		"surgery (50%), and 100% were receiving parenteral nutrition; however C."
		parapsilosis sensu stricto was recovered primarily from patients over 50 years
		(69.2%) and 46.1% were receiving parenteral nutrition. CONCLUSIONS: These
		findings show that C. orthopsilosis should be considered as human pathogenic
		yeast and therefore its accurate identification is important. Despite our small
		sample size our study suggests that a displacement of some epidemiological
		characteristics previously attributed to C. parapsilosis to C. orthopsilosis may
		be possible.

PG	-	32-9
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Almost one-third of patients with bloodstream infections with Candida
		species (candidemia) have onset of disease that occurs outside of the hospital or
		"< or = 2 days after hospital admission (i.e., community-onset candidemia). We"
		compared the characteristics of patients who developed candidemia by the timing
		of onset of infection. METHODS: Incident episodes of candidemia were identified
		"through active, population-based surveillance in Connecticut and in Baltimore and"
		"Baltimore County, Maryland, during 1 October 1998-30 September 2000. The"
		molecular subtypes of a sample of 45 Candida parapsilosis isolates were evaluated
		"using Southern blots hybridized with the complex probe Cp3-13. RESULTS: Overall,"
		356 (31%) of the 1143 incident episodes of candidemia were classified as
		"community-onset disease (occurring < or = 2 days after hospital admission), and"
		"132 (37%) were caused by Candida albicans, 89 (25%) were caused by Candida"
		"glabrata, 57 (16%) were caused by C. parapsilosis, and 53 (15%) were caused by"
		Candida tropicalis. Community-onset disease was less likely to be associated with
		"concurrent immunosuppressive therapy, recent surgery, or use of a central venous"
		"catheter, compared with inpatient disease. Among patients with community-onset"
		"disease, the median time from blood culture to initiation of antifungal treatment"
		"was 2.7 days, the 30-day case-fatality rate was 26%, and 262 patients (75%) had"
		been hospitalized at least once in the previous 3 months. Although there were few
		differences between patients with very recent hospitalization (in the previous 1
		"month), less recent hospitalization (previous 1-3 months), and no documented past"
		"hospitalization, C. parapsilosis was more frequently associated with"
		community-onset disease as hospitalization became more distant. C. parapsilosis
		"strains tended to be unique to the patient, with little similarity found between"
		"strain types, on the basis of epidemiologic classification of patients."
		CONCLUSION: We report that community-onset candidemia is common and occurs in
		patients with extensive contact with the health care system. Disease caused by C.
		parapsilosis tends to involve unique strains.

AB	-	Candida pericarditis is a rare disease described mostly in patients with recent
		cardiothoracic surgery or debilitating chronic diseases and is generally
		"considered to be associated with high mortality. To our knowledge, we report the"
		first case of Candida pericarditis in a healthy host who had not undergone
		thoracic surgery and the first documented case and cure of pericarditis caused by
		C. glabrata. The most probable underlying factor in the development of this
		pericarditis was the abdominal surgery the patient underwent to correct a
		"gastrogastric fistula, without an intraabdominal leak, which developed 10 y after"
		surgical gastric stapling for weight reduction. The literature on Candida
		pericarditis is reviewed. If Candida pericarditis is diagnosed early and treated
		"with a combined medical and surgical approach, the prognosis today is much more"
		favorable than that previously reported.

AB	-	Bloodstream infections caused by Candida species remain a significant cause of
		morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. Biofilm formation by Candida
		species is an important virulence factor for disease pathogenesis. A prospective
		analysis of patients with Candida bloodstream infection (n = 217) in Scotland
		(2012-2013) was performed to assess the risk factors associated with patient
		"mortality, in particular the impact of biofilm formation. Candida bloodstream"
		isolates (n = 280) and clinical records for 157 patients were collected through
		11 different health boards across Scotland. Biofilm formation by clinical
		isolates was assessed in vitro with standard biomass assays. The role of biofilm
		phenotype on treatment efficacy was also evaluated in vitro by treating preformed
		biofilms with fixed concentrations of different classes of antifungal. Available
		mortality data for 134 patients showed that the 30-day candidaemia case mortality
		"rate was 41%, with predisposing factors including patient age and catheter"
		removal. Multivariate Cox regression survival analysis for 42 patients showed a
		significantly higher mortality rate for Candida albicans infection than for
		Candida glabrata infection. Biofilm-forming ability was significantly associated
		"with C. albicans mortality (34 patients). Finally, in vitro antifungal"
		sensitivity testing showed that low biofilm formers and high biofilm formers were
		"differentially affected by azoles and echinocandins, but not by polyenes. This"
		study provides further evidence that the biofilm phenotype represents a
		"significant clinical entity, and that isolates with this phenotype differentially"
		"respond to antifungal therapy in vitro. Collectively, these findings show that"
		greater clinical understanding is required with respect to Candida biofilm
		"infections, and the implications of isolate heterogeneity."

PG	-	1077-88
LID	-	10.1007/s00134-015-3791-4 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: To assess the evolution of patient deep colonization by Candida spp. in
		"a surgical ICU over an 8-year period. METHODS: This retrospective, observational"
		study included all patients hospitalized for more than 2 days in a surgical and
		"trauma ICU of a university hospital, from 2005 to 2012. Mycological samples were"
		"monitored weekly from five sites (oropharyngeal, rectal, gastric, tracheal and"
		urinary). Preemptive fluconazole therapy was started in patients highly colonized
		with Candida albicans. The evolution in Candida spp. involved in the deep
		"colonization sites distribution over the study period (main outcome measure,"
		"trend chi-square and time-series analysis), antifungal consumption, ICU-acquired"
		candidemia and mortality were determined. RESULTS: Among the 3029 patients with
		"ICU stay >48 h, 2651 had at least one set of mycological sampling. Thirty percent"
		"of the 31,171 samples were positive to Candida spp. Caspofungin consumption"
		"increased over the years, whereas fluconazole consumption decreased. No trend in"
		"C. albicans colonization was observed, after adjusting on colonization"
		risk-factors. A significant increase of acquired C. glabrata colonization was
		"observed, whereas the clearing of C. parapsilosis colonization significantly"
		decreased. No significant shift of colonization to other Candida spp. and
		mortality was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Preemptive strategy of antifungal drug
		prescriptions in highly colonized ICU patients induced an increase in C. glabrata
		colonization without significant shift of colonization to other Candida spp. in
		"surgical ICU patients. However, the potential detrimental impact of fluconazole"
		on Candida ecology in ICU and/or on Candida susceptibility to antifungal drugs
		"should be considered, and deserves further studies."

		spp. growing concomitantly within the same blood culture bottle or within 72 h of
		"each other. Information on demographics, comorbidities, antifungal use, and"
		survival was collected. Forty MSC patients with 81 Candida isolates were
		"identified. Non-albicans Candida spp. (54 of 81 isolates, 66.7%) were more"
		frequently identified. The most common combinations observed were Candida
		"albicans/Candida glabrata (15 of 40 patients, 37.5%), C. albicans/Candida"
		"parapsilosis (8, 20.0%), and C. glabrata/Candida krusei (5, 12.5%). The overall"
		"crude 4- and 12- week mortality, excluding patients lost to follow-up, was 41.9%"
		"and 66.7%, respectively. In this contemporary sampling of patients with MSC, the"
		combination of C. albicans/C. glabrata was most frequently observed and mortality
		was high.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Studies on candidemia occurring among adults in Southern African are
		limited. We aimed to document the epidemiology of candidemia among adults in
		Soweto. METHODS: This was a retrospective hospital-based study in three discrete
		"periods, involving 9 years, from 1990 to 2007. RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty-six"
		patients were identified. Case rates were 2.8 cases/10 000 admissions in
		"1998-2002 and 3.6 episodes/10 000 hospitalizations in 2005-2007. In 1990, Candida"
		"albicans caused 62% and Candida tropicalis caused 23% of episodes. In 2005-2007,"
		"major species were C. albicans (46%), Candida parapsilosis (25%), and Candida"
		"glabrata (23%), with little change compared to 1998-2002. Major predisposing"
		"conditions were abdominal surgery (43%), HIV infection (19% in 2005-2007), trauma"
		"(16%), diabetes mellitus (12%), and cancer (8%). General wards superseded"
		intensive care as the major diagnostic setting in 2005-2007. The crude mortality
		"was 60%. Among 22 HIV-infected patients with a median CD4 cell count of 68/μl,"
		three were of community-onset. C. albicans caused 73% of cases. Five patients had
		another predisposing condition and five had central venous catheters. The
		mortality was 73%. CONCLUSIONS: Soweto has a pattern of Candida species different
		from other continents. HIV infection and trauma were important predisposing
		conditions.

AB	-	"INTRODUCTION: Larger populations at risk, broader use of antibiotics and longer"
		hospital stays have impacted on the incidence of Candida sp. bloodstream
		infections (CBSI). OBJECTIVE: To determine clinical and epidemiologic
		characteristics of patients with CBSI in two tertiary care reference medical
		institutions in Mexico City. DESIGN: Prospective and observational
		laboratory-based surveillance study conducted from 07/2008 to 06/2010. METHODS:
		All patients with CBSI were included. Identification and antifungal
		"susceptibility were performed using CLSI M27-A3 standard procedures. Frequencies,"
		Mann-Whitney U test or T test were used as needed. Risk factors were determined
		with multivariable analysis and binary logistic regression analysis. RESULTS:
		CBSI represented 3.8% of nosocomial bloodstream infections. Cumulative incidence
		was 2.8 per 1000 discharges (incidence rate: 0.38 per 1000 patient-days). C.
		"albicans was the predominant species (46%), followed by C. tropicalis (26%). C."
		"glabrata was isolated from patients with diabetes (50%), and elderly patients."
		Sixty-four patients (86%) received antifungals. Amphotericin-B deoxycholate
		(AmBD) was the most commonly used agent (66%). Overall mortality rate reached
		"46%, and risk factors for death were APACHE II score ≥ 16 (OR = 6.94, CI95% ="
		"2.34-20.58, p<0.0001), and liver disease (OR = 186.11, CI95% = 7.61-4550.20, p ="
		"0.001). Full susceptibility to fluconazole, AmBD and echinocandins among C."
		"albicans, C. tropicalis, and C. parapsilosis was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The"
		cumulative incidence rate in these centers was higher than other reports from
		tertiary care hospitals from Latin America. Knowledge of local epidemiologic
		patterns permits the design of more specific strategies for prevention and
		preemptive therapy of CBSI.

PG	-	1672-8
AB	-	"STUDY OBJECTIVES: To analyze the clinical spectra, pathogenesis, treatment,"
		"outcome, and prognostic factors of fungal empyema thoracis. DESIGN: The medical"
		records of patients with positive fungal cultures from pleural effusions were
		retrospectively analyzed. SETTING: A university-based tertiary care hospital in
		"Taipei, Taiwan. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 1990 through December 1997,"
		patients diagnosed with fungal empyema were included in this study. The criteria
		for diagnosis of fungal empyema thoracis were as follows: (1) isolation of a
		"fungal species from the pleural effusion; (2) significant signs of infection,"
		such as fever (body temperature > 38.3 degrees C) and leukocytosis (white blood
		"cell > 10,000/microL); and (3) isolation of the same mold species from pleural"
		"effusion on more than one occasion, or from pleural effusion and other specimens"
		"such as blood, sputum, or surgical wounds that showed evidence of tissue"
		invasion. RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients with fungal empyema thoracis were
		"included. Their mean age was 54 years (range, 2 weeks to 93 years), and 64% (43"
		"patients) were men. Fifty-seven patients (85%) had various underlying diseases,"
		and 18 (27%) had more than one immunocompromising condition. A total of 73 fungal
		isolates were recovered from pleural effusion; the most commonly encountered were
		"Candida species (47 isolates, 64%), Torulopsis glabrata (13 isolates, 18%), and"
		"Aspergillus species (9 isolates, 12%). Candida albicans (28 isolates) was the"
		"most common Candida species, followed by Candida tropicalis (13 isolates). Six"
		"patients (9%) had two fungal strains isolated, and 16 (24%) had concomitant"
		bacterial empyema thoracis. Eighteen patients (27%) had concurrent fungemia. Most
		"(56 patients, 84%) cases of fungal empyema thoracis were nosocomial, and many"
		"case (43 patients, 64%) were acquired in ICUs. Abdominal disease (20 patients,"
		"30%), especially previous abdominal surgery and GI perforation (12% and 10%,"
		"respectively), was the most common cause of fungal empyema thoracis, followed by"
		"bronchopulmonary infection (15 patients, 22%) and chest surgery (12 patients,"
		"18%). Forty-nine patients (73%) received systemic antifungal therapy, and 38"
		(57%) underwent closed drainage therapy. Eleven patients (16%) underwent pleural
		"irrigation with normal saline solution, povidone-iodine solution, or antifungal"
		agents. Six patients (9%) finally received decortication. All patients receiving
		surgery or pleural irrigation with antifungal agents survived. Despite the
		"aforementioned management, the crude mortality was high (73%). Multivariate"
		analysis showed a significantly increased risk of death in immunocompromised
		"patients (relative risk, 1.58; p < 0.005) and those with respiratory failure"
		"(relative risk, 2.31; p < 0.001). Systemic antifungal therapy was associated with"
		"a significantly lower risk of death (relative risk, 0.69; p < 0.05). CONCLUSION:"
		These data imply an increasing incidence of fungal empyema thoracis in recent
		years and the necessity for aggressive treatment of patients with this disease.

TI	-	Distribution and epidemiology of Candida species causing fungemia at a Saudi
		"Arabian hospital, 1996-2004."
PG	-	239-44
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate the Candida species and
		the change over time in the organisms causing candidemia at Saudi Aramco Medical
		Services Organization in Saudi Arabia. We also describe the risk factors
		associated with mortality. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of candidemia
		over nine years (1996-2004). RESULTS: A total of 98 distinct episodes of
		candidemia were identified over the study period. The annual incidence of
		candidemia ranged between 0.2 and 0.76 cases/1000 hospital discharges with an
		incidence per 10 000 patient-days per year of 0.45 to 1.6. The most frequent
		"Candida species were Candida albicans (53%), Candida tropicalis (19%), Candida"
		"parapsilosis (16%), and Candida glabrata (7%). In relation to predisposing"
		"factors, 83% of candidemia occurred in patients with central venous catheters and"
		96% had received broad-spectrum antibiotics. Other predisposing factors included
		"complicated abdominal surgeries (22%), total parenteral nutrition (52%),"
		"neutropenia (9%), acute renal failure (24%), malignancy (26%) and burns (15%)."
		"However, prior fluconazole use was low (8%). The overall crude mortality rate was"
		43% for all candidemia. Logistic regression analysis identified two independent
		"determinants of death, C. albicans (OR 5.91, 95% CI 1.50, 23.24, p=0.01) and"
		"acute renal failure (OR 5.15, 95% CI 1.18, 22.55, p=0.03). CONCLUSION: The study"
		showed that the rate of candidemia was low in our hospital and that C. albicans
		was the major species followed by C. tropicalis and C. parapsilosis. Future
		studies are needed to evaluate the antifungal susceptibility pattern in our
		hospital.

TI	-	Candidaemia in a London teaching hospital: analysis of 128 cases over a 7-year
		period.
PG	-	390-6
AB	-	In a retrospective analysis of 128 cases of Candida bloodstream infections in a
		"London teaching hospital between 1995 and 2001, the incidence of candidaemia"
		increased from 0.2/1000 admissions in 1995 to 0.5 and 0.4/1000 admissions in 2000
		"and 2001, respectively. Risk factors for candidaemia included the presence of"
		"intravascular (IV) lines (88%), admission to intensive care (51%), parenteral"
		"nutrition (35%), multiple antibiotics (74%), corticosteroid therapy (12%), cancer"
		"chemotherapy (11%), renal transplantation (5%) and neutropenia (3%). The sources"
		"of infection were IV lines (77%), the urinary tract (7%) and the gastrointestinal"
		"tract (7%). Serious infective complications (endocarditis, endophthalmitis or"
		brain abscess) were noted in 6% of cases. The most frequently isolated species
		"were Candida albicans (64%), C. glabrata (20%), C. tropicalis (9%) and C."
		parapsilosis (5%). The overall fluconazole-resistance rate of Candida spp. was 7%
		(MIC > or = 64 mg l-1). All the C. albicans isolates were sensitive to
		fluconazole (MIC < or = 8 mg l-1) whereas 20% of non-C. albicans isolates (27% of
		C. glabrata and 14%C. tropicalis) were resistant. The mortality rate (35%) was
		lower than in other reports and may be due to the early recognition of
		candidaemia and the prompt removal of IV lines together with the initiation of
		"appropriate antifungal therapy. Regular surveillance of local Candida species,"
		resistance profiles and risk factors is important in order to identify patients
		at risk and to develop empirical treatment protocols to reduce the incidence and
		mortality of candidaemia.

		literature review.
PG	-	106-108
LID	-	10.5301/uro.5000173 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: The retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) is a procedure that sees an
		increase in its use every day and is supported by excellent results in terms of
		safety and feasibility. We report the first case of fatal mycotic septic
		complication in a neurological patient for renal stone disease. CASE
		"PRESENTATION: The case of a woman 44 year-old, with left solitary kidney and"
		"history of advanced multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, bedridden and percutaneous"
		endoscopic gastrostomy was described. She was hospitalized for the presence of
		recurrent lower urinary tract infections. The computed tomography (CT) scan
		control revealed a 1.7 cm obstructive renal pelvic stone and multiple stones in
		"the bladder. After the refusal of a percutaneous approach, a RIRS was planned and"
		"done. No intraoperative complications were observed. In the postoperative period,"
		she developed a urinary sepsis with progressive deterioration of the general
		conditions. She died 6 days after the RIRS for septic shock with a blood culture
		positive for Candida glabrata. DISCUSSION: A Pubmed search for fatal
		complications after RIRS shows only two cases not fully elucidated. CONCLUSIONS:
		The use of flexible ureteroscopes and holmium lasers has a high succes
		"rate;nevertheless, the possibility of a major complication should be kept in mind"
		"in order to evaluate all the risk factors, to adopt all the preventive measures"
		for the safety of the patients.

TI	-	Inadequacy of fluconazole dosing in patients with candidemia based on Infectious
		Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines.
PG	-	919-27
AB	-	"INTRODUCTION: Based on Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines,"
		inappropriate fluconazole therapy in patients with candidemia is defined as an
		"empiric dose <6 mg/kg/d, <12 mg/kg/d after Candida glabrata identification, or"
		"continued fluconazole use after identification of Candida krusei. However, the"
		extent to which inappropriate antifungal therapy is due to improper dosing or
		drug selection has not been well investigated. The objectives of this study were
		to assess the incidence of inappropriate fluconazole therapy in patients with
		candidemia and to identify variables associated with inappropriate therapy.
		METHODS: Retrospective cohort study from four medical centers of hospitalized
		patients with candidemia prescribed fluconazole. Appropriateness of fluconazole
		dosages (adjusted for renal dysfunction) was assessed at the time of symptom
		onset and after Candida identification. RESULTS: Patients (206) were identified.
		Sixty-one of 112 (55%) patients who were given empiric therapy received an
		initial dose of fluconazole <6 mg/kg. After identification of the Candida
		"species, 97 of 206 (47%) patients received inadequate fluconazole therapy based"
		on IDSA guideline recommendations due to a fluconazole dose <12 mg/kg after
		"isolation of C. glabrata (12%), continued use of fluconazole after isolation of"
		"C. krusei (3%), or a dose <6 mg/kg for all other Candida species (32%). Using"
		"multivariate logistic regression, increased weight in 1-kg increments (OR: 1.02;"
		p = 0.0142) and a creatinine clearance (CRCL) >50 ml/minute (OR: 3.17; p =
		0.0003) were associated with increased risk of inadequate fluconazole therapy.
		CONCLUSION: A high prevalence of suboptimal dosing of fluconazole given
		empirically or after Candida species identification was documented. Increased
		weight and CRCL were significant predictors of inadequate fluconazole doses.

		pediatric population.
PG	-	664-8
LID	-	10.1097/INF.0b013e318213da0f [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Non-albicans Candida (NAC) species have been implicated as major
		pathogens in patients with hospital-acquired candidemia. Few studies have
		investigated the impact of NAC fungemia among pediatric patients outside of the
		"neonatal age group. MATERIALS/METHODS: Between 2000 and 2009, we performed a"
		retrospective case-control study in children aged 6 months to ≤18 years with
		"blood culture proven candidemia at Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX."
		RESULTS: A total of 276 episodes of candidemia occurred in 226 patients. The
		overall incidence ranged between 0.06 and 0.3 per 1000 inpatient days. The median
		"patient age was 50 months (range, 6 months to ≤18 years) with 55.4% males; 40.2%"
		Hispanics; and 31.8% whites. Candida albicans (CA) was the most common (44.2%)
		"species although, collectively, NAC was more frequently (55.8%) isolated. Among"
		"the NAC group, Candida parapsilosis was most common (23.9%) followed by Candida"
		"tropicalis (14.8%), Candida glabrata (6.5%), and Candida lusitaniae (5.4%). No"
		"difference was found between CA and NAC candidemia in terms of demographics,"
		"underlying diagnosis, risk factors, clinical features, dissemination, or 30-day"
		mortality. Disseminated candidiasis was independently associated with the use of
		"vasopressors (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 4.58; confidence interval [CI]:"
		"1.03-20.5; P = 0.05), prolonged fungemia (≥3 days of persistently positive"
		"cultures) after catheter removal (OR, 3.2; CI: 1.08-9.3; P = 0.04), and"
		"neutropenia (OR, 4.06; CI: 1.2-13.2; P = 0.02), but not with NAC fungemia."
		"CONCLUSIONS: Though CA was the single most common species, NAC species"
		collectively have emerged as the predominant pathogens responsible for candidemia
		"in non-neonatal patients at our institution. Risk factors, clinical features, and"
		outcomes were not different between the 2 groups.

LID	-	10.29063/ajrh2020/v24i3.4 [doi]
AB	-	Vaginal Candida infection is one of the most common genital tract infections
		reported in pregnant women. This study was designed to determine the prevalence
		of vaginal Candida infection and pattern of Candida species isolates in the
		genital tract of pregnant women during antenatal period and in early labour; and
		the associated fetal outcome. The study was conducted at the antenatal clinic and
		"labor ward of Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital Sagamu, Ogun State,"
		Nigeria. High vaginal swabs were collected from 408 pregnant women at the
		antenatal clinic and repeated in early labour. The samples were processed to
		isolate Candida species. Data were analysed using Statistical Package for Social
		"Science (SPSS) windows version 21.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Prevalence of"
		Candida infection was significantly higher in early labour (46%) than during
		"antenatal period (38%) (P=0.02). Candida albicans was the predominant isolate,"
		followed by Candida glabrata and Candida tropicalis. Candida infection was
		"associated with increased likelihood of low birth weight babies (AOR 2.8, CI:"
		1.1-6.8; P= 0.03). However there was no statistically significant effect of
		"Candida infection on the likelihood of preterm delivery (AOR 1.4, CI: 0.7-2.6; P="
		0.35). Routine screening and prompt treatment of women at risk of delivering low
		birth weight babies is advocated.

TI	-	Neonatal Candida glabrata sepsis: clinical and laboratory features compared with
		other Candida species.
PG	-	39-43
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown a rise in Candida glabrata infections among
		"immunocompromised adults. In published case series of neonatal candidemia,"
		"however, the species glabrata is uncommon. We conducted a retrospective chart"
		"review to examine the epidemiology, clinical presentation and outcome of neonatal"
		infection with C. glabrata compared with other species of Candida. METHODS:
		Neonatal and microbiology databases of two affiliated hospitals were searched for
		all cases of candidemia in neonatal intensive care unit patients with suspected
		"sepsis from 1991 through 1998. RESULTS: Of 58 cases of Candida sepsis, 9 (15%)"
		"were caused by C. glabrata (CG), 41 (71%) by C. albicans (CA) and 8 (14%) by C."
		parapsilosis (CP). There was no change in the proportion of candidemia caused by
		glabrata species in the years studied. Although there was a significantly higher
		"proportion of CG cases at 1 hospital (29% vs. 6%, P = 0.01), there was no case"
		clustering to suggest direct nosocomial spread. Compared with other Candida
		"species, CG occurred in infants of higher gestational age (CG 29.7 weeks, CA 26.6"
		"weeks, CP 27.3 weeks) and birth weight (CG 1442 g, CA 931 g, CP 965 g). Patients"
		with CG sepsis were more likely to be receiving broad spectrum antibiotics at the
		"time of diagnosis (CG 67%, CA 38%, CP 38%), were less likely to present with"
		"apnea and had less severe thrombocytopenia. Of 9 patients with CG sepsis, 1 had"
		"meningitis, 1 had necrotizing enterocolitis and 3 had candiduria. CONCLUSION: C."
		glabrata is a significant nosocomial pathogen in the neonate.

PG	-	493-9
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candida species are important bloodstream pathogens that are being
		isolated with increasing frequency. Despite the availability of effective
		"antifungal therapy, the mortality rate associated with Candida infection remains"
		"high. With the objective of describing the epidemiology of candidemia, the"
		Canadian Infectious Disease Society conducted a study of candidemia in Canada.
		METHODS: Fourteen medical centres across Canada identified all patients with
		candidemia from March 1992 to February 1994 through blood culture surveillance
		for Candida spp. Patient-related data for invasive fungal infection were compiled
		retrospectively by chart review using a standardized data-recording form
		developed for the Fungal Disease Registry of the Canadian Infectious Disease
		Society. Cases of Candidemia were studied in relation to underlying medical
		"conditions, predisposing factors, concurrent infection, antimicrobial agents,"
		"antifungal treatment and deaths. RESULTS: In total, 415 cases of candidemia were"
		"identified, 48 (11.6%) in children and 367 (88.4%) in adults. The causative"
		"pathogens were C. albicans in 286 cases (68.9%), C. parapsilosis in 43 (10.4%),"
		"C. glabrata in 34 (8.2%), C. tropicalis in 27 (6.5%) and other Candida species in"
		18 (4.3%); polymicrobial candidemia occurred in 7 cases (1.7%). The overall
		"mortality rate was 46%, and the rate of deaths clinically related to candidemia"
		"was 19%. However, only 13 (27%) of the children died. A univariate analysis"
		"indicated that significant risk factors for death were age greater than 60 years,"
		"therapy for concomitant bacterial infection, stay in an intensive care unit,"
		"concurrent malignant disease, cytotoxic chemotherapy and granulocytopenia,"
		although only age and stay in an intensive care unit emerged as significant risk
		factors in the multivariate analysis. After adjustment for other predictors of
		"death, only infection with C. parapsilosis was associated with a lower mortality"
		rate than infection with C. albicans. Treatment was given in 352 (84.8%) of
		cases. Amphotericin B was the preferred agent in 244 cases (69.3% of those
		treated); fluconazole was used in 101 cases (28.7%) and ketoconazole in 5 cases
		(1.4%). INTERPRETATION: Candidemia in Canada is caused predominantly by C.
		"albicans. The mortality rate associated with candidemia is high, but it varies"
		with the species of Candida and is lower in children than in adults. Age greater
		than 60 years and stay in an intensive care unit were the most significant risk
		factors for overall mortality.

TI	-	A 1-year prospective survey of candidemia in Italy and changing epidemiology over
		one decade.
PG	-	655-62
LID	-	10.1007/s15010-013-0455-6 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to assess the epidemiology of candidemia and
		antifungal susceptibility profiles of Candida isolates in Italy through a
		prospective surveillance study and to evaluate changes compared to a previous
		survey performed in one Italian region (Lombardy) in 1997-1999. METHODS: A
		prospective laboratory-based surveillance of candidemia was performed in Italy
		"from January to December 2009. For each case a questionnaire was filled in, and"
		the first isolate was collected and tested for in vitro antifungal
		"susceptibility. RESULTS: During our 12-month survey, 467 episodes of candidemia"
		were reported from 34 centres (30 located in Lombardy) and 464 isolates
		collected. Candida albicans was the predominant species (overall incidence 50.4
		"%), but the proportion varied considerably from 52.1 % in Lombardy hospitals to"
		45.2 % hospitals located outside this region. The second most frequent species
		was C. glabrata in Lombardy and C. parapsilosis in other regions. Comparison of
		the 1997-1999 and 2009 data on episodes of candidemia in Lombardy revealed a
		"threefold increase in incidence (from 0.38 to 1.19 per 1,000 admissions), aging"
		"of infected patients, decline in crude mortality (from 35 to 27.1 %) and an"
		increased proportion of C. glabrata etiology (from 12.8 to 20.3 %).
		Susceptibility testing confirmed the broad activity of amphotericin B and
		echinocandins. Decreased susceptibility to fluconazole was found in 24.9 % of the
		tested isolates. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this latest survey confirm the high
		rate of candidemia in Italy and show changes in some of the epidemiological
		"tracts, such as aging of infected patients, increased proportion of C. glabrata"
		"infections, increased diagnosis in medical wards, and improvement in patients'"
		survival.

AB	-	"INTRODUCTION: The incidence of Candida spp. infections is worrisome, particularly"
		in critically ill patients. Previous reports suggested that increasing use of
		antifungal therapy might affect resistance profiles of invasive strains. The
		study objective was to describe the distribution resistance profile of Candida
		"spp. strains, and to correlate it with antifungal consumptions within one ICU."
		METHOD: Antifungal drug consumption was measured as the number of defined daily
		doses per 1000 hospital days. The distribution of Candida spp. over a 10 year
		period 2004-2013 and the MICs of antifungal drugs over 2007-2013 were determined.
		Time series analyses were performed. RESULTS: Of 2403 identified Candida spp.
		"from 5360 patients, Candida albicans predominated (53.1%), followed by Candida"
		"glabrata (16.2%), Candida parapsilosis (7.9%) and Candida tropicalis (7.5%). C."
		parapsilosis increased from 5.7% in 2004 to 8.4% in 2013 (P = 0.02). The increase
		in caspofungin use is correlated with the increase in caspofungin MICs of C.
		"parapsilosis (P = 0.01), C. glabrata (P = 0.001) and C. albicans (P = 0.02)."
		Polyenes consumption correlated with an increase in amphotericin B MICs of C.
		glabrata (P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Previous history of antifungal prescription
		within an ICU influences Candida species distribution and susceptibility profile
		to antifungal agents. The significant selective pressure exerted by caspofungin
		and amphotericin B on C. glabrata is a concern.

		cultures-is it justified?
PG	-	1697-1702
LID	-	10.1038/s41433-018-0160-x [doi]
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Although the worldwide prevalence of disseminated candidaemia is
		"rising, reported intraocular candidiasis rates are variable, even as low as 1%."
		The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends fundoscopy screening for
		all fungal blood culture positive patients. We wished to evaluate the impact of
		this recommendation on our department. METHODS: A retrospective observational
		study was performed in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (population = 1.15 million)
		for all patients with candida positive blood culture results over a 2-year
		"period. RESULTS: From January 2015 to December 2016, 258 candida positive"
		"cultures were obtained from 168 adults (mean age = 62 years, range: 17-94 years;"
		"85 females, 83 males). Candida species were isolated in 161/168 (95.8%) cases"
		"(43.5% Candida albicans, 35.7% Candida glabrata). All 168 cases were treated with"
		intravenous antifungals. 84 patients (50%) were formally referred to
		"ophthalmology. Of those not referred, 21 were deceased prior to culture result"
		(12.5%) and 14 patients subsequently deteriorated (8.3%). Six patients reported
		"visual symptoms. In total, 65% had no ocular findings and 32.5% had unrelated"
		"ocular signs. Only one patient had signs consistent with Candida chorioretinitis,"
		making the prevalence of intraocular candida in our population 1.3% (1/80).
		"CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of ocular candidiasis is low, presumably due to"
		potent systemic antifungal agents and good intraocular penetration. Our findings
		support the view that routine fundoscopy screening may not be indicated in every
		culture positive patient. This paper provides an evidence base for the Royal
		College's Eyecare in intensive care unit recommendations regarding targeted
		"screening of non-verbal, symptomatic or high-risk patients."

TI	-	Epidemiology and risk factors for nosocomial Non-Candida albicans candidemia in
		adult patients at a tertiary care hospital in North China.
PG	-	684-90
LID	-	10.1093/mmy/myv060 [doi]
AB	-	"Nosocomial candidemia extends the length of hospital stay, increases the costs of"
		"medical care, and is associated with a high mortality rate. Epidemiological data"
		that assist in the choice of initial therapy may help to improve the prognosis.
		The present study was undertaken to investigate the epidemiology of nosocomial
		candidemia and identify risk factors for nosocomial candidemia caused by C.
		albicans and non-albicans Candida species (NAC). A retrospective chart review was
		undertaken to analyze cases of nosocomial candidemia treated at the Beijing
		Friendship Hospital between January 2008 and December 2012. All cases of
		candidemia were identified using the previously published criteria. Among 106
		"patients analyzed, 53.8% had nosocomial candidemia caused by NAC. Candida"
		"albicans was the most common causative agent, accounting for 46.2% of all cases,"
		"followed by C. glabrata (25.5%), C. tropicalis (15.1%), C. parapsilosis (10.4%)"
		and C. Krusei (0.9%). Comparison of nosocomial C. albicans and NAC candidemia by
		multivariate logistic regression showed that factors independently associated
		with nosocomial NAC candidemia included exposure to azole agents (odds ratio
		[OR]: 3.359; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.136-10.154; P = .031) and artificial
		surgical implants (OR: 37.519; 95% CI: 2.5-562.998; P = .009). A significant risk
		factor for nosocomial C. albicans candidemia was cancer surgery (OR: 0.075; 95%
		CI: 0.013-0.437; P = .004). Clinical and epidemiological differences in the risk
		factors between nosocomial candidemia caused by C. albicans and NAC should be
		considered when selecting an initial antifungal regimen for the treatment of
		adult patients. This should be undertaken before the availability of species
		identification and/or antifungal susceptibility results.

TI	-	Clinical profile and risk factors for oral candidosis in sick newborns.
PG	-	299-303
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To provide the clinical profile and assess the significance of
		various risk factors contributing to the occurrence of oral candidosis in
		newborns. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Neonatal Intensive Care Unit
		(NICU). SUBJECTS: Twenty newborns with oral candidosis and an equal number of age
		and weight matched controls. INTERVENTIONS: All cases of oral candidosis were
		treated with local application of 1% Clotrimazole. RESULTS: Oral candidosis was
		documented in 3.2% (20/650) cases in the NICU. Acute pseudomembranous candidosis
		was the most common presentation. The mean age of onset was 10.5 days. Candida
		"albicans was isolated in 50% cases in addition to C. tropicalis, C."
		"paratropicalis, C. krusei, C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis. On univariate"
		"analysis, male sex, birth asphyxia and prolonged antibiotic therapy had a"
		significant correlation with occurence of oral candidosis in neonates. Out of
		"these, birth asphyxia was the only factor significantly associated with oral"
		"candidosis (OR 8.09, 95% CI 1.34-48.8, p = 0.0226) on multivariate analysis."
		CONCLUSIONS: C. albicans was the predominant isolate in this series of oral
		candidosis. Clinical manifestations were evident in the second week of life and
		birth asphyxia was the most important associated perinatal event.

OAB	-	"During February-September 1992, all 650 infants admitted to the neonatal"
		intensive care unit of the University College of Medical Sciences and G.T.B.
		Hospital were screened for oral thrush. A case control study was conducted to
		determine risk factors for oral candidiasis in newborns. The rate of oral
		candidiasis in this population was 3.2% (20 cases). The most common pathogen was
		Candida albicans (50%). All but 1 oral thrush case had acute pseudomembranous
		candidiasis. 75% of oral thrush cases were asymptomatic. Mean age of onset was
		"10.4 days (median, 9.5 days). Clotrimazole solution was applied to oral lesions"
		of all oral thrush cases. The multiple logistic regression revealed that birth
		asphyxia was the only significant factor responsible for oral thrush in newborns
		(odds ratio = 8.09; p = 0.0226). These findings show that the most important
		perinatal event associated with oral thrush in newborns was birth asphyxia.

		and children (n=144) with candidemia at tertiary care centers in the United
		States in parallel with a candidemia treatment trial that included nonneutropenic
		adults. Candida albicans was the most common bloodstream isolate recovered from
		adults and children (45% vs. 49%) and was associated with high mortality (47%
		among adults vs. 29% among children). Three-month survival was better among
		children than among adults (76% vs. 54%; P<.001). Most children received
		"amphotericin B as initial therapy, whereas most adults received fluconazole. In"
		"adults, Candida parapsilosis fungemia was associated with lower mortality than"
		was non-parapsilosis candidemia (24% vs. 46%; P<.001). Mortality was similar
		among subjects with Candida glabrata or non-glabrata candidemia; mortality was
		also similar among subjects with C. glabrata candidemia who received fluconazole
		rather than other antifungal therapy. Subjects in the observational cohort had
		higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores than did
		"participants in the clinical trial (18.6 vs. 16.1), which suggests that the"
		former subjects are more often excluded from therapeutic trials.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: This retrospective study investigated clinical manifestations of
		candidemia caused by uncommon Candida species and antifungal susceptibility of
		the isolates in a regional hospital in Taiwan. METHODS: The uncommon Candida
		"species was initially defined as Candida species other than C. albicans, C."
		"tropicalis, C. glabrata complex, C. parapsilosis complex and C. krusei. All"
		uncommon Candida isolates were identified and confirmed by molecular methods.
		In vitro susceptibility testing of the uncommon Candida species to nine
		antifungal agents was conducted using the broth microdilution method with the
		"Sensititre YeastOne (SYO) system (Trek Diagnostic Systems, Ltd., East Grimstead,"
		"UK). RESULTS: Twenty-one patients, comprising 11 males and 10 females with a"
		"median age of 69 years, were recruited. Cancer (n = 11) was the most common"
		"underlying disease, 19 (90.5%) cases had prior antibiotic exposure, and only two"
		patients had prior antifungal use. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was
		"38.1% (n = 8). C. guilliermondii (n = 11) was the most common pathogen, followed"
		by C. curvata (n = 3). C. guilliermondii isolates exhibited relatively high rates
		of azole minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) above epidemiological cut-off
		"values (ECVs), whereas C. pelliculosa and C. lusitaniae isolates all remained"
		susceptible to azoles. All three C. curvata isolates had high caspofungin
		(>8 mg/L) and fluconazole MICs (8 mg/L) and could be defined as
		multidrug-resistant. CONCLUSIONS: Uncommon Candida species frequently exhibit
		high rates of non-susceptibility to antifungals. Identification of all Candida
		isolates at the species level from blood samples is of value for treatment.

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To review the epidemiology of candidemia in a UK tertiary referral
		center. METHODS: Clinical and laboratory data from patients with candidemia were
		"collected prospectively from October 1, 2005 to June 30, 2008 (a 33-month"
		period). RESULTS: A total of 107 episodes were identified. The incidence was 10.9
		episodes/100 000 bed-days. The most common predisposing factors were the use of
		"broad-spectrum antibiotics (92%), the presence of an intravascular device (IVD)"
		"(82%), admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) (51%), and recent surgery (50%)."
		"Non-Candida albicans species accounted for 58% of the episodes, which is higher"
		than the percentage reported from other UK centers. C. albicans was the most
		"common species, accounting for 43% of episodes, followed by C. glabrata (31%) and"
		"C. parapsilosis (20%). Overall C. tropicalis, C. krusei, C. norvegensis, and C."
		lusitaniae caused 7% of episodes. The crude 30-day mortality rate was 37%.
		Advanced age (p = 0.003) and the presence of septic shock (p = 0.038) were
		associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Candidemia continues to be associated
		with a high mortality. Preventative measures should be targeted against high-risk
		"hospitalized patients, especially those in ICUs, the elderly, and those"
		undergoing major surgery. Local surveillance of candidemia is important to
		optimize management.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Prolonged myelosuppression following CD19-directed CAR T-cell
		"transfusion represents an important, yet underreported, adverse event. The"
		resulting neutropenia and multifactorial immunosuppression can facilitate severe
		infectious complications. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the clinical course of a
		59-year-old patient with relapsed/refractory DLBCL who received
		Axicabtagene-Ciloleucel (Axi-cel). The patient developed ASTCT grade I CRS and
		"grade IV ICANS, necessitating admission to the neurological ICU and prolonged"
		application of high-dose corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents.
		"Importantly, neutropenia was profound (ANC < 100/μl), G-CSF-refractory, and"
		"prolonged, lasting more than 50 days. The patient developed severe septic shock 3"
		weeks after CAR transfusion while receiving anti-fungal prophylaxis with
		micafungin. His clinical status stabilized with broad anti-infective treatment
		and intensive supportive measures. An autologous stem cell backup was employed on
		day 46 to support hematopoietic recovery. Although the counts of the patient
		"eventually started to recover, he developed an invasive pulmonary aspergillosis,"
		which ultimately lead to respiratory failure and death. Postmortem examination
		revealed signs of Candida glabrata pancolitis. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights
		the increased risk for fatal infectious complications in patients who present
		with profound and prolonged cytopenia after CAR T-cell therapy. We describe a
		rare case of C. glabrata pancolitis associated with multifactorial
		"immunosuppression. Although our patient succumbed to a fatal fungal infection,"
		autologous stem cell boost was able to spur hematopoiesis and may represent an
		important therapeutic strategy for DLBCL patients with CAR T-cell associated bone
		marrow aplasia who have underwent prior stem cell harvest.

TI	-	Candida albicans and non-albicans species as etiological agent of vaginitis in
		pregnant and non-pregnant women.
PG	-	89-97
AB	-	Pregnancy represents a risk factor in the occurrence of vaginal candidosis. The
		objectives of our study were: to make determination of the microscopic findings
		"of vaginal swab, frequency of Candida species in the culture of pregnant women"
		"and patients who are not pregnant, determine the Candida species in all cultures,"
		and to determine the frequency and differences in the frequency of C. albicans
		"and other non-albicans species. In one year study performed during 2006 year, we"
		tested patients of Gynaecology and Obstetrics clinic of the Clinical Centre in
		Sarajevo and Gynaecology department of the General hospital in Sarajevo. 447
		woman included in the study were separated in two groups: 203 pregnant (in the
		"last trimester of pregnancy), and 244 non-pregnant woman in period of fertility."
		"Each vaginal swab was examined microscopically. The yeast, number of colonies,"
		and the species of Candida were determined on Sabouraud dextrose agar with
		"presence of antibiotics. For determination of Candida species, we used germ tube"
		"test for detection of C. albicans, and cultivation on the selective medium and"
		assimilation tests for detection of non-albicans species. The results indicated
		"positive microscopic findings in the test group (40,9%), as well as greater"
		"number of positive cultures (46,8%). The most commonly detected species for both"
		"groups was C. albicans ( test group 40.9% and control group 23,0%). The most"
		"commonly detected non-albicans species for the test group were C. glabrata (4,2"
		"%) and C. krusei (3,2%), and for the control group were C. glabrata (3,2%) and C."
		"parapsilosis (3,2%). The microscopic findings correlated with the number of"
		"colonies in positive cultures. In the test group, we found an increased number of"
		"yeasts (64,3%), and the pseudopyphae and blastopores by microscopic examination"
		"as an indication of infection. In the control group, we found a small number of"
		"yeasts (64,6%) , in the form of blastopores, as an indication of the candida"
		"colonisation. Our results indicate that gravidity, as the risc factor for"
		"incidence of infection, has the significant role in the incidence of vaginal"
		candidosis.

TI	-	Candida tropicalis is the most prevalent yeast species causing candidemia in
		Algeria: the urgent need for antifungal stewardship and infection control
		measures.
PG	-	50
LID	-	10.1186/s13756-020-00710-z [doi]
LID	-	50
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Despite being associated with a high mortality and economic burden,"
		data regarding candidemia are scant in Algeria. The aim of this study was to
		"unveil the epidemiology of candidemia in Algeria, evaluate the antifungal"
		susceptibility pattern of causative agents and understand the molecular
		"mechanisms of antifungal resistance where applicable. Furthermore, by performing"
		environmental screening and microsatellite typing we sought to identify the
		source of infection. METHODS: We performed a retrospective epidemiological-based
		surveillance study and collected available blood yeast isolates recovered from
		"the seven hospitals in Algiers. To identify the source of infection, we performed"
		environmental screening from the hands of healthcare workers (HCWs) and high
		touch areas. Species identification was performed by API Auxa-Color and MALDI-TOF
		MS and ITS sequencing was performed for species not reliably identified by
		MALDI-TOF MS. Antifungal susceptibility testing followed CLSI M27-A3/S4 and
		included all blood and environmental yeast isolates. ERG11 sequencing was
		performed for azole-resistant Candida isolates. Microsatellite typing was
		"performed for blood and environmental Candida species, where applicable. RESULTS:"
		Candida tropicalis (19/66) was the main cause of candidemia in these seven
		"hospitals, followed by Candida parapsilosis (18/66), Candida albicans (18/66),"
		and Candida glabrata (7/66). The overall mortality rate was 68.6% (35/51) and was
		81.2% for C. tropicalis-infected patients (13/16). Fluconazole was the main
		antifungal drug used (12/51); 41% of the patients (21/51) did not receive any
		systemic treatment. Candida parapsilosis was isolated mainly from the hands of
		"HCWs (7/28), and various yeasts were collected from high-touch areas (11/47),"
		"including Naganishia albida, C. parapsilosis and C. glabrata. Typing data"
		revealed interhospital transmission on two occasions for C. parapsilosis and C.
		"glabrata, and the same clone of C. parapsilosis infected two patients within the"
		same hospital. Resistance was only noted for C. tropicalis against azoles (6/19)
		and fluconazole-resistant C. tropicalis isolates (≥8 μg/ml) (6/19) contained a
		novel P56S (5/6) amino acid substitution and a previously reported one (V234F;
		"1/6) in Erg11p. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our data suggest an urgent need for"
		antifungal stewardship and infection control strategies to improve the clinical
		outcome of Algerian patients with candidemia. The high prevalence of C.
		tropicalis joined by fluconazole-resistance may hamper the therapeutic efficacy
		"of fluconazole, the frontline antifungal drug used in Algeria."

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors for pediatric Candida central line-associated
		bloodstream infections (CLABSIs). DESIGN: Retrospective case-control study.
		SETTING: Freestanding tertiary care children's hospital. PATIENTS: Patients with
		"Candida CLABSI from January 31, 2000, through December 31, 2010, compared with"
		"age- and year-matched controls. METHODS: Demographics, comorbidities, presence of"
		"indwelling foreign bodies, exposure to antibiotics or corticosteroids, total"
		"parenteral nutrition (TPN) or blood transfusions, complications, and outcome were"
		evaluated. Bivariate and then logistic regression were used to compare temporal
		trends and risk factors. Results. A total of 160 Candida CLABSI patients (median
		"age, 1.96 years) were compared with 457 controls. Those with Candida CLABSIs were"
		"more likely to have intestinal failure (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 6.777 [95%"
		"confidence interval (CI), 2.315-19.839]; P< .001), to have a gastrostomy tube in"
		"place (aOR, 4.156 [95% CI, 2.317-7.456]; P< .001), and to receive TPN (aOR, 3.897"
		"[95% CI, 2.403-6.319]; P< .001) or blood transfusions (aOR, 2.990 [95% CI,"
		"1.841-4.856]; P< .001), and they had a 3-fold increase in mortality (aOR, 3.543"
		"[95% CI, 1.501-8.364]; P< .004). Candida albicans was most common, but"
		non-albicans strains resistant to amphotericin (C. lusitaniae) and fluconazole
		(C. glabrata and C. krusei) were also found. Conclusions. Those patients with
		"intestinal failure, gastrostomy tube presence, and/or receipt of TPN and blood"
		transfusions are at increased risk for development of Candida CLABSI.

PG	-	657-65
LID	-	10.1097/SLA.0b013e31819ed914 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To determine whether Candida glabrata colonization and invasive
		candidiasis (IC) increased among critically ill surgical patients 3 years after
		the introduction of fluconazole prophylaxis to a surgical intensive care unit
		(SICU). SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Fluconazole prophylaxis has been shown in
		randomized clinical trials to reduce the occurrence of candidiasis in some
		"patient populations, including high-risk SICU patients. One such trial was"
		performed in The Johns Hopkins Hospital SICU in 1998. Whether the epidemiology of
		Candida colonization and IC has changed in SICUs where fluconazole prophylaxis is
		routinely utilized has not been adequately studied. METHODS: We conducted a
		"prospective, observational study of subjects admitted for > or = 3 days to the"
		"SICU of a large, urban, academic medical center, where fluconazole prophylaxis"
		had been utilized for approximately 3 years. Surveillance fungal cultures of
		"rectal/fecal swabs, urine, and endotracheal aspirates were performed on admission"
		"to the SICU, once weekly, and upon discharge from the SICU. Demographic and"
		clinical data were collected. C. glabrata colonization and IC prevalence among
		patients in the prospective cohort were compared with the prevalence among SICU
		patients enrolled in the 1998 clinical trial of fluconazole for the prevention of
		candidiasis that was performed at the same institution. RESULTS: C. glabrata
		colonization was not significantly more common among patients in the 2003 cohort
		"as compared with patients in the 1998 trial (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 0.90, 95%"
		confidence interval [CI]: 0.57-1.41). Patients with IC in the 2003 cohort were
		not more likely than those in the 1998 trial to have IC due to C. glabrata
		"(adjusted OR: 1.93, 95% CI: 0.20-18.98), while patients with IC in the 2003"
		cohort were less likely than patients in the 1998 trial to have acquired IC in
		"the ICU (adjusted OR: 0.08, 95% CI: 0.009-0.82). CONCLUSIONS: There was no"
		increase in C. glabrata colonization or in the proportion of IC due to C.
		glabrata after a 3-year period of routine fluconazole prophylaxis for selected
		SICU patients.

		candidemia in nonneutropenic patients.
PG	-	568-73
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candidemia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in
		hospitalized patients. OBJECTIVES: To describe the epidemiology of and risk
		factors for non-albicans candidemia (NAC) in nonneutropenic adults and the impact
		of NAC on patient outcomes and treatment cost. METHODS: We conducted a
		retrospective cohort analysis comparing demographics and risk factors for Candida
		albicans candidemia (CAC) versus NAC in 144 nonneutropenic patients with
		candidemia over a 6 year period (1997-2002) at Detroit Receiving Hospital.
		"RESULTS: Candida species distribution included albicans (50%), parapsilosis"
		"(13%), tropicalis (10%), and glabrata (13%). Predominant species varied by"
		"patient care unit, with C. glabrata more common in the medical intensive care"
		"unit (ICU) and C. parapsilosis in the burn ICU. In multivariate analysis, NAC was"
		"associated with the absence of antibiotic use at the onset of candidemia, recent"
		"history of solid tumor, and male sex. NAC was not associated with an increase in"
		"mortality or length of stay compared with CAC, but was found to have a higher"
		cost of antifungal therapy ($2030 vs $780; p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The
		epidemiology of candidemia is complex and varies among the different patient care
		"units. Specifically, patients appear less likely to develop NAC if they are"
		receiving antibiotics at the onset of candidemia. Increased awareness of risk
		factors for NAC can be used to guide adequate initial antifungal therapy.

TI	-	The epidemiology of Candida glabrata and Candida albicans fungemia in
		immunocompromised patients with cancer.
PG	-	380-5
AB	-	"PURPOSE: Candida glabrata is an increasing cause of candidemia, especially at"
		cancer and bone marrow transplant centers where fluconazole is used for
		antifungal prophylaxis. This yeast is less susceptible to fluconazole in vitro
		than is Candida albicans. We compared the characteristics of patients who had C.
		glabrata and C. albicans candidemia at a large cancer center. SUBJECTS AND
		METHODS: We searched the microbiological laboratory reports and identified 116
		cases of C. glabrata candidemia between 1993 and 1999. The 116 cases of C.
		albicans candidemia that occurred most closely in time (before or after each case
		of C. glabrata candidemia) served as the control group. Data were collected from
		patients' medical records. RESULTS: When compared with patients who had C.
		"albicans infection, patients with C. glabrata candidemia more often had an"
		"underlying hematologic malignancy (68 [59%] vs. 26 [22%], P = 0.0001), had an"
		Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score > or =16 (55
		"[48%] vs. 28 [25%], P = 0.0002), and received fluconazole prophylaxis (57 [49%]"
		"vs. 8 [7%], P = 0.0001). Patients with C. albicans candidemia more often had"
		"concomitant infections (101 [87%] vs. 78 [67%], P = 0.0003) and septic"
		"thrombophlebitis (11 [10%] vs. 2 [2%], P = 0.01). Among patients treated with"
		"antifungal therapy, those with C. albicans candidemia had a significantly greater"
		"overall response to therapy (83/104 [80%] vs. 60/97 [62%], P = 0.005) and to"
		"primary therapy (74/104 [71%] vs. 45/97 [46%], P = 0.0003). Amphotericin B"
		preparations were not more effective than fluconazole (19/45 [42%] vs. 20/38
		"[53%], P = 0.5) in patients with C. glabrata candidemia. Fluconazole was less"
		effective against C. glabrata than against C. albicans (20/38 [53%] vs. 57/74
		"[77%], P = 0.008). CONCLUSION: C. glabrata has emerged as an important cause of"
		"candidemia, especially among neutropenic patients who receive fluconazole"
		prophylaxis.

PG	-	635-41
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk factors for disseminated infection in
		hospitalized children with candidemia. METHODS: We performed a nested
		case-control study within a cohort of hospitalized children with candidemia. The
		cohort was defined by all patients with positive blood cultures for Candida
		"species in a large, urban, academic, tertiary care children's hospital from 1998"
		"to 2001. Cases were patients with clinical, microbiologic or radiographic"
		evidence of disseminated candidiasis. Controls were patients with no evidence of
		"disseminated candidiasis. RESULTS: Among 168 total children with candidemia, the"
		"median age was 3.5 years (interquartile range, 0.6-14.3). There were 189 episodes"
		"of candidemia. Candida species included:Candida albicans (41%), Candida"
		"parapsilosis (24%), Candida glabrata (13%) and Candida tropicalis (9%). The most"
		"common underlying diagnoses were oncologic (24%), gastrointestinal (15%) and"
		cardiac (10%) diseases. Eighty-nine patients (53%) were admitted to an intensive
		"care unit, 46 (27%) to a general pediatric or surgical ward and 33 (20%) to the"
		"oncology ward. Of the 168 patients with candidemia, 153 were included in the"
		"analysis of risk factors for disseminated candidiasis. Of 153 (17%) patients, 26"
		had evidence of organ dissemination. Organ involvement was most commonly
		"identified in the lung (58%), followed by the liver (23%), kidney (16%), brain"
		"(12%), spleen (8%), eye (8%) and heart (8%). Eight of the 26 patients had"
		evidence of dissemination to more than 1 organ. Independent risk factors for
		disseminated candidiasis were persistently positive blood cultures for Candida
		"(>3 days) with a central venous catheter in place (odds ratio, 3.0; 95%"
		"confidence interval, 1.2, 7.8; P = 0.02) and immunosuppression (odds ratio, 2.9;"
		"95% confidence interval, 1.2, 7.0; P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged duration of"
		candidemia with a central venous catheter in place and immunosuppression were
		independent risk factors for disseminated candidiasis in children with
		candidemia. Furthermore review of the epidemiology of candidemia at our
		institution revealed a heterogeneous population of children at risk for
		candidemia and a predominance of non-albicans species as the cause of these
		infections. Future studies are needed to determine the extent of evaluation
		needed for detecting dissemination among children with candidemia and to explore
		interventions for its prevention.

AB	-	"OBJECTIVE: To describe the evolving epidemiology, management, and risk factors"
		for death of invasive Candida infections in intensive care units (ICUs). DESIGN:
		"Prospective, observational, national, multicenter study. SETTING: One hundred"
		"eighty ICUs in France. PATIENTS: Between October 2005 and May 2006, 300 adult"
		patients with proven invasive Candida infection who received systemic antifungal
		therapy were included. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: One
		"hundred seven patients (39.5%) with isolated candidemia, 87 (32.1%) with invasive"
		"candidiasis without documented candidemia, and 77 (28.4%) with invasive"
		"candidiasis and candidemia were eligible. In 37% of the cases, candidemia"
		occurred within the first 5 days after ICU admission. C. albicans accounted for
		"57.0% of the isolates, followed by C. glabrata (16.7%), C. parapsilosis (7.5%),"
		"C. krusei (5.2%), and C. tropicalis (4.9%). In 17.1% of the isolates, the"
		causative Candida was less susceptible or resistant to fluconazole. Fluconazole
		"was the empirical treatment most commonly introduced (65.7%), followed by"
		"caspofungin (18.1%), voriconazole (5.5%), and amphotericin B (3.7%). After"
		"identification of the causative species and susceptibility testing results,"
		treatment was modified in 86 patients (31.7%). The case fatality ratio in ICU was
		45.9% and did not differ significantly according to the type of episode.
		Multivariate analysis showed that factors independently associated with death in
		ICU were type 1 diabetes mellitus (odds ratio [OR] 4.51; 95% confidence interval
		"[CI] 1.72-11.79; p = 0.002), immunosuppression (OR 2.63; 95% CI 1.35-5.11; p ="
		"0.0045), mechanical ventilation (OR 2.54; 95% CI 1.33-4.82; p = 0.0045), and body"
		"temperature >38.2 degrees C (reference, 36.5-38.2 degrees C; OR 0.36; 95% CI"
		0.17-0.77; p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: More than two thirds of patients with
		invasive candidiasis in ICU present with candidemia. Non-albicans Candida species
		reach almost half of the Candida isolates. Reduced susceptibility to fluconazole
		is observed in 17.1% of Candida isolates. Mortality of invasive candidiasis in
		ICU remains high.

PG	-	573
LID	-	10.1186/s12879-014-0573-5 [doi]
LID	-	573
AB	-	BACKGROUND: The goal was to determine whether one medical centres' unique
		antifungal prophylactic regimen for patients at high risk for invasive
		"candidiasis because of their haematological malignancies, haematopoietic stem"
		"cell transplants, or high-dose chemotherapy might lead ultimately to a higher"
		"incidence of infection, to increasing fluconazole resistance, or to a shift in"
		the predominant strain of Candida in invasive fungal episodes. METHODS: Data were
		"collected retrospectively, for a ten-year period from ONKO-KISS surveillance"
		"records, and from hospital, medical, and pharmacy records and then evaluated with"
		"respect to incidence of fungal infection episodes, emergence of antifungal drug"
		"resistance, and predominance of specific Candida strains in isolate cultures."
		Fisher's exact test and linear regression were used to compare minimum inhibitory
		"concentrations and to compare the incidence of different Candida isolates,"
		respectively. RESULTS: The incidence of infection remained quite stable over 10
		"years with a median of 0.67 episodes/1000 bed days. Overall, Candida glabrata was"
		the predominant species with 29% followed by C. albicans and C. krusei (14%
		each). No significant increment of non-albicans Candida species with decreased
		fluconazole susceptibility was perceived over this decade. CONCLUSIONS: Once
		weekly administration of 400 mg of fluconazole to prevent candidaemia appears to
		have no negative impact on the efficacy as a prophylaxis when compared to
		standard of care (400 mg of fluconazole daily).

PG	-	296-303
LID	-	10.1111/myc.12470 [doi]
AB	-	Candidemia remains a major cause of disease worldwide and is associated with a
		high mortality rate. We conducted a retrospective study of candidemia at Nantes
		"Hospital, France, between 2004 and 2010. A total of 191 episodes (n = 188"
		"patients) were reviewed. Incidence, demographics, risk factors, antifungal"
		"management, species identification, in vitro susceptibility and 12 weeks survival"
		were analysed. Global incidence of candidemia was 0.37‰ admissions. Higher
		incidences were observed in haematology (6.65‰) and intensive care units (2‰).
		Central venous catheter and antibiotic exposure were the most frequent risk
		factors (77% and 76% respectively). Candida albicans was the predominant species
		"(51.8%) followed by C. parapsilosis (14.5%), C. glabrata (9.8%), C. tropicalis"
		"(9.8%) and C. krusei (4.1%). However, species distribution differed significantly"
		between medical units with frequency of C. tropicalis being higher in haematology
		compared to other medical units. Fluconazole and caspofungin were the main
		"antifungals given as first-line therapy. Although not significant, 12 weeks"
		"mortality rate was 30.9%, being higher for C. tropicalis (44.4%) than for C."
		parapsilosis (16%). Acquired azole or echinocandin resistance was noted in some
		"isolates, underlining the need for systematic antifungal susceptibility testing"
		in patients with candidemia. These epidemiological findings will be of interest
		for antifungal stewardship at our hospital.

PG	-	185-91
LID	-	10.1345/aph.1K328 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Concerns surrounding the potential extra gut complication of gastric
		acid suppression are becoming increasingly realized. OBJECTIVE: To determine
		whether chronic antisecretory treatment with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or
		histamine(2)-receptor antagonist (H(2)RA) is associated with the presence of
		Candida spp. in cases of complicated intraabdominal infection. METHODS: We
		conducted a case-controlled study of adult surgical intensive care unit patients
		with complicated intraabdominal infection during a 5-year period. Exclusion
		"criteria consisted of primary peritonitis, diagnosis of intraabdominal infection"
		"more than 72 hours before hospital admission, or a stay in the intensive care"
		unit of less than 72 hours. Patients were categorized into either the
		antisecretory group (H(2)RA or PPI therapy prior to admission) or control group
		(no prior antisecretory therapy). RESULTS: One hundred eighteen patients met
		inclusion criteria. Chronic antisecretory (n = 41) and control (n = 77) patients
		were similar except in median age (69.0 vs 59.0 y; p = 0.026) and preadmission
		antibiotic use (36.6% vs 15.6%; p = 0.010). The 2 groups had a similar proportion
		of patients with Candida (30.3% vs 32.1%; p = 0.857); the cultures included C.
		"albicans, C. glabrata, and C. parapsilosis. Yeast was recovered more often in"
		patients diagnosed with community-acquired intraabdominal infection and in
		"patients who had used PPIs before hospital admission (p = 0.066). Additionally,"
		Candida was cultured more often in antisecretory patients with a history of prior
		abdominal surgery than in control patients (91.7% vs 62.5%; p = 0.066).
		CONCLUSIONS: No significant difference was found in the number of patients in the
		antisecretory and control groups from whom peritoneal Candida was recovered.
		"However, patients with prior abdominal surgery and those in the community with"
		chronic PPI use may be predisposed to Candida-associated intraabdominal
		infections.

TI	-	Increased Urine Interleukin-17 and Interleukin-22 Levels in Patients With
		Candidal Urinary Tract Infection.
PG	-	33-39
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Candiduria is common in the hospitalized patients. This study aimed
		to quantify interleukin (IL)-17 and IL-22 levels in urine of candiduric patients.
		MATERIALS AND METHODS: A case-control study was conducted on inpatients at
		Hashemi Nejad Kidney Center. Thirty-four patients were identified with Candida
		species in their urine samples (> 103 colony-forming units per milliliter and
		presence of Candida species only). Urine samples with concomitant infections were
		excluded. Thirty-four patients with negative direct examination and culture were
		included as the control patients. Interleulin-17 and IL-22 levels were measured
		in the lyophilized and nonlyophilized urine. The relevant cytokine titers of the
		"two groups were compared, and the association of cytokine elevation and"
		candiduria was investigated. RESULTS: The majority of the candiduric patients
		were from the intensive care and urology units of women. Only 4 patients (11.7%)
		manifested fever and dysuria. Massive leukocyturia was observed in 4 patients.
		Candida glabrata was the most commonly isolated species (44%). Levels of the
		"urine IL-17 and IL-22 were significantly elevated in the candiduric patients,"
		when compared to the noncandiduric controls. While an increased IL-17 level was
		"significantly associated with candiduria (odds ratio, 1.09; 95% confidence"
		"interval, 1.003 to 1.17; P = .04), an increased IL-22 level was not. The results"
		showed that lyophilized urine samples maximized the detection power of urinary
		"cytokines. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that direct examination, fungal"
		"urine culture, and investigation of urine IL-17 and IL-22 levels are useful tools"
		for diagnosis of Candida urinary tract infection.

TI	-	Global distribution and outcomes for Candida species causing invasive
		candidiasis: results from an international randomized double-blind study of
		caspofungin versus amphotericin B for the treatment of invasive candidiasis.
PG	-	470-4
AB	-	"In a randomized study, caspofungin was compared with amphotericin B for the"
		treatment of invasive candidiasis in a total of 239 adults from 56 sites in 20
		countries. This study provided a unique opportunity to assess the frequency and
		"outcome of invasive candidiasis caused by different Candida species worldwide,"
		and the results are presented here. Efficacy was primarily assessed at the end of
		intravenous therapy using a modified intent-to-treat (MITT) analysis. This
		analysis was performed on 224 of the 239 patients enrolled in the study. Attempts
		were made to collect baseline Candida isolates from all patients for species
		identification at a central laboratory. Yeasts were identified to the species
		level using two commercial systems and microscopic examination. Viable baseline
		isolates were recovered from 210 of the 224 (94%) patients included in the MITT
		analysis. Candida albicans was the most frequently isolated species in all
		"regions and was responsible for 45% of cases overall. Nevertheless, the majority"
		of cases of infection were caused by non- albicans Candida species. In the USA
		"and Canada, Candida glabrata was the second most commonly isolated pathogen"
		"(18%). In contrast, Candida parapsilosis and Candida tropicalis accounted for 55%"
		of cases in Latin America. Outcomes were comparable for patients treated with
		caspofungin (74% overall; 64% and 80% for infections due to Candida albicans and
		non- albicans species) and amphotericin B (62% overall; 58% and 68% for
		"infections due to Candida albicans and non- albicans species), and were generally"
		similar across continents. The distribution of Candida species isolated from
		patients enrolled in a clinical trial may not be representative of pathogens
		"causing invasive candidiasis in the general population. Nevertheless, our"
		findings may affect the regional choice of empirical antifungal therapy for
		seriously ill patients with suspected or documented invasive candidiasis since
		different Candida species have varying susceptibility to conventional antifungal
		drugs.

AB	-	This study aimed to describe the effect of initial antifungal therapy on patient
		mortality and to detail the current distribution and resistance patterns of
		Candida spp. among patients with candidaemia. A prospective observational study
		was performed among consecutive patients with candidaemia from 10 Turkish medical
		centres between January 2015 and November 2018. The primary outcome was 10-day
		mortality. Species were identified using MALDI-TOF/MS. A total of 342 patients
		"with candidaemia were included, of which 175 (51.2%) were male and 68 (19.9%)"
		"were aged <18 years. The most common species were Candida albicans (47.4%),"
		"Candida parapsilosis (26.6%), Candida tropicalis (9.6%) and Candida glabrata"
		"(7.6%). Among all Candida spp., the 10-day case fatality rate (CFR) was 32.2%."
		The CFR was highest in patients with C. albicans (57.3%) and lowest in patients
		with C. parapsilosis (21.8%). The resistance rate to fluconazole was 13% in C.
		"parapsilosis, with no significant effect on mortality. No resistance to"
		"echinocandins was detected. In the multivariate analysis, being in the ICU"
		"[OR = 2.1 (95% CI 1.32-3.57); P = 0.002], renal failure [OR = 2.4 (1.41-3.97);"
		"P = 0.001], total parenteral nutrition [OR = 2 (1.22-3.47); P = 0.006], C."
		albicans infection [OR = 1.7 (1.06-2.82); P = 0.027] and echinocandin as primary
		agent [OR = 0.6 (0.36-0.99); P = 0.047] were significantly associated with
		"mortality. Candidaemia is a deadly infection. Fluconazole resistance is emerging,"
		although it was not significantly related to mortality. Using an echinocandin as
		the primary agent could be life-saving.

AB	-	The incidence of nosocomial invasive fungal infections involving Candida spp. has
		increased markedly in recent years in patients undergoing abdominal surgery. This
		post hoc analysis aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of anidulafungin
		treatment in patients with intra-abdominal candidiasis (IAC) from five
		prospective studies (one comparative and four open-label) of adult surgical
		patients with microbiologically confirmed Candida intra-abdominal infection.
		"Patients received an intravenous (IV) loading dose of anidulafungin 200 mg,"
		"followed by a daily 100-mg maintenance dose. Per study protocols, some patients"
		could be switched to an oral azole after ≥ 5 or ≥ 10 days of IV treatment.
		Antifungal treatment was maintained for ≥ 14 days after the last positive Candida
		culture and resolution of symptoms. The global response rate (GRR) at the end of
		"IV treatment (EOIVT) was the primary endpoint. GRR at the end of therapy (EOT),"
		"all-cause mortality at days 14 and 28, and safety was also evaluated."
		Seventy-nine patients had IAC from peritoneal fluid or hepatobiliary tract. C.
		albicans (72.2%) and C. glabrata (32.9%) were the most common pathogens. Overall
		"GRR was 73.4% and 67.1% at EOIVT and EOT, respectively. All-cause mortality was"
		17.7% at day 14 and 24.1% at day 28 in the modified intent-to-treat population.
		"Anidulafungin was well tolerated in this population, with most adverse events"
		"mild or moderate in severity. In these patients with IAC, anidulafungin showed a"
		"GRR at EOIVT similar to the anidulafungin registrational trial, and the results"
		of our analysis confirmed the known safety profile of anidulafungin.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: The incidence of candidemia is increasing in developing countries.
		Very little is known about the epidemiology of candidemia in Peru. The aim of
		"this study is to describe the incidence, microbiology, clinical presentation and"
		outcomes of Candida bloodstream infections in three Lima-Callao hospitals.
		METHODS: Candida spp. isolates were identified prospectively at participant
		hospitals between November 2013 and January 2015. Susceptibility testing for
		"amphotericin B, fluconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole and anidulafungin was"
		performed using broth microdilution method. Clinical information was obtained
		from medical records and evaluated. RESULTS: We collected information on 158
		"isolates and 157 patients. Median age of patients was 55.0 yrs., and 64.1% were"
		males. Thirty-eight (24.2%) episodes of candidemia occurred in those <18 yrs. The
		frequency of non-Candida albicans was 72.1%. The most frequently recovered
		"species were C. albicans (n = 44, 27.8%), C. parapsilosis (n = 40, 25.3%), C."
		"tropicalis (n = 39, 24.7%) and C. glabrata (n = 15, 9.5%). Only four isolates"
		"were resistant to fluconazole, 86.7% (n = 137) were susceptible and 17 were"
		susceptible-dose dependent. Decreased susceptibility to posaconazole was also
		"observed in three isolates, and one to voriconazole. All isolates were"
		susceptible to anidulafungin and amphotericin B. The most commonly associated
		"co-morbid conditions were recent surgery (n = 61, 38.9%), mechanical ventilation"
		"(n = 60, 38.2%) and total parenteral nutrition (n = 57, 36.3%). The incidence of"
		"candidemia by center ranged between 1.01 and 2.63 cases per 1,000 admissions,"
		with a global incidence of 2.04. Only 28.1% of cases received treatment within 72
		"hrs. of diagnosis. Overall, the 30-day survival was 60.4% (treated subjects,"
		"67.4%; not-treated patients, 50.9%). CONCLUSIONS: We found a very high proportion"
		"of non-albicans Candida species. Despite this, the decreased"
		susceptibility/resistance to fluconazole was only 13.3% and not seen in the other
		"antifungals. Overall, the incidence of candidemia mortality was high when"
		"compared to other international studies. It is possible, that the delay in"
		"initiating antifungal treatment contributed to the elevated mortality rate, in"
		spite of low antifungal resistance.

		review.
PG	-	e85-7
AB	-	Catheter removal is now the standard recommendation of catheter-related fungemia
		"even when tunneled devices are used. However, in the clinical practice, this"
		procedure is not always without risks. Antibiotic-lock technique can resolve many
		"cases of catheter-related bacteraemia, but cure of catheter-related candidemia by"
		"this method has been attempted in very few instances, reviewed in this article."
		"Herein, we report a case of non-complicated Candida glabrata fungemia related to"
		"a Hickman catheter used for parenteral nutrition, cured with intraluminal"
		amphotericin B in addition to systemic therapy. This case demonstrates that
		'antifungal-lock therapy' can be effectively used in selected cases of
		catheter-related candidemia.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Surveillance of current changes in the epidemiology of Invasive
		Fungal Diseases (IFDs) as an important component of the antifungal stewardship
		"programs (ASP), requires careful regular monitoring, especially in high-risk"
		settings such as oncology centers. This study aimed to examine Candida
		colonization status and corresponding current changes in children with malignancy
		during repeated admissions and also investigate the possible epidemiological
		shifts after the implementation of ASP. METHODS: In this prospective
		"observational study, all eligible patients younger than 18 years were recruited"
		"during 2016-2017 at Amir Medical Oncology Center (AMOC) in Shiraz, Iran. Totally,"
		136 patients were enrolled and 482 samples were collected from different sites
		"(oral/nasal discharges, urine and stool). Weekly regular sampling was carried out"
		during hospitalization. Candida colonization status and epidemiological changes
		were monitored during repeated admissions. Samples were cultivated on Sabouraud
		Dextrose agar medium and identified by Polymerase Chain Reaction -Restriction
		Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). RESULTS: Estimated Candida colonization
		incidence was 59.9% (82/136) in our patients. Candida colonization was found to
		be higher in oral cavity and rectum than that in nasal cavity. Among those
		"long-term follow ups and repetitive hospitalizations, a significant number of"
		patients exhibited changes in their colonization patterns (37.7%). Candida
		"colonization did not reveal any significant relationship with age, sex, oncologic"
		diseases and degree of neutropenia. C. albicans (72.0%) was found as the most
		"common Candida species in colonized patients, followed by C. krusei, C. kefyr, C."
		glabrata and C. parapsilosis. CONCLUSION: Given the high incidence of Candida
		"infections in children with cancers, close monitoring of epidemiologic changes is"
		"essential for judicious management, based on local surveillance data and"
		improvement of overall quality of care in high risk patients.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Nosocomial transmission of Candida spp. has not been fully explored
		and previous studies have shown conflicting results. AIM: To evaluate the
		possible nosocomial transmission of Candida spp. on an intensive care unit (ICU).
		"METHODS: A prospective study was conducted for a period of 19 months, including"
		all patients on our ICU with growth of Candida spp. from surveillance and
		directed cultures. Molecular typing with repetitive sequence-based polymerase
		chain reaction was used to define genotype relationships between the Candida
		albicans and Candida glabrata isolates. Candida isolates obtained from blood
		cultures taken from patients in our county outside the ICU were used as a
		reference. Temporal cluster analysis was performed to evaluate genotype
		"distribution over time. FINDINGS: Seventy-seven patients with 78 ICU stays,"
		"representing 12% of all ICU stays, were found to harbour 180 isolates of Candida"
		spp. Molecular typing revealed 27 C. albicans genotypes and 10 of C. glabrata.
		"Possible clustering, indicated by overlapping stays of patients with"
		"indistinguishable candida genotypes, was observed on seven occasions with"
		C. albicans and on two occasions with C. glabrata. Two C. albicans genotypes were
		found significantly more often in the ICU group compared with the reference
		"group. Moreover, C. albicans genotypes isolated from more than one patient were"
		significantly more often found in the ICU group. Temporal cluster analysis
		revealed a significantly increased number of pairs with indistinguishable
		"genotypes at a 21-day interval, indicating clustering. CONCLUSION: This study"
		indicates possible transmission of C. albicans between ICU patients based on
		genotyping and temporal cluster analysis.

PG	-	1175-80
AB	-	"A total of 211 episodes of bloodstream yeast infections in 207 patients,"
		hospitalized in 28 Belgian hospitals participating in a National Surveillance
		"Program, were evaluated. A total of 81% of the patients were more than 50 years"
		"of age. Candida albicans was the cause of infections in 55% of patients, 22% were"
		due to C. glabrata and 13% to C. parapsilosis. The most common predisposing
		"factors were antibacterial therapy (42%), residence in an intensive care unit"
		(32.9%) and presence of an intravascular catheter (29.7%). Most patients had more
		than one predisposing factor. Fluconazole alone or in association with another
		antifungal agent was the treatment of choice for 89.7% of the cases. In vitro
		susceptibility testing of the isolates revealed that 99% were susceptible to
		"amphotericin B, 95% to 5-fluorocytosine, 82% to fluconazole and 69% to"
		itraconazole. Resistance to azoles was more common among C. glabrata isolates in
		the elderly. We conclude that the frequency of C. albicans infection is
		"decreasing in Belgium and this is associated with the emergence of other species,"
		"most notably, C. glabrata."

		"factors, clinical presentation and prognosis of MC episodes. A comparison between"
		MC and monomicrobial candidaemia within a prospective programme on candidaemia
		was performed in 29 hospitals between April 2010 and May 2011. In fifteen
		"episodes of candidaemia corresponding to 15 patients, out of 752, two species of"
		Candida (1.9%) were isolated. MC was more frequent in patients with HIV infection
		"(12%, P = 0.038) and those admitted due to extensive burns (23%, P = 0.012). The"
		Candida species most frequently identified in MC were C. albicans 12 patients
		"(40%), C. glabrata seven patients (23.3%) and C. parapsilosis six patients (20%)."
		"Early mortality was higher (nine patients, 60%) in patients with MC than in"
		"patients with MMC (223 patients, 30.3%, P = 0.046). In conclusion, MC was was"
		independently associated with increased mortality even after considering other
		prognostic factors. MC is an infrequent event that is more common in HIV
		"infection and in patients suffering from burns, and is associated with increased"
		mortality.

TI	-	A 7-year study of the distribution of nosocomial candidemia in children with
		cancer.
PG	-	225-9
AB	-	Candidemia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in cancer patients.
		The incidence of candidemia has been reported to have shifted toward nonalbicans
		species. The aim of this study was to determine the distribution of Candida
		species resulting in bloodstream infections or catheter-related blood stream
		infections (CRBSIs) in pediatric hematology-oncology (PHO) patients over a
		7-year-period. Medical and computerized microbiology laboratory records of all
		positive blood fungal cultures during the study period were analyzed
		retrospectively. The ratio of non-albicans Candida species (81.4%) was nearly
		"four times higher than that of C. albicans candidemia (18.5%). Overall, C."
		"parapsilosis caused the majority (61.4%) of candidemia episodes, followed by C."
		"tropicalis (14.8%), C. famata (2.9%), C. ciferrii (1.4%) and C. glabrata (0.7%)."
		The rate of CRBSIs was significantly higher in C. Parapsilosis candidemia. The
		overall rate of 30-day mortality in 135 candidemia episodes was 4.44%. Nearly
		"half of the C. parapsilosis candidemia was associated with CRBSIs, suggesting its"
		"importance in PHO, in which several types of central venous catheters have been"
		used.

TI	-	The epidemiology of Candida species associated with vulvovaginal candidiasis in
		an Iranian patient population.
PG	-	199-203
LID	-	10.1016/j.ejogrb.2010.11.022 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: Vulvovaginal candidiasis is a common infection among women worldwide.
		"According to previous epidemiological studies, Candida albicans is the most"
		"common species of Candida. The prevalence of non-Candida species, however, is"
		increasing. Identification of Candida species among the population will not only
		"help health professionals to choose suitable antifungal treatments, but also"
		"prevent development of drug resistance. The aim of this study was to identify,"
		"using chromogenic agar medium, the Candida species associated with vulvovaginal"
		candidiasis among a sample of the Iranian population. STUDY DESIGN: In a
		"prospective cohort study during a two year period from March 2006 to March 2008,"
		swab samples of vaginal discharge/secretion were taken from 200 patients admitted
		"to the gynecology clinic of Mahdieh Hospital (Tehran, Iran) with a clinical"
		presentation suggestive of vulvovaginal candidiasis. The isolates obtained were
		cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar and chromogenic agar medium. Candida species
		"were also identified by germ tube formation in serum, chlamydospore production on"
		Corn Meal Agar and carbohydrate absorption using the API 20C-AUX kit.
		Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire investigating the risk
		factors associated with candidiasis. An assessment of the different species of
		"recurrent and non-recurrent candidiasis was also made. Descriptive statistics,"
		"chi-square test, and t-test were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: A total of"
		191 isolates were obtained from 175 vaginal specimens. Candida albicans accounted
		for 67% of the strains including single and mixed infections. The other
		"identified species were Candida glabrata (18.3%), Candida tropicalis (6.8%),"
		"Candida krusei (5.8%), Candida parapsilosis (1.6%), and Candida guilliermondii"
		(0.5%) respectively. Mixed infection with two or more species of Candida was seen
		in 10.3% of patients. The most common mixed cause was the combination of Candida
		albicans and Candida glabrata. Participants who were sexually active and those
		who had orogenital sex were more likely to suffer recurrent vulvovaginal
		candidiasis. CONCLUSIONS: Candida albicans was the most common cause of recurrent
		and non-recurrent vulvovaginitis. The second most common species was Candida
		glabrata. This study suggests CHROMagar method as a convenient and cost effective
		yet reliable method to isolate the species of Candida especially in cases where
		more than one species is present.

		cardiac transplantation.
PG	-	1333-7
AB	-	Acalculous cholecystitis is a life-threatening complication in critically ill
		surgical patients. Whereas Candida albicans and Torulopsis glabrata have been
		reported as the primary pathogens in 14 previous cases of acalculous
		"cholecystitis, we report the first case of Candida parapsilosis as a biliary"
		pathogen in a patient after cardiac transplantation. Although cardiac transplant
		recipients often have many of the risk factors for acalculous candidal
		"cholecystitis, including major surgery, immunosuppression, antibiotic therapy,"
		"parenteral nutrition, and prolonged intensive care unit stay, this entity has not"
		"been previously reported in the cardiac transplant population. Although rare,"
		acalculous candidal cholecystitis is associated with very high morbidity and a
		mortality rate of 40%. Early diagnosis necessitates an aggressive approach to the
		critically ill patient with abdominal complaints. Prompt drainage or
		"cholecystectomy, if possible, represent the mainstays of therapy and offer the"
		greatest chance for survival.

		treatment is more difficult than that of bacterial infection. We present the
		first case of a patient with refractory fungal-infected WON treated with
		percutaneous endoscopic necrosectomy and local administration of amphotericin B.A
		Japanese man in his 30s was hospitalized with severe necrotizing pancreatitis and
		multiple organ failure. Computed tomography imaging of the abdomen 1 month after
		the onset of pancreatitis revealed infected WON. Percutaneous drainage revealed
		"purulent necrotic fluid, and culture of the fluid revealed the presence of"
		Candida albicans and C glabrata. WON was treated by percutaneous endoscopic
		"necrosectomy and local administration of amphotericin B. Consequently, the"
		"patient's condition improved, and Candida species were not detected in subsequent"
		cultures.The combination of endoscopic necrosectomy with local administration of
		amphotericin B may be effective in treating refractory fungal-infected WON.

AB	-	Internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) sequencing is the most extensively used
		technology for accurate molecular identification of fungal pathogens in clinical
		"microbiology laboratories. Intra-genomic ITS sequence heterogeneity, which makes"
		"fungal identification based on direct sequencing of PCR products difficult, has"
		rarely been reported in pathogenic fungi. During the process of performing ITS
		"sequencing on 71 yeast strains isolated from various clinical specimens, direct"
		sequencing of the PCR products showed ambiguous sequences in six of them. After
		"cloning the PCR products into plasmids for sequencing, interpretable sequencing"
		"electropherograms could be obtained. For each of the six isolates, 10-49 clones"
		were selected for sequencing and two to seven intra-genomic ITS copies were
		detected. The identities of these six isolates were confirmed to be Candida
		"glabrata (n=2), Pichia (Candida) norvegensis (n=2), Candida tropicalis (n=1) and"
		Saccharomyces cerevisiae (n=1). Multiple sequence alignment revealed that one to
		"four intra-genomic ITS polymorphic sites were present in the six isolates, and"
		all these polymorphic sites were located in the ITS1 and/or ITS2 regions. We
		report and describe the first evidence of intra-genomic ITS sequence
		"heterogeneity in four different pathogenic yeasts, which occurred exclusively in"
		the ITS1 and ITS2 spacer regions for the six isolates in this study.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: There are few epidemiological studies on candidaemia in the
		paediatric population in Spain. We sought to determine the epidemiology of
		"candidaemia in these patients. METHODS: Prospective, observational and"
		multicentre study in 44 Spanish hospitals. All candidaemia episodes in paediatric
		patients from 0 to 15 years old between January 2009 and February 2010 were
		studied. RESULTS: There were 197 episodes and 200 species were isolated. The most
		"frequent species was Candida parapsilosis sensu stricto (43%), followed by C."
		"albicans (36%), C. tropicalis (6%), C. orthopsilosis, and C. glabrata (4%)"
		"respectively. C. albicans was the most prevalent in newborns, and C. parapsilosis"
		"was most frequent in the other age groups. As regards the regions of Spain, C."
		"albicans was most prevalent in patients from Catalonia, the Balearic Islands and"
		"Canary Islands, and C. parapsilosis in patients from Andalusia, Castilla-León,"
		"Galicia, Valencia, and Madrid. The rate of resistance to fluconazole was 1.5%"
		(4.1% with the new species-specific Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute
		[CLSI] criteria). Fluconazole resistance was lower in neonates than the other age
		groups. The Neonatal Wards were the areas with most episodes (31.5%). In the
		"multivariate analysis, the variables associated independently with candidaemia"
		due to C. albicans were: catheter (OR: 5.967; 95% CI: 1.614-22.057; P=.007) and
		prematurity (OR: 2.229; 95% CI: 1.141- 4.631; P=.020). CONCLUSIONS: The
		"epidemiology of paediatric candidaemia varies between Spanish regions, but,"
		"globally, C. parapsilosis and C. albicans, are respectively, the first and second"
		"most frequently isolated species, and they show resistance rates to fluconazole"
		of less than 5%.

AB	-	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To investigate in vitro microbiological
		susceptibilities of Candida vitreous endophthalmitis isolates using traditional
		and newer antifungal agents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The current study is a
		"retrospective, consecutive case series of 17 vitreous culture-proven Candida"
		endophthalmitis isolates from 2011 to 2017 from Bascom Palmer Eye Institute.
		"Susceptibilities to echinocandins, triazoles, polyenes, and nucleoside analogs"
		"were obtained. RESULTS: The study isolates consisted of 59% C. albicans, 17% C."
		"glabrata, 12% C. tropicalis, and 12% C. parapsilosis. Isolates demonstrated 100%"
		sensitivity to all antifungals tested except anidulafungin (85% sensitive) and
		"fluconazole (88.2% sensitive). Comparing in-class agents, minimum inhibitory"
		"concentration (MIC) values for voriconazole were lower than other triazoles,"
		whereas micafungin had lower MIC values compared with other echinocandins.
		CONCLUSION: Both traditional and newer antifungals included agents that were
		highly efficacious against in vitro Candida species. Although the authors' study
		"data suggest that older, established antifungals are likely adequate for the"
		"treatment of Candida endophthalmitis, newer antifungal agents also can be"
		considered. [Ophthalmic Surg Lasers Imaging Retina. 2019;50:S13-S17.].

		Candida glabrata.
PG	-	308-13
AB	-	"In a retrospective study (1 January 1992-12 December 1998), we investigated"
		population characteristics and outcome in critically ill patients with fungaemia
		involving C. albicans (n=41) and C. glabrata (n=15). Patients with C. glabrata
		fungaemia were significantly older compared with patients in the C. albicans
		group (P=0.024). There were no other differences in population characteristics or
		"severity of illness. Logistic regression analysis showed age (P=0.021), the"
		"presence of a polymicrobial blood stream infection (P=0.039), and renal failure"
		(P=0.044) to be independent predictors of mortality. There was no significant
		difference in in-hospital mortality between the C. glabrata and C. albicans
		groups (60.0% vs. 41.5%; P=0.24). Since age was an independent predictor of
		"mortality, the trend towards a higher mortality in patients with C. glabrata can"
		"be explained by this population being significantly older. In conclusion, we"
		found no difference in mortality between patients with fungaemia involving C.
		albicans and C. glabrata.

TI	-	Use of amphotericin B during pregnancy: case report and review.
PG	-	364-8
AB	-	"Unlike the situation with many antimicrobial agents, there is limited experience"
		with the use of amphotericin B during pregnancy. Although reports of fungal
		"infections during pregnancy have been published, few describe fungemia with"
		either Candida or Torulopsis species. We present a case of fungemia due to
		Torulopsis glabrata that occurred during pregnancy and that was treated with
		"amphotericin B. Drug concentrations were measured in placental tissue, cord"
		"serum, and infant serum at delivery. Although the last dose of amphotericin B was"
		"administered 4 weeks before delivery, the concentrations in all three specimens"
		were still within the MIC ranges for most strains of Candida albicans and T.
		glabrata as measured by broth dilution. We speculate that persistent tissue
		concentrations of amphotericin B most likely contributed to the sustained
		hypokalemia in the mother and the increased creatinine level in the infant. In
		"the latter case, placental tissue may have served as the reservoir from which"
		amphotericin B was slowly released into fetal circulation.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: The role of fungi in infections in immunocompromised patients is a
		growing problem in both diagnosis and treatment. Candida species are the most
		"common cause of fungal, endogenous endophthalmitis and infections of the cornea."
		CASE STUDY: A patient was admitted to hospital due to acute inflammation of the
		"tissue of the left orbit, 1.5 years after the corneal penetrating transplantation"
		of the left eye with intracapsular extraction of lens and simultaneous anterior
		"vitrectomy. The microbiological system identified: Streptococcus pyogenes,"
		"Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida glabrata in the patient. CONCLUSIONS: The"
		"factors conducive to fungal infections are: patient's old age, immune disorders"
		"and diabetes, as well as the presence of a necrotic tissue or a foreign body. All"
		these parameters were met in this case. Only antibiotic therapy and long-term
		"antifungal therapy, together with surgical debridement of the site of the ongoing"
		infection produces clinical effects in such severe cases.

		care unit: a retrospective cohort study.
PG	-	10
LID	-	10.1186/1471-2334-13-10 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: The incidence of fungal healthcare-associated infection (HAI) has
		increased in a major teaching hospital in the northern part of Taiwan over the
		"past decade, especially in the intensive care units (ICUs). The purpose of this"
		study was to determine the factors that were responsible for the outbreak and
		trend in the ICU. METHODS: Surveillance fungal cultures were obtained from
		"""sterile"" objects, antiseptic solutions, environment of infected patients and"
		"hands of medical personnel. Risk factors for comparison included age, gender,"
		"admission service, and total length of stay in the ICU, Acute Physiology and"
		"Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores at admission to the ICU, main"
		"diagnosis on ICU admission, use of invasive devices, receipt of hemodialysis,"
		"total parenteral nutrition (TPN) use, history of antibiotic therapy before HAI or"
		"during ICU stay in no HAI group, and ICU discharge status (ie, dead or alive)."
		Univariable analysis followed by multiple logistic regression analysis was
		performed to identify the independent risk factors for ICU fungal HAIs and ICU
		mortality. RESULTS: There was a significant trend in ICU fungal HAIs from 1998 to
		2009 (P < 0.001). A total of 516 episodes of ICU fungal HAIs were identified; the
		"rates of various infections were urinary tract infection (UTI) (54.8%), blood"
		"stream infection (BSI) (30.6%), surgical site infection (SSI) (6.6%), pneumonia"
		"(4.5%), other sites (3.5%). The fungi identified were: yeasts (54.8%), Candida"
		"albicans (27.3%), Candida tropicalis (6.6%), Candida glabrata (6.6%), Candida"
		"parapsilosis (1.9%), Candida species (0.8%), and other fungi (1.9%). Candida"
		albicans accounted for 63% of all Candida species. Yeasts were found in the
		environment of more heavily infected patients. The independent risk factors (P <
		"0.05) of developing ICU fungal HAIs from all sites were TPN use, sepsis, surgical"
		"patients, mechanical ventilation and an indwelling urinary catheter. The"
		"independent risk factors for ICU fungal UTI included TPN use, mechanical"
		ventilation and an indwelling urinary catheter. The independent risk factors for
		"ICU fungal BSI included TPN use, sepsis, and higher APACHE II score. The"
		"independent risk factors for ICU fungal pneumonia included TPN use, surgical"
		patients. The independent risk factors for ICU fungal SSI included surgical
		"patients, and TPN use. The odds ratios of TPN use in various infection types"
		ranged from 3.51 to 8.82. The risk of mortality in patients with ICU fungal HAIs
		was over 2 times that of patients without ICU HAIs in the multiple logistic
		regression analysis (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: There was a secular trend of an
		increasing number of fungal HAIs in our ICU over the past decade. Patients with
		ICU fungal HAIs had a significantly higher mortality rate than did patients
		without ICU HAIs. Total parenteral nutrition was a significant risk factor for
		"all types of ICU fungal HAIs, and its use should be monitored closely."

		"hospital in Islamabad, Pakistan."
PG	-	986-991
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and antifungal susceptibility pattern of
		"Candida species. METHODS: This prospective, cross-sectional study was conducted"
		"at the Quaid-e-Azam International Hospital, Islamabad, Pakistan, from January"
		"2014 to February 2015, and comprised different clinical samples which were"
		analysed for various types of microbial infections. Species differentiation was
		confirmed by biochemical and molecular methods. Antifungal susceptibility against
		"amphotericin B, fluconazole and voriconazole was determined by Clinical and"
		Laboratory Standards Institute M44-A disk diffusion method. RESULTS: Of the 219
		"Candida isolates, majority of them were isolated from urine 78(35.6%) and vaginal"
		"swabs 59(26.9%). Moreover, 144(65.8%) samples were of females and 75(34.2%) were"
		of males. Candida albicans 128(58.45%) was the most predominant species followed
		"by Candida glabrata 30(13.69%), Candida tropicalis 26(11.87%), Candida krusei"
		"17(7.76%), Candida parapsilosis 12(5.47%), Candida dubliniensis 3(1.37%) and"
		Candida lusitaniae 3(1.37). All isolates were least susceptible to amphotericin B
		with a susceptibility rate of 213(97.26%). The highest resistance was found for
		voriconazole 40(18.26%) compared to fluconazole 32(14.61%). CONCLUSIONS: Candida
		species possessed high resistance rate against various antifungal agents.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the epidemiology of oral
		yeast colonization and infection amongst cancer patients. METHODS: Patients with
		"solid tumor, head-neck cancer or hematological malignancy were recruited into the"
		"study. Demographic data on age, gender, type of cancer, preceding treatment with"
		"antibiotics, anti-fungal agents, chemotherapy, radiation or surgery and presence"
		of dentures were recorded on admission. Oral examination and microbial swabs were
		"obtained and yeast culture, identification and antifungal susceptibility"
		performed. RESULTS: Oral yeast colonization was prevalent in 56.8% (227/400) of
		all cancer patients and 18.9% (43/227) of those had clinical and microbiological
		evidence of infection. The incidence of oral candidiasis in yeast colonized
		patients was highest in head neck cancer (29.2%) followed by hematological
		malignancies (20.5%) and solid tumor (17%) patients. Age and dentures were
		identified as independent risk factors associated with yeast carriage. Candida
		albicans was the dominant (74%) species (497.5 per 1000 cancer admissions)
		"followed by C. glabrata (11.5%), C. tropicalis (2.6%), C. krusei (2.6%) and C."
		parapsilosis (1.9%). The overall resistance to azoles was 28.2% (75/266).
		"Resistance to specific drugs was seen for fluconazole (4.5%), itraconazole"
		"(11.7%), ketoconazole (11.3%), voriconazole (0.75%) and caspofungin (41.1%) but"
		none to amphotericin B or nystatin. CONCLUSIONS: The highest incidence of oral
		candidiasis amongst cancer patients was seen in head neck cancers. The majority
		of infections were caused by C. albicans but almost one third of patients
		harbored non-C. albicans strains such as C. glabrata which were often more
		resistant to anti-fungal agents.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Overall, fungi are estimated to cause approximately 1% of prosthetic"
		"joint infections, Candida glabrata account for less than 10% of these cases. No"
		well-defined treatment strategy is available. CASE PRESENTATION: A 71-year-old
		Caucasian man with non-insulin-dependent diabetes was admitted for hip prosthesis
		revision. For the past 17 years he suffered from recurrent infection of a
		"perianal fistula, the last episode being 1 week before admission, and was"
		"prescribed amoxicillin/clavulanate 1 g twice a day. At surgery, the synovial"
		"fluid tested positive for infection with the Synovasure® Alpha Defensin Test, and"
		the orthopedic surgeon reported intraoperative evidence of infection. While the
		"synovial fluid failed to grow microorganisms, seven different samples including"
		periprosthetic tissue and the prosthesis grew Candida glabrata. Imipenem 2 g and
		teicoplanin 600 mg daily were administered during surgery. Also an antibiotic
		"loaded spacer was positioned. A week later micafungin 100 mg a day was added, and"
		after another week imipenem was replaced with ertapenem 1 g once a day. The
		combination of antibiotics and antifungal was administered for a total of
		"7 weeks, while he also underwent treatment of the perianal fistula. The"
		reimplantation was performed after an 8-week antibiotic-free interval. Before
		"reimplantation, his erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level"
		"were normal. At reimplant surgery, several samples were collected for"
		"microbiology, before administering ertapenem 1 g, teicoplanin 600 mg and"
		micafungin 100 mg once a day. This antimicrobial combination was continued for
		"15 days until the microbiologic investigations, including culture and molecular"
		"testing after sonication technique of the spacer, were reported negative for"
		"bacteria and fungi. In this patient, systemic antifungal and extensive"
		debridement allowed for clinical and microbiologic cure. CONCLUSIONS: Although
		"Candida glabrata prosthetic joint infection is a rare event, the incidence could"
		"increase in the future, and there is need for more definitive treatment"
		protocols. Diagnosis depends on culture. Fungal etiology must always be included
		in the differential diagnosis of prosthetic joint infection.

TI	-	Time to initiation of fluconazole therapy impacts mortality in patients with
		candidemia: a multi-institutional study.
PG	-	25-31
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Inadequate antimicrobial treatment is an independent determinant of
		"hospital mortality, and fungal bloodstream infections are among the types of"
		infection with the highest rates of inappropriate initial treatment. Because of
		"significant potential for reducing high mortality rates, we sought to assess the"
		impact of delayed treatment across multiple study sites. The goals our analyses
		were to establish the frequency and duration of delayed antifungal treatment and
		to evaluate the relationship between treatment delay and mortality. METHODS: We
		conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with candidemia from 4 medical
		centers who were prescribed fluconazole. Time to initiation of fluconazole
		therapy was calculated by subtracting the date on which fluconazole therapy was
		initiated from the culture date of the first blood sample positive for yeast.
		"RESULTS: A total of 230 patients (51% male; mean age +/- standard deviation, 56"
		+/- 17 years) were identified; 192 of these had not been given prior treatment
		with fluconazole. Patients most commonly had nonsurgical hospital admission (162
		"patients [70%]) with a central line catheter (193 [84%]), diabetes (68 [30%]), or"
		cancer (54 [24%]). Candida species causing infection included Candida albicans
		"(129 patients [56%]), Candida glabrata (38 [16%]), Candida parapsilosis (25"
		"[11%]), or Candida tropicalis (15 [7%]). The number of days to the initiation of"
		"antifungal treatment was 0 (92 patients [40%]), 1 (38 [17%]), 2 (33 [14%]) or >"
		or = 3 (29 [12%]). Mortality rates were lowest for patients who began therapy on
		"day 0 (14 patients [15%]) followed by patients who began on day 1 (9 [24%]), day"
		"2 (12 [37%]), or day > or = 3 (12 [41%]) (P = .0009 for trend). Multivariate"
		"logistic regression was used to calculate independent predictors of mortality,"
		"which include increased time until fluconazole initiation (odds ratio, 1.42; P <"
		.05) and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (1-point
		"increments; odds ratio, 1.13; P < .05). CONCLUSION: A delay in the initiation of"
		fluconazole therapy in hospitalized patients with candidemia significantly
		impacted mortality. New methods to avoid delays in appropriate antifungal
		"therapy, such as rapid diagnostic tests or identification of unique risk factors,"
		are needed.

TI	-	PCR identification of four medically important Candida species by using a single
		primer pair.
PG	-	2962-7
AB	-	A single pair of primers was used in a PCR assay to amplify and identify the DNAs
		"from four medically important Candida species: C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, C."
		"tropicalis, and C. (Torulopsis) glabrata. The report describes the first"
		successful amplification of a chitin synthase-specific fragment from the four
		Candida species responsible for more than 90% of all cases of neonatal
		candidemia. The primer pair sequence was based on that from the C. albicans
		"chitin synthase gene, CHS1 (J. Au-Young and P.W. Robbins, Mol. Microbiol."
		"4:197-207, 1990). Each of the four amplified products is a single band of a"
		"different size. The DNA sequence of each PCR product was determined, and four"
		species-specific probes were synthesized. The DNAs from as few as 10 organisms in
		100 microliters of plasma could be detected after amplification and Southern blot
		analysis. In a retrospective study of 27 paired blood samples from 16 patients
		"with culture-proven candidemia, PCR analysis was successful at detecting and"
		correctly identifying to the species level 26 of the 27 Candida isolates. The
		speed and accuracy of this PCR-based technology make it a very powerful tool for
		detecting and diagnosing candidemia. Implementation of this assay for analyzing
		"blood samples should result in the more timely treatment of neonatal candidemia,"
		thereby reducing morbidity and mortality.

PG	-	485-91
AB	-	The medical records of 620 patients submitted to renal transplant from February
		"1968 to February 1995 were surveyed for Candida infection. Of these, 87 presented"
		107 episodes of candidiasis. In 42.9% the infection appeared up to 6 months after
		"the transplant. The most frequent involved sites were: urinary tract, respiratory"
		"tract, and gastrointestinal tract. The most frequent etiological agents were: C."
		"albicans, C. tropicalis and C. glabrata. Most urinary tract infections occurred"
		in the first 6 months (61.7%) and manifested clinically as a bacterial infection.
		In the respiratory tract infections were characterized by isolation of the agent
		"in sputum. In the gastrointestinal infections, 9/16 episodes were esophageal."
		There were 3 deaths directly related to Candidiasis (one pulmonary and 2
		"disseminated cases). In the urinary tract, and respiratory tract infections there"
		"was association of candidiasis with previous antibiotic treatment (76% and 67%,"
		"respectively), and with concomitant bacterial infections (34% and 64%,"
		respectively). The overall prevalence of Candida infections was 14.5%. The
		"predominant location was in the urinary tract (51.0%), followed by the"
		"respiratory (26.0%) and gastrointestinal tract (15.0%), with a high rate of"
		association with previous antibiotic treatment and bacterial infections.

TI	-	Neonatal Torulopsis glabrata fungemia.
PG	-	246-8
AB	-	Torulopsis glabrata is a yeastlike fungus that has recently become recognized as
		an important opportunistic pathogen. Only four cases of T glabrata infection in
		neonates have been reported. We report two cases of fungemia caused by this
		organism in premature infants. Both patients were treated with amphotericin B and
		"survived the fungemia, but one patient later died of bacterial sepsis. Both"
		"patients had been treated with surfactant, artificial ventilation, intravascular"
		"catheters (arterial and venous), broad spectrum antibiotics, and"
		"hyperalimentation, which appear to be risk factors for T glabrata fungemia. A"
		review of the literature indicates that T glabrata is susceptible to amphotericin
		"B and 5-fluorocytosine and is resistant to fluconazole. In addition, it is less"
		"susceptible to ketoconazole, clotrimazole, and itraconazole than is Candida"
		albicans. We recommend that T glabrata infections be treated initially by
		reducing iatrogenic risk factors and beginning amphotericin B therapy. If
		"necessary, 5-fluorocytosine should be added to the drug regimen."

PG	-	550-5
AB	-	"The incidence, risk factors and prognostic factors for candidal infection were"
		determined in a prospective study of 280 infected patients. Thirty-one (11%)
		"patients were infected with Candida spp., sub-divided into 18 (58%) with C."

		"factors for death, but infection with Candida spp., was not. Factors associated"
		"with Candida spp. infection were the degree of morbidity, intensive care unit"
		"length of stay, alterations of immune response, and the number of medical devices"
		"involved. By multivariate logistic regression analysis, the only independent risk"
		factor for candidal infection was intensive care unit length of stay.

PG	-	432-4
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To present a case of fluconazole-associated torsade de pointes (TDP)
		and discuss fluconazole's role in causing TDP. CASE SUMMARY: A 68-year-old white
		woman with Candida glabrata isolated from a presacral abscess developed TDP eight
		days after commencing oral fluconazole The patient had no other risk factors for
		"TDP, including coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure,"
		and electrolyte abnormalities There was a temporal association between the
		initiation of fluconazole and TDP. The TDP resolved when fluconazole was
		"discontinued; however, the patient continued to have premature ventricular"
		contractions and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) until six days after
		drug cessation DISCUSSION: Use of the Naranjo probability scale indicates a
		probable relationship between the use of fluconazole and the development of TDP.
		The possible mechanism is depression of rapidly activating delayed rectifier
		"potassium currents. In our patient, there was no other etiology identified that"
		could explain QT prolongation or TDP The complete disappearance of NSVT and
		premature ventricular contractions followed by normalization of QT interval after
		the drug was stopped strongly suggests fluconazole as the etiology. CONCLUSIONS:
		"Clinicians should be aware that fluconazole, even at low doses, may cause"
		"prolongation of the QT interval, leading to TDP. Serial electrocardiographic"
		monitoring may be considered when fluconazole is administered in patients who are
		at risk for ventricular arrhythmias.

TI	-	Economic analysis of inadequate fluconazole therapy in non-neutropenic patients
		with candidaemia: a multi-institutional study.
PG	-	557-62
AB	-	Mortality significantly increases in patients with candidaemia who receive
		inappropriate fluconazole therapy. The goals of this study were to compare
		hospital length of stay and costs for non-neutropenic patients with candidaemia
		treated with fluconazole based on the empirical dose and time until initiation of
		therapy. A retrospective cohort study was conducted of patients with candidaemia
		who were prescribed fluconazole at the onset of candidaemia or later.
		Hospital-related costs were compared based on time to initiation of fluconazole
		therapy and empirical fluconazole dose. A total of 192 non-neutropenic patients
		"(55% male; mean age+/-standard deviation, 56+/-17 years) were identified."
		"Isolated Candida species included C. albicans (59%), C. glabrata (15%), C."
		"parapsilosis (11%), C. tropicalis (6%), C. krusei (3%) or other Candida spp."
		"(6%). Time to initiation of fluconazole was Day 0 (35.4%), Day 1 (14.1%), Day 2"
		(26.6%) or Day >or=3 (23.9%). Thirty-two patients (17%) received a dose of
		fluconazole >or=6 mg/kg on Day 0. Total costs were lowest for patients started on
		"fluconazole on the culture day with adequate doses ($35,459+/-25,988) compared"
		"with all other patients ($52,158+/-53,492) (P=0.0088). After controlling for"
		"covariates, each 1-day delay in fluconazole therapy was associated with increased"
		"total hospital costs of $6392+/-3000 (P=0.0344), and an adequate fluconazole dose"
		"was associated with decreased total hospital costs of $18,744+/-7173 (P=0.0097)."
		A delay or an inadequate dose or fluconazole in patients with candidaemia was
		associated with increased hospital costs. Improved methods to diagnose patients
		with candidaemia quickly are needed.

TI	-	Candida peritonitis in dogs: report of 5 cases.
PG	-	227-33
LID	-	10.1111/vcp.12047 [doi]
AB	-	Candida peritonitis is reported in people and is associated with significant
		morbidity and mortality compared with sterile or bacterial peritonitis.
		"Recognized predisposing risk factors include peritoneal dialysis, hollow viscous"
		"organ perforation, abdominal surgery, inflamed intestinal mucosa, antimicrobial"
		"administration, and immunosuppression. In this report, we describe 5 cases of"
		"dogs with peritonitis complicated by Candida spp; 3 dogs with C albicans, one dog"
		"with C albicans and C glabrata, and one dog with C glabrata only. The 3 dogs with"
		"C albicans peritonitis presented with duodenal perforation due to NSAID therapy,"
		"intestinal resection and anastomosis following postspay-surgery dehiscence, and"
		intestinal foreign body removal. The 2 dogs with C glabrata peritonitis had
		undergone cholecystectomy due to gall bladder rupture and dehiscence of
		"intestinal biopsy removal sites following exploratory laparatomy. In all cases,"
		initial diagnosis of fungal peritonitis was made via cytologic examination of
		"peritoneal effusions, which revealed marked pyogranulomatous inflammation with"
		"numerous 3-8 μm oval, deeply basophilic yeast organisms with thin clear capsules"
		"noted within phagocytes and extracellularly. In addition, germ tube formation,"
		"hyphae, and pseudohyphae were rarely seen in some of the cases with pure C"
		albicans. Identity of the organisms was determined by culture in all cases and
		confirmed by PCR in 3 cases. Candida spp. are commensals normally inhabiting the
		"alimentary, the upper respiratory, and the lower urogenital tracts of mammals."
		They are opportunistic pathogens that can invade and colonize tissue when a
		patient is immune-compromised or there is disruption of the mucosal barrier.
		Candida peritonitis should be considered in patients with peritoneal
		contamination with gastrointestinal or biliary contents.

TI	-	Candida glabrata prosthetic valve endocarditis treated successfully with
		fluconazole plus caspofungin without surgery: a case report and literature
		review.
PG	-	753-5
AB	-	Reported here is the case of a 72-year-old man who was diagnosed with Candida
		glabrata prosthetic mitral valve endocarditis and treated successfully with
		fluconazole plus caspofungin after he refused and was determined unfit for
		surgery. Initial treatment with intravenous amphotericin B resulted in acute
		"renal impairment. Despite 8 days of intravenous fluconazole therapy, he remained"
		fungemic. Caspofungin was added to the treatment regimen with subsequent
		sterilisation of blood culture. The patient was treated for 34 days with
		caspofungin and 41 days with fluconazole. He continued oral fluconazole after
		hospital discharge and remained well at follow-up 11 months later. The role of
		fluconazole and caspofungin in the treatment of Candida endocarditis is
		discussed.

TI	-	Incidence and distribution of vaginal yeasts in Malaysian women.
PG	-	563-7
AB	-	"A total of 2,153 high vaginal swabs were processed for the presence of yeasts."
		The specimens were obtained from pregnant and non-pregnant Malaysian women with
		and without vaginitis. The yeast species most commonly isolated were Candida
		"albicans, C. glabrata, C. famata and C. parapsilosis. C. albicans was isolated"
		"from 27% of pregnant women with vaginitis, 14% of pregnant women with no overt"
		"vaginitis, 15% of non-pregnant women with vaginitis, and 3% of non-pregnant women"
		with no vaginitis. The significant difference of the isolation rates from women
		with and without vaginitis indicates that C. albicans is likely to be a vaginal
		pathogen.

PG	-	23-33
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-018-0286-1 [doi]
AB	-	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of echinocandins in the
		treatment of Candida prosthetic joint infection (PJI) based on published
		literature and on patients we examined. A structured literature review of
		multiple databases was conducted to identify patients who received echinocandins
		"for Candida PJIs. Additionally, we describe here the first cases of PJIs due to"
		"C. parapsilosis, successfully treated with prolonged anidulafungin therapy. Out"
		"of 17 patients, 12 were female and the mean age at diagnosis was 66.0 years. No"
		risk factors associated with Candida PJIs were found in four patients (23.5%).
		"Infection sites included the knee (n = 10, 62.5%), the hip (n = 6, 35.3%) and the"
		"shoulder (n = 1, 5.9%). The most frequently isolated Candida species were C."
		"albicans (n = 7, 41.2%) and C. glabrata (n = 7, 41.2%), followed by C."
		"parapsilosis (n = 2, 11.8%) and C. freyschussii (n = 1, 5.9%). All patients were"
		cured with the combination of systemic antifungal therapy and surgical
		interventions. Two-stage exchange arthroplasty and resection arthroplasty were
		"performed in five and nine patients, respectively. The most frequently used"
		"echinocandins were caspofungin (n = 11, 64.7%), followed by anidulafungin (n = 4,"
		"23.5%) and micafungin (n = 2, 11.8%). The median duration (days) of echinocandin"
		"therapy was as follows: caspofungin (25.5, range 8-56), micafungin (14.0, range"
		"4-56) and anidulafungin (58, range 14-90). This study supports the effective role"
		"of echinocandins, as well as the potential advantage of surgical intervention in"
		"the treatment of Candida PJIs. Furthermore, it provides fundamental data on the"
		safety of long-term echinocandin therapy.

		"swab from each patient using sterile cotton-tipped swabs. Furthermore, we"
		compared the recovery and identification performances of chromID Candida agar to
		Sabouraud dextrose agar with gentamicin and chloramphenicol. Clinically and
		mycologically confirmed cases of VVC were detected in 139 (37.4%) and vaginal
		colonization described in 42 (11.3%) of 372 pregnant women. Rectal cultures were
		also positive in 98 of the 139 (70.5%) VVC cases. Candida albicans and C.
		glabrata were identified in vaginal samples in 58.0 versus 19.0% and from rectal
		"samples in 49.0 versus 13.5%, respectively. Increases in gestational week and"
		gravidae were identified to be statistically significant in patients with acute
		"VVC (AVVC) and symptomatic recurrent VVC (RVVC), and asymptomatic RVVC (P = 0.04"
		"and P = 0.03, respectively). In the laboratory diagnosis of VVC, specifically"
		tailored chromogenic media are reliable tools for both the recovery and rapid
		"identification of common Candida spp., particularly C. albicans, as well as for"
		the detection of polyfungal populations in vaginal samples (P > 0.05). In
		"addition, rectal colonization is a common finding in cases of AVVC and"
		symptomatic-RVVC cases and corresponds well with the presence of the same yeast
		species in the vagina.

PG	-	1298-302
AB	-	Bloodstream infections due to Candida species cause significant morbidity and
		mortality. Surveillance for candidemia is necessary to detect trends in species
		distribution and antifungal resistance. We performed prospective surveillance for
		candidemia at 16 hospitals in the State of Iowa from 1 July 1998 through 30 June
		2001. Using U.S. Census Bureau and Iowa Hospital Association data to estimate a
		"population denominator, we calculated the annual incidence of candidemia in Iowa"
		"to be 6.0 per 100,000 of population. Candida albicans was the most common species"
		"detected, but 43% of candidemias were due to species other than C. albicans."
		"Overall, only 3% of Candida species were resistant to fluconazole. However,"
		Candida glabrata was the most commonly isolated species other than C. albicans
		and demonstrated some resistance to azoles (fluconazole MIC at which 90% of the
		"isolates tested are inhibited, 32 microg/ml; 10% resistant, 10% susceptible dose"
		dependent). C. glabrata was more commonly isolated from older patients (P = 0.02)
		and caused over 25% of candidemias among persons 65 years of age or older. The
		"investigational triazoles posaconazole, ravuconazole, and voriconazole had"
		excellent in vitro activity overall against Candida species. C. albicans is the
		most important cause of candidemia and remains highly susceptible to available
		"antifungal agents. However, C. glabrata has emerged as an important and"
		"potentially antifungal resistant cause of candidemia, particularly among the"
		elderly.

		frequently lethal infection.
PG	-	4745-52
LID	-	10.1002/cncr.24507 [doi]
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: The incidence, epidemiology, Candida species distribution, resistance"
		"patterns, and outcome of candidemia in high-risk hematologic malignancy and/or"
		stem cell transplantation patients have not been extensively described since the
		"introduction of new antifungal agents. METHODS: In this retrospective study, the"
		authors reviewed the medical records and microbiologic data of hematologic
		malignancy patients with candidemia at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson
		Cancer Center from March 2001 to February 2007. RESULTS: The authors analyzed 173
		"episodes of candidemia (170 patients), 125 (72%) of which were breakthrough cases"
		"after prior antifungal agents, mainly fluconazole (28 [22%]), caspofungin (25"
		"[20%]), and voriconazole (18 [14%]). The incidence of candidemia (per 100,000"
		"inpatient days) remained relatively stable, from 13.9 in 2001 to 19.2 in 2006."
		"However, compared with the findings of previous studies at the authors'"
		"institution, the frequency of Candida glabrata and C. krusei infection decreased"
		"(to 5% and 17%, respectively) and C. parapsilosis (24%) and C. tropicalis (21%)"
		increased. C. parapsilosis fungemia was associated with prior caspofungin use
		"(P<.001). The overall 30-day crude mortality rate was 38%, and the attributable"
		"mortality rate was 19%, similar to previous findings at the authors' institution."
		The Candida species associated with the highest mortality rate was C. glabrata.
		CONCLUSIONS: Despite the widespread use of antifungal prophylaxis and the
		"introduction of new antifungal agents, the incidence and associated mortality"
		rates of candidemia remained stable in high-risk hematologic malignancy patients.
		"However, its epidemiological characteristics have shifted, with C. parapsilosis"
		and C. tropicalis becoming more common.

		"risk factors, microbiology, treatment, and clinical outcome of candidemia in"
		"neonates, children, and adults that might impact on management. PATIENTS AND"
		METHODS: Cases of candidemia in Australia were identified prospectively by blood
		"culture surveillance over 3 years. Episodes of candidemia in neonatal, pediatric,"
		"and adult age groups were analyzed and compared. RESULTS: Of 1005 incident cases,"
		"33 occurred in neonates, 110 in children, and 862 in adults. The respective"
		"annual age-specific incidences were 4.4, 0.9, and 1.8 per 100,000 population."
		Prematurity and ICU admission were major risk factors in neonates. Hematologic
		malignancy and neutropenia were significantly more frequent in children than in
		"neonates and adults. Diabetes, renal disease, hemodialysis, and recent surgery"
		were more common in adults. Candidemia was attributed to a vascular access device
		"in 58% of neonates, 70% of children, and 44% of adults. Candida albicans caused"
		approximately 48% of cases in all of the age groups. Candida parapsilosis was
		significantly more common in neonates and children (42% and 38% vs 15%). Candida
		glabrata was infrequent in neonates and children (9% and 3% vs 17%).
		Significantly more isolates from children were susceptible to fluconazole
		compared with those from adults (95% vs 75%). Fluconazole-resistant candidal
		isolates were infrequent in all of the age groups. Neonates and children were
		more likely to receive amphotericin B compared with adults. Adults were more
		"likely to receive fluconazole. Survival rates at 30 days were 78% in neonates,"
		"90% in children, and 70% in adults. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies"
		"significant differences in candidemia in neonates, children, and adults."
		Neonatologists and pediatricians must consider age-specific differences when
		interpreting adult studies and developing treatment and prevention guidelines.

		cancer patients. This study was aimed to identify and evaluate the risk factors
		"of candidemia in cancer patients, which will prompt the improvement on current"
		"therapeutic strategies and prognosis. METHODS: A retrospective, case-control"
		study was conducted from inpatients of Tianjin Medical University Cancer
		"Institute and Hospital, during 2006 to 2013. Analyses were performed between"
		"cancer patients with candidemia as study case, and patients with bacterial"
		"bloodstream infections as control. Each case was matched up with two controls,"
		"for gender and inpatient duration. Candida species, clinical characteristics,"
		risk factors and outcomes were reviewed in details. RESULTS: Total number of 80
		cases and 160 controls were enrolled and analyzed in this study. Candida albicans
		"was identified as the most prevalent species and account for 55.0% candidemia,"
		"followed by Candida parapsilosis complex (21.3%), Candida tropicalis (8.8%),"
		"Candida glabrata complex (7.5%), Candida lusitaniae (3.8%), and Candida famata"
		"(3.8%). The crude mortality at 30-days of candidemia was up to 30.0%, which is"
		significantly higher than bacterial bloodstream infections (p = 0.006).
		Logistical analysis demonstrated that total parenteral nutrition >5 days
		"(p = 0.036), urinary catheter >2 days (p = 0.001), distant organ metastasis of"
		cancer (p = 0.002) and gastrointestinal cancer (p = 0.042) were the independent
		risk factors for candidemia. CONCLUSIONS: Candidemia showed significant higher
		"mortality than bacterial bloodstream infections, C. albicans was cited as the"
		"primary pathogen. Total parenteral nutrition, urinary catheter, distant organ"
		metastasis of cancer and gastrointestinal cancer are independent predictors for
		"candidemia, this findings provides potential therapeutic targets for improving"
		the outcome.

		"pneumonia in Nairobi, Kenya."
PG	-	1286-91
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To determine the significance of Pneumocystis jirovecii infection in
		the Kenyan paediatric population. DESIGN: Sixty samples of induced sputum from
		"children aged < or =23 months, half of whom were human immunodeficiency virus"
		"(HIV) positive, admitted with severe pneumonia in Nairobi were subjected to"
		immunofluorescent staining for detection of P. jirovecii and microbiological
		culture. RESULTS: P. jirovecii was detected in 8/60 (13%) as a copathogen with
		other respiratory pathogens. Five of eight samples with >5 oocysts were from
		"HIV-positive children aged < or =6 months, while equivocally scored samples (< or"
		=5 oocysts) were from HIV-negative children aged >6 months. Klebsiella pneumoniae
		"was significantly recovered in 26/ 60 (43%), followed by Escherichia coli 11/60"
		"(18%) and Staphylococcus aureus 8/60 (13%). Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus"
		influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated infrequently. Candida
		"albicans was recovered from 27/60 (45%), while the frequency of C. tropicalis, C."
		"glabrata and C. parapsilosis was 7%, 5% and 3% respectively. Multidrug resistance"
		"among E. coli and K. pneumoniae were: sulphamethoxazoletrimethoprim 100% vs. 69%,"
		chloramphenicol 55% vs. 73% and ampicillin 100% vs. 89%. CONCLUSION:
		"Paediatricians in Kenya should be aware of Pneumocystis pneumonia, irrespective"
		of the patient's HIV status.

TI	-	Torulopsis glabrata vaginitis.
PG	-	993-8
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To study the sociodemographic risk factors and clinical features of
		Torulopsis glabrata vaginal infection. METHODS: We evaluated the sociodemographic
		and clinical characteristics of 86 consecutive symptomatic women attending a
		vaginitis clinic and isolated T glabrata. Case patients were compared with a
		control group of 174 asymptomatic women with negative vaginal cultures and an
		additional group of 625 symptomatic women with vaginal cultures positive for
		"Candida albicans. In addition, the sensitivity of the isolates to the more common"
		antimycotic agents used was tested by the modified Kirby-Bauer method. RESULTS:
		Patients with T glabrata vaginal infection were from lower socioeconomic
		backgrounds and had less education. They were more likely to use vaginal tampons
		and to be seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus than were negative
		"controls. Compared with C albicans infection, T glabrata was more frequent among"
		women over 38 years of age and in those with less education and of lower social
		"class. In logistic regression analysis, T glabrata was associated more frequently"
		"with recurrent vaginal candidiasis than was C albicans (odds ratio 2.46, 95%"
		confidence interval 1.33-4.54; P = .004). Six of the 86 (7%) T glabrata isolates
		and none of the C albicans isolates (P < .001 by Fisher exact test) were
		resistant to the imidazole derivatives tested. CONCLUSION: Torulopsis glabrata
		was isolated in 10% of women with vulvovaginal candidiasis attending a vaginitis
		clinic. This infection was associated with recurrent vaginitis in almost
		one-third of case patients presenting with symptoms.

PG	-	137-43
LID	-	10.1080/13693780802144339 [doi]
AB	-	The aim of this study was to determine in vitro susceptibility profiles of
		Venezuelan strains of Candida spp. to four antifungal agents. One hundred and
		forty five (145) isolates were recovered during a 1-year period (June 2006 to
		June 2007) from clinical specimens of patients with severe Candida spp.
		"infections in 15 hospitals. In vitro susceptibilities to amphotericin B,"
		"fluconazole, itraconazole and voriconazole were determined by modified Etest. Non"
		Candida albicans Candida spp. were the most frequently isolated yeasts (72.4%) in
		comparison with C. albicans (27.6%). Candida spp. strains showed MIC ranges
		between <0.002 and 0.5 mug/ml to amphotericin B. While none were found to be
		"resistant to voriconazole, 5.5% and 27.6% of the test strains were resistant to"
		"fluconazole and itraconazole, respectively. C. albicans remains the most"
		susceptible of the yeasts studied to fluconazole and itraconazole (P<0.05) when
		compared with non C. albicans Candida spp. C. krusei showed the greater
		"cross-resistance to azoles, followed by C. glabrata, C. tropicalis and C."
		"parapsilosis, while C. albicans isolates did not demonstrate this characteristic."
		It is very important to carry out the correct species identification of clinical
		yeast isolates because they show up variations in both distribution and
		"susceptibility profiles according to the hospital, patient's underlying disease,"
		"clinical specimen analyzed, and the geographical region in which the studies were"
		conducted. The Mycology Department of the INHRR is the national reference center
		"responsible for antifungal resistance surveillance, performing the susceptibility"
		tests with isolates recovered from hospitalized patients in public health centres
		which do not have mycological diagnosis laboratories.

AB	-	Infectious arthritis due to Candida glabrata is very rare. A 40-year-old Iranian
		man had developed a painful swelling on the left knee since a year ago. A surgery
		"(meniscectomy) was performed on his knee. However, in follow-up visit after"
		"2 months, the patient's condition was deteriorated. Direct examination of"
		synovial fluid with Gram and hematoxylin-eosin stains were negative for any
		"bacterial or fungal infection or crystal elements; however, inoculation into"
		BACTEC™ Mycosis IC/F and Plus Aerobic/F culture bottles led to the isolation of a
		yeast strain. The macroscopic examination on CHROMagar™ Candida medium combined
		with microscopical examination on CMT80 agar made a presumptive identification of
		"the isolate to be considered as C. glabrata, and it was later on confirmed by ITS"
		sequencing. Initial empirical treatment was started with intravenous amphotericin
		B for 4 weeks followed by oral itraconazole which was unsuccessful. Prescription
		of an oral 150-mg tablet of fluconazole was considered for a 2-month course. All
		"symptoms completely declined, and no recurrence of infection was detected."
		"Antifungal susceptibility testing (AFST) was performed for this isolate, and the"
		result showed sensitivity to both amphotericin B and itraconazole and less
		susceptibility to fluconazole while clinical recovery was achieved by
		"fluconazole. In any suspected clinical case caused by infectious agents,"
		application of an effective fungal diagnostic test should be considered to avoid
		complications due to misdiagnosis. The correlation of AFST result with real in
		"vivo therapeutic responses can be strain or patient dependent, and this should be"
		considered for a successive treatment.

AB	-	Abstract We conducted a four-year (2003-2006) retrospective study of yeasts
		recovered in a hospital laboratory in the centre of Portugal to evaluate the
		epidemiology of yeast infections. Clinical isolates and data were gathered from
		751 patients corresponding to 906 episodes of yeast infection. The isolates were
		"first identified using classical and commercial methods, routinely employed at"
		the hospital laboratory. We then re-identified the same isolates using RFLP of
		the ITS 5.8S rRNA gene and sequence of the D1/D2 domain of the 26S rRNA gene.
		Candida parapsilosis isolates were re-identified using the Ban I digestion of the
		SADH gene. C. albicans was the most frequently isolated of the yeasts found in
		"the analysed specimens, with an overall incidence of 69.6% and then in decreasing"
		"order, C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis and C. krusei. C. parapsilosis"
		"was most frequently recovered from younger patients, decreasing with age, while"
		C. glabrata occurrence increased with age. We found an increased number of cases
		"of fungemia per 100,000 people per year, reaching a maximum of 4.4 during 2006."

		of a tertiary care children's hospital in Egypt.
PG	-	624-34
LID	-	10.3855/jidc.4186 [doi]
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: This study was conducted to determine characteristics of Candida
		colonization and candidemia in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of a
		tertiary care children's hospital. METHODOLOGY: Patients between 6 months and 15
		years of age consecutively admitted to the PICU of Mansoura University Children's
		"Hospital in Mansoura, Egypt, during one year period, were evaluated for Candida"
		colonization and candidemia. Susceptibility of Candida species isolated from
		blood to fluconazole and amphotericin B was determined by Etest. RESULTS:
		Sixty-six patients without prior fluconazole prophylaxis had 88 episodes of
		"candidemia, representing 19% of all cases with blood stream infections (BSIs)."
		Candida albicans (CA) and non-albicans Candida (NAC) species accounted for 40%
		"and 60% of candidemia episodes respectively. C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, and"
		"C. glabrata accounted for 25%, 17%, and 8% of NAC candidemias respectively."
		Fluconazole resistance was detected in 11.4% and 18.9% of CA and NAC isolates
		"respectively. Of the fluconazole resistant NAC isolates, four were C. krusei."
		Amphotericin B resistance was detected in 17% of NAC isolates. Candida
		"colonization was detected in 78.8% of patients. Compared to CA candidemia, higher"
		"risk for NAC candidemia was associated with age older than 1 year, Candida"
		isolation from endotracheal tube (ETT) and from central venous catheter.
		"Mortality rate was 42.4%, attributable mortality of candidemia was 16.7%."
		Regression analysis showed that the most significant independent predictors of
		"death were ETT and mechanical ventilation (MV), MV longer than 7 days, and"
		candiduria. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents important epidemiological features
		of Candida BSIs in a non-neonatal population.

		report and review of the literature.
PG	-	133-6
LID	-	10.1002/hed.21075 [doi]
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Fungal abscesses of the parotid gland are rare, and cases arising"
		within parotid neoplasms have not been described previously. This report conveys
		"our experience managing such an entity, which is further distinguished by its"
		occurrence in an immunocompetent host. METHODS AND RESULTS: A 59-year-old man
		experienced multiple recurrences of a parotid fungal abscess requiring repeated
		drainage procedures. Definitive excision ultimately demonstrated Candida glabrata
		infecting a Warthin tumor. CONCLUSIONS: This case is the first report of a
		parotid neoplasm presenting as a fungal abscess. It contributes to the scant
		"literature on fungal abscesses of the parotid, which previously has only been"
		described in debilitated hosts and without an associated neoplasm. The case also
		expands the spectrum of disease associated with C. glabrata. Warthin tumor may be
		"an occult etiology for a parotid fungal abscess, and definitive diagnosis and"
		therapy may require parotidectomy.

TI	-	Health care-associated candidemia--a distinct entity?
PG	-	298-301
LID	-	10.1002/jhm.652 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: The concept of health care-associated infection (HCAI) was developed
		to address the fact that select patients now present to the hospital with
		infections due to traditionally nosocomial pathogens. Although epidemiologic
		"studies document the clear existence of health care-associated pneumonia, little"
		is known about fungal pathogens and their role in HCAIs. OBJECTIVE: To describe
		the epidemiology of health care-associated bloodstream infections (BSIs) due to
		candida species and to compare patients with HCA candidemia to nosocomial
		"candidemia. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. SETTING: Academic, tertiary care"
		hospital. MEASUREMENTS: We measured the proportion of cases of candidal BSI
		classified as health care-associated along with the microbiology of these
		infections. We compared health care-associated and nosocomial cases of candidemia
		"with respect to demographics, severity of illness, and fluconazole"
		susceptibility. RESULTS: We noted 233 cases of candidal BSI over a 3-year period.
		"Nearly one-quarter represented an HCAI that presented to the hospital, as opposed"
		to a nosocomial process. Although patients with HCA candidemia were similar to
		subjects with nosocomial infection in terms of underlying comorbidities and
		"severity of illness, those with HCA yeast BSI were more likely to be"
		immunosuppressed and to have their infection caused by a fluconazole-resistant
		organism. C. glabrata was seen more often in patients presenting to the hospital
		with an HCA case of candidemia. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians must recognize the
		potential for candida species to cause HCA infections and to be present at time
		of hospital presentation. Physicians need to consider this and the distribution
		of species of yeast causing BSI in their institution when considering initial
		therapy for patients with a suspected BSI.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the"
		"incidence of fungal infections attributed to Candida species worldwide, with a"
		"major shift toward non-albicans Candida (NAC). In this study, we have described"
		the distribution of Candida species among different hospital departments and
		calculated the antifungal consumption in our facility. We also correlated the
		consumption of certain antifungals and the prevalence of specific Candida
		species. METHODS: This was a retrospective review of all the Candida isolates
		recovered from the computerised microbiology laboratory database of Makassed
		"General Hospital, a tertiary care centre in Beirut, Lebanon, between January 2010"
		and December 2015. Data on antifungal consumption between January 2008 and
		December 2015 were extracted from the hospital pharmacy electronic database. We
		used Spearman's coefficient to find a correlation between Candida species
		"distribution and antifungal consumption. RESULTS: Between 2008 and 2015, we"
		observed that the highest antifungal consumption was in the haematology/oncology
		"department (days of therapy/1000 patient days = 348.12 ± 85.41), and the lowest"
		"was in the obstetrics/gynaecology department (1.36 ± 0.47). In general, the"
		difference in antifungal consumption among various departments was statistically
		"significant (P < 0.0001). Overall, azoles were the most common first-line"
		antifungals in our hospital. Echinocandins and amphotericin B were mostly
		prescribed in the haematology/oncology department. As for Candida species
		"distribution, a total of 1377 non-duplicate isolates were identified between 2010"
		and 2015. A non-homologous distribution of albicans vs. non-albicans was noted
		among the different departments (P = 0.02). The most commonly isolated NAC was
		"Candida glabrata, representing 14% of total Candida species and 59% of NAC."
		"Candida famata (9% of NAC), Candida parapsilosis (3.6% of NAC) and Candida krusei"
		(3% of NAC) were recovered unequally from the different departments. The total
		antifungal consumption correlated positively with the emergence of NAC. The use
		"of azoles correlated positively with Candida glabrata, while amphotericin B"
		formulations correlated negatively with it. None of these correlations reached
		statistical significance. CONCLUSION: Different Candida species were unequally
		"distributed among different hospital departments, and this correlated with"
		"consumption of antifungals in respective departments, highlighting the need for"
		antifungal stewardship.

PG	-	129-31
AB	-	BACKGROUND: T. glabrata is a saprophyte fungus that has been considered in the
		past years to be a pathologic agent in the pancreatic pseudocyst. Only three
		cases have been reported in the world literature. OBJECTIVE: To present a new
		case of a patient with pancreatic pseudocyst whose primary cause of infection and
		sepsis was Torulopsis glabrata and to analyze the possible factors that produced
		"the infection. In the same manner, a review of the cases on literature to date"
		was conducted. CASE REPORT: We present the clinical evolution of a post surgical
		patient with conventional cholecystectomy with biliary duct exploration and
		biliary duct derivation secondary to choledocholithiasis. This patient developed
		acute pancreatitis days after an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
		was carried out. The patient received wide-range antibiotics and total parenteral
		"nutrition (TPN). Later, the patient's case was complicated with pancreatic"
		pseudocyst that was act diagnosed and managed initially with antifungus therapy
		due to an asymptomatic stage and a late report for T. glabrata. CONCLUSIONS:
		"Pancreatobiliary duct instrumentation, in the same manner, prolonged therapy with"
		wide-spectrum antibiotics and with TPN an with the means that had associated as
		"risk factors for T. glabrata infection. Therefore, this fungus could have changed"
		its biologic behavior from commensal to pathogenic. A potentially pathogenic
		agent in patients receiving this type of therapy and who have pancreatic
		pseudocyst must be considered to recognize these in the initial stages and begin
		therapy.

TI	-	Systemic Candidiasis in Extremely Low Birthweight (ELBW) Neonates Despite the
		"Routine Use of Topical Miconazole Prophylaxis: Trends, Risk Factors and Outcomes"
		over an 11-Year Period.
PG	-	255-62
AB	-	"INTRODUCTION: This study aims to determine the incidence, trends of systemic"
		candidiasis and meningitis in extremely low birthweight (ELBW) neonates (<1000
		gms) despite the routine use of topical miconazole prophylaxis and to compare the
		"risk factors, adverse outcomes and comorbidities with controls. MATERIALS AND"
		METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of ELBW neonates with systemic candidiasis
		and meningitis over an 11-year period (1997 to 2007). Matched case control
		analyses were performed to determine the risk factors and comorbidities which
		"were severe intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), severe retinopathy of prematurity"
		"(ROP), patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) requiring treatment, necrotising"
		"enterocolitis (NEC), chronic lung disease (CLD) and cholestatic jaundice."
		Mortality and end organ involvement secondary to systemic candidiasis were
		"identified as adverse outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 757 ELBW neonates, 51 (6.7%) had"
		evidence of systemic candidiasis with a significant 3-fold increase in trend
		"noted in 2007 as compared against 1997 (12.1% vs 3.8%) (RR 1.2, 95% CI, 1.06 to"
		"1.36, P <0.001). This corresponds to a significant increasing trend of preceding"
		or co-existent bacterial blood stream infections (BSI) in neonates with systemic
		"candidiasis (0% in 1997 vs 7.1% in 2007, RR 1.40, 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.25, P ="
		"0.005). On logistic regression analysis, decreasing gestational age was an"
		"independent risk factor for systemic candidiasis (OR 2.0, 95% CI, 1.52 to 2.63, P"
		<0.001). Candida meningitis was detected in 4/38 (10.5%) and end organ
		involvement in 17 (33%). The organisms isolated were Candida parapsilosis 31
		"(61%), Candida albicans 17 (33%) and Candida glabrata 3 (5.8%). Significantly"
		higher mortality was seen in cases when compared to controls 10/51 (19.6%) vs
		"76/706 (10.7%) (OR 2.02, 95% CI, 1.02 to 4.40, P <0.001). CONCLUSION: Increasing"
		trend in the incidence of systemic candidiasis despite routine use of topical
		miconazole prophylaxis is of concern and future studies comparing the use of
		systemic fl uconazole versus oral nystatin may need to be considered.

TI	-	Determining risk factors for candidemia among newborn infants from
		"population-based surveillance: Baltimore, Maryland, 1998-2000."
PG	-	601-4
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Our objective was to determine risks factors for late onset
		"candidemia, independent of birth weight, in newborn infants. METHODS: We"
		"performed a matched case-control study. Cases were identified through active,"
		"population-based surveillance for candidemia, conducted in Baltimore City and"
		"County during 1998-2000, and were defined as the incident isolation of any"
		Candida species from the bloodstream of an infant 3 months old or younger. Four
		"controls, matched by age, hospital, birth weight category, hospital stay and"
		"admission date, were selected for each case. Potential risk factors included"
		"clinical, demographic and maternal prenatal data. RESULTS: Of the 35 cases, 19"
		"(54%) infections were with Candida albicans, 9 (26%) were with Candida"
		parapsilosis and 5 (14%) were with Candida glabrata. Cases had a median birth
		"weight of 680 g (range, 430-3200 g); median gestational ages of cases and"
		"controls were 25 and 27 weeks, respectively. Compared with controls, cases had"
		significant higher mortality (20% versus 4%; P = 0.004). No maternal factors were
		associated with increased risk of disease; cases were as likely as controls to be
		of black race. Multivariable conditional logistic regression analysis revealed
		"that gestational age younger than 26 weeks [adjusted odds ratio, 6.5; 95%"
		"confidence interval (95% CI), 1.3-32], vaginal delivery (adjusted odds ratio,"
		"4.3; 95% CI 1.3-14.2) and abdominal surgery (adjusted odds ratio, 10.9; 95% CI"
		1.9-62) were independently associated with increased risk of candidemia.
		"CONCLUSIONS: Independent of birth weight, infants born at <26 weeks or those who"
		have had abdominal surgery are at a significantly increased risk of candidemia.
		This study helps define a subgroup of preterm infants at high risk of developing
		bloodstream infections with Candida species.

AB	-	"PURPOSE: to characterize, phenotypically, yeasts isolated from the vaginal"
		content of 223 symptomatic (S) and asymptomatic (A) adult women with
		"vulvovaginitis, and to determine the clinical indicators which may lead to the"
		appearance of signs and symptoms related to the mucosa involvement by this
		pathology. METHODS: a questionnaire with open and closed questions on
		"epidemiological clinical data was applied initially. Then, mycological diagnosis"
		"with sowing in Chrom Agar Candida was done, followed by micro-morphological and"
		biochemical identification. Specific methods for the detection of the virulence
		"factors, proteinase and phospholipase were employed. Statistical analysis was"
		performed through chi2 and Pearson's chi2 tests. RESULTS: the most prevalent
		"species found was Candida albicans (87%, S and 67%, A) followed by Candida"
		"glabrata (4%, S e 17% A). The number of women reporting the use of contraceptives"
		"was higher among the symptomatic, 77%. In the two groups studied, about 87% of"
		the women presented regular menstrual cycles and 57% were married with ages
		"between 30 to 40 years old. Concerning the sexual practices, there has been"
		"concomitance among anal, oral and vaginal habits from the patients. Only Candida"
		albicans produced the virulence factor phospholipase in 37.5% of them. Proteinase
		"has been detected in Candida albicans, Candida glabrata and Candida parapsilosis."
		This latter virulence factor was mainly associated to isolates from symptomatic
		patients. CONCLUSIONS: it is a fact that the vaginal mucosa can be colonized and
		"infected by yeasts, with several Candida species present. Nevertheless, Candida"
		albicans is the most prevalent in the vaginal mucosa of adult women. It is
		"evident the emergence of non-albicans Candida species, some of them with"
		"intrinsic resistance to azolics, such as Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis,"
		"Candida tropicalis, and Candida guillermondii, which can be explained by the"
		inadequate use of medicines and empirical treatment.

		"nosocomial infections, are one of the most important issues in current practice."
		"Understanding trends in overall infection rates, as well as their incidence and"
		"proportion among different causative organisms, can help us to better define our"
		infection control methods and therapy goals. To understand the changing
		"epidemiology of nosocomial bloodstream infections (BSI) in Taiwan, we"
		retrospectively collected nosocomial infection data from 11 hospitals and
		examined the trends and changing patterns of nosocomial BSI. METHODS: Eleven
		major teaching hospitals in Taiwan were invited to participate in the study. The
		"overall density of nosocomial infections and major BSI-causing organisms,"
		"including Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii,"
		"and Candida species, were collected. The distribution of the different Candida"
		"species was also recorded. Background parameters from the 11 hospitals, including"
		"the size of the hospital, hospital capacity, the number of blood stream infection"
		"events, and average length of stay, were also recorded. RESULTS: The incidence of"
		"nosocomial BSI ranged 0.23-2.56 per 1,000 patient-days, which accounted for 8-43%"
		of all nosocomial infections. The most common causative organism of nosocomial
		"bacteremia was S. aureus, ranging 0.88-0.01 per 1,000 patient-days. Overall, the"
		"incidence of S. aureus bacteremia has decreased over the last 13 years, but this"
		difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.053). The rate of Candida
		fungemia (p < 0.01) and A. baumannii (p = 0.03) bacteremia increased
		"significantly. C. albicans accounted for most cases of nosocomial fungemia,"
		"ranging from 40% to 80%, followed by Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis and"
		"Candida glabrata. However, the incidence varied significantly from hospital to"
		"hospital, and the highest incidence was observed in a cancer center. CONCLUSION:"
		The overall incidence rate of S. aureus bacteremia in the 11 major hospitals
		"studied had decreased over the last decade, though the difference was not"
		"statistically significant. However, the rate of Candida fungemia and A. baumannii"
		bacteremia had increased significantly.

TI	-	The epidemiology of candidemia in two United States cities: results of a
		population-based active surveillance.
PG	-	1164-70
AB	-	"We conducted prospective, active population-based surveillance for candidemia"
		(defined as any Candida species isolated from blood) in Atlanta and San Francisco
		"(total population, 5.34 million) during 1992-1993. The average annual incidence"
		"of candidemia at both sites was 8 per 100,000 population. The highest incidence"
		"(75 per 100,000) occurred among infants </=1 year old. In 19% of patients,"
		candidemia developed prior to or on the day of admission. Underlying medical
		"conditions included cancer (26%), abdominal surgery (14%), diabetes mellitus"
		"(13%), and human immunodeficiency virus infection (10%). In 47% of cases, species"
		"of Candida other than Candida albicans were isolated, most commonly Candida"
		"parapsilosis, Candida glabrata, and Candida tropicalis. Antifungal susceptibility"
		testing of 394 isolates revealed minimal levels of azole resistance among C.
		"albicans, C. tropicalis, and C. parapsilosis. These data document the substantial"
		burden of candidemia and its changing epidemiology. Continued surveillance will
		be important to monitor the epidemiology of candidemia and to detect emergence of
		resistance to azoles.

TI	-	Immune compromise and prevalence of Candida vulvovaginitis in human
		immunodeficiency virus-infected women.
PG	-	252-6
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
		infection on vaginal yeast colonization and symptomatic vulvovaginitis and to
		explore the effects of immune compromise on these conditions in HIV-positive
		"women. METHODS: Between September 1991 and May 1993, 223 HIV-positive women"
		without AIDS-defining conditions were enrolled for prospective follow-up and
		compared with 289 HIV-negative women enrolled in a concurrent study. Standardized
		gynecologic assessment was carried out. RESULTS: Cultures from 81 of 223 (36%)
		HIV-positive women and 72 of 289 (25%) HIV-negative women were positive for any
		yeast. The most commonly isolated yeasts were Candida albicans and Torulopsis
		glabrata; the proportion of non-C albicans isolates (26%) did not differ by
		serostatus. The rates of C albicans colonization and vulvovaginitis among
		immunocompetent (CD4 count at least 500 cells/mm3) HIV-positive women did not
		"differ from those among HIV-negative women. Among HIV-positive women, risks for"
		colonization and for symptomatic vulvovaginitis were increased approximately
		"threefold and fourfold respectively, in women with CD4 counts below 200 cells/mm3"
		compared with either immunocompetent HIV-positive women or HIV-negative women.
		CONCLUSION: The yeast species isolated from HIV-positive and HIV-negative women
		were similar. Rates of vaginal colonization and vaginitis were similar among
		nonimmunocompromised HIV-positive women and HIV-negative women. Elevated rates of
		yeast colonization and vaginitis were not seen among this population of
		HIV-infected women before immune compromise. Both vaginal colonization and
		"symptomatic vaginitis increased with immune compromise among HIV-positive women,"
		especially at CD4 counts below 200 cells/mm3.

TI	-	Topical antiseptics as an alternative in the treatment of acute vulvovaginal
		candidosis.
PG	-	194-7
AB	-	"The aim of this prospective, multicenter, randomized, case-control study was to"
		investigate the efficacy of a nonspecific mucosal antiseptic (octenidine
		"dihydrochloride, phenoxyethanol) with proven antifungal effects, in patients with"
		"acute symptomatic vaginal candidosis, in comparison with a specific topical"
		"antifungal agent (clotrimazole), particularly in respect to non-Candida albicans"
		"yeasts. A total of 491 patients from 29 gynecological practices, who had new"
		"clinical vaginal mycosis, not treated with antifungal agents in the last 12"
		"months, were included in the study. The diagnosis in each case was confirmed by"
		microscopy or positive culture. The majority of the vaginal mycoses were
		infections with C. albicans (72%). In 28% of patients a non- Candida species
		"(mainly C. glabrata) contributed to the infection. Except for vaginal discharge,"
		the success of treatment was between 71% and 91% for both clinical and subjective
		parameters. The control preparation was significantly better than the treatment
		in the test group. Mycological cure rate on the basis of cultures was 78% in the
		test group and 87% in the control group. These results were also significantly
		different. The relatively high proportion of C. glabrata isolates in this study
		tended to be more successfully treated by the antiseptic (to 72%) than by the
		administration of clotrimazole (59%). Even though therapeutic success with
		"clotrimazole was overall significantly better than with the test preparation, the"
		success of treatment with the antiseptic used was within the range between 70%
		and 90% described for topical antifungal agents. Both the good efficacy of the
		topical antiseptic and the increased prevalence of non-Candida albicans species
		causing vaginal infections mean that the use of an antiseptic may be considered a
		suitable alternative therapeutic concept to an appropriate topical antifungal
		agent in the treatment of acute vaginal candidosis.

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: We aimed to describe the epidemiology of Candida bloodstream
		infection in an intensive care unit (ICU) in Reunion Island. METHODS: We
		"performed a retrospective cohort study and evaluated 63 candidemia episodes,"
		which occurred between January 2004 and December 2015 in the ICU of a University
		Hospital in St-Pierre. RESULTS: The incidence rate of candidemia in the ICU was
		estimated at 7.6%. Candida albicans was the most common yeast pathogen species
		"recovered (54%), followed by Candida glabrata (17%), Candida tropicalis (12%) and"
		"Candida parapsilosis (10%). Between 2012 and 2015, we also observed a"
		modification of antifungal use. CONCLUSION: The epidemiology of candidemia in
		Reunion Island is characterized by the predominance of Candida albicans and by
		the relative importance of Candida tropicalis. This pattern corresponds to a
		model of epidemiological transition between the one usually observed in tropical
		areas and the one observed in temperate countries.

TI	-	Candida colonization of the respiratory tract and subsequent pseudomonas
		ventilator-associated pneumonia.
PG	-	110-7
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Recovery of Candida from the respiratory tract of a critically ill
		patient receiving mechanical ventilation (MV) usually indicates colonization
		"rather than infection of the respiratory tract. However, interactions between"
		"Candida and bacteria, particularly Pseudomonas, have been reported. Thus, Candida"
		colonization of the respiratory tract may predispose to bacterial
		ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). METHODS: In a multicenter study of
		"immunocompetent critically ill patients receiving MV for > 2 days, we compared"
		the incidence of pneumonia in patients with and without (exposed/unexposed)
		"respiratory-tract Candida colonization, matched on study center, admission year,"
		"and MV duration. RESULTS: Over the 4-year study period, of the 803 patients"
		"meeting study inclusion criteria in the six study centers, 214 patients (26.6%)"
		had respiratory tract Candida colonization. Candida albicans was the most common
		"species (68.7%), followed by Candida glabrata (20.1%) and Candida tropicalis"
		(13.1%). Extrapulmonary Candida colonization was more common in exposed patients
		"(39.7% vs 8.3%, p = 0.01). Exposed patients had longer ICU and hospital stays but"
		similar mortality to unexposed patients. The matched exposed/unexposed nested
		cohort study identified bronchial Candida colonization as an independent risk
		"factor for pneumonia (24.1% vs 17.6%; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.58; 95%"
		"confidence interval [CI], 0.94 to 2.68; p = 0.0860); the risk increase was"
		"greatest for Pseudomonas pneumonia (9% vs 4.8%; adjusted OR, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.00"
		to 4.92; p = 0.049). CONCLUSIONS: Candida colonization of the respiratory tract
		is common in patients receiving MV for > 2 days and is associated with prolonged
		"ICU and hospital stays, and with an increased risk of Pseudomonas VAP."

PG	-	304-309
LID	-	10.1159/000507259 [doi]
AB	-	Emphysematous pyelonephritis (EPN) is a rare and serious necrotizing infection
		that is potentially life-threatening. It has been seldom reported in kidney
		"grafts and is usually caused by Gram-negative bacteria, with some case reports"
		"caused by anaerobic bacteria, and has been closely associated with poorly"
		controlled diabetes mellitus (DM) and urinary tract structural abnormalities.
		There are no reports of EPN of fungal etiology in kidney grafts. We present a
		"case of a 53-year-old kidney transplant recipient with a history of DM, active"
		"vesicoureteral reflux, and recurrent urinary tract infections who developed EPN"
		"in the kidney allograft caused by Candida glabrata, 3 weeks after starting"
		"treatment with empagliflozin, with an aggressive course that required urgent"
		transplant nephrectomy.

		susceptibility pattern.
PG	-	393-404
LID	-	10.1007/s15010-013-0570-4 [doi]
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Bloodstream infections (BSIs) due to Candida spp. constitute the
		predominant group of hospital-based fungal infections worldwide. A retrospective
		study evaluated the performance of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
		time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) for the identification of BSI
		"Candida isolates. The epidemiology, risk factors, demographic features, species"
		"distribution, and clinical outcome associated with candidemia in patients"
		"admitted to a single tertiary-care hospital in Qatar, were analyzed. METHODS: A"
		"single-center, retrospective analysis covering the period from January 1, 2004 to"
		"December 31, 2010 was performed. Molecular identification used sequence analysis"
		of the D1/D2 domains of the large subunit ribosomal DNA (LSU rDNA) and the ITS1/2
		regions of the rDNA. MALDI-TOF MS-based identification of all yeast isolates was
		performed with the ethanol/formic acid extraction protocol according to Bruker
		"Daltonics (Bremen, Germany). The susceptibility profiles of 201 isolates to"
		"amphotericin B, itraconazole, fluconazole, voriconazole, anidulafungin,"
		"caspofungin, posaconazole, and isavuconazole were tested using CLSI standard"
		broth microdilution method (M27-A3 and M27 S4) guidelines. Statistical analyses
		were performed with the statistical package SPSS 19.0. RESULTS: A total of 187
		patients with 201 episodes of candidemia were identified. Candida albicans was
		"the most common species isolated (33.8 %; n = 68), whereas non-albicans Candida"
		species represented 66.2 % (n = 133) of the episodes. The species distribution
		and outcome of candidemia showed a difference in the crude mortality between
		patients infected with C. albicans (n = 30; 45.5 %) and non-albicans Candida
		"species. For example, C. parapsilosis candidemia was associated with the lowest"
		"mortality rate (40.6 %), and patients with other non-albicans species had the"
		highest mortality rate (68-71.4 %). High mortality rates were observed among
		pediatric (<1 year of age) and elderly patients (>60 years of age). All strains
		showed low minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) (MIC90 of 0.063 μg/ml) to
		isavuconazole. The overall resistance to voriconazole in vitro antifungal
		activity was 2.5 %. C. glabrata (n = 38) had an MIC90 of 8 μg/ml for fluconazole.
		Most yeast isolates were susceptible to anidulafungin (>99.5 %) and 81.1 % to
		caspofungin. Resistance to anidulafungin was detected in 1/8 (12.5 %) isolates of
		C. orthopsilosis. According to new Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute
		"(CLSI) breakpoints, C. glabrata (n = 38) showed 100 % resistance, and 37/68 (54.4"
		%) C. albicans isolates were susceptible dose dependent (SDD) to caspofungin.
		Identification by MALDI-TOF MS was in 100 % concordance with molecular
		identification. CONCLUSION: The Middle East epidemiology of candidemia has a
		unique species distribution pattern distinct from other parts of the globe. High
		mortality rates were observed among pediatric (<1 year of age) and elderly
		patients (>60 years of age). All strains were susceptible to isavuconazole. All
		isolates of C.glabrata were resistant to caspofungin based on M27 S4. MALDI-TOF
		MS is a highly useful method for the routine identification of yeast isolates in
		clinical setting to achieve successful therapeutic treatment.

TI	-	The changing face of candidemia: emergence of non-Candida albicans species and
		antifungal resistance.
PG	-	617-23
AB	-	"OBJECTIVES: To assess the changing epidemiology of candidemia in the 1990s, to"
		evaluate the clinical implications for the presence of non-Candida albicans in
		"blood, and to evaluate the presence of antifungal resistance in relation to prior"
		antifungal administration. DESIGN: Multicenter prospective observational study of
		patients with positive blood cultures for Candida species or Torulopsis glabrata.
		SETTING: Four tertiary care medical centers. RESULTS: Four hundred twenty-seven
		consecutive patients were enrolled. The frequency of candidemia due to non-C.
		albicans species significantly increased in each hospital throughout the 3.5-year
		study period (P = 0.01). Thirteen percent of candidemias occurred in patients who
		were already receiving systemic antifungal agents. Candidemias developing while
		receiving antifungal therapy were more likely caused by non-C. albicans species
		than by C. albicans species (P = 0.0005). C. parapsilosis and C. krusei were more
		"commonly seen with prior fluconazole therapy, whereas T. glabrata was more"
		commonly seen with prior amphotericin B therapy. Candida species isolated during
		episodes of breakthrough candidemia exhibited a significantly higher MIC to the
		antifungal agent being administered (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In this large scale
		"study, the non-C. albicans species, especially T. glabrata, emerged as important"
		and frequent pathogens causing fungemia. This finding has major clinical
		implications given the higher complication and mortality rate associated with the
		non-C. albicans species. The change in the pattern of candidemia might be partly
		attributed to the increase in number of immunocompromised hosts and the
		widespread use of prophylactic or empiric antifungal therapy. This is an ominous
		sign given the in vitro resistance of the non-C. albicans species to currently
		available antifungal agents.

TI	-	Candidaemia and antifungal therapy in a French University Hospital: rough trends
		over a decade and possible links.
PG	-	80
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Evidence for an increased prevalence of candidaemia and for high
		associated mortality in the 1990s led to a number of different recommendations
		concerning the management of at risk patients as well as an increase in the
		availability and prescription of new antifungal agents. The aim of this study was
		to parallel in our hospital candidemia incidence with the nature of prescribed
		antifungal drugs between 1993 and 2003. METHODS: During this 10-year period we
		"reviewed all cases of candidemia, and collected all the data about annual"
		consumption of prescribed antifungal drugs. RESULTS: Our centralised clinical
		mycology laboratory isolates and identifies all yeasts grown from blood cultures
		"obtained from a 3300 bed teaching hospital. Between 1993 and 2003, 430 blood"
		yeast isolates were identified. Examination of the trends in isolation revealed a
		"clear decrease in number of yeast isolates recovered between 1995-2000, whereas"
		the number of positive blood cultures in 2003 rose to 1993 levels. The relative
		prevalence of Candida albicans and C. glabrata was similar in 1993 and 2003 in
		contrast to the period 1995-2000 where an increased prevalence of C. glabrata was
		observed. When these quantitative and qualitative data were compared to the
		amount and type of antifungal agents prescribed during the same period (annual
		"mean defined daily dose: 2662741; annual mean cost: 615,629 euros) a single"
		"correlation was found between the decrease in number of yeast isolates, the"
		increased prevalence of C. glabrata and the high level of prescription of
		fluconazole at prophylactic doses between 1995-2000. CONCLUSION: Between 1993 and
		"2000, the number of cases of candidemia halved, with an increase of C. glabrata"
		prevalence. These findings were probably linked to the use of Fluconazole
		prophylaxis. Although it is not possible to make any recommendations from this
		data the information is nevertheless interesting and may have considerable
		implications with the introduction of new antifungal drugs.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Noniatrogenic pituitary abscess remains a rare clinical entity, and"
		is the indication for surgery in <1% of transsphenoidal approaches. Correct
		"diagnosis of this rare entity is often delayed. Without timely treatment,"
		"morbidity and mortality are high. Of the 200 cases reported to date, less than"
		one-half have identified a causative organism. We report the second case of a
		"pituitary abscess caused by Candida species, and also provide an intraoperative"
		video showing the endoscopic management of this pathology. CASE DESCRIPTION: A
		"33-year-old woman presented with headache, hypopituitarism, and vision loss in"
		"the setting of diabetic ketoacidosis, and was found to have multiple abscesses in"
		"the liver, lung, kidney, and uterus. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed a"
		15-mm cystic sellar mass with restricted diffusion. The patient underwent urgent
		"evacuation of the abscess via an endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal route, with"
		"obvious purulent material filling the sella, later identified as Candida"
		"glabrata. Antimicrobial therapy was refined appropriately, and she exhibited"
		"significant improvement in neurologic function, although endocrinopathy has"
		"persisted. CONCLUSIONS: With timely management, including a combination of"
		"surgical drainage and appropriate antimicrobial therapy, neurologic outcomes are"
		"good in most cases of pituitary abscess; however, endocrinopathy often does not"
		improve. Although most reported cases with identified causative organisms
		"speciate bacteria, some cases are of fungal etiology and require different"
		antimicrobial agents. This further underscores the importance of identifying the
		causative agent.

		ill surgical patients.
PG	-	2443-9
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of a preemptive antifungal therapy in
		preventing proven candidiasis in critically ill surgical patients. DESIGN:
		"Before/after intervention study, with 2-yr prospective and 2-yr historical"
		control cohorts. SETTING: Surgical intensive care unit (SICU) in a
		"university-affiliated hospital. PATIENTS: Nine hundred and thirty-three patients,"
		"478 in the prospective group and 455 in the control group, with SICU stay > or =5"
		"days. INTERVENTIONS: During the prospective period, systematic mycological"
		"screening was performed on all patients admitted to the SICU, immediately at"
		admittance and then weekly until discharge. A corrected colonization index was
		used to assess intensity of Candida mucosal colonization. Patients with corrected
		colonization index > or =0.4 received early preemptive antifungal therapy
		"(fluconazole intravenously: loading dose 800 mg, then 400 mg/day for 2 wks)."
		MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: End points of this study were the frequency of
		"proven candidiasis, especially SICU-acquired candidiasis. During the"
		"retrospective period, 32 patients of 455 (7%) presented with proven candidiasis:"
		22 (4.8%) were imported and 10 (2.2%) were SICU-acquired cases. During the
		"prospective period, 96 patients with corrected colonization index > or =0.4 of"
		478 received preemptive antifungal treatment and only 18 cases (3.8%) of proven
		candidiasis were diagnosed; all were imported infections. Candida infections
		occurred more frequently in the control cohort (7% vs. 3.8%; p = .03). Incidence
		of SICU-acquired proven candidiasis significantly decreased from 2.2% to 0% (p <
		".001, Fisher test). Incidence of proven imported candidiasis remained unchanged"
		(4.8% vs. 3.8%; p = .42). No emergence of azole-resistant Candida species
		"(especially Candida glabrata, Candida krusei) was noted during the prospective"
		period. CONCLUSIONS: Targeted preemptive strategy may efficiently prevent
		acquisition of proven candidiasis in SICU patients. Further studies are being
		performed to assess cost-effectiveness of this strategy and its impact on
		selection of azole-resistant Candida strains on a long-term basis.

AB	-	Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients may suffer increased morbidity and mortality
		"through colonisation, allergy and invasive infection from fungi. The black yeast,"
		Exophiala dermatitidis (synonym Wangiella dermatitidis) has been found with
		"increasing frequency in sputum specimens of CF patients, with reported isolation"
		"rates ranging from 1.1 to 15.7%. At present, no diagnostic PCR exists to aid with"
		the clinical laboratory detection and identification of this organism. A novel
		species-specific PCR-based assay was developed for the detection of E.
		"dermatitidis, based on employment of rDNA operons and interspacer (ITS) regions"
		"between these rDNA operons. Two novel primers, (designated ExdF & ExdR) were"
		designed in silico with the aid of computer-aided alignment software and with the
		"alignment of multiple species of Exophiala, as well as with other commonly"
		"described yeasts and filamentous fungi within CF sputum, including Candida,"
		"Aspergillus and Scedosporium. An amplicon of approximately 455 bp was generated,"
		spanning the partial ITS1 region - the complete 5.8S rDNA region - partial ITS2
		"region, employing ExdF (forward primer [16-mer], 5'-CCG CCT ATT CAG GTC C-3' and"
		"ExdR (reverse primer [16-mer], 5'-TCT CTC CCA CTC CCG C-3', was employed and"
		optimised on extracted genomic DNA from a well characterised culture of E.
		"dermatitidis, as well as with high quality genomic DNA template from a further 16"
		"unrelated fungi, including Candida albicans, C. dubliniensis, C. parapsilosis, C."
		"glabrata, Scedosporium apiospermum, Penicillium sp., Aspergillus fumigatus,"
		"Aspergillus versicolor, Pichia guilliermondii, Rhodotorula sp., Trichosporon sp.,"
		"Aureobasidium pullulans, Fusarium sp., Mucor hiemalis, Bionectria ochroleuca,"
		Gibberella pulicaris. Results demonstrated that only DNA from E. dermatitidis
		"gave an amplification product of the expected size, whilst none of the other"
		fungi were amplifiable. Subsequent employment of this primer pair detected this
		yeast from mycological cultures from 2/50 (4%) adult CF patients. These two
		patients were the only patients who were previously shown to have a cultural
		history of E. dermatitidis from their sputum. E. dermatitidis is a slow-growing
		"fungus, which usually takes up to two weeks to culture in the microbiology"
		"laboratory and therefore is slow to detect conventionally, with the risk of"
		bacterial overgrowth from common co-habiting pan- and multiresistant bacterial
		"pathogens from sputum, namely Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia"
		"complex organisms, hence this species-specific PCR assay may help detect this"
		"organism from CF sputum more specifically and rapidly. Overall, employment of"
		"this novel assay may help in the understanding of the occurrence, aetiology and"
		"epidemiology of E. dermatitidis, as an emerging fungal agent in patients with CF."

TI	-	Candidemia: the impact of antifungal prophylaxis in a surgical intensive care
		unit.
PG	-	345-54
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candidemia is fourfold more common in 1990 compared to 1980. In
		"addition, a shift to non-albicans species has occurred in some institutions."
		Antifungal prophylaxis (AP) is effective in high-risk patients including
		"critically ill surgical patients, but its use has been attributed to a resultant"
		shift to non-albicans candida species. We hypothesized that the use of
		fluconazole prophylaxis would lead to a decreased incidence of candidemia but a
		"possible increased incidence of resistant species of Candida, especially Candida"
		"glabrata (CG). METHODS: From 1990 to 2002, all patients with candidemia (C) in"
		the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) of a large tertiary care hospital were
		identified and reviewed retrospectively. Antifungal prophylaxis began in 2000 for
		"high-risk patients. The periods were separated into PRE (1990-2000), and POST"
		prophylaxis (2000-2002). RESULTS: Excluding the year of the trial studying
		"prophylaxis, (1998; five cases of C) a total of 83 patients developed candidemia:"
		69 PRE (83%) (1.94/1000 patient days) and 14 POST (17%) (0.76/1000 patient days)
		"(OR 0.44; 95% CI 0.25, 0.78; p = 0.004). In the PRE period C. albicans (45%) and"
		"CG (30%) were predominant, whereas in the POST period, CG (9/14, 64%) (p = 0.05),"
		"and C. albicans (3/14, 21%) were common. Non-albicans species were 38/69 (55%)"
		"PRE and 11/14 (79%) POST, p = 0.14. Mortality in the group was 43/83 (52%) and"
		did not differ PRE/POST or based on treatment. Predictors of SICU mortality
		"(model r2 = 0.61) included hospital length of stay (LOS) (OR 1.14, CI 1.04,"
		"1.25), fever (OR 51.2, CI 2.46, 1064), and broad-spectrum antibiotics (OR 69.7,"
		"CI 2.08, 2351), whereas post-transplantation status (OR 0.005, CI 0.00, 0.56),"
		"blood sugar <180 mg/dL (OR 0.03, CI 0.01, 0.81), and fungal prophylaxis (OR 0.03,"
		"CI 0.01, 0.58) were associated with a decreased risk of mortality. CONCLUSIONS:"
		"Unfortunately, the mortality of candidemia remains high in SICU patients (52%)."
		"In the SICU, risk factors for candidemia and mortality are common. However,"
		antifungal prophylaxis has significantly decreased the annual incidence of
		candidemia without a statistically significant shift to non-albicans pathogens.

TI	-	Effects of fluconazole administration in critically ill patients: analysis of
		bacterial and fungal resistance.
PG	-	160-5
AB	-	HYPOTHESIS: The administration of fluconazole in intensive care unit (ICU)
		patients leads to the emergence of bacterial and fungal resistance. DESIGN:
		Retrospective analysis of 2 patient cohorts: (1) critically ill patients treated
		"in surgical, trauma, and medical ICUs between June 1997 and January 1999 who did"
		and did not receive fluconazole; and (2) ICU patients with fungal infections and
		sensitivity testing results from June 1994 to December 1998. SETTING:
		University-affiliated tertiary care hospital. PATIENTS: The first cohort included
		99 ICU patients with documented microorganism culture(s) who were treated with (n
		= 50) or without (n = 49) fluconazole; the second cohort included 38 patients
		"with Candida species infection, identification, and antifungal susceptibility"
		testing. RESULTS: Mortality (40% vs 20%; P = .03) and hospital length of stay
		(33.8 vs 25.6 days; P = .04) were higher in the patients treated with fluconazole
		compared with patients not treated with fluconazole. The ICU length of stay was
		also higher in patients treated with fluconazole (23.7 vs 15.1 days; P = .009).
		An increase in bacterial resistance occurred in patients after fluconazole
		treatment as opposed to bacterial resistance of patients who were treated for
		bacterial microorganism(s) without fluconazole (16% vs 4%; P = .049). Comparison
		of patient populations with Candida species identification before and after
		December 1997 showed an increase in Candida species resistance to fluconazole
		"(11% vs 36%; P = .16), respectively. Fungal strains were dominated by a"
		combination of Candida albicans and Candida glabrata in both populations (60%
		"[before 1998] vs 82% [after 1998]), with an emergence of Candida non-albicans"
		species tolerant to fluconazole. The amount of fluconazole administered and the
		number of patients receiving fluconazole treatment in the ICUs has also increased
		when comparing both periods. CONCLUSIONS: Comparison of critically ill patient
		populations with and without fluconazole treatment found increased mortality and
		longer hospital and ICU lengths of stay in the fluconazole-treated group. This
		group also had higher bacterial pathogen resistance to antibiotics after
		fluconazole administration compared with bacterial resistance of patients without
		fluconazole treatment. Our results warrant concern regarding worsening bacterial
		"infections, increased mortality, and an increase in Candida resistance to"
		"fluconazole from increased use in ICU patients, with a shift in yeast infection"
		that is more difficult to treat.

TI	-	Oral colonization of Candida species in patients receiving radiotherapy in the
		head and neck area.
PG	-	e52-7
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To investigate oral Candida strain diversity in patients receiving
		radiation therapy for head and neck cancer compared to controls by conventional
		"procedures, including cultivation of imprint samples on chromogenic medium and"
		subsequent identification using Analytical Profile Index testing. METHOD AND
		MATERIALS: Twenty-two irradiated patients aged 18 to 55 years were recruited from
		"the Maxillofacial Prosthetic Service, Mahidol University. Concomitantly, 22"
		healthy individuals whose age and sex matched that of the patient group were
		selected for a control group. RESULTS: All patients studied were Candida carriers
		and were predominantly infected with Candida albicans (86.36%). Besides C
		"albicans, other yeasts colonizing the oral cavity of these patients were C"
		"glabrata, C krusei, and C tropicalis. Candida carriage was found relatively less"
		"frequently (45.45%) in control subjects. However, C albicans was still the"
		predominant species detected. No C dubliniensis was found in either group.
		CONCLUSION: Head and neck cancer patients who had received radiotherapy had a
		"high prevalence of Candida colonization in the oral cavity. Consequently,"
		prophylaxis to reduce Candida infection in these patients is required. This may
		improve the quality of life for patients who receive irradiation treatment for
		malignant cancer.

TI	-	Invasive fungal infections in Chile: a multicenter study of fungal prevalence and
		susceptibility during a 1-year period.
PG	-	333-9
AB	-	During the first year of an ongoing surveillance program of invasive fungal
		infections (IFI) a total of 130 patients (56% male) with fungal strains isolated
		from blood and other sterile sites were reported from 13 hospitals in Chile.
		"Significant yeast isolates were obtained from 118 patients, and molds affected 12"
		"patients. The main patient groups affected were neonates, children less than 1"
		year old and adults aged 50-79 years. All fungal bloodstream infections (BSI)
		were due to yeasts; 79 patients (61%) were affected. The main risk factors
		"recorded were antibiotic therapy (76%), stay in the intensive care unit (ICU)"
		(70%) and presence of a central venous catheter (65%). Nosocomial infections were
		"represented in 83.5% of BSI. Overall, Candida albicans (40.8%), C. parapsilosis"
		"(13.1%), C. tropicalis (10%) and Cryptococcus neoformans (10%) were the most"
		common species. Aspergillus fumigatus (3.1%) was the most frequent mold. C.
		"albicans (48.1%) and C. parapsilosis (17.7%), were the most frequent agents"
		"recovered from blood. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Trichosporon mucoides, two"
		"emerging pathogens, were also isolated. All yeasts tested were susceptible to"
		amphotericin B with minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) < or = 1 microg/ml.
		Resistance to itraconazole (MIC > or = 1 microg/ml) and fluconazole (MIC > or =
		"64 microg/ml) was observed in 4 and 6% of cases, respectively. C. glabrata was"
		"the least susceptible species, with 50% of isolates resistant to itraconazole and"
		"33% resistant to fluconazole, with one strain showing combined resistance."
		Reduction of BSI requires greater adherence to hand-washing and related infection
		control guidelines.

PG	-	311-20
AB	-	Superficial fungal diseases that affect the skin and its appendages are
		frequently seen in basic triage and in dermatology services. These diseases are
		distributed in Venezuela with an incidence of 92.9%. The aim of this study was to
		determine the genera and species that cause dermatomycoses in residents of
		"Anzoátegui state, Venezuela, during the period 2002-2012. A total of 4257"
		"patients with a presumptive diagnosis of superficial mycoses were studied, with"
		ages from 7 months to 79 years. The overall prevalence was 30.9%. The most
		frequent were dermatophytosis (44.7%). M. canis produced 148 cases of tinea
		"capitis. Three dermatophytic agents represented 95% of all cases, with a"
		significant predominance of T. mentagrophytes with 50%. Candidosis occurred in
		"28.4%. C. albicans, and the C. parapsilosis complex, were responsible for 80% of"
		"the cases. The other species identified were C. tropicalis (n = 41, 11.0%), C."
		"glabrata (n = 10, 2.7%), C. guilliermondii (n = 6, 1.6%), C. krusei (n = 4,"
		"1.1%). Pityriasis versicolor occurred in 22.4% of the cases studied, and less"
		frequently were present onychomycosis produced by a non dermatophytic mold:
		"Fusarium oxysporum (n = 34, 65.4%), Aspergillus terreus (n=16, 30.8%) and"
		Scytalidium dimidiatum (n=2; 3.8%). Rare cases of Trichosporon onychomycosis
		(0.5%) and one case of black tinea were also found. Health education in the
		population is recommended to promote measures to prevent transmission of these
		fungi and prevent the spread of this silent public health problem.

TI	-	Evaluation of blood stream infections by Candida in three tertiary hospitals in
		"Salvador, Brazil: a case-control study."
PG	-	36-40
AB	-	Invasive infections caused by Candida spp. are an important problem in
		immunocompromised patients. There is scarce data on the epidemiology of blood
		"stream candidiasis in Salvador, Brazil. This study evaluates the risk factors"
		"associated with candidemia, among patients admitted to three tertiary, private"
		"hospitals, in Salvador, Brazil. We conducted a case-control, retrospective study"
		to compare patients with diagnosis of candidemia in three different tertiary
		"hospitals in Salvador, Brazil. Patients were matched for nosocomial, acquired"
		"infections, according to the causal agent: cases were defined by positive blood"
		cultures for Candida species. Controls were those patients who had a diagnosis of
		"systemic bacterial infection, with a positive blood culture to any bacteria,"
		within the same time period (+/- 30 days) of case identification. The groups were
		compared for the main known risk factors for candidemia and for mortality rates.
		"A hundred thirty-eight patients were identified. Among the 69 cases, only 14 were"
		diagnosed as infected by Candida albicans. Candida species were defined in only
		"eight cultures: C. tropicalis (4 cases), C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, C."
		"guillermondi, C. formata (1 case each). The main risk factors, identified in a"
		"univariate analysis, were: presence of a central venous catheter (CVC), use of"
		"parenteral nutrition support (PNS), previous exposure to antibiotics, and chronic"
		"renal failure (CRF). No association was detected with surgical procedures,"
		"diabetes mellitus, neutropenia or malignancies. Patients were more likely to die"
		"during the hospitalization period, but the rates of death caused by the"
		infections were similar for cases and controls. The length of hospitalization was
		"similar for both groups, as well as the time for a positive blood culture. Blood"
		"stream infection by Candida spp. is associated with CVC, PNS, previous use of"
		"antibiotics, and CRF. The higher mortality rate for cases probably better"
		"reflects the severity of the underlying diseases, than as a direct consequence of"
		Candidemia.

		and neck cancer].
PG	-	605-8
AB	-	PURPOSE: To investigate the distribution of oral candida species in head and neck
		"cancer (HNC) patients treated with radiation therapy, and provide the basis for"
		planning of clinical preventive measures. METHODS: Saliva was sampled from 60 HNC
		"patients before, during and after radiation. Concomitantly, 60 healthy"
		individuals whose age and sex matched that of the patient group were selected as
		control group. Oral candida carriages were quantitatively detected and the
		different candida species were identified by multiple measures such as CHROMagar
		candida culture medium and API 20C AUX yeast identification system. Then the
		differences between the two groups in terms of the candida detection rate and the
		distribution of each species of candida were analyzed with SPSS 17.0 software
		package. RESULTS: Xerostomia and dysphagia was found in 54 HNC patients during
		"radiotherapy, radiation-induced oral mucotitis(RIOM) was found in 50 HNC"
		"patients,and oral candidiasis was found in 18 HNC patients; In radiation group,"
		"the detection rate of candida colonization during radiation was 56.7%, 63.3%"
		"postradiation, which showed significant differences compared with pre-radiation"
		"(X² =18.320,P<0.001 ); Among the 54 identified clinical isolates, candida"
		"albicans (n=42) was the most frequent, followed by candida parapsilosis (n=6),"
		"candida tropicalis (n=4) and candida glabrata (n=2). In radiation group, the oral"
		"candida pathogens detection rate was 30%, and candida colonization was 46.7%."
		CONCLUSIONS: The oral candida colonization rate was significantly higher in HNC
		"patients after radiotherapy, which indicated that the candida infection may be"
		closely related to RIOM.

AB	-	We have reported an unusual case of Candida glabrata meningitis causing acute
		"changes in mental status in a chronically ill, elderly patient with"
		non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Candida glabrata was identified by Gram
		"stain, culture, and fermentation pattern from the CSF. Although the patient died"
		"of foreign body aspiration, an excellent clinical response was initially obtained"
		with amphotericin B and 5-flucytosine. This is the first report of a symptomatic
		Candida glabrata meningitis.

		urine].
PG	-	584-8
AB	-	JUSTIFICATION: Candiduria is increasingly frequent among patients admitted to
		intensive care units but its significance remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: Search for
		eventual correlation between quantitative candiduria and known risk factors for
		invasive candidiasis. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A
		four-month study was conducted in 162 patients hospitalized in the intensive care
		unit for more than 72 hours. All patients underwent a weekly research of
		candiduria added to sampling from different body sites to determine the Pittet
		Candida colonization index. RESULTS: Candiduria has been proved in 56 cases
		(34%). It was superior or equal to 10(4) UFC/ml among 28 patients (50%). Candida
		"tropicalis, Candida glabrata and Candida albicans has been isolated in 41, 22 and"
		20% respectively. All patients had at least one major and two minor risk factors
		for Candida infection. Six patients (10%) developed invasive candidiasis. The
		global mortality rate was at 52%. Pittet colonization index was significantly
		different between patients with candiduria and those with invasive candidiasis
		(p=0.01). There was a statistically significant correlation between candiduria
		superior or equal to 10(4) UFC/ml and Pittet colonization index superior or equal
		to 0.5 (p=0.01). CONCLUSION: Candiduria superior or equal to 10(4) UFC/ml
		associated with risk factors may predict invasive candidiasis in critically ill
		patients.

TI	-	Pancreatic fungal infections: a case report and review of the literature.
PG	-	308-12
AB	-	Pancreatic necrosis as a consequence of acute pancreatitis usually implies a poor
		prognosis. Infection is the most common complication affecting mortality and
		"appears to be increasing. While bacterial infections, particularly with"
		"coliforms, account for the majority of cases of infected necrosis, fungal"
		infections are being more frequently documented. This may be due to increased
		"recognition through improved laboratory techniques, more aggressive diagnosis by"
		"percutaneous aspiration, or the more widespread use of broad-spectrum antibiotics"
		or parenteral nutrition. While the majority of documented fungal pancreatic
		"infections have been with Candida species, recent reports have highlighted the"
		importance of Torulopsis glabrata. This haploid yeast of the family
		Cryptococcaceae is a fungal commensal organism accounting for 16% of all human
		yeast isolates. Here we report the first case of T. glabrata infection
		complicating pancreatic necrosis and review the current knowledge of pancreatic
		"fungal infections complicating acute pancreatitis. Superimposed infection, either"
		"bacterial or fungal, needs to be diligently sought in patients with pancreatic"
		necrosis who fail to improve or deteriorate despite supportive care.

		"due to altered gene expression: risk factors, antifungal treatment and outcome."
PG	-	1379-85
LID	-	10.1093/jac/dkn381 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: The role of Candida glabrata in fungaemia is attributed in part to
		"its reduced susceptibility to azoles, usually due to altered expression of genes"
		encoding drug efflux pumps. The aims of this study were to identify risk factors
		for fungaemia due to C. glabrata isolates with decreased susceptibility to
		fluconazole and to analyse the response to antifungal treatment and the clinical
		outcome of C. glabrata infections in hospitalized patients. METHODS: A
		retrospective case-case-control study was conducted at a university hospital from
		2000 to 2006. Three patient groups were studied: 14 patients infected by a
		fluconazole-less-susceptible isolate [susceptible-dose-dependent (SDD) or
		resistant]; 21 patients infected by a fluconazole-susceptible (FS) isolate; and
		70 uninfected controls. We measured expression of the drug efflux pump-encoding
		CgCDR1 and CgCDR2 genes in isolates of the two infected groups using quantitative
		real-time PCR. RESULTS: Multivariable analysis found that patients with prior
		"fluconazole use [odds ratio (OR) 12.24, 95% confidence intervals (CIs)"
		"1.77-84.39, P = 0.01], diabetes (OR 10.47, 95% CI 1.96-55.96, P = 0.006) and a"
		"central venous catheter (CVC) (OR 8.48, 95% CI 1.82-39.36, P = 0.006) were more"
		likely to develop fungaemia due to a less-susceptible isolate. Previous surgery
		"(OR 7.73, 95% CI 2.18-27.41, P = 0.002) was an independent risk factor for"
		"fungaemia due to a susceptible isolate, in addition to the presence of a CVC (OR"
		"5.48, 95% CI 1.69-17.72, P = 0.004). The crude 30 day mortality rate was high for"
		"both case groups. Seven patients received inadequate antifungal treatment,"
		including five infected by a fluconazole-resistant isolate but empirically
		treated with fluconazole; six of these seven patients died. Expression of the
		"CgCDR genes was up-regulated in all fluconazole-resistant and, to a lesser"
		"extent, SDD isolates, but not in the FS isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest"
		"that when candidaemia is suspected or detected, a more broad-spectrum antifungal"
		drug (i.e. echinocandins or amphotericin B) should be considered as initial
		treatment for patients with prior azole exposure.

		case report.
PG	-	316
LID	-	316
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Micafungin and caspofungin, which are both echinocandins, elicit"
		"their antifungal effects by suppressing the synthesis of β-D-glucan, an essential"
		component of fungal cell walls. If micafungin is not effective against a fungal
		"infection, is it unreasonable to switch to caspofungin? CASE PRESENTATION: An"
		80-year-old Asian man presented to our hospital with brain and lung abscesses.
		Klebsiella pneumonia and Escherichia coli were identified by sputa culture and
		Streptococcus mitis was identified in the brain abscess culture obtained by
		drainage surgery. He was treated with antibiotics and both abscesses shrank after
		the treatment. But he continued to have a high fever and Candida glabrata was
		identified by blood culture. The origin of the infection was not clarified and
		micafungin was administered intravenously. The fungus showed poor susceptibility
		to micafungin; we then switched the antifungal from micafungin to caspofungin.
		"After caspofungin treatment, his body temperature remained below 37 °C and his"
		"β-D-glucan levels decreased remarkably. CONCLUSIONS: In vitro, micafungin is"
		considered more effective against C. glabrata because its minimum inhibitory
		"concentration against C. glabrata is lower than that of caspofungin. However, in"
		"vivo, there is no significantly different effect between the two drugs. When"
		"micafungin is not effective against candidiasis, a switch to caspofungin might be"
		applicable because the pharmacokinetics in each echinocandin is slightly
		different.

PG	-	47-53
AB	-	"AIM: To study the etiology, clinical manifestations, risk factors, and results of"
		treatment for candidemia (CE) in patients with blood system tumors. SUBJECTS AND
		METHODS: The investigation included the patients with CE and hemoblastoses
		"treated at the Hematology Research Center, Ministry of Health of the Russian"
		"Federation, in 2006 to 2012. The diagnosis of CE was established according to the"
		single isolation of Candida spp. from blood cultures and the presence of
		"infection symptoms. RESULTS: Over 7 years, CE was diagnosed in 57 patients aged"
		"17 to 77 years (median age 48 years). Among the patients with CE, there was a"
		preponderance of those with lymphomas (54%) and acute leukemias (30%). The
		"pathogens of CE were C. albicans (33%), C. guilliermondii (26%), C. parapsilosis"
		"(12%), C. krusei (8%), C. lusitaniae (5%), C. famata (4%), C. tropicalis (4%), C."
		"glabrata (4%), and C. pelliculosa (4%). The major risk factors were"
		"polychemotherapy (85%), granulocytopenia (63%), mucosal Candida spp. colonization"
		"(82%), the presence of central venous catheter (CVC) (97%), antibiotics (100%),"
		and glucocorticosteroids (70%). The infection occurred with the intake of an
		antifungal agent in 33% of the patients; 60% had concomitant infections of other
		etiology. Antifungal agents were given to 52 (91%) patients. Within 30 days after
		"CE diagnosis, 20 (35%) patients died; of them 12 (60%) patients showed tumor"
		progression concurrent with the infection. The cure rate for CE was significantly
		"higher in the use of echinocandin as a first-line drug (92%), in complete or"
		"partial remission in hemoblastosis (90%), CVC removal (76%) and in the"
		administration of an antifungal drug on day 1 of detection of positive blood
		cultures (75%). The cure rate was significantly lower when septic shock developed
		"and a patient was transferred to an intensive care unit (15%), when amphotericin"
		"B was used as a first-line drug (45%), when granulocytopenia occurred (53%), or"
		glucocorticoids were given (55%). CONCLUSION: Candida non-albicans constitute a
		high proportion among the pathogens of CE. A number of risk factors influencing
		survival rates in CE have been identified. It is crucial to use echinocandin as a
		first-line agent as soon as possible after isolation of Candida spp. from blood
		cultures.

PG	-	447-50
AB	-	Between February 1993 and May 1994 we studied the prevalence of fungal
		vulvovaginitis among women attending the Obstetric and Gynecology Clinic of the
		"University of Ancona. Out of the 222 patients, 18 (8.2%) women had symptomatic"
		vaginitis and 24 (10.8%) were carriers. Candida albicans was the species most
		"frequently isolated (44.2%), followed by Torulopsis glabrata (28%) and"
		"Saccharomyces cerevisiae (16.2%), from symptomatic and carrier patients. The"
		activity of acid proteinase was determined for C. albicans isolated from both
		symptomatic and carrier patients. All 13 carriers showed low activity for
		"aspartyl proteinase (score 1+), while 5 of 6 symptomatic patients showed higher"
		"activity (score 2+), with a significant difference (p = 0.026). In general,"
		isolates of T. glabrata and S. cerevisiae were less susceptible in vitro to
		fluconazole than isolates of C. albicans. We did not find any differences in
		fluconazole MIC results among the C. albicans strains isolated from symptomatic
		"and carrier patients. On the other hand, the fluconazole MICs of T. glabrata and"
		S. cerevisiae isolates showed statistically significant differences between
		"symptomatic and carrier patients (p = 0.009 and p = 0.000, respectively). The"
		differences in proteinase secretion between the isolates from symptomatic and
		carrier patients suggest a correlation between proteinase production and vaginal
		"candidiasis caused by C. albicans. Torulopsis glabrata, however, was found to be"
		"the most common causative agent of vaginitis (7 out 19 episodes), followed by C."
		albicans (6 out of 19 episodes). Due to the varying patterns of antifungal
		"susceptibility, mainly to fluconazole for the yeast isolates considered in this"
		"study, an in vitro susceptibility testing program might be useful for monitoring"
		the outcome of this infection.

PG	-	30-40
AB	-	"PURPOSE: Candida endocarditis are rare, with a poor prognosis. Actually, the"
		principal problem concerns the growing incidence of nosocomial fungal infections.
		The objective of the present investigation is to assess a disease which risks
		becoming more pronounced in the future. METHODS: We have collected observations
		of Candida sp. endocarditis between 1985 to 1997 from three French university
		hospitals. RESULTS: Twelve of the observations fit the Duke criteria of acute
		"endocarditis. Patients were eight men and four women, with a mean age of 46"
		"years. An immunodepression was found in seven cases, and four patients were"
		active drug addicts. Six had an underlying heart disease at risk to acute
		"endocarditis. Candidemia risk factors were found in nine cases, with an average"
		of 2.7 risk factors per patient. The fungal agents detected were Candida albicans
		"(eight cases), C. tropicalis (one case), C. parapsilosis (two cases), and C."
		"glabrata (one case). These vegetations were on aortic (seven cases), mitral"
		"(three cases), tricuspid valves (two cases) or in other areas (three cases), with"
		"multiple localizations (two cases). In three observations, vegetations were"
		"associated with myocardium abscesses. Eight patients had embolic complications,"
		two had a cardiac insufficiency leading to death. The treatment was medical in
		all of the cases and combined with a surgical treatment in ten cases. The surgery
		"was performed, on an average, 17 days after diagnosis, allowing seven surviving"
		"patients. Among them, five received a secondary prophylaxis and no recurrence was"
		"recorded. CONCLUSIONS: Prognosis remains severe because of the voluminous,"
		"friable and necrotic vegetations, which favor embolic migrations and which are"
		"not easily accessible to antifungals, which penetrate poorly into these"
		vegetations. Therapy is based on a medical treatment combined with a valve
		"replacement which needs to be done early on, and is followed by a relapse"
		prevention which can occur several years after the initial episode.

		Endocarditis.
PG	-	208-210
LID	-	4470 [pii]
AB	-	BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: A case is reported of Candida glabrata infective
		endocarditis (IE) treated without surgical intervention. The study aim was to:
		(i) briefly discuss the outcomes of other documented cases of fungal IE managed
		medically with fluconazole; (ii) discuss the (1→3)-β-D-glucan assay and its
		previously studied role in the diagnosis of invasive fungal infections; and (iii)
		examine a possible application of the (1→3)-β-D-glucan assay to monitor response
		to antifungal treatment in patients with Candida endocarditis. METHODS: The serum
		Fungitell assay was used to trend (1→3)-β-D-glucan in a patient with Candida
		"endocarditis to determine treatment effectiveness with fluconazole, to provide an"
		"appropriate end date for antifungal therapy, and to survey infection suppression"
		while off treatment. RESULTS: The (1→03)-β-D-glucan assay began trending
		downwards at 197 days into treatment with oral fluconazole. After 16 months of
		"therapy, fluconazole was stopped due to transaminitis. (1→3)-β-Dglucan levels"
		were checked six weeks after the discontinuation of treatment and were negative.
		The patient has now been off therapy for 21 weeks with no signs of clinical
		"disease, and values remain negative. CONCLUSIONS: The present case indicates that"
		a trending (1→3)-β-D-glucan assay may have valuable application in monitoring
		treatment response and infection suppression for Candida endocarditis.

AB	-	JUSTIFICATION: The frequency of candidiasis has increased dramatically in recent
		"years. Candida albicans is the most common species. However, other species which"
		are pathogenic and resistant to usual antifungal agents beginning to emerge.
		"These include Candida dubliniensis and Candida africana, which share"
		"morphological similarities with Candida albicans. Thus, it is of interest to"
		correctly identify the fungal isolates. OBJECTIVE: To seek these new species
		among Candida strains isolated in Dakar. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Oropharyngeal and
		vaginal swabs were performed at Fann Universitary Hospital in Dakar. The strains
		"were identified by the germ tube test, the chlamydospore production test and an"
		auxanogram. Then identification by PCR targeting the hyphal wall protein 1(hwp1)
		"gene, was performed for the discrimination between Candida albicans, Candida"
		"dubliniensis and Candida africana. RESULTS: In total, 243 yeasts were isolated"
		from samples including 231 in vaginal swab and 12 in oropharyngeal swab. Species
		"identified by phenotypic methods are Candida albicans, which is the most"
		"frequent, Candida tropicalis, Candida glabrata, Candida dubliniensis, Candida"
		kefyr and Candida lusitaniae. PCR performed on the 150 strains germ tube test
		"positive identifies three Candida africana, 109 Candida albicans and no strain of"
		Candida dubliniensis. CONCLUSION: This study isolates Candida africana for the
		first time in Senegal. Further studies on a larger sample will better know the
		actual proportion of these three species among the isolated yeasts.

TI	-	[Antifungal susceptibility of Candida spp. isolates from blood cultures in a
		five-year period (1997-2001)].
PG	-	488-92
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: This retrospective study investigates the incidence of candidemia
		and antifungal susceptibility of Candida spp. isolates from blood cultures
		performed in the period from January 1997 to December 2001. METHODS: Amphotericin
		"B, fluconazole, itraconazole and flucytosine minimal inhibitory concentrations"
		(MICs) were determined using the Sensititre YeastOne broth microdilution assay
		"for the 53 isolates detected in the study period: C. parapsilosis (22), C."
		"albicans (19), C. glabrata (5), C. krusei (3), C. tropicalis (2) and C."
		guilliermondii (2). RESULTS: The incidence of candidemia was 0.25 episodes per
		1000 admissions in the period studied. C. parapsilosis was present in 41.5% of
		"cases, followed by C. albicans (35.8%), C. glabrata (9.4%), C. krusei (5.5%), C."
		tropicalis (3.7%) and C. guilliermondii (3.7%). Isolation of C. parapsilosis was
		significantly associated with the neonatal and pediatric ICU. None of the
		isolates presented an amphotericin B MIC > 1 micro g/ml. All the C. krusei
		isolates were resistant to fluconazole. Itraconazole resistance and
		dose-dependent fluconazole susceptibility was found in 80% of C. glabrata
		isolates. Only one C. parapsilosis isolate was resistant to flucytosine.
		CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of candidemia in our hospital was low. C. parapsilosis
		was the most common species and was associated with neonatal and pediatric ICUs.
		Fluconazole and itraconazole resistance was only found among C. krusei and C.
		"glabrata isolates, which accounted for 15% of the total Candida spp. isolated"
		from blood cultures in our hospital.

AB	-	Lower gastrointestinal tract infection caused by Candida species are rarely
		"reported and, Candida albicans and tropicalis have been the only pathogens"
		identified. We present the first documented case of candida colitis caused by
		Candida Glabrata in a 56-year-old man with a personal history of morbid obesity
		"and bariatric surgery. The presenting symptoms were diarrhea, rectal bleeding and"
		septic shock. Diagnosis was obtained by histological and microbiological study of
		the colonoscopy biopsies. Gastroenterologists should be aware of Candida as a
		cause of colonic infection. Fungal culture is the key to identify specific
		Candida species and lead to an appropriate antifungal therapy.

PG	-	e28247
LID	-	10.1371/journal.pone.0028247 [doi]
LID	-	e28247
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Fungal peritonitis is a serious complication of peritoneal dialysis
		(PD) therapy with the majority of patients ceasing PD permanently. The aims of
		this study were to identify risk factors and clinical associations that may
		discriminate between fungal from bacterial peritonitis. METHODS: We
		retrospectively identified episodes of fungal peritonitis from 2001-2010 in PD
		patients at Liverpool and Westmead Hospitals (Australia). Fungal peritonitis
		cases were matched in a 1:2 ratio with patients with bacterial peritonitis from
		"each institution's dialysis registry, occurring closest in time to the fungal"
		"episode. Patient demographic, clinical and outcome data were obtained from the"
		medical records. RESULTS: Thirty-nine episodes of fungal peritonitis (rate of
		0.02 episodes per patient-year of dialysis) were matched with 78 episodes of
		bacterial peritonitis. Candida species were the commonest pathogens (35/39; 90%
		"episodes) with Candida albicans (37%), Candida parapsilosis (32%) and Candida"
		glabrata (13%) the most frequently isolated species. Compared to bacterial
		"peritonitis, fungal peritonitis patients had received PD for significantly longer"
		"(1133 vs. 775 catheter-days; p = 0.016), were more likely to have had previous"
		"episodes of bacterial peritonitis (51% vs. 10%; p = 0.01), and to have received"
		prior antibacterial therapy (51% vs. 10%; p = 0.01). Patients with fungal
		"peritonitis were less likely to have fever and abdominal pain on presentation,"
		"but had higher rates of PD catheter removal (79% vs. 22%; p<0.005), and permanent"
		transfer to haemodialysis (87% vs. 24%; p<0.005). Hospital length of stay was
		significantly longer in patients with fungal peritonitis (26.1 days vs. 12.6
		"days; p = 0.017), but the all-cause 30-day mortality rate was similar in both"
		groups. Fluconazole was a suitable empiric antifungal agent; with no Candida
		"resistance detected. CONCLUSION: Prompt recognition of clinical risk factors,"
		initiation of antifungal therapy and removal of PD catheters are key
		considerations in optimising outcomes.

PG	-	265-8
LID	-	S0036-46652008000500003 [pii]
AB	-	The incidence of Candida bloodstream infection has increased over the past years.
		"In the Center-West region of Brazil, data on candidemia are scarce. This paper"
		reports a retrospective analysis of 96 cases of Candida bloodstream infection at
		"a Brazilian tertiary-care teaching hospital in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul,"
		"from January 1998 to December 2006. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data"
		were collected from medical records and from the hospital's laboratory database.
		"Patients' ages ranged from three days to 92 years, with 53 (55.2%) adults and 43"
		"(44.8%) children. Of the latter, 25 (58.1%) were newborns. The risk conditions"
		"most often found were: long period of hospitalization, utilization of venous"
		"central catheter, and previous use of antibiotics. Fifty-eight (60.4%) patients"
		died during the hospitalization period and eight (13.7%) of them died 30 days
		after the diagnosis of candidemia. Candida albicans (45.8%) was the most
		"prevalent species, followed by C. parapsilosis (34.4%), C. tropicalis (14.6%) and"
		C. glabrata (5.2%). This is the first report of Candida bloodstream infection in
		the state of Mato Grosso do Sul and it highlights the importance of considering
		the possibility of invasive Candida infection in patients exposed to risk
		"factors, particularly among neonates and the elderly."

TI	-	[Nosocomial fungemias in a general hospital. Epidemiology and prognostic factors.
		Prospective study 1993-1998].
PG	-	304-7
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Nosocomial fungemias are infections with a high mortality rate. In
		last years the incidence of these infections has increased probably because of
		the growing population of immunocompromised patients who undergo aggressive
		diagnostic and therapeutic techniques. OBJECTIVE: To know the epidemiologic
		"characteristics, risk factors, clinical features and prognosis of fungemia."
		PATIENTS AND METHODS: We prospectively evaluated all the patients with proven
		fungemia in our center during a 5 year-period. After finishing antifungal
		treatment a minimum follow-up of 1 month was carried out. Fungal isolation and
		identification were performed by standard tests. RESULTS: During the period of
		study we evaluated 81 patients with an episode of nosocomial fungemia. Global
		"incidence was 0,9 episodes per thousand admitted patients. Candida albicans was"
		"the more frequently isolated species (n=53), followed by C. parapsilosis (n=11),"
		C. tropicalis (n=6) and C. glabrata (n=5). Most of the patients had a central
		intravenous line and were on parenteral nutrition therapy. All of them previously
		received at least one course of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Overall mortality was
		"49,6%. A worst prognosis was significantly associated with: age over 65 years,"
		"surgical procedures during present admission, leucocytosis, shock, and delay in"
		antifungal treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Fungal bloodstream infection incidence is high
		"in our environment. It is associated with a high mortality rate, specially in"
		patients in whom the beginning of antifungal treatment was delayed. A higher
		clinical suspicion index may improve the poor outcome in these patients.

TI	-	Secular trends in nosocomial candidaemia in non-neutropenic patients in an
		Italian tertiary hospital.
PG	-	908-13
AB	-	A retrospective study was performed in an Italian tertiary hospital to evaluate
		"trends in candidaemia between 1992 and 2001, and to compare the characteristics"
		"of episodes of fungaemia between 1992--1997 and 1998--2001. In total, 370"
		"episodes of candidaemia were identified, with an average incidence of 0.99"
		episodes/10 000 patient-days/year (range 0.49--1.29 episodes). On an annual trend
		"basis, the overall incidence was essentially stable in surgical and medical"
		"wards, but decreased in intensive care units (ICUs) (p 0.0065). The average use"
		"of fluconazole was 37.9 g/10 000 patient-days/year (range 21.4--56.1 g), and did"
		not change significantly during the 10-year period. Nearly two-thirds of patients
		"were in ICUs at the onset of candidaemia, but none was neutropenic in either"
		study period. Candida albicans remained the predominant species isolated (53.8%
		"vs. 48.1%), followed by Candida parapsilosis, Candida glabrata and Candida"
		"tropicalis, the distribution of which did not change significantly. The 30-day"
		crude mortality rate was essentially similar (44% vs. 35%) in both study periods.
		"Thus the incidence of nosocomial candidaemia, although high in this institution,"
		decreased among critically-ill patients during the 10-year period. This finding
		"seemed to be related to an improvement in infection control practices,"
		particularly regarding the prevention of intravascular catheter-related
		"infections in ICUs. Although the overall use of fluconazole was considerable, no"
		increase in azole-resistant non-albicans Candida spp. was detected.

TI	-	High-dose liposomal amphotericin B in the therapy of systemic candidiasis in
		neonates.
PG	-	603-7
AB	-	High-dose (5-7 mg/kg/day) liposomal amphotericin B was evaluated prospectively
		during the period 1995-2001 in 41 episodes of systemic candidiasis occurring in
		37 neonates (36 of the 37 were premature infants with very low birth weights).
		Median age at the onset of systemic candidiasis was 17 days. Candida spp. were
		"isolated from blood in all patients and from urine, skin abscesses and peritoneal"
		"fluid in 6, 5 and 1 neonates, respectively. Candidiasis was due to Candida"
		"parapsilosis in 17 cases, Candida albicans in 15 cases, Candida tropicalis in 5"
		"cases, Candida guilliermondii in 2 cases, Candida glabrata in 2 cases and an"
		"unidentified Candida sp. in 1 case. Twenty-eight, five and eight infants received"
		"7, 6-6.5 and 5 mg/kg/day, respectively. Median duration of therapy was 18 days;"
		median cumulative dose was 94 mg/kg. Fungal eradication was achieved in 39 of 41
		(95%) episodes; median duration of therapy until fungal eradication was 8.7+/-4.5
		days. Fungal eradication was achieved after 10.9+/-4.8 days in patients who had
		received previous antifungal therapy compared to 8.2+/-4.3 days in those treated
		with liposomal amphotericin B as first-line therapy. One patient died due to
		systemic candidiasis on day 12 of therapy. High-dose liposomal amphotericin B was
		effective and safe in the treatment of neonatal candidiasis. Fungal eradication
		was more rapid in patients treated early with high doses and in patients who
		received high-dose liposomal amphotericin B as first-line therapy.

TI	-	Candida colonization as a risk marker for invasive candidiasis in mixed
		"medical-surgical intensive care units: development and evaluation of a simple,"
		standard protocol.
PG	-	1324-30
LID	-	10.1128/JCM.03239-14 [doi]
AB	-	Colonization with Candida species is an independent risk factor for invasive
		"candidiasis (IC), but the minimum and most practicable parameters for prediction"
		of IC have not been optimized. We evaluated Candida colonization in a prospective
		"cohort of 6,015 nonneutropenic, critically ill patients. Throat, perineum, and"
		urine were sampled 72 h post-intensive care unit (ICU) admission and twice weekly
		"until discharge or death. Specimens were cultured onto chromogenic agar, and a"
		subset underwent molecular characterization. Sixty-three (86%) patients who
		developed IC were colonized prior to infection; 61 (97%) tested positive within
		the first two time points. The median time from colonization to IC was 7 days
		"(range, 0 to 35). Colonization at any site was predictive of IC, with the risk of"
		infection highest for urine colonization (relative risk [RR]=2.25) but with the
		sensitivity highest (98%) for throat and/or perineum colonization. Colonization
		of ≥2 sites and heavy colonization of ≥1 site were significant independent risk
		"factors for IC (RR=2.25 and RR=3.7, respectively), increasing specificity to 71%"
		to 74% but decreasing sensitivity to 48% to 58%. Molecular testing would have
		prompted a resistance-driven decision to switch from fluconazole treatment in
		"only 11% of patients infected with C. glabrata, based upon species-level"
		identification alone. Positive predictive values (PPVs) were low (2% to 4%) and
		negative predictive values (NPVs) high (99% to 100%) regardless of which
		"parameters were applied. In the Australian ICU setting, culture of throat and"
		perineum within the first two time points after ICU admission captures 84% (61/73
		"patients) of subsequent IC cases. These optimized parameters, in combination with"
		"clinical risk factors, should strengthen development of a setting-specific"
		risk-predictive model for IC.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Oropharyngeal candidiasis continues to be a major opportunistic
		infection in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. The objectives
		"of this study were to investigate the prevalence, associated factors, and"
		microbiologic features for oropharyngeal yeast colonization in HIV-infected
		"patients. METHODS: From October to December 2009, consecutive HIV-infected"
		patients older than 18 years were recruited in this study. Demographic
		"information, underlying conditions, and clinical histories were collected."
		Oropharyngeal swab cultures for yeasts and antifungal drug susceptibilities of
		"the isolates were performed. RESULTS: Of the 105 HIV-infected patients, 54"
		"(51.4%) were colonized with yeasts, including 11 patients (20.4%) with more than"
		"one species. Among the 68 isolates, Candida albicans accounted for 73.5%,"
		"followed by Candida tropicalis (5.9%), Candida glabrata (5.9%), and Candida"
		dubliniensis (4.4%). There were 7.5% and 6% Candida isolates resistant to
		"fluconazole and voriconazole, respectively. All of the Candida isolates were"
		susceptible to amphotericin B. A higher prevalence of yeast colonization was
		noted in patients with a CD4 cell count ≤200 cells/μL (p = 0.032). Multivariate
		regression analysis showed that intravenous drug use was an independent
		"associated factor for oropharyngeal yeast colonization (odds ratio, 5.35; 95%"
		"confidence interval, 1.39-20.6; p = 0.015), as well as protease"
		"inhibitor-containing antiretroviral therapy (odds ratio, 3.59; 95% confidence"
		"interval, 1.41-9.12; p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: Despite previous studies showing"
		"that protease inhibitors decreased Candida adhesion to epithelial cells in vitro,"
		the current study found protease inhibitor-containing antiretroviral therapy
		predisposed to oropharyngeal yeast colonization in HIV-infected patients.

AB	-	Fungal colonization is a common occurrence in preterm neonates. Our objective was
		to describe the profile and characteristics of fungal colonization in preterm
		"infants admitted to the Martinique NICU. From March 2012 to January 2013, an"
		epidemiological prospective cohort study was conducted with 57 very
		"low-birth-weight infants. Cutaneous, rectal, gastric, respiratory, and urinary"
		"swabs were collected on admission, then every week for 4 weeks. The prevalence of"
		"fungal colonization was 68% (39/57): 46% by Malassezia species, 28% by"
		"Candida parapsilosis, 19% by C. albicans, 5% by C. glabrata, and 2% by"
		C. guilliermondii. The colonized patients had a duration of parenteral nutrition
		and antibiotic therapy longer than the others (P<0.05). Nosocomial colonization
		(after 2 days of life) occurred in 52% of cases: Malassezia species and
		C. parapsilosis were the commensal skin yeasts most frequently implicated.
		Forty-nine percent (28/57) had suspected invasive fungal infections that received
		probabilistic treatment. Only one case of invasive fungal infection with
		C. glabrata was diagnosed. This study highlights the important role played by
		nosocomial transmission in the colonization of preterm newborns. Mycological
		surveillance cultures in the NICU are very useful for monitoring fungal ecology
		and can improve the prevention of fungal colonization in preterm infants at risk
		of invasive fungal infection.

TI	-	Frequency of Candida albicans in Patients with Funguria.
PG	-	113-6
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of Candida albicansin patients with
		funguria. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive cross-sectional study. PLACE AND DURATION OF
		"STUDY: Department of Microbiology, Sindh Institute of Urology and"
		"Transplantation, from July to December 2012. METHODOLOGY: Patients’ urine samples"
		with fungus/Candida were included. Candida albicans was identified by the
		production of tubular structures (germ tubes) on microscopy as per standard
		procedure followed by inoculation on Chrom agar (Oxoid) and Corn Meal-Tween 80
		agar (Oxoid). The identification of other non-albicans Candidaspecies was also
		done both microscopically and macroscopically as per standard procedure. RESULTS:
		"Out of the 289 isolates, 204 (70.6%) were male patients and 85 (29.4%) were"
		"female patients, with 165 (57.1%) from the out-patients and 124 (42.9%) from the"
		in-patients. Five species of Candidawere found to be prevalent including 87
		"(30.1%) Candida albicans, 176 (60.9%) Candida tropicalis, 14 (4.8%) Candida"
		"parapsilosis, 8 (2.8%) Candida glabrata and 4 (1.4%) Candida lusitaniae. Majority"
		of patients with funguria were aged above 50 years (60.2%). CONCLUSION: In the
		"present study, 30.1% patients with funguria had Candida albicans. The most"
		"frequently isolated species was Candida tropicalis(60.9%), followed by other"
		non-albicansCandida. This study has shown the emergence of non-albicans Candidaas
		a major cause of candiduria.

PG	-	531-6
AB	-	This study aimed to retrospectively evaluate the adequate use of antifungal drugs
		"in the treatment of the candidaemia. A collection of clinical, biological and"
		therapeutic data was carried out for the patients who had a positive blood
		culture for Candida species during the year 2004. The antifungal therapy was
		"compared to the guidelines of the French Conference of consensus named ""Prise en"
		"charge des candidoses et aspergilloses invasives de l'adulte"". The degree of"
		"conformity was classified as follows: complying, partly complying (molecule in"
		conformity but delay of treatment or unsuited dosing) and not complying with the
		"guidelines. The analysis was performed, according to the guidelines, before and"
		after knowledge of Candida species growing from the blood culture. On 29
		"candidaemia, the found species were: Candida albicans 55%, Candida glabrata 14%,"
		"Candida krusei 10%, Candida parapsilosis and Candida lusitaniae 7%, Candida"
		pelliculosa and Candida tropicalis 3.5%. Only 19 candidaemia were included in
		this study because blood cultures were known positive for Candida on the day of
		death (N=7) or medical charts were not available (N=3). For treatment before
		"identification of Candida species, 37% were complying, 37% in partly complying"
		and 26% not complying with the guidelines. For the treatment after identification
		"of the species, 26% were complying, 63% partly complying and 11% not complying"
		"with the guidelines. As a whole, antifungal therapy was totally or partly"
		complying in 74 to 89% of candidaemia in adult patients. Lower dosages of
		fluconazole explained most of the treatments that partly complied with
		guidelines.

TI	-	High- versus low-dose fluconazole therapy for empiric treatment of suspected
		invasive candidiasis among high-risk patients in the intensive care unit: a
		cost-effectiveness analysis.
PG	-	1057-65
AB	-	BACKGROUND: High-dose fluconazole is an alternative for patients with candidemia
		caused by Candida glabrata or other Candida species with decreased fluconazole
		"susceptibility. However, empiric high-dose fluconazole is not currently"
		recommended and may result in higher drug costs and toxicity. OBJECTIVE: To
		determine the cost-effectiveness of using empiric high-dose fluconazole in
		intensive care unit (ICU) with suspected invasive candidiasis. DESIGN: Decision
		analytic model. TARGET POPULATION: ICU patients with suspected invasive
		candidiasis. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTIONS:
		Low-dose fluconazole (loading dose of 800 mg followed by 400 mg daily) vs.
		high-dose fluconazole (loading dose of 1600 mg followed by 800 mg daily). Generic
		fluconazole costs were used for the analysis. OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental life
		expectancy and incremental cost per discounted life year (DLY) saved. RESULT OF
		BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Based on current national levels of fluconazole resistance
		"and ability to correctly identify patients with candidemia, high-dose fluconazole"
		was the more effective but more expensive treatment strategy. Empiric high-dose
		fluconazole therapy decreased the mortality rate by 0.15% compared to low-dose
		"strategy with a cost-effectiveness rate of $55,526 per DLY saved. RESULTS OF"
		SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Empirical high-dose fluconazole was an acceptable treatment
		"strategy (using $100,000 per DLY saved as threshold) unless the physical age of"
		an ICU survivor was 66 years or older. Empirical high-dose fluconazole was an
		"acceptable treatment strategy using $50,000 per DLY saved with minor changes in"
		parameters estimates. LIMITATIONS: The estimates of our model may not be
		applicable to all ICU patients. Other hospitals with differences in fluconazole
		"resistance, prevalence of invasive candidiasis, or duration of fluconazole"
		therapy may produce different results. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that
		empiric high-dose fluconazole therapy should reduce the mortality associated with
		invasive candidiasis at an acceptable cost.

PG	-	598-602
LID	-	10.1016/j.jcrs.2008.08.046 [doi]
AB	-	We report a case of Candida glabrata endophthalmitis following penetrating
		keratoplasty in a 57-year-old man. The infection was thought to be treated
		successfully with intravitreal amphotericin B but flared 7 months later following
		cataract extraction and eventually required explantation of the intraocular lens
		and therapeutic keratoplasty. The literature regarding this rare infection is
		"reviewed. Candida glabrata, an uncommon ocular pathogen, is being reported with"
		increasing frequency and with a notable predilection for post-keratoplasty eyes.
		"In the 10 reported cases, there is 100% concordance between host and donor tissue"
		"cultures. In half the cases, there was a latent period of several months. These"
		infections can be difficult to treat because C glabrata is often resistant to the
		antifungal agents commonly used to treat Candida albicans.

TI	-	Candidaemia in an Irish tertiary referral hospital: epidemiology and prognostic
		factors.
PG	-	251-9
AB	-	There were two parts to this study. Part 1 evaluated the epidemiology of Candida
		bloodstream isolates within the Southern Health Board (SHB) of Ireland from 1992
		to 2003 by retrospective surveillance of all such isolates of patients reported
		from SHB hospitals to our laboratory database during that period. Part 2 reviewed
		candidaemia cases occurring in Cork University Hospital (CUH) from 1999 to 2003
		using surveillance of all positive blood culture isolates in CUH microbiology
		"laboratory during the 5-year period. In part 1, 250 Candida bloodstream isolates"
		were reported in the SHB over 12 years. There was a pattern of decreasing
		"percentage of C. albicans with time. Whereas in part 2, 63 cases of candidaemia"
		were identified in CUH from 1999 to 2003. Candida albicans constituted 50% of all
		"isolates, while C. parapsilosis and C. glabrata accounted for 21.2% and 18.2%"
		respectively. Average annual incidence rate was 0.48 episodes/1000 admissions and
		0.70 episodes/10 000 patient-days. Vascular catheters were the commonest source
		of candidaemia (61.9%) followed by the urinary tract (12.7%). Risk factors
		included exposure to multiple antibiotics (75%); central vascular catheterization
		(73%); multiple colonization sites (71%); severe gastrointestinal (GI)
		dysfunction (54%) and acute renal failure (43%). Crude 7-day and 30-day mortality
		rates were 20.6% and 39.7% respectively. Logistic regression multivariate
		analysis identified the following to be independent predictors for mortality: age
		"> or =65 years [odds ratio (OR) 7.2, P = 0.013]; severe GI dysfunction (OR 10.6,"
		"P = 0.01); acute renal failure (OR 7.6, P = 0.022); recent/concurrent bacteraemia"
		"(OR 5.2, P = 0.042); endotracheal intubation (OR 7.7, P = 0.014); while major"
		"surgery was associated with a better prognosis (OR 0.05, P = 0.002). Appropriate"
		antifungal treatment was also found to be associated with survival (Fisher's
		"exact test, P < 0.001). The epidemiology of Candida bloodstream isolates within"
		our health board had changed over the years. Incidence and mortality of
		candidaemia were relatively high in our hospital. Dysfunction of major organ
		systems and recent bacteraemia were found to predict mortality.

		non-albicans candidemia.
PG	-	1077-83
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To describe the evolving epidemiology of fungal bloodstream infections
		in critically ill and noncritically ill patients and to identify predictors of
		infection with non-albicans yeast species. DESIGN: Retrospective case series.
		"SETTING: Two academic, tertiary care centers. PARTICIPANTS: All persons during a"
		4-yr period who developed fungemia. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN
		RESULTS: We initially compared subjects with Candida albicans vs. alternative
		"yeast. In a sensitivity analysis, we compared persons with potentially"
		fluconazole-resistant organisms (Candida glabrata and Candida krusei) to those
		with other fungi. We also repeated these analyses in the subgroup of persons in
		the intensive care unit when they developed fungemia. The study cohort included
		"245 patients (60% in the intensive care unit), and C. albicans accounted for 52%"
		"of infections, whereas C. glabrata represented 20% of cases. The distribution of"
		isolates was similar in both intensive care unit patients and those on the wards.
		"In the entire population, no variable, including both previous fluconazole"
		"exposure and severity of illness, correlated with the fungemia due to a"
		"non-albicans species. In our sensitivity analysis, no factor was independently"
		associated with a potentially fluconazole-resistant yeast. For the subgroup of
		"subjects whose fungemia was diagnosed while they were in the intensive care unit,"
		no variable differentiated C. albicans from non-albicans isolates. CONCLUSIONS:
		Non-albicans yeast are common both in the intensive care unit and on the wards.
		Simple clinical factors do not allow the clinician to effectively identify
		patients likely infected with non-albicans pathogens or with possible
		fluconazole-resistant fungi.

TI	-	Outbreak of nosocomial fungemia caused by Candida glabrata.
PG	-	470-5
AB	-	An outbreak of Candida glabrata fungemia that was thought to be associated with
		bottles used for milk feeds occurred at our children's infectious diseases
		clinic. This cluster of cases was investigated using a case-control study.
		Isolates were identified by conventional methods and karyotyped using
		pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of genomic DNA. Potential risk factors
		for nine hospitalized children with candidemia and 14 controls were long-term
		hospitalization and treatments with more than two antibiotics. Electrophoretic
		"karyotyping showed a single chromosomal pattern for these outbreak isolates and,"
		"in addition, they all had the same antifungal susceptibility results. These"
		findings suggest that clonal dissemination of a single strain was responsible for
		this outbreak. Karyotyping by PFGE appears to be a useful molecular typing method
		for strains of C. glabrata.

TI	-	Candida glabrata olecranon bursitis treated with bursectomy and intravenous
		caspofungin.
PG	-	179-82
AB	-	Orthopedic surgeons are becoming more involved in the care of patients with
		septic arthritis and bursitis caused by yeast species. This case report involves
		a middle-aged immunocompromised female who developed a Candida glabrata septic
		olecranon bursitis that developed after she received a corticosteroid injection
		in the olecranon bursa for presumed aseptic bursitis. Candida (Torulopsis)
		glabrata is the second most frequently isolated Candida species from the
		bloodstream in the United States. Increased use of fluconazole and other azole
		antifungal agents as a prophylactic treatment for recurrent Candida albicans
		infections in immunocompromised individuals is one reason why there appears to be
		increased resistance of C. glabrata and other nonalbicans Candida (NAC) species
		"to fluconazole. In this patient, this infection was treated with surgery"
		"(bursectomy) and intravenous caspofungin, an echinocandin. This rare infectious"
		etiology coupled with this intravenous antifungal treatment makes this case novel
		among cases of olecranon bursitis caused by yeasts.

TI	-	Bloodstream infections in pediatric patients.
PG	-	1555-61
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: Blood stream infection (BSI) is the leading cause of morbidity and
		"mortality in pediatric patients. This study aims to describe the clinical,"
		microbiological characteristics and outcome of BSI in pediatric patients.
		METHODS: We collected the clinical data from all pediatric patients with positive
		blood cultures. We identified all isolates from these patients from January 2004
		"to December 2004 at King Khalid University Hospital (KKUH), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia,"
		and determined antimicrobial susceptibilities by MicroScan Walk Away 96 (Dade
		"Behring Inc., West Sacramento, CA95691, USA). RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty"
		"pediatric patients had BSI, of whom 147 (67%) were males and 71 (32.2%) were from"
		intensive care units (ICUs). Two hundred and ten (95.4%) had single blood culture
		isolate. One hundred and seventy-three (78.6%) of the isolates were Gram positive
		"bacteria and included the following: Staphylococcus epidermidis (55.4%),"
		"Staphylococcus aureus (9.5%) of which 14% were methicillin resistant,"
		"Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) (4.5%), 40% of which were resistant to"
		penicillin and Enterococcus faecalis (4%). Gram negative bacteria were 44 (20%)
		and included Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (K.pneumoniae) (3.6%
		each). Three isolates (1.3%) were Candida glabrata. None of the Gram positive
		isolates were vancomycin resistant. Three K.pneumoniae and one Pseudomonas spp.
		isolates were multiresistant. One hundred and ninety-four (88%) of BSI isolates
		were hospital acquired. Fever was the most common presentation of pediatric
		patients (26%) with positive blood culture with no apparent focus of infection.
		Respiratory tract infections 26 (12%) were the next most common. We seen sepsis
		"in (7.7%) children between 8 days and 6 months of age. Bone and joint infections,"
		"cardiac, renal, gastrointestinal diseases, malignancy and surgical cases were"
		other associated clinical diagnoses of BSI in pediatric patients. Patients with
		"immuno- suppressive disorders with BSI had isolates such as Salmonella spp., S."
		pneumoniae and Pseudomonas spp. Overall mortality was 13 (6%) (p<0.005) and those
		patients had underlying serious medical conditions with associated risk factors
		"such as prolonged hospital stay, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, indwelling"
		"catheterization, mechanical ventilation and prior antimicrobial use. CONCLUSION:"
		Bloodstream infection is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in
		pediatric patients. Risk factors for hospital acquired infection include:
		"prematurity, prolonged hospitalization, ICU admission, indwelling"
		"catheterization, mechanical ventilation and prior antimicrobial therapy."

AB	-	Candida infection among multiple sclerosis (MS) patients has not been studied in
		depth. We determined whether there is an association between serological evidence
		of Candida infection and MS. Blood specimens were obtained from 80 MS patients
		and 240 matched controls. Immunofluorescence analysis and ELISA were used to
		detect Candida species antibodies and slot-blot to detect antigens. Using
		"immunofluorescence analysis, moderate to high concentrations of serum antibodies"
		to Candida famata were present in 30 (37.5%) MS patients vs. 30 (12.5%) controls
		(p < 0.001). Results for Candida albicans were 47.5% (38/80) in MS patients vs.
		"21.3% (51/240) in controls (p < 0.001), for Candida parapsilosis 37% (28/80) vs."

		"(42/240) (p < 0.001), respectively. After adjusting for age and gender, the odds"
		"ratios (95% confidence intervals) for MS, according to the presence of Candida"
		"antigens were: 2.8 (0.3-23.1, p = 0.337) for Candida famata; 1.5 (0.7-3.4, p ="
		"0.290) for Candida albicans; 7.3 (3.2-16.6, p < 0.001) for Candida parapsilosis;"
		"and 3.0 (1.5-6.1, p = 0.002) for Candida glabrata. The results were similar after"
		excluding ten patients on immunosuppressants. The results of this single study
		suggest that Candida species infection may be associated with increased odds of
		MS.

		candidemia: retrospective case-control analysis of 491 episodes of Candida
		species bloodstream infections.
PG	-	2859-65
AB	-	BACKGROUND: The efficacy and feasibility of donor granulocyte transfusion therapy
		(GTX) have changed considerably over the past four decades. The authors sought to
		determine the impact of high-dose (approximately 5.5 x 10(10) cells) GTX in
		patients with candidemia. METHODS: The authors' case-control retrospective
		analysis comprised 491 consecutive patients treated at The University of Texas M.
		"D. Anderson Cancer Center (Houston,TX) from 1993 to 2000. The cohort included 29"
		patients with Candida species bloodstream infection who had received GTX and 462
		"who had not. RESULTS: Both groups were comparable in age, gender, APACHE II"
		"score, recent chemotherapy received, broad-spectrum antibiotics, systemic"
		"corticosteroids, radiotherapy, intravascular catheter, and concordant antifungal"
		therapy (P > or = 0.1). The patients who received GTX compared with those who did
		"not had a higher incidence of underlying leukemia (86% vs. 29%, P <0.001),"
		"persistent neutropenia (59% vs. 18%, P <0.001), non-Candida albicans candidemia"
		"(Candida glabrata, 35%; Candida krusei, 31%: 90% vs. 67%, P=0.01), and"
		"breakthrough invasive mycosis (62% vs. 23%, P <0.001). Neutropenia was more"
		"prolonged in patients who received GTX (28 vs. 10 days, P <0.001). Also, more of"
		the patients who received GTX had received hematopoietic stem cell
		"transplantations (28% vs. 13%, P = 0.03), exposure (within 4 weeks) to"
		"antifungals (79% vs. 38%, P <0.001), and stays in critical care units (62% vs."
		"40%, P=0.02). The overall attributable mortality rate for 25 evaluable recipients"
		"of GTX was 48% (n=12), compared with 45% (n=115) of 254 evaluable patients in the"
		"control group (P=0.5). Of the 158 patients with leukemia, 25 (16%) had received"
		"GTX. In patients with leukemia, more of those who had received GTX experienced"
		disseminated candidiasis (44% vs. 26%; P <0.07) and persistent neutropenia (68%
		"vs. 43%, P <0.02), had candidemia that was more prolonged (> 72 hours, P <0.02),"
		"and had more stays in critical care units (68% vs. 44%, P <0.03). On the bases of"
		"a reduced multivariate model, a significantly increased risk of death was found"
		for patients with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (odds ratio [OR]=2.51;
		"95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.99-6.31; P <0.05), for patients with"
		"persistent neutropenia (OR=4.57; 95% CI, 1.99-10.47; P <0.0003), and for patients"
		"with leukemia who also had prolonged candidemia (OR=3.59; 95% CI, 1.61-7.98; P"
		"<0.002), disseminated candidiasis (OR=5.19; 95% CI, 2.17-12.42; P <0.0002), or"
		"non-C. albicans candidemia (OR=5.02; 95% CI, 1.07-23.64; P <0.04). In patients"
		"with leukemia, death was attributable to candidemia in 50% of the GTX recipients,"
		compared with 59% of the non-GTX patients who had received antifungal therapy

		"increased mortality, high-dose GTX therapy in these high-risk patients with"

		Keratoplasty.
PG	-	e93-6
LID	-	10.1097/OPX.0000000000000565 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: Fungal interface keratitis by Candida species can occur several weeks to
		"several months after deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK). Here, we report"
		a case of early-onset fungal interface keratitis by Candida glabrata after DALK.
		CASE REPORT: A 31-year-old Chinese man complained of decreased vision 4 days
		after an uneventful DALK for keratoconus. White to cream-colored interface
		deposits were identified under slit-lamp examination. The confocal scan disclosed
		"clusters of hyperreflective granular deposits of 2 to 4 μm at the interface,"
		without evidence of inflammation or hyphae-like structures. The graft was then
		"removed, along with interface irrigation, and another graft was sutured. Finally,"
		a penetrating keratoplasty was performed because the interface opacities recurred
		and deteriorated after graft replacement. Histopathological examination disclosed
		yeast-like structures at the retrocorneal side. The microbiologic results of both
		corneal scrapings taken from the recipient stromal bed and the removed half
		cornea button showed C. glabrata. CONCLUSIONS: Candida glabrata interface
		"keratitis can occur early after DALK, which can only be effectively treated with"
		penetrating keratoplasty. Confocal microscopy is a promising tool to diagnose
		this rare complication. The importance of donor corneoscleral rim cultures should
		be emphasized during DALK.

		by Candida species].
PG	-	637-48
AB	-	Nosocomial infections due to candida species are increasingly gaining importance.
		"In this study, we aimed to determine the risk factors associated with nosocomial"
		candida infections and also to determine the species and antifungal sensitivity
		of candida strains. Candida spp. strains isolated from the clinical specimens of
		92 patients who were hospitalized in Ankara Research and Training Hospital
		between May 2008 and September 2009 were prospectively included in the study. The
		"demographic features, clinical and laboratory findings of the patients were"
		recorded. Identification and antifungal sensitivities of the candida species were
		"determined by VITEC 2 Compact System (BioMeriéux, France). Invasive candida"
		infection was determined in 79 (85.9%) and candida colonization was found in 13
		(14.1%) of the patients. Types of candida infections were as follows; urinary
		"tract infection in 57 (72.1%), candidemia in 26 (32.9%), surgical site infection"
		in 6 (7.5%) and intraabdominal infection in 3 (%3.8) patients. According to the
		"univariate analysis, being female gender, duration and rate of hospitalization in"
		"the intensive care unit, use of linezolid, prolonged duration of urinary"
		catheterization and total parenteral nutrition and the duration of central venous
		catheterization were found significantly higher in the urinary tract infection
		"group. In candidemia group, carbapenem use, rates and periods of central venous"
		catheterization and total parenteral nutrition were detected higher which were
		statistically significant. In multivariate analysis for urinary tract infections
		female gender (Odds ratio: 3; 95% CI: 1.25-7.17) and prolonged stay (p= 0.031) in
		intensive care unit; for candidemia use of total parenteral nutrition (OR: 16.25;
		95% CI: 2.07-127.35) were found as independent risk factors. A total of 114
		Candida spp. Strains were isolated from the clinical specimens. The most common
		"isolated species were C.albicans (n= 62, 54.4%), C.glabrata (n= 16, 14%) and"
		"C.tropicalis (n= 13, 11.4%). While the resistance rates of Candida spp. To"
		"fluconazole and flucytosine were 2.6% and 1.7% respectively, there was no"
		resistance to voriconazole. The rate of isolates with amphotericin B MIC values >
		"1 µg/ml was 4.4%. Consequently, the restricted use of central venous catheter and"
		shortening the length of stay in intensive care unit may prevent the development
		of invasive candida infections. The local surveillance of antifungal resistance
		in candida strains might aid to the decision of empirical antifungal therapy.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: Heightened interest in oral health has lead to an increase in patients
		"complaining of xerostomia, which is associated with various oral mucosal"
		"disorders. In this study, we investigated the relationship between Candida"
		species and oral mucosal disorders in patients with xerostomia. SUBJECTS AND
		METHODS: We evaluated whole salivary flow rate and presence of oral mucosal
		disorders in 48 patients with xerostomia and 15 healthy controls. The number of
		Candida species was measured as colony-forming units after propagation on
		selective medium. Identification of Candida at the species level was carried out
		by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism
		analysis. We then examined the relationship between Candida species and oral
		"mucosal symptoms. RESULTS: Compared with controls, patients with xerostomia"
		"exhibited significantly decreased whole salivary flow rate, increased rate of"
		"oral mucosal symptoms, and higher numbers of Candida. Salivary flow rate"
		negatively correlated with the number Candida. Among patients with oral
		"candidiasis, Candida albicans was isolated from the tongue mucosa and Candida"
		glabrata was isolated from the angle of the mouth. CONCLUSION: These results
		suggest that particular Candida species are involved in the pathogenesis of oral
		mucosal disorders in patients with xerostomia.

AB	-	PURPOSE: To report the successful medical management of a late-onset Descemet
		membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK)-related interface infection. METHODS: A
		case of DMEK endothelial keratoplasty-related infection treated with intrastromal
		antifungal injection was identified. The following information was collected:
		"demographic data, surgical indications, donor rim cultures, donor mate outcomes,"
		"clinical course, diagnostic tests, and clinical outcome. RESULTS: A DMEK patient"
		developed a single infiltrate approximately 1 month after uncomplicated DMEK.
		Donor rim culture was positive for Candida glabrata but no prophylactic treatment
		was initiated. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography confirmed the
		"location of the infiltrate, and the patient was treated with oral fluconazole and"
		"an intrastromal injection of amphotericin B with an inadvertent, but negligible,"
		intracameral volume of the same drug. The lesion significantly regressed on
		examination 2 days later with complete involution and excellent visual acuity to
		"date. CONCLUSIONS: Medical therapy, including systemic and intrastromal"
		"application, is a viable initial treatment option for late-onset, presumed yeast"
		interface keratitis in patients who have undergone DMEK.

PG	-	973-7
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To examine efficacy of itraconazole in the treatment of candidemia in
		critically ill children. METHODS: We studied retrospectively cases of candidemia
		seen consecutively in our Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) over three and
		"half years. Candida isolates from those patients included. Candida albicans--19,"
		"C. tropicalis--31, C. guillermondii--9, C.krusei--4 and C. glabrata--1. RESULTS:"
		"Of the 64 patients, 48 (75%) had symptoms suggestive of septicemia and 16 had no"
		symptoms suggestive of septicemia. No antifungal therapy was given to
		asymptomatic patients; they recovered from candidemia without development of any
		sequelae. Of the 48 symptomatic patients 11 died before results of fungal culture
		became available and antifungal therapy could be started. Thirty seven patients
		were treated with itraconazole (10 mg/kg/day orally or through gastric tube).
		"Seven (18.9 %) of 37 patients died, 3 within first week of antifungal therapy."
		Thirty (81%) patients recovered; microbiological cure was noted on average by day
		14 (range 4-30 days). The mean +/- SD duration of therapy in patients who
		responded was 24 +/-7 days (range 21-42 days). None had any major side effect.
		CONCLUSION: We conclude that oral itraconazole may be effective in treatment of
		candidemia in children in a PICU where non-C. albicans candida species
		constituted majority (70%) of all Candida isolates.

PG	-	382-5
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To conduct a retrospective analysis of the invasive fungal infection
		(IFI) in surgical intensive care unit (SICU). METHODS: The IFI data of the
		patients who were admitted in SICU during January 2003 to December 2008 was
		retrospectively analyzed. A total of 3743 patients were admitted into SICU. Among
		"them, 271 patient's SICU duration was more than 48 hours, who had fungi"
		"examination. RESULTS: Seventy-five patients were diagnosed IFI, the morbidity was"
		"2.00% (75/3743), the incidence of fungemia was 0.27% (10/3743), the mortality of"
		IFI patients was 49.33% (37/75). The morbidity rate of each year was almost the
		same. The mortality of 2007 and 2008 was higher than before (both P < 0.05).
		"Thirty-four of all the 75 IFI patients got urinary tract infected, 37 got fungal"
		"pneumonia, 10 got fungemia, 1 got catheter-related fungal infection, 2 got fungal"
		"infection in abdomen, 2 got biliary tract infected. Eighty-six fungi strains"
		which caused fungal infection were spotted. Candida albicans was the most common
		"isolate (46.51%). Other isolates were Candida glabrata (22.09%), Candida"
		"tropicalis (13.95%), Candida parapsilosis (8.14%), Candida krusei (3.49%),"
		"Trichosporon (4.65%), Aspergillus (1.16%). Assist ventilation, combination of"
		"bacterial infection, treatment by broad spectrum antibiotics or more than three"
		kinds of antibiotics were the most important risk factors of IFI in SICU.
		Prophylactic antifungal treatment may be useful. CONCLUSION: The morbidity of IFI
		"in our SICU was comparatively low, and the same of the incidence of fungemia. The"
		mortality of IFI patients was markedly high. The main sites of infection were
		"lung and urinary tract, and the pathogenic fungi strains were mostly Candidas."
		"Assist ventilation, combination of bacterial infection, broad spectrum"
		antibiotics treatment were the most important risk factors of IFI in SICU.

TI	-	Treatment of vaginitis caused by Candida glabrata: use of topical boric acid and
		flucytosine.
PG	-	1297-300
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to review the treatment outcome and
		safety of topical therapy with boric acid and flucytosine in women with Candida
		glabrata vaginitis. STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective review of case records
		"of 141 women with positive vaginal cultures of C glabrata at two sites, Wayne"
		State University School of Medicine and Ben Gurion University. RESULTS: The boric
		"acid regimen, 600 mg daily for 2 to 3 weeks, achieved clinical and mycologic"
		success in 47 of 73 symptomatic women (64%) in Detroit and 27 of 38 symptomatic
		women (71%) in Beer Sheba. No advantage was observed in extending therapy for 14
		to 21 days. Topical flucytosine cream administered nightly for 14 days was
		associated with a successful outcome in 27 of 30 of women (90%) whose condition
		had failed to respond to boric acid and azole therapy. Local side effects were
		uncommon with both regimens. CONCLUSIONS: Topical boric acid and flucytosine are
		useful additions to therapy for women with azole-refractory C glabrata vaginitis.

TI	-	Characterization of a parainfluenza virus isolated from a bottlenose dolphin
		(Tursiops truncatus).
PG	-	231-42
AB	-	A novel member of the parainfluenza virus family was identified in a bottlenose
		dolphin with respiratory disease. The case animal was a 19-year old male Atlantic
		bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) that presented with signs of respiratory
		"illness, including raspy, foul-odored breaths and cream-colored exudate from the"
		blowhole. Focally extensive pyogranulomatous bronchointerstitial pneumonia with
		moderate numbers of intralesional yeast organisms was identified on
		histopathological examination. Other significant microscopic findings included
		multifocal erosive and ulcerative tracheitis and laryngitis consisting of active
		laryngeal lymphatic tissue and dilated glands with eosinophilic fluid. The cause
		of death was attributed to respiratory disease of unknown etiology. In addition
		to the postmortem isolation of Candida glabrata and mixed bacteria from lung
		"tissue, a virus was isolated from two antemortem affected lung aspirates"
		collected over a 2-month period and two postmortem samples (mediastinal lymph
		node and left lung tissue homogenate). The morphology of the virions on negative
		staining and transmission electron microscopy was consistent with that of
		"paramyxoviruses. Two genomic fragments, comprising 532 and 419 nucleotides from"
		"the open reading frames that code for the viral polymerase and fusion protein,"
		"respectively, were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using degenerate"
		primers. Phylogenetic analyses of the two viral RNA segments showed that the
		"isolate comprised a novel virus strain, tentatively named T. truncatus"
		"parainfluenza virus type 1 (TtPIV-1). The virus is monophyletic with, but"
		"genetically distinct from, the various bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 strains."

TI	-	Secular trends of candidemia over 12 years in adult patients at a tertiary care
		hospital.
PG	-	425-33
AB	-	"The incidence of fungal infections has been increasing for the last 3 decades,"
		"especially among neutropenic, cancer, and critically ill patients. These"
		infections are associated with high mortality rates. We retrospectively reviewed
		medical charts of adult patients with fungemia from 1989 to 2000 at our
		institution. The characteristics of the population groups served by the hospital
		"were described. Of 328 patients with fungemia, we reviewed 315 (96%) medical"
		"records, and focused on those with candidemia (n = 294). The species distribution"
		in patients with candidemia showed that the most commonly identified species were
		"Candida albicans (66%), followed by C. glabrata (17%), and C. parapsilosis (6%)."
		"The incidence of candidemia ranged from 0.2 to 0.46 per 10,000 patient-days with"
		the highest incidence in 1993 and the lowest in 1997. Although most studies show
		"an increased incidence of candidemia, we observed a reduction over the study"
		"period. Furthermore, we observed no shift from C. albicans to non-albicans"
		Candida species despite a significant increase in the use of fluconazole. The
		"overall mortality among patients with candidemia was 44%, with the highest rate"
		in patients over 65 years (52%). Factors independently associated with higher
		"mortality were patient age greater than 65 years, intensive care unit admission,"
		and underlying cancer.

		in Beijing].
PG	-	1970-3
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the epidemiological characteristics of invasive
		nosocomial candidiasis in teaching hospitals in Beijing. METHODS: The clinical
		data of consecutive cases diagnosed as with nosocomial candidiasis hospitalized
		in Beijing Chaoyang Hospital (CYH) (n=43) and Peking Union Medical College
		Hospital (PUMCH) (n=34) from January 2004 to September 2006 were retrospectively
		"analyzed to evaluate the incidence and mortality, and the relationship between"
		antifungal therapy and outcomes. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for
		Candida spp were determined by microdilution method. RESULTS: The incidence rates
		of nosocomial candidiasis of CYH and PUMCH were 0.053% and 0.025% respectively in
		"2004, and increased to 0.074% and 0.049% respectively in 2006. Candidemia"
		"accounted for 55.8% (43/77) of the Candida infection, followed by intra-abdominal"
		"infection (26.0%, n=20), intra-thoracic infection (9.1%, n=7), and biliary tract"
		"infection (7.8%, n=6). The species mostly frequently isolated were Candida"
		"albicans (57.1%), followed by C. tropicalis (19.5%), C. glabrata (14.3%), and C."
		"parasitosis (2.6%). The susceptibility rates of C. albicans, C. tropicalis, C."
		"glabrata, and C. parasitosis to fluconazole were 97.7%, 86.7%, 63.6%, and 100%"
		respectively. No isolates were resistant to amphotericin B. The crude mortality
		rate of Candida infection was 37.7%. The mortality rate of the candidemia
		"patients who did not receive systemic antifungal therapy was 72.7%, significantly"
		"higher than those who received antifungal therapy (37.5%, P = 0.043). Most"
		patients received fluconazole as the first choice (91.7% in PUMCH and 79.2% in
		CYH) with the survival rates of 63.6% and 52.6% respectively. Conclusion With
		"high morbidity and mortality, invasive nosocomial candidiasis is a big problem in"
		teaching hospitals. Further investigation is necessary to evaluate the incidence
		and to identify which antifungal agents are most protective for candidiasis.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: In recent decades, there has been an increase in the survival of"
		recipients of solid organ transplants related to the improvement of the surgical
		"technique, the introduction of protocols for immunosuppressive therapy, and the"

		currently the major cause of morbidity and mortality in this group of patients.
		Invasive candidiasis is the most common IFI found after renal transplantation and
		"is usually associated with total parenteral nutrition, broad-spectrum antibiotic"
		therapy and abdominal surgery. CLINICAL CASE: We report the case of a recent
		kidney-pancreas transplant recipient who developed a persistent catheter-related
		candidemia caused by Candida glabrata. The patient was treated with anidulafungin
		and had a good clinical course with no significant drug interactions. We discuss
		the possible causes and diagnostic and therapeutic alternatives of this kind of

		"hospitalized patients in USA. In tissue C. glabrata present as yeasts, 3-5"
		"microns in size, which are difficult to visualize on H&E stained slides but can"
		be detected on Grocott methenamine silver (GMS) stained slides. The presence of

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Patients with severe coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) are
		susceptible to superimposed infections. OBJECTIVES: To describe COVID-19 patients
		who presented with complications due to Candida bloodstream co-infection
		(candidemia) and their outcome in a single center in northern Israel (Emek
		Medical Center) during the second outbreak of COVID-19 in Israel (15 June 2020 to
		20 September 2020). METHODS: A retrospective study of COVID-19 patients
		"presenting with candidemia was conducted, including clinical and laboratory data."
		The incidence of candidemia among hospitalized COVID-19 patients was compared to
		a historical cohort of non-COVID-19 controls. RESULTS: Three COVID-19 patients
		complicated with candidemia were documented. All three patients died shortly
		after the detection of candidemia. Three different Candida sp. were isolated from
		"the blood cultures: C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, and C. glabrata. The incidence"
		of candidemia among COVID-19 patients was 0.679 episodes per 1000 hospital days.
		CONCLUSIONS: Our small sample suggests a much higher incidence of candidemia
		among COVID-19 patients compared to a historical cohort of non-COVID-19 controls.
		All clinicians treating COVID-19 patients in GICU should be aware of this
		complication.

PG	-	476-80
AB	-	A 72-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of a low grade fever and
		malaise. He had received a middle to lower esophagectomy and proximal gastrectomy
		with reconstruction of a gastric conduit for esophageal cancer 12 years
		previously. Chest X-ray and CT scan revealed massive pleural effusion and
		consolidations on the right side. Candida glabrata was isolated 4 times from
		pleural fluid specimens. Candida antigen was negative in both serum and pleural
		"effusion. However, while serum beta-D-glucan was negative, the level of"
		"beta-D-glucan in pleural effusion was extremely elevated. Thus, the patient was"
		diagnosed as having C. glabrata empyema. He was treated with insertion of a
		thoracostomy tube followed by intrapleural instillation of amphotericin B and
		intravenous administration of micafungin. Pleural effusion was reduced and the
		repeated culture of the pleural effusion became negative after 27 days of
		treatment. Empyema with C. glabrata is rare and the present case is the second
		report of the disease in the Japanese literature.

AB	-	We present the rare case of a 76-year-old female with infective endocarditis (IE)
		"caused by Candida glabrata. Immediately before developing the present infection,"
		"she developed IE with vegetation on the mitral annular calcification, which was"
		caused by Streptococcus mitis and successfully treated with penicillin-G and
		"gentamicin. However, her fever recurred, and she developed disseminated"
		"intravascular coagulation. Blood culture revealed C. glabrata, and"
		echocardiography revealed new vegetation on the mitral valve. After 4 weeks of
		"treatment with micafungin, prosthetic valve replacement was performed, followed"
		by additional administration of micafungin for 4 weeks (total of 8 weeks). No
		relapse at 9 months after surgery has been observed. C. glabrata endocarditis is
		extremely rare and difficult to manage. Our case and review of past reported
		cases suggest that early diagnosis and initiation of treatment contribute to good
		prognosis of C. glabrata endocarditis.

AB	-	WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Anidulafugin is an echinocandin used for the
		treatment of candida infections in non-neutropenic adults. Echinocandins show few
		drug-drug interactions and are usually well tolerated. We report a case of acute
		"hypotension, bradycardia and haemodynamic instability with consecutive"
		cardiopulmonary resuscitation during anidulafungin administration. CASE SUMMARY:
		A 41-year-old man ICU patient received anidulafungin for a suspected Candida
		"glabrata infection. During the first administration of the drug, he developed"
		acute haemodynamic instability with hypotension and bradycardia. The infusion was
		discontinued immediately and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed
		successfully. The patient regained haemodynamic stability. WHAT IS NEW AND
		"CONCLUSION: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of a"
		life-threatening adverse event due to haemodynamic instability during
		anidulafungin administration. Cardiac toxicity associated with echinocandins has
		been described. Further studies seem to be mandatory to investigate this
		potential risk.

TI	-	[Epidemiology of candidemia: results of a one month French hospitals-based
		surveillance study in 2004].
PG	-	523-30
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: The aim of our study was to determinate the frequency of
		"candidemia, the species encountered and their susceptibility to antifungal agents"
		"in French hospitals in 2004. METHODS: A prospective survey of septicaemia,"
		including candidaemia was conducted among 193 non teaching French hospitals
		during October 2004. All bloodstream infections were reported and the bloodstream
		isolates sent to two coordinating centers. Species identification and
		"susceptibility were performed by biologists as usual, and further confirmed by"
		"use of alternative methods, including Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC)"
		"determination. RESULTS: The survey was effective in 93 hospitals, where 2013"
		"bloodstream infections were noticed, including 46 candidaemia (2.3%). Candida sp."
		"Is the 7th pathogen responsible for bloodstream infection, without concern of the"
		origin of the infection. Candidaemia was hospital acquired in 80.4% of cases
		(N=37/46). Candidaemia represents 0.7% (N=9/1211) of community-acquired
		"bloodstream infections but 4.5% (N=37/802) of nosocomial cases, placing Candida"
		sp. at the 5th row of frequency in this last group. No mistakes were noticed
		"during identification, but two strains were not named. After confirmation of"
		"identification, species are distributed as follows: 23 C.albicans (50%), 13"
		"C.glabrata (28.3%), 5 C.tropicalis (10.9%), 3 C.parapsilosis (6.5%), 1 C.krusei"
		"(2.2%), and 1 C.kefyr (2.2%). The overall susceptibility is 97.7% for"
		"amphotericin B, 93.2% for 5-fluorocytosin, 88.6% for fluconazole, 70.5% for"
		"itraconazole, 95.5% for voriconzole and 100% of strains had very low MIC for"
		"caspofungin. Concerning the two main species isolated, 95.5% of C.albicans"
		"strains remain susceptible to fluconazole, but only 69% of C.glabrata strains."
		"Two strains, 1 C.albicans and 1 C.glabrata exhibit cross resistance to azoles."
		"The majority of amphotericin, fluconazole, and itraconazole decreased"
		"susceptibility strains are found into C.glabrata strains, but susceptibility to"
		5-fluorocytosin and very low MCI to caspofungin remained in this species.
		CONCLUSION: Our survey allowed us to get data from French non-teaching hospitals
		in 2004 about frequency of candidaemia among septicaemia. Candida species
		distribution and in vitro susceptibility patterns of the strains isolated.
		"Candidaemia is not a rare event, specially when septicaemia is nosocomially"
		acquired. C.albicans is the main species isolated and remains highly in vitro
		susceptible to antifungals. One important feature is the frequency of C.glabrata
		"in our survey. Considering its decreased susceptibility to azoles, this finding"
		confirms the need for rapid identification of yeast isolated from bloodstream
		"samples, and antifungal susceptibility testing each time it is available."

TI	-	Longitudinal 10-year prospective survey of fungaemia in Slovak Republic: trends
		in etiology in 310 episodes. Slovak Fungaemia study group.
PG	-	11-Jul
AB	-	"A 10-year prospective survey of fungaemia in the Slovak Republic, involving 31"
		"microbiology laboratories and 71 hospitals, was conducted from 1989-1998 (10"
		"years): 310 fungaemias were analyzed for etiology, clinical characteristics,"
		"therapy, and outcome. C. albicans was responsible for 191 (61.6%) fungaemias,"
		"non-albicans Candida spp. (NAC) for 97 (31.3%), non-Candida yeasts for 18 (5.8%)"
		and moulds (Fulsarium spp.) for four fungaemias. The most frequent NAC isolated
		"from blood cultures were C. parapsilosis--30 (9.7%), C. krusei--18 (5.8%), C."
		"tropicalis--14 (4.5%), and C. glabrata--10 (3.2%). Secular trends in etiology"
		showed a sustaining decrease of C. albicans (from 100% in 1989 to 50.7% in 1998)
		and increase of NAC (from 0% in 1989-1990 to 46.3% in 1998). Non-Candida yeasts
		and moulds showed a stable proportion during the investigated period. There were
		statistically significant differences in etiology of fungaemia various subgroups
		of patients: non-albicans Candida spp. was significantly more frequent observed
		"among subgroups of patients with pancreatitis and coma (53.3% vs. 31.3%, p < or ="
		"0.02) and less frequently in the subgroup of neonates (15.0% vs. 31.3%, p < or ="
		"0.006). Vice versa, C. albicans appeared more frequently in neonates (85%)."

AB	-	"Based on favorable results from randomized clinical trials, oral posaconazole has"
		been approved for prophylaxis in neutropenic patients and stem cell
		"transplantation (SCT) recipients. However, routine use of a prophylactic drug may"
		yield different results than those from clinical trials. We collected data on the
		"efficacy, safety, breakthrough infections, and antimicrobial resistance"
		associated with standard long-term posaconazole prophylaxis in adult allogeneic
		SCT recipients at the UCLA Medical Center. Oral posaconazole (200 mg 3 times
		"daily) was started on day 1 after SCT and continued until day 100. After day 100,"
		posaconazole was continued in patients who still required corticosteroids for
		prevention or treatment of graft-versus-host disease. From January 2007 through
		"December 2008, 106 consecutive patients received prophylactic posaconazole."
		Breakthrough invasive fungal infections on posaconazole occurred in 8 patients
		(7.5%) within 6 months after SCT; 3 additional patients developed invasive fungal
		infection after discontinuation of prophylactic posaconazole. The infective
		"organisms were Candida (8 cases), Aspergillus (2 cases), and Aspergillus plus"
		Coccidioides immitis (1 case). There were no Zygomycetes infections. Only 2 (both
		Candida glabrata) of 9 infecting isolates tested were resistant to posaconazole
		(minimal inhibitory concentration >1 μg/mL). Mortality from invasive fungal
		"infection occurred in 4 patients (3.7%). Except for nausea in 9 patients, no"
		clinical adverse event or laboratory abnormality could be attributed to
		posaconazole. Mean peak and trough plasma posaconazole concentrations were
		relatively low (<400 ng/mL) in neutropenic patients with oral mucositis and other
		factors possibly affecting optimal absorption of posaconazole. These results
		demonstrate that standard long-term oral posaconazole prophylaxis after
		"allogeneic SCT is safe and associated with few invasive mold infections. However,"
		breakthrough infections caused by posaconazole-susceptible organisms (frequently
		"Candida) may occur at currently recommended prophylactic doses. Thus, strategies"
		"to improve posaconazole exposure, including the use of higher doses,"
		"administration with an acidic beverage, and restriction of proton pump"
		"inhibitors, need to be considered when using prophylactic posaconazole."

TI	-	Caspofungin in the treatment of symptomatic candiduria.
PG	-	e46-9
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Because the urine concentrations achieved by echinocandin antifungal
		"agents are low, drugs from this class are excluded from consideration when"
		candiduria treatment is selected. METHODS: We performed a retrospective view
		(sponsored by Merck Research Laboratories) of case records of patients
		participating in phase II-III clinical studies of caspofungin to identify
		patients with candiduria. RESULTS: Of 12 case records collected by Merck Research
		"Laboratories, 6 met the criteria for significant candiduria, allowing the"
		evaluation of caspofungin therapy as judged by J.D.S. Three reported cases of
		candiduria secondary to hematogenous renal candidiasis were promptly eradicated.
		"Of greater significance are 3 cases of complicated, ascending Candida glabrata"
		"infection (i.e., C. glabrata infection plus renal insufficiency), which were"
		successfully treated with caspofungin. CONCLUSIONS: Caspofungin may have a role
		"in treating complicated Candida urinary tract infections, especially when the"
		infection is caused by non-albicans species of Candida.

		the Candida species involved and the antifungal susceptibility of Candida species
		isolated from patients with VVC. METHODS: Candida organisms were cultured from
		samples obtained from patients who presented with VVC to the Gynecology
		"Department, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital. Antifungal susceptibility"
		testing was performed using a commercial agar diffusion test. RESULTS: Of the
		"1,070 cases of VVC reported in this study, 36.5% were uncomplicated VVC, and"
		63.5% were complicated VVC. Twenty-four patients were identified as having two
		species of Candida. Candid albicans alone was isolated from 89.5% of cases (n =
		"958). Candida glabrata was isolated from 85 cases (7.9%), Candida tropicalis from"
		"10 (0.9%), Saccharomyces cerevisiae from eight (0.7%), Candida parapsilosis from"
		"six (0.6%), Candida famata from two (0.2%), and Candida krusei from one case"
		(0.1%). All isolates of Candida albicans were susceptible to nystatin. The
		resistant rate of Candida albicans to azole agents was 0-4.9%. CONCLUSION:
		Candida albicans was the predominant Candida species isolated from this series of
		patients with VVC. Resistance of vaginal Candida albicans isolates to antifungal
		agents was infrequent.

PG	-	1129-34
AB	-	"Autologous peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC), for transplantation following"
		"high-dose chemotherapy, are collected using regimens containing cytokines with or"
		without chemotherapy. The added period of neutropenia prior to stem cell
		transplantation (SCT) in patients receiving chemotherapy mobilization may
		increase the risk of infections following transplantation. We studied the
		incidence of culture-positive infections in 107 consecutive patients who were
		"divided into three groups, according to whether they experienced extended"
		neutropenia during chemotherapy for stem cell mobilization as well as post
		autotransplant. All the patients received antibiotic prophylaxis and
		hematopoietic growth factors during neutropenia. The total duration of
		pre-transplant neutropenia differed among the three mobilization schemes (growth
		factors alone; one cycle; or two cycles of chemotherapy plus growth factor for
		"mobilization) at 0, 6 and 18 days, respectively (median). However the"
		post-autograft time to myeloid engraftment was similar at 10 days (median). The
		incidence of culture-proven infections in all three groups was similar. Using
		"fluconazole for yeast prophylaxis, 40% patients developed gastrointestinal"
		"colonization with yeast, and the majority of speciated isolates were Candida"
		glabrata. Bacteremia developed in 22% and 9% of patients with S. epidermidis and
		"Gram-negative organisms, respectively, while 11% developed C."
		"difficile-associated diarrhea. In conclusion, treatment using none, one or two"
		cycles of mobilizing chemotherapy pre-transplant does not influence the overall
		"incidence of infections among autologous SCT recipients. However, although"
		"post-transplant neutropenia is brief, infections remain a significant cause of"
		morbidity.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To report the occurrence of Candida glabrata chorioamnionitis
		complicating an in vitro fertilization (IVF) pregnancy. DESIGN: Case report.
		"SETTING: University hospital. PATIENT(S): A 30-year-old woman, primagravida, with"
		an IVF dichorionic-diamniotic pregnancy who presented at 15 weeks with vaginal
		"bleeding. INTERVENTION(S): Before embryo transfer in next IVF cycle, vaginal"
		"culture from the patient revealed colonization with C. glabrata, which was"
		treated with boric acid. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Subsequent pregnancy after
		eradication of fungal organisms. RESULT(S): The patient's first pregnancy was
		"treated with indomethacin and broad-spectrum antibiotics, but her membranes"
		"ruptured, and she delivered both twins at 16 weeks; the autopsy and pathology"
		reports were consistent with C. glabrata chorioamnionitis. After boric acid
		"treatment eradicated the organisms, two embryos were transferred in subsequent"
		"IVF treatment; the second pregnancy was uncomplicated, with"
		"dichorionic-diamniotic twins, delivered by cesarean section at 38 weeks."
		CONCLUSION(S): Eradication of vaginal colonization with C. glabrata may prevent
		infection of the next IVF pregnancy.

PG	-	318-24
AB	-	"Urinary system infections are usually bacterial, however, fungal etiology,"
		particularly Candida spp. are encountered in about 10% of these infections.
		C.albicans is still the most frequently isolated species in candiduria. This
		study was aimed to identify the risk factors of candiduria and to determine
		species distribution of Candida which cause candiduria in hospitalized patients.
		"The study was carried out in a total of 93 hospitalized patients (68 female, 25"
		"male; age range: 17-84 yrs, mean age: 59.5 ± 1.7 yrs) of which 50 presented with"
		"candiduria (case group) and 43 with bacteriuria (control group), between January"
		2009 to December 2009. The most frequently isolated species was C.albicans (n=
		"32; 64%), followed by C.glabrata (n= 13; 26%), C.tropicalis (n= 4; 8%) and"
		"C.krusei (n= 1; 2%). All of the isolates except one, were found susceptible to"
		"fluconazole and voriconazole by E-test (AB Biodisk, Sweden), however, C.krusei"
		isolate was resistant to fluconazole and susceptible to voriconazole. The mean
		hospitalization period and the period of stay in intensive care unit (ICU) of the
		"case group (9.56 ± 9.09 and 4.12 ± 7.05 days, respectively) were found"
		"statistically significant compared to control group (4.42 ± 3.71 and 0.53 ± 1.78,"
		respectively) (p< 0.005). Nosocomial origin of infection was higher in control
		"group (n= 45, 90%) than the case group (n= 30, 69.8%), (p= 0.014). The rate of"
		antibiotic use prior to candiduria in the case group was detected significantly
		higher (n= 43; 86%) than the controls (n= 14; 32.6%) (p= 0.000). The most
		frequently used antibiotic prior to candiduria/bacteriuria was the quinolone
		"group of agents both in case and control groups (42% and 21%, respectively). The"
		other risk factors for candiduria found to be higher in the case group than the
		"controls were as follows; presence of urinary system intervention (32% and 0,"
		"respectively; p= 0.000), catheter use (76% and 46.5%, respectively; p= 0.003) and"
		"immunosuppression history (24% and 9.3%, respectively; p= 0.041). However, there"
		was no significant relationship between candiduria and history of surgical
		"intervention, diabetes mellitus and renal failure (p> 0.05). In conclusion, rate"
		"of candiduria might be reduced by judicious antibiotic use, by implementation of"
		"guidelines for urinary catheter use, care and maintenance, and shortening the"
		duration of ICU and hospital stay.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: The epidemiology of candidemia vary by region. AIM: To determine the
		epidemiology of candidemia in a hospital for 16 years. MATERIAL AND METHODS:
		Episodes of candidemia occurred in the Hospital de Clinicas of Buenos Aires were
		"reviewed, from 01/01/98 to 31/12/13. RESULTS: 374 episodes of candidemia were"
		"identified. The incidence was 2.21/1,000 discharges and increased from 1.96"
		(1998-2005) to 2.25 (2006-2013) (p = 0.023). Candidemia was diagnosed: 5.4% in
		"neonates, 1.7% in infants, 6.5% in children, 31.8% in adults and 52.7% in elderly"
		"adults over 64 years old. The episodes were caused by C. albicans (40.9%), C."
		"parapsilosis (21.7%), C. tropicalis (15.5%), C. glabrata (13.9%), other species"
		of Candida (5.1%) and more than one species of Candida (2.9%). The 5.3% of the
		isolates were resistant to fluconazole. 74% of patients were treated. Initial
		"treatments were with fluconazole (70.3%), amphotericin B deoxycholate (25%),"
		"echinocandins or lipidic amphotericin (4,7%). The 81% of central venous catheters"
		"were taken off. Mortality rate was of 47.9%, but in the elderly adults was of"
		60.8%. CONCLUSION: The incidence of candidemia showed an increase over the years.
		"It was higher in the elderly adults, being the group with worse outcomes."

PG	-	15-20
AB	-	A forty-eight-year old male diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia was further
		complicated by Candida krusei fungemia despite introduction of fluconazole
		prophylaxis during antileukemic therapy. The fungemia subsided after intravenous
		amphotericin B therapy followed by itraconazole therapy. Multiple ulcerative
		"lesions and a carcinoid lesion were observed in the transverse colon, and it was"
		thought that the C. krusei had invaded from the ulcerative lesions. Azole
		"antifungal agents, especially fluconazole, have frequently been used for therapy"
		and the prophylaxis of fungal infections. Though infections due to
		"fluconazole-resistant Candida species such as C. krusei are a growing problem, in"
		the hematology division of our hospital there is no evidence of an increasing
		incidence of C. krusei fungemia or an increasing rate of C. krusei in
		"surveillance culture from admitted patients. However, future increases in"
		infections due to fluconazole-resistant Candida species like C. krusei and C.
		"glabrata are entirely possible, making it necessary to identify isolated fungi,"
		"perform susceptibility tests on antifungal agents against isolates, measure the"
		"serum concentrations of antifungal agents, and then to treat patients with the"
		appropriate therapies.

PG	-	107-12
AB	-	The importance of epidemiological monitoring of yeasts involved in pathologic
		processes is unquestionable due to the increase of these infections over the last
		"decade, the changes observed in species causing candidiasis, and empirical"
		"antifungal treatment. At the Mycology Center, 1006 isolates from a wide range of"
		clinical samples were studied during 1999-2001. Candida albicans (40.3%) was the
		"most isolated species, although, the Candida no albicans species with 54.9%"
		"showed the major prevalence. In blood cultures Candida parapsilosis (34.9%), C."
		albicans (30.2%) and C. tropicalis (25.6%) were recovered most frequently while
		C. glabrata represented only 2.3%. C. albicans with 60%-80% was the predominant
		"specie in mucosal surface. We also detected Candida mediastinistis, which alert"
		us over the importance at this location. Urinary tract infections caused by
		"yeasts were more frequent in hospitalized patients, being C. albicans (47.7%),"
		"the most commonly isolated, followed by C. glabrata (24.8%) and C. tropicalis"
		"(20.0%). In the candidal onychomycoses, C. parapsilosis (37.7%) outplaced C."
		albicans (22.0%). Fluconazole susceptibility studies of Candida species allowed
		"us to conclude that the majority of C. albicans islolates are susceptible, and"
		that the highest resistance averages were observed in C. glabrata (21.41%) and C.
		krusei (69.23%).

TI	-	Changes in the spectrum of fungal isolates: results from clinical specimens
		gathered in 1987/88 compared with those in 1991/92 in the University Hospital
		"Göttingen, Germany."
PG	-	247-53
AB	-	"In the University Hospital in Göttingen, the spectra of fungal species in"
		"clinical specimens of respiratory secretions, bronchial secretions and urine were"
		compared over periods of 15 months (10/87 to 12/88 and 1/91 to 3/92) before and
		after the introduction of fluconazole. The following changes could be
		demonstrated: 1. In all specimens analysed the number of Candida albicans
		"isolates decreased, while the number of Candida tropicalis isolates remained"
		almost unchanged. 2. During the observation period the number of Candida glabrata
		isolates doubled. In 1991 C. glabrata was second to C. albicans as the most
		"common of all fungal isolates, appearing in 8.6% of all specimens. 3. The total"
		"number of Candida krusei isolates increased only slightly, but the rise in the"
		number of isolates in bronchial secretions was statistically significant. 4. The
		"prevalence of rarely isolated Candida yeasts, such as Candida guilliermondii,"
		"Candida lipolytica and Candida kefyr, and Candida isolates which were not further"
		differentiated increased. 5. During the observation period the number of mixed
		cultures showed a fourfold increase. C. glabrata and C. krusei were associated in
		more than 75% of all isolates with C. albicans or C. tropicalis respectively. 6.
		The number of mould isolates increased. These changes in the spectra of fungal
		isolates are discussed with respect to the broad therapeutic and prophylactic
		usage of fluconazole in the University Hospital of Göttingen.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infections are a frequent ailment in patients in
		intensive care units. Candida and other yeasts cause 5-12% of these infections.
		"The value of the finding of any yeast is controversial, and there is no consensus"
		about which parameters are adequate for differentiating urinary infections from
		colonization or contamination. AIMS: To analyse the epidemiological
		"characteristics of patients with funguria, to determine potential cut-off points"
		"in cultures (to distinguish an infection from other conditions), to identify the"
		"prevalent yeast species, and to determine the value of a second urine sample."
		METHODS: A multicentre study was conducted in intensive care units of 14
		hospitals in the Buenos Aires City Mycology Network. The first and second samples
		of urine from every patient were cultured. The presence of white cells and yeasts
		"in direct examination, colony counts, and the identification of the isolated"
		"species, were evaluated. RESULTS: Yeasts grew in 12.2% of the samples. There was"
		no statistical correlation between the number of white cells and the fungal
		colony-forming units. Eighty five percent of the patients had indwelling
		catheters. Funguria was not prevalent in women or in patients over the age of 65.
		"Candida albicans, followed by Candida tropicalis, were the most frequently"
		isolated yeasts. Candida parapsilosis and Candida glabrata appeared less
		"frequently. The same species were isolated in 70% of second samples, and in 23%"
		of the cases the second culture was negative. CONCLUSIONS: It was not possible to
		determine a useful cut-off point for colony counts to help in the diagnosis of
		"urinary infections. As in other publications, C. albicans, followed by C."
		"tropicalis, were the most prevalent species."

TI	-	Nosocomial candidemia in non-neutropenic patients at an Italian tertiary care
		hospital.
PG	-	602-7
AB	-	"In a retrospective study conducted in an Italian tertiary care hospital, the"
		incidence of nosocomial candidemia was evaluated together with causative
		"pathogens, treatment, and risk factors for death. Over a 6-year period"
		"(1992-1997), a total of 189 episodes of candidemia occurred in 189 patients (mean"
		"age 58+/-19 years), accounting for an average incidence of 1.14 episodes per"
		"10,000 patient-days per year. The most common reasons for hospitalization were"
		"solid neoplasia (21%), trauma (17%), abdominal diseases requiring surgery (13%),"
		and cardiovascular diseases (13%). No patient was neutropenic within 3 weeks
		prior to the onset of candidemia. One hundred thirty patients were hospitalized
		"in intensive care units, 47 patients in surgical wards, and 12 patients in"
		"medical wards. Candida albicans was the most frequently isolated pathogen,"
		"accounting for 54% of fungal isolates, followed by Candida parapsilosis (23%),"
		"Candida glabrata (7%), Candida tropicalis (5%), Candida pelliculosa (4%), Candida"
		"lusitaniae (1%), Candida humicula (1%), and other non-albicans Candida spp. (5%)."
		Seventy-six (41%) patients received adequate antifungal therapy. Seventy-one
		(58%) of the 123 evaluable patients with central venous catheters underwent line
		removal; 51 of them had catheter-related candidemia. The 30-day crude mortality
		"rate was 45%. Older age, hospitalization in an intensive care unit, a longer"
		"duration of candidemia, retention of central lines, and inadequate antifungal"
		"therapy were significantly associated with poor outcome. In the present study,"
		nosocomial candidemia was a frequent and relatively underestimated illness.
		Adequate antifungal therapy and central line removal independently reduced the
		high mortality of the disease.

PG	-	1962-5
AB	-	We report a case of infection with Candida glabrata in which the organism became
		resistant to fluconazole and in which pre- and posttreatment isolates were
		available for comparison. The organism was cross-resistant to ketoconazole and
		"itraconazole, in common with other azole-resistant yeasts. Fluconazole was a"
		potent inhibitor of cytochrome P-450-dependent 14 alpha-sterol demethylase
		(P-450DM) in lysates of cells from both susceptible and resistant cultures (50%
		"inhibitory concentration, 0.2 microM), indicating that resistance was unrelated"
		"to changes in P-450DM. Instead, it appeared to arise from a permeability barrier"
		"to fluconazole, since resistant cells were unable to take up radiolabelled drug."

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candida glabrata is an emerging pathogen with the ability to develop
		"tolerance and resistance to azole antifungals, which creates uncertainty about"
		the usefulness of antifungal prophylaxis in newborns. AIMS: The aim of this study
		was to describe the factors associated with C. glabrata infection in a NICU that
		uses prophylaxis with fluconazole. METHODS: A case-control study paired by
		gestational age was designed and conducted at the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara
		Dr. Juan I. Menchaca. Newborns with C. glabrata infection were studied and for
		each one a matched control was selected by gestational age. Odds ratios (OR) were
		estimated with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) and McNemar test for contrast of
		"hypothesis was applied. RESULTS: Twenty-one infected patients were identified,"
		from whom 66.7% were male; the median gestational age was 31.5 weeks. Increased
		risk of infection with C. glabrata was observed when there was a prescription of
		"more than one antimicrobial scheme (OR 21, 95% CI, 1.23 - 358.3; p=0.006) and"
		"also among patients with surgical comorbidities (OR 8, 95% CI 1.01 - 63.9;"
		"p=0.04). During the study period, exposure to fluconazole showed no difference in"
		the risk of infection. CONCLUSIONS: Neonates with more than one antimicrobial
		regimen and those with surgical comorbidities had a higher risk of C. glabrata
		infection.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candida species represent the fourth leading cause of nosocomial
		"bloodstream infections (BSI) worldwide. However, candidaemia rates and species"
		involved vary geographically. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the epidemiological
		"pattern, risk factors for mortality and antifungal therapy of Candida BSI over a"
		5-year period (2008-2012) in a university hospital in northern Italy together
		with a review of the recent literature concerning candidaemia. METHODS: A
		retrospective cohort study cross-linked with microbiology database was performed.
		RESULTS: A total of 89 Candida BSI were identified in 42 males (47 %) and 47
		females (52.8 %). The median age was 69 years (interquartile range 55-78) with
		61.8 % of patients being older than 65 years. Considering all hospitalized
		"patients, the overall incidence rate of candidaemia increased significantly from"
		"2008 to 2012 (from 0.4 to 1.68 episodes per 10,000 patient/days) (p = 0.0001)"
		with a mean linear increase in 5 new cases per year. Candida albicans was the
		predominant species isolated (64 %) followed by C. glabrata (19.1 %). The latter
		species was observed with significantly higher frequency in Internal Medicine and
		Intensive Care Units (ICU). In-hospital crude mortality was 41.6 %. CONCLUSIONS:
		"Candidaemia is an increasing BSI in our university hospital, in accordance with"
		"that observed in northern Italy, and it is still associated with high in-hospital"
		crude mortality.

TI	-	The epidemiology of non-albicans Candida in oropharyngeal candidiasis in HIV
		patients.
PG	-	178-81
AB	-	Oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) is the most common fungal infection in patients
		with HIV infection. Fluconazole has been proven to be very effective in treating
		"this infection, but decreased susceptibility of Candida to this drug has emerged."
		Certain non-albicans species such as C. glabrata and C. krusei are commonly less
		susceptible to fluconazole than C. albicans and are being isolated with increased
		frequency in HIV patients. The purpose of this study was to determine if the
		presence of non-albicans Candida with OPC in HIV patients had an impact on
		clinical presentation. This study shows that late-stage HIV patients have a high
		"prevalence of Candida with decreased susceptibility to fluconazole, especially"
		non-albicans species. OPC episodes with non-albicans isolates were more likely to
		"require higher doses of fluconazole to achieve clinical cure. Also, the presence"
		of non-albicans Candida was more frequently associated with severe symptoms.

PG	-	309-18
AB	-	The aim of this study was to evaluate the distributions of yeast species
		according to the years and to detect the emerging pathogens in intensive care
		"units (ICU). For this purpose, yeast isolation rates were detected"
		"retrospectively, in the following time periods: Period I: April-December 2001;"
		period II: January-December 2002; period III: January-December 2003; period IV:
		January-December 2004. A total of 490 yeast isolates recovered from 462 clinical
		specimens obtained from 360 different ICU patients were investigated during these
		"periods. Urine (62.1%), blood (13.6%) and tracheal aspirate (8.7%) samples were"
		"detected as the most common specimens. Of these isolates, 53.3% were identified"
		"as Candida albicans, 14.5% as C. tropicalis, 12.2% as C. glabrata, 6.5% as C."
		"parapsilosis, 4.5% as Trichosporon spp., 3.9% as C. kefyr, 1.6% as C. krusei,"
		1.4% as Geotrichum candidum and 2.1% as other Candida species. The isolation
		"rates of C. albicans in the periods of I to IV were found as 47.7%, 55.5%, 41.7%"
		"and 62.4%, respectively. The decrease between the second and third periods, and"
		increase between third and fourth periods were statistically significant (chi2 =
		"4.15, p = 0.04 and chi2 = 8.32, p = 0.004). C. glabrata was the second most"
		"common species in the first and second periods (14.8% and 15.5%, respectively),"
		"followed by C. tropicalis (12.5% and 10.0%, respectively), however this array has"
		changed in the third and fourth periods (C. tropicalis was the second with the
		"rates of 16.7% and 16.8%, while C. glabrata placed in the third line with the"
		"rates of 14.8% and 7.6%, respectively). It was concluded that C. albicans has"
		still been the most frequent species among yeast isolates of ICU's in our
		"hospital; however, the incidence of non-albicans species like C. glabrata and C."
		tropicalis has increased.

		endocarditis by Candida glabrata.
PG	-	328-331
AB	-	Bloodstream infections caused by non-albicans Candida species are increasing and
		echinocandins have been extensively used especially in patients with hemodynamic
		"instability, previous antifungal treatment and hospital risk factors for"
		intrinsic or acquired resistance to azoles. Candida glabrata resistance to
		echinocandins is reported and is generally associated with previous use of
		echinocandins; FKS gene mutations have been associated with a worse outcome. We
		report the case of a 65-year-old woman who developed candidemia and endocarditis
		by C. glabrata with a newly acquired FKS mutation 24 months after successful
		treatment of infective endocarditis by C. glabrata with a double dosage of
		anidulafungin (200 mg daily) followed by oral voriconazole. Driven by high
		echinocandin MICs the strain taken by intraoperative cultures was further
		"analyzed in a referral microbiology laboratory, confirming the new onset of point"
		mutation S633P of the FKS2 gene.

AB	-	CONTEXT: Infection is a major determinant in the outcome of patients with cancer.
		AIMS: The aim was to know the epidemiology and outcome of patients with cancer in
		a cancer care center in Eastern India. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Retrospective study
		"of pediatric patients in Tata Medical Center, Kolkata, India. METHODS: Patients"
		(n = 262) between the age group of 0 and 18 years were reviewed for infections
		and infection-related outcome (January to December 2013). STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:
		Modified Wald method was used to determine confidence interval of proportions.
		RESULTS: Gram-negative bacteria were found to be the most common cause of
		"bloodstream infections (BSIs) (56.4%), followed by Gram-positive cocci (34.5%),"
		and Candida species (9.1%). Carbapenem-resistance was noted among 24% of
		"Gram-negative bacilli (GNB), and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase among 64% of"
		GNBs. A single case of Vibrio cholerae septicemia was also noted. No case of
		"vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus was observed, whereas only two cases of"
		methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (1/3 of all Staphylococcus
		"aureus bacteremia) were detected. Escherichia coli, followed by Klebsiella,"
		"Pseudomonas, and Acinetobacter were the predominant organisms detected in BSIs."
		"Among Candida spp. BSIs no resistance to caspofungin, amphotericin B,"
		"Voriconazole was noted. Candida tropicalis was the most common isolate, and 1"
		isolate of Candida glabrata showed dose-dependent sensitivity to fluconazole.
		Three out of 25 patients died of multi-drug resistant Gram-negative bacteria
		(12%) in 2013. Seventeen patients had radiological evidence of invasive fungal
		infections (no mortality was noted). CONCLUSIONS: Periodic review of
		"infection-related data, as well as infection control practices, is essential to"
		optimize clinical outcome in patients with pediatric malignancies.

		chorioretinitis: a case report.
PG	-	21
LID	-	10.1186/s12894-018-0335-6 [doi]
LID	-	21
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Renal fungal bezoars are remarkably rare and mostly occur in
		immunodeficient patients. Only a small number of cases with immunocompetent
		patients have been published so far. The published treatment approaches comprised
		systemic antimycotic therapy and surgical or minimal invasive removal of the
		fungal balls. In some cases irrigation of the renal duct system with amphotericin
		B was performed. By obstruction of the urinary tract bezoars can lead to infected
		hydronephrosis and severe urosepsis with high lethality. Fungaemia can cause
		fungal colonization in different distant organs. Fulminant chorioretinitis and
		irreversible visual impairment can be the consequence of ocular fundus
		colonization. The following report highlights that a co-operation between
		urologists and ophthalmologists is absolutely indispensible in case of fungaemia.
		CASE PRESENTATION: Hereinafter we describe a case of an immunocompetent 56 years
		"old woman, presenting with flank pain and shivering. The diagnosis turned out to"
		be difficult due to initially negative urine culture. The fungaemia caused by
		obstructive nephropathy led to bilateral candida chorioretinitis. The patient was
		treated with intravenous amphotericin b and the bezoar was removed by
		"percutaneous ""nephrolitholapaxy"". After two months, a follow up revealed the"
		"patient felt well, chorioretinal lesions regressed and urine culture did not show"
		"any fungal growth. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first"
		"case reporting on obstructive renal bezoars, which lead to haematogenous fungus"
		spread and bilateral chorioretinitis. It points out that extensive ophthalmologic
		examination should be performed in case of fungaemia even if the patient is not
		suffering from any visual impairment.

		glabrata.
PG	-	112-4
AB	-	CASE REPORT--SUBJECTS--Three cases are described of long-standing vaginal
		candidosis due to Candida glabrata. These had failed to respond to local and
		systemic antifungals. In each case the infecting strain appeared resistant to a
		range of azole drugs in vitro. CLINICAL COURSE--Case one--This patient recovered
		following prolonged treatment with oral itraconazole in combination with oral and
		vaginal nystatin. Case two. Yeasts were eradicated from this patient following
		cyclical treatment with oral dydrogesterone; prolonged vaginal treatment with
		nystatin may have helped. Case three. This patient did not respond to a prolonged
		"course of oral itraconazole in combination with vaginal and oral nystatin, oral"
		medroxyprogesterone or intravaginal boric acid. Eradication of C glabrata was
		finally achieved by local application of 1% gentian violet. Shortly after
		"eradication of the C glabrata infection, both Case two and Case three developed"
		infections with other Candida species responsive to azole antifungals.

TI	-	Two cases of systemic Candida glabrata infection following in vitro fertilization
		and embryo transfer.
PG	-	53-6
AB	-	Presented here are two cases of systemic Candida glabrata infection diagnosed in
		two expectant mothers and their fetuses at 34 and 22 weeks' gestation. The
		underlying risk factors in case 1 were in vitro fertilization and embryo
		"transfer, recurrent yeast vaginitis and two intravenous injections of"
		betamethasone. The risk factors in case 2 were in vitro fertilization and embryo
		"transfer, recurrent yeast vaginitis, antibiotics for treatment of a urinary tract"
		"infection due to Morganella morganii and amniocentesis. In both cases, vaginal"
		fluid yielded growth of a yeast that was not identified. Candida glabrata was
		isolated from samples obtained from the mothers and their babies. Since Candida
		"glabrata lacks hyphae, membranitis and infection of the fetuses were demonstrated"
		only on slides stained with Gomori Grocott and periodic acid-Schiff. Both cases
		suggest that for such pregnancies the follow-up of vaginal fluid should include
		the identification of any yeasts grown on selective Candida medium. In case of
		"premature rupture of membranes, systematic sampling of mothers and their infants"
		"or fetuses should be associated with microscopic study of placentas, membranes"
		and stillborn fetuses with Gomori Grocott and periodic acid-Schiff staining
		techniques.

TI	-	Endophthalmitis in patients with disseminated fungal disease.
PG	-	67-70; discussion 70-1
AB	-	BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Fungal endophthalmitis caused by dissemination from
		extraocular fungal infections has been reported to vary between 9% and 45%.
		"However, recent clinical experience disagrees with that. This study is an"
		"investigation of patients in an inner city teaching hospital, the risks"
		"associated with endogenous fungal endophthalmitis, and this incidence. METHODS:"
		All ophthalmology consultations between February 1995 and August 2000 that might
		be associated with disseminated fungal infection were examined in a prospective
		manner. Patients were excluded if there was no evidence of a positive fungal
		culture from any site at any time. Visual symptoms were recorded along with
		"ophthalmologic and systemic examination features. Information was gathered,"
		"including the identity of cultured organisms, the sites from which the organisms"
		"were obtained, and the patients' disposition. RESULTS: During this interval, 170"
		"consultation requests contained the words ""endophthalmitis"" or ""retinitis"" and/or"
		indicated concern about disseminated fungal infections. Extraocular fungal
		"infections were found in 114 patients, but only 82 of them had evidence of"
		systemic dissemination. Some patients had more than one organism. The following
		"are listed in decreasing frequency of occurrence: Candida albicans, Torulopsis"
		"glabrata, Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis, Candida krusei, Aspergillus"
		"niger, and others. Only two patients had evidence of chorioretinitis and"
		progressed to fungal endophthalmitis. CONCLUSIONS: Endophthalmitis was rare among
		these patients with known fungal infections. Less than 2% had any related
		"ophthalmic manifestations. Nevertheless, since treatment can save vision,"
		evidence of intraocular infection should be sought as eagerly as before.

PG	-	616-8
LID	-	10.1002/ppul.20982 [doi]
AB	-	We report a case of fungal pleural effusion secondary to presumed valproate
		induced pancreatitis with pseudocyst and stricture formation. A child with
		dyskinetic cerebral palsy who had been on sodium valproate for several years was
		transferred for drainage of a left sided pleural effusion. Pleural fluid culture
		consistently grew Candida glabrata although the patient was treated with
		broad-spectrum antibiotic and antifungal therapy. Clinical deterioration ensued
		"with abdominal discomfort, feed intolerance, and re-accumulation of the effusion."
		Investigations revealed a large pancreatic pseudocyst compressing the stomach and
		impairing pancreatic function. Subsequent therapeutic evacuation of pancreatic
		fluid demonstrated C. glabrata. This case underscores that pleural disease may be
		"secondary to abdominal pathology, and always to consider rare side-effects of"
		medication in the face of a puzzling clinical picture.

TI	-	[Oesophageal candidiasis: clinical and mycological analysis].
PG	-	211-8
AB	-	Oesophageal candidiasis is an epithelial infection which requires an immune
		"deficiency. C. albicans is commonly the cause, although other species may also be"
		"responsible. Resistance to fluconazole, drug of choice for treatment, is an"
		emerging problem. The objectives of the current paper were: to determine the
		frequency of oesophageal candidiasis in patients submitted to upper
		"gastrointestinal endoscopy, analyze risk factors, identify Candida species and"
		"determine in vitro susceptibility to fluconazole. During 12 months, 34 patients"
		with oesophageal candidiasis were detected. Out of 1.230 HIV negative and 91 HIV
		"positive patients submitted to upper endoscopy, 11 (0.9%) and 23 (25.3%),"
		"respectively, had candidiasis. Risk factors for HIV negative patients were"
		"systemic antibiotic therapy in 2, deficient dental cleaning in 2 aged patients,"
		"use of proton pump inhibitors in 3, inhaled steroids in 2, malignancy in 1 and"
		oral steroids in 1. The histopathologic diagnosis was confirmed in 48.6% of
		"cases. Cultures were positive in 91.2% C. albicans was prevalent (93.5%), and was"
		"associated to other species in 5 cases (16.1%), (3 C. glabrata, 1 C. tropicalis"
		"and 1 C. parapsilosis). One case cultured only C. glabrata and 1, only C"
		"tropicalis. Out of 31 cultures, 25 were susceptible to fluconazole, 4 dose"
		"dependent (1 C. albicans, 3 C. glabrata), and 2 resistant (1 C. albicans, 1 C."
		"glabrata). Frequency of oesophageal candidiasis was low, except for HIV positive"
		"patients. The most common etiologic agent was C. albicans, though other Candida"
		species were also found. C. albicans and C. glabrata showed dose dependency and
		resistance to fluconazole.

TI	-	Late-onset donor-to-host transmission of Candida glabrata following corneal
		transplantation.
PG	-	123-5
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the potential value of obtaining routine fungal
		cultures of donor rims at the time of corneal transplantation and instituting
		"prophylactic therapy in culture-positive cases, even in the absence of clinical"
		evidence of established microbial keratitis or endophthalmitis. METHODS:
		Interventional case report and literature review. RESULTS: A 69-year-old Saudi
		man underwent penetrating keratoplasty with donor tissue that was
		culture-positive for Candida glabrata. The postoperative course was complicated
		"by slight override of the graft associated with an associated epithelial defect,"
		but there was no evidence of microbial keratitis or significant anterior chamber
		"inflammation. Following repair of the graft override on postoperative day 42, the"
		epithelial defect healed. The subsequent clinical course was unremarkable until
		"postoperative day 146, when a deep stromal infiltrate was present at the"
		"graft-host junction, associated with a dense endothelial plaque. Cultures of the"
		anterior chamber were positive for Candida glabrata. Treatment with topical and
		"intracameral amphotericin B and systemic fluconazole, along with topical"
		"corticosteroids and intracameral t-PA, was successful in eradicating the corneal"
		infiltrate and resolving intraocular inflammation. Four months after treatment
		"was initiated, there was no evidence of recurrent fungal keratitis or"
		endophthalmitis. CONCLUSION: This case provides support for the practice of
		obtaining routine fungal cultures of donor rims at the time of corneal
		transplantation and for the implementation of prophylactic antifungal therapy in
		culture-positive cases.

TI	-	[Infections by Candida sp. in intensive care. Survey of French practices].
PG	-	440-9
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: The isolation of Candida sp in nosocomial infections is on the
		"increase and over the past 10 years many guidelines for ""good"" practices and"
		recommendations have been published on the modalities for the management of
		systemic candidiasis. The aim of this paper was to assess the habits in the
		intensive care units in this domain in France. METHOD: A transversal survey on
		"the habits was conducted from March to May 2001, using a questionnaire mailed to"
		200 intensive care units. RESULTS: One hundred eighty questionnaires (surgical
		"reanimation: 12%, medical: 18%, medico-surgical: 70%) out of 200 (92.5%) were"
		"returned. The indirect diagnostic examinations: serology, search for antigenemia"
		"and PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) were never used in 21, 35 and 65% of cases."
		The systematic search for colonisation (a mean of 4 areas sampled) was conducted
		"in all the patients by 19% of the investigators, in some patients by 53%, and"
		never by 28%. An antifungal treatment was prescribed: in the presence of a
		"positive haemoculture alone, once out of twice if the sample had been taken from"
		a central catheter and in 2 cases out of 3 when the sample was peripheral. It was
		prescribed 6 times out of 10 after isolation of Candida sp following surgery or
		"on needle aspiration of an intra-abdominal abscess, varyingly in the case of"
		"cadiduria, isolation of a Candida sp in a broncho-pulmonary sample or in"
		"abdominal draining and positive culture of a catheter, depending on the intensity"
		"of the colonisation, the severity of the clinical picture and the presence of"
		factors of risk for Candida infection. It is still prescribed empirically
		depending on the same elements and the absence of explanation for worsening. When
		"faced with candidemia in a non-neutropenic patient, a central catheter is not"
		"changed in 18% of cases. Depending on the microbiology, fluconazole is prescribed"
		"in: the identification of yeast without further precision (78% of cases), Candida"
		"sp without further precision (86% of cases), Candida non albicans without further"
		"precision (57% of cases), C. albicans (93% of cases), Candida non albicans other"
		"than C. krusei and C. glabrata (62% of cases), C. glabrata (36% of cases) with an"
		increase in dose in 1 out of 2 cases. In the presence of C. glabrata or C.
		"krusei, amphotericin B is the choice in respectively 51 and 75% of cases. To"
		adapt the treatment.

PG	-	752-6
LID	-	10.1111/1469-0691.12004 [doi]
AB	-	"The emergence of fluconazole-resistant Candida (FRC) is worrisome, but little is"
		known about susceptibility patterns in different nosocomial settings. We
		prospectively analysed Candida bloodstream isolates in 18 medical centres in
		Israel (six tertiary-care and 12 community hospitals). The study included 444
		"episodes of candidaemia (450 patient-specific isolates, 8.5%"
		fluconazole-resistant). Institutional FRC bloodstream infection rates correlated
		"with annual inpatient days, and were strongly associated with the presence and"
		activity of haematology/oncology services. Infection with Candida krusei and
		fluconazole-resistant Candida glabrata occurred exclusively in hospitals with
		>600 beds. These findings suggest that empirical antifungal strategies should be
		tailored to the nosocomial setting.

TI	-	Cross-sectional study of the susceptibility of Candida isolates to antifungal
		drugs and in vitro-in vivo correlation in HIV-infected patients.
PG	-	945-50
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To investigate (1) the frequency of clinical resistance to oral
		"polyenes or azole treatment for oral candidiasis, (2) the frequency of resistant"
		"in vitro Candida strains, (3) the relationship between the susceptibilities of in"
		vitro Candida species and in vivo status in HIV patients. DESIGN: Prospective
		"cross-sectional study. SETTING: Tertiary care clinic at Bocage Hospital, Dijon,"
		France. PATIENTS: HIV-infected patients with and without oral candidiasis.
		"INTERVENTIONS: Clinical examination, oral swab for mycologic investigations. MAIN"
		"OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical diagnosis of oral candidiasis, identification of the"
		"antifungal treatment given within the previous month, identification of Candida"
		"species, antimycogramm and determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration"
		"(MIC) for fluconazole, and measurement of T-helper cell count. RESULTS: Within a"
		"2-month period, 154 HIV-infected patients were studied: 46 heterosexuals, 51"
		"intravenous drug users (IVDU), 52 homosexuals and five blood transfusion"
		"recipients. The percentages of patients with oral candidiasis were: 41, 80, 44"
		"and 20%, respectively (P < 0.05); the mean T-helper cell counts were 200, 135,"
		"210 and 238 x 10(6)/l cells, respectively (P < 0.05). Twenty-two patients (14.3%)"
		had received recent azole treatment and 29 (18.8%) recent oral polyene treatment.
		"Among the 84 patients with and the 70 patients without oral candidiasis, 78 and"
		"28 Candida strains were isolated, respectively. Although Candida albicans"
		"represented the majority of Candida species (88 strains, 83%), the non-albicans"
		strains were isolated more frequently in patients who had received recent
		"antifungal treatment. No strains were resistant to ketoconazole, miconazole or"
		"econazole; however, six (5.6%), 16 (15%) and 10 (9.5%) were intermediately"
		"susceptible to the three drugs, respectively. Twelve (13.6%) of the 88 C."
		"albicans, five of the six C. (Torulopsis) glabrata, one of the five C. tropicalis"
		and all three C. krusei strains were resistant to fluconazole. These resistant
		strains were separated as follows: 41.1% of C. albicans strains resistant to
		"fluconazole were isolated from patients who had received recent azole therapy,"
		"17.6% from patients who received recent oral polyene, and 3.7% from patients who"
		had not received any recent antifungal treatment (P = 0.004). The mean MIC of
		"these three categories of isolates were 3.6, 1.6 and 0.6 mg/l, respectively (P ="
		0.06). CONCLUSIONS: Oral candidiasis and fluconazole-resistant Candida isolates
		are more frequently found in IVDU. Treatments using azoles select non-albicans
		strains and are associated with decreased susceptibilities of C. albicans strains
		to fluconazole in particular. These findings show that prolonged azole treatment
		in severely immunocompromised patients should be avoided.

AB	-	"OBJECTIVE: A one-year prospective, observational study was conducted in the west"
		"of France, to evaluate the epidemiology of candidemia. METHOD: During the year"
		"2004, each patient with at least one blood culture yielding Candida sp. was"
		"included. For each episode of candidemia, mycological, demographical, clinical,"
		"and therapeutic data, as well as outcome, were collected. RESULTS: One hundred"
		"and ninety-three strains of Candida sp. were isolated in 186 patients, Candida"
		"albicans accounting for 54.9%, Candida glabrata for 18.7%, Candida parapsilosis"
		"for 12.9%, Candida tropicalis for 4.7% and Candida krusei for 4.1% of these"
		isolates. A percentage of 84% of the Candida isolates were fully susceptible to
		fluconazole in vitro. Dose-dependent susceptibility or resistance to fluconazole
		"was detected in more than one third of the Candida glabrata strains, of which 36%"
		"were also resistant to voriconazole. Two-thirds of the patients were males, and"
		the mean age was 61.5 years. A percentage of 37% of patients were hospitalized in
		intensive care units. The main predisposing factors for candidemia were
		"broad-spectrum antibiotics (75.8%), central venous catheter (72.6%), cancer or"
		"hematologic malignancy (47.3%), recent surgery (42.5%), total parenteral"
		nutrition (37.6%). One hundred and fifty-four patients were treated with
		"antifungal therapy, two-thirds of whom received fluconazole as first-line agent."
		"Mortality was 49% overall, and was significantly higher in case of septic shock,"
		"advanced age, and absence of catheter removal."

PG	-	373-9
AB	-	The aim of this study was to detect fungi in three ontocenoses of 947 women (aged
		20-45). The prevalence of multifocal fungal infections in women varied from 62.2
		+/- 2.99% to 81.0 +/- 3.92% in different ontocenoses. They assumed the following
		"mean values: 38.4 +/- 1.77% for the vagina, 42.2 +/- 1.80% for the oral cavity,"
		and 25.0 +/- 1.58% for the anus. The clinical manifestations of sexual organs
		inflammations were statistically significantly (p < 0.01) more frequent in women
		infected with fungi than in those without fungi in the vaginal ontocenosis. The
		highest convergence of the fungi presence with subjective and objective symptoms
		(assessed using the Yule Q index value) concerned: pruritus of the vulva or/and
		"vaginal walls, burning sensation or painful urethra, as well as oedema of the"
		"external opening of the urethra, vulva or/and the vagina (Q from +0.808 to"
		"+0.970). However, there was no statistically significant convergence between"
		occurrence of the fungi and vaginal discharge and painful hypogastrium. Based on
		"more than 40 phenotypical features (morphological, biochemical) of the axenic"
		"strains originating from vaginal, oral, and anal ontocenoses, a total of 12"
		"species of fungi were identified: Candida albicans, C. guilliermondii, C. krusei,"
		"C. tropicalis, C. kefyr, C. utilis, C. humicola, C. viswanathii, C. glabrata, C."
		"parapsilosis, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, and Geotrichum candidum. For"
		"intraspecific features, depending on the profile of the compounds used for"
		"auxanogram, 9 codes were read for Candida albicans and only one code for each of"
		other species was detected. In API ZYM test based on assessment of 19 hydrolase
		activities the enzymograms of species included from 6 to 11 enzymes.

TI	-	Candidemia and the susceptibility pattern of Candida isolates in blood.
PG	-	1060-3
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: Candida species has become one of the most common blood isolates as
		well as one of the leading causes of nosocomial bloodstream infections. The
		purpose of our study was to determine the prevalence of Candida species among our
		bloodstream infecting organisms and the susceptibility pattern of the Candida
		isolates to antifungal agents. METHODS: A prospective study was carried out in
		"the Division of Microbiology, King Khalid National Guard Hospital, Jeddah,"
		Kingdom of Saudi Arabia of all positive blood cultures for Candida species. The
		study took place from 1st January 1998 to March 2002. Identification and
		susceptibility pattern of isolates were determined by the Candifast technique to
		"amphotericin B, fluconazole, nystatin, Flucytosine, econazole, ketoconazole and"
		"miconazole. RESULTS: Over a 2-year period, 17,916 blood cultures were performed"
		"in our hospital. There were 2,972 positive cultures, of which 83 (2.8%) patients"
		"had Candida species isolated from their bloodstream. Of these, 38 (46%) were"
		Candida albicans (C.albicans). The remaining 45 strains were made up of Candida
		tropicalis 9 (10.8%); Candida parapsilosis 9 (10.8%); Candida species 9 (10.8%);
		Candida guilliermondi 6 (7.2%); Candida krusei 5 (6%); Candida glabrata 4 (4.8%);
		Candida pseudotropicalis 2 (2.4%) and Trichosporon species 1 (1.2%). All Candida
		"species were susceptible to amphotericin B. However, only 18 (47%) out of 38"
		"C.albicans were susceptible to fluconazole, while only 8 (17.7%) of 45"
		non-C.albicans strains were susceptible to this drug. CONCLUSION: The
		susceptibility of C.albicans to fluconazole in our hospital using the Candifast
		method is very low (47%). These results need to be confirmed by carrying out the
		Etest or the NCCLS M27-A method to confirm the true susceptibilities of Candida
		strains in our locality.

TI	-	"Triazole cross-resistance among Candida spp.: case report, occurrence among"
		"bloodstream isolates, and implications for antifungal therapy."
PG	-	529-35
AB	-	Candida spp. are common causes of bloodstream infections among hospitalized
		patients. Fluconazole (FLC) remains a first-line therapy for candidemia; and
		"voriconazole (VRC), an expanded-spectrum triazole, was recently approved for the"
		treatment of candidemia in nonneutropenic patients. In vitro studies have
		suggested that VRC has potent activity against Candida spp. with reduced
		susceptibilities to FLC. We present a case report of invasive candidiasis and
		candidemia due to a Candida glabrata isolate that developed resistance to all
		currently available triazole antifungals after a course of FLC treatment. This
		case prompted us to determine the frequency of cross-resistance among bloodstream
		"Candida isolates collected during a recent 12-month period at a large, academic"
		medical center. FLC MICs were determined for 125 of 153 isolates (81.7%). Thirty
		of 125 isolates (24%) were resistant or showed reduced susceptibilites to FLC
		(MICs >/= 16 microg/ml). When 28 of these 30 isolates were tested for their VRC
		"susceptibilities, 9 (32%) had MICs that were >/=2 microg/ml. Five of these nine"
		"isolates were C. glabrata, two isolates were Candida tropicalis, one isolate was"
		"Candida albicans, and one isolate was Candida parapsilosis. All five Candida"
		krusei isolates tested had VRC MICs </=0.5 microg/ml. These data have prompted
		the introduction of reflexive FLC susceptibility testing of first bloodstream
		Candida isolates at our institution. The case report and our data also suggest
		that VRC should be avoided as initial therapy in unstable patients with invasive
		"candidiasis, particularly in the setting of prior azole exposure. Studies are"
		needed to define the clinical significance of in vitro resistance to the newer
		antifungal agents.

TI	-	A 5-year (2000-2004) epidemiological survey of Candida and non-Candida yeast
		"species causing vulvovaginal candidiasis in Graz, Austria."
PG	-	471-5
AB	-	Vulvovaginal candidasis (VVC) is a common disease. The majority of cases is
		"caused by Candida albicans, but in recent years an increase has been observed in"
		"the frequency of non-albicans Candida infections, especially due to C. glabrata"
		and C. tropicalis. The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of
		"non-albicans Candida infections in patients suffering from VVC. Therefore, the"
		statistical data of culture-confirmed VVC ascertained at the Institute of Hygiene
		"(Medical University Graz) have been studied. Altogether, 10,463 samples from"
		"patients with vulvovaginal complaints were analysed in the years 2000-2004, a"
		number of 3184 proved to be culture-positive for yeast. Candida albicans was the
		most prevalent cause in 87.9% of all cases. Non-albicans Candida yeast were
		"detected in 12.1%, mainly C. glabrata and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. During a"
		1-year period 185 patients showed more than one episode of VVC. Patients aged
		21-40 years were significantly more prone to suffer from VVC compared with other
		age-related groups.

PG	-	825-8

AB	-	PURPOSE: To report 2 cases of donor-to-host transmission of Candida albicans
		interface keratitis after Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty
		(DSAEK). METHODS: We performed clinical and microbiologic examinations on 2
		patients who underwent DSAEK for pseudophakic corneal edema. RESULTS: Two
		patients underwent uneventful DSAEK surgery using corneal tissue from the same
		donor. The donor corneoscleral rims were cultured at the time of surgery and both
		rims subsequently grew C. albicans and Candida glabrata. Approximately 5 weeks
		"after surgery, infiltrates were noted in the DSAEK interface in both of these"
		"patients. Despite treatment with antifungal therapy, the Candida keratitis was"
		unable to be controlled medically and required surgical intervention in each
		"case, after which there was no recurrence of infection. CONCLUSIONS: Candida"
		interface keratitis can occur after DSAEK. These 2 cases emphasize the importance
		"of donor corneoscleral rim cultures, especially with the increase in lamellar and"
		"endothelial keratoplasty, which can make such interface infections more difficult"
		to diagnose and treat. Patients with fungal positive donor corneal rim cultures
		should be prophylactically treated with antifungal therapy.

TI	-	Secular trends in the epidemiology of nosocomial fungal infections at a teaching
		"hospital in Taiwan, 1981 to 1993."
PG	-	369-75
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To describe the incidence and patterns of nosocomial fungal infection
		"in a large teaching hospital in Taiwan. DESIGN: Prospective, hospitalwide"
		nosocomial surveillance data from 1981 through 1993 were analyzed to show the
		secular trend in nosocomial fungal infection rates and to identify the most
		common pathogens and sites of infection (other than skin) in this hospital.
		SETTING AND PATIENTS: The National Taiwan University Hospital is a medical
		"school-affiliated hospital in the city of Taipei, Taiwan, with a 1200-bed"
		capacity before 1991 and 1500 beds since 1992. It provides both primary and
		tertiary medical care. RESULTS: The overall nosocomial fungal infection rate rose
		from 0.9 infections per 1000 discharges in 1981 to 6.6 per 1000 discharges in
		"1993, with the highest rate at the medical intensive-care unit (26.5/1000"
		discharges in 1993). This increase in infection rate was found at four major
		"anatomic sites of infection, particularly including the bloodstream"
		(0.08-2.19/1000 discharges) and the urinary tract (0.36-2.95/1000 discharges). Of
		"256 pathogens causing nosocomial fungemia from 1981 through 1993, Candida"
		"albicans was the most commonly isolated (50.8%), followed by Candida tropicalis"
		"(17.6%). Candida parapsilosis (11.7%), and Candida glabrata (8.2%). As compared"
		"to isolates from 1981 through 1988, the proportion of C parapsilosis and C"
		"glabrata isolated between 1989 and 1993 increased more than sixfold and fourfold,"
		respectively. The increasing importance of fungal infections was confirmed
		further by the increased use of amphotericin B and azoles in this hospital.
		CONCLUSIONS: Candida species and other yeasts have become a prominent cause of
		nosocomial infections in this hospital. These fungal pathogens accounted for a
		higher proportion of nosocomial bloodstream and urinary infections than any
		"single bacterial species. Therefore, it is important to conduct a prospective"
		epidemiological study and to establish in vitro antifungal susceptibility testing
		to enhance efforts to control nosocomial fungal infections and to minimize the
		risk of emergence of antifungal resistance.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Blood infection with Candida glabrata often occurs in during severe
		acute pancreatitis (SAP). It complicate severe agranulocytosis has not been
		reported. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case where a SAP patient presenting
		with a sudden hyperpyrexia was treated for 19 days. We monitored her routine
		blood panel and CRP levels once or twice daily. The results showed that WBC count
		decreased gradually. And the lowest level of WBC was appeared at the 21st day of
		"treatment. WBC 0.58 × 10(9)/L(4.0-10.0 × 10(9)/L), neutrophils 0.1 × 10(9)/L"
		"[2.20%] (2.5-7.5 × 10(9)/L). During treatment, Candida glabrata was identified as"
		"the infecting agent through blood culture, drainage tubes culture and gene"
		"detection. During anti-infection therapy, the patient had severe agranulocytosis."
		"With control of the infection, her WBC and granulocyte counts gradually returned"
		to the normal range. CONCLUSIONS: Blood infection with Candida glabrata can
		complicate severe agranulocytosis.

AB	-	We report a case of in vitro fertilization (IVF)-acquired Candida glabrata
		chorioamnionitis successfully treated through systemic maternal antifungal
		"treatment prior to delivery. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case"
		"of its kind in the literature. C. glabrata chorioamnionitis in pregnancy is rare,"
		but the current literature suggests a very high fetal fatality in such cases. It
		"is known to have an association with cervical stitch, amniocentesis, chorionic"
		"villous sampling, and assisted reproductive techniques such as IVF. Given the"
		"increasing global use of artificial reproductive techniques, it is important to"
		raise awareness of this condition and highlight its potential complications.
		Early recognition of possible fetal infection could enable early initiation of
		systemic antifungal treatment. It would be prudent to consider early delivery
		once fetal maturity is achieved despite normal fetal monitoring.

TI	-	Emergence of non-albicans Candida among candidal vulvovaginitis cases and study
		"of their potential virulence factors, from a tertiary care center, North India."
PG	-	144-7
LID	-	10.4103/0377-4929.118703 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of various
		Candida species and study some of their virulence factors among thevulvovaginal
		candidiasis(VVC)patients. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTINGS: The study was conducted in a
		Tertiary Care University Hospital in North India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This
		study was carried out prospectively for a period of 1 year. High vaginal swabs
		(HVSs) were collected from women in childbearing age group attending the
		gynecology and obstetrics out-patient departments with the complaints suggestive
		of vulvovaginitis. Samples were plated on Sabouraud's dextrose agar slope.
		"Candida spp. isolated was further speciated based on microscopy, biochemical"
		tests and culture characteristics on special media. Virulence factors of these
		strains were determined by biofilm formation and phospholipase activity. RESULT:
		A total of 464 HVS from 232 patients with the complaints of vulvovaginitis were
		"included in this study. Following laboratory workup, 71 specimens were positive"
		"for genus Candida (30.6%). Further speciation showed 32.4% as Candida albicans,"
		45.07% Candida parapsilosis and 22.53% of Candida glabrata. Biofilm production
		was shown by 50 candidal strains (70.4%) and phospholipase activity was given by
		41 candidal strains (57.74%). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests increasing
		prevalence of non-albicans Candida among the VVC cases along with their virulence
		"factors. Therefore, we recommend that microbiological investigation upto species"
		level should be mandatory to determine the emergence of non-albicans Candida as a
		major cause of VVC.

TI	-	Breakthrough candidemia in patients with cancer differs from de novo candidemia
		in host factors and Candida species but not intensity.
PG	-	542-5
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the risk factors associated with breakthrough candidemia
		in patients with cancer and to compare them with those of de novo candidemia in
		this patient population. DESIGN: Retrospective case series of 120 episodes of
		"candidemia, 90 de novo and 30 breakthrough candidemias. SETTING:"
		"University-affiliated, tertiary-care cancer center in Houston, Texas. PATIENTS:"
		All patients with cancer who acquired candidemia between January 1993 and
		December 1998 were included if they had non-catheter-related candidemia and
		"information about quantitative blood cultures. RESULTS: Although less frequent,"
		breakthrough candidemia was seen more often in neutropenic patients with
		leukemia. The intensity of breakthrough candidemia was comparable to that of de
		novo candidemia. Most (70%) of the breakthrough candidemias were due to Candida
		"glabrata or C. krusei. CONCLUSIONS: In breakthrough candidemia, the same risk"
		"factors seen in de novo candidemia were encountered, although more frequently. C."
		glabrata and C. krusei are the leading causes of breakthrough candidemia in
		patients with cancer.

		and literature review.
PG	-	402-5
LID	-	10.3109/13693780903176503 [doi]
AB	-	We report the case of an immunocompetent woman who developed a Candida glabrata
		abscess of the parotid gland and present a review of similar cases from the
		literature. Diagnosis was based on the isolation of C. glabrata in pure culture
		from the abscess pus. Examination of stained smears of the same material
		"demonstrated small sized yeast cells, some being intra-macrophagic. Combination"
		of a local drainage and oral fluconazole proved to be an efficient therapeutic
		strategy. Candidal abscesses are rare in immunocompetent patients and salivary
		gland localization has only been reported in five cases.

		successful treatment with micafungin.
PG	-	214-7
AB	-	A 69-year-old man was transferred to our hospital because of fever and acute
		"renal failure. 5 weeks prior to admission, he was admitted to another hospital"
		"and treated with several antibiotics including vancomycin, but fever did not"
		"subside and renal dysfunction showed rapid progression. On admission, laboratory"
		"findings revealed pyuria, inflammatory changes, acute renal failure, and"
		disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Computed tomography showed left
		ureteral stone and hydronephrosis. Gallium scintigraphy showed avid uptake in the
		left kidney. Serum concentration of vancomycin was 57.4 micro/ml. Candida
		"glabrata was isolated from blood, sputum and urine. Under the diagnosis of"
		"fungemia and left pyelonephritis, he was treated with micafungin (150 mg/day),"
		gabexate mesilate and insertion of a double-ended pigtail catheter. The above
		"treatment produced regression of systemic inflammation, DIC and acute renal"
		"failure. At the last follow-up 3 weeks after discharge, ureteroscopy showed that"
		the ureter stone had already passed but a soft white-yellowish bezoar was
		"detected in the ureter. In this case, neurogenic bladder, poorly controlled"
		"diabetes, and long-term antibiotic treatment probably enhanced the development of"
		C. glabrata infection. Antifungal treatment with micafungin is useful in patients
		with non-albicans Candida infection.

AB	-	Candida glabrata is a well-known cause of lower urinary tract infections.
		"Systemic infections caused by this organism are less common, but have increased"
		dramatically in recent years. Prosthesis infection caused by C. glabrata is
		extremely rare. We report a case of prosthesis failure due to C. glabrata 5 y
		after candidaemia and pyelonephritis caused by this organism. The same C.
		"glabrata strain was isolated from both infections, as confirmed by the random"

PG	-	437-8
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To establish whether there has been any rise in the prevalence of
		non-albicans Candida species isolated from vaginal swabs since the introduction
		"of ""over the counter"" antifungal treatments. METHOD: A retrospective review"
		looking at all positive vaginal yeast isolates collected from women attending one
		genitourinary medicine clinic during the 6 year period from 1993 to 1998
		"inclusive. All positive vaginal yeast isolates were included, regardless of"
		whether or not the patients were symptomatic. Isolates from HIV positive women
		were excluded from the analysis. RESULTS: No increase in non-albicans vaginal
		yeast isolates was shown during the period studied. The proportion of
		non-albicans yeasts remained constant at approximately 5% of the total yeasts
		isolated. The most common non-albicans yeast isolated was C glabrata. CONCLUSION:
		"There is no evidence from this study to suggest that the increasing use of ""over"
		"the counter"" antifungal treatment has selected for atypical, possibly inherently"
		"azole resistant, strains of vaginal yeasts in HIV seronegative women."

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candida species are responsible for various clinical infections
		ranging from mucocutaneous infection to life threatening invasive diseases along
		with increased resistance to antifungal drugs has made a serious concern.
		"Resistance to antifungal agents has increased during the last decade. Thus,"
		identification of Candida up to species level and its antifungal susceptibility
		testing has a paramount significance in the management of Candidal infections.
		The aim of the study was to speciate Candida species and to determine antifungal
		susceptibility pattern of Candida species to antifungal agents. METHODS: A total
		of 100 consecutive Candida species were isolated from 1248 clinical specimens
		over 7 months period. Growths on Sabouraud dextrose agar were evaluated for
		"colony appearance, macroscopic examination, Gram staining, germ tube test and"
		"urea hydrolysis test. Further, they were processed for Candida speciation on"
		CHROMagar. Antifungal susceptibility testing was performed as recommended by
		Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M44-A document. RESULTS: Out
		"of 100 Candida isolates, Candida albicans (56%) was the most common species."
		"Among the non-albicans Candida species, Candida tropicalis (20%) was the"
		predominant isolate followed by Candida glabrata (14%). Regarding antifungal
		"susceptibility pattern, Candida species were more susceptible to clotrimazole"
		(82%) followed by fluconazole (64%) and miconazole (44%). CONCLUSIONS: Candida
		albicans was the predominant species responsible for various Candidal infections.
		"Among commonly used antifungal drugs clotrimazole, miconazole and fluconazole"
		were most effective.

		yeasts in patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis. Determination of in vitro
		susceptibility of yeast isolates to clinically used antimycotic agents. DESIGN: A
		retrospective clinical study of patients with positive vaginal cultures for the
		presence of pathogenic yeast species. SETTING: I. gynekologicko-pôrodnícka
		"klinika LF UK a FN, Zochova 7,811 03 Bratislava, Slovenská republika. METHODS:"
		Identification of yeast pathogens on the chromogenic medium CHROMagar CANDIDA and
		with API-CANDIDA identification system. In vitro susceptibility assays of
		"clinical yeast isolates to antifungal agents using the plate dilution method,"
		NCCLS method and ATB-FUNGUS test system. RESULTS: The highest prevalence of
		vulvovaginal candidasis was found in women aged between 20-30 years. Candida
		albicans was the most commonly identified species of pathogenic yeasts (87.4%).
		"Of the non-albicans species, C. glabrata (6.3%) was the most prevalent species."
		C. glabrata and C. krusei clinical isolates were found to be generally less
		susceptible to several antifungals in vitro as compared to C. albicans strains. A
		"minimal number of resistant yeast isolates was observed for econazole,"
		clotrimazole and nystatin. A relatively high number of resistant strains was
		"observed for some other azole antifungals (miconazole, ketoconazole,"
		"itraconazole, fluconazole). CONCLUSION: A successful treatment of vaginal mycotic"
		infections requires the results of the microbiological analyses. They will bring
		"evidence to a physician of the presence and fate of the pathogen, of its"
		"sensitivity to antifungals, both of which are essential for the rational and"
		successful therapy of Candida vaginitis.

		hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively (1989-1997) studied all
		"HIV-infected patients with positive blood cultures for Candida sp., Cryptococcus"
		neoformans or any other fungal infection. RESULTS: C. neoformans was isolated in
		11 patients (10 men and 1 woman): Six were treated with amphotericin B and 5 with
		fluconazole. 2 patients died during the acute phase and the infection relapsed in
		3. Blood culture for Candida sp. were positive in 9 (8 men and 1 woman): only a
		case was nosocomial. Seven patients were intravenous drug users and the
		"presenting manifestations were autolimited candidemia in 3, aortic and tricuspid"
		endocarditis in 1 and 2 cases respectively and pneumonia in another one. Six C.
		"albicans, 2 C. krusei and 1 C. glabrata were isolated. 3 patients received"
		amphotericin B and 3 received fluconazole. 2 patients suffering from endocarditis
		"died and so did the patient with C. glabrata infection. A patient, who denied"
		"having travelled to endemic areas, developed histoplasmosis; blood culture was"
		positive for H. capsulatum. He initially had a good response to amphotericin B
		and itraconazole. CONCLUSIONS: Fungemia is not frequent in HIV-infected patients.
		Cryptococcosis and histoplasmosis occur in advanced HIV-patients and candidemia
		is fundamentally associated with intravenous drug use.

TI	-	Identification of Candida dubliniensis in a study of HIV-seropositive pediatric
		dental patients.
PG	-	234-8
AB	-	PURPOSE: The combination of an immature immune system and suppressed cellular
		immunity in children with HIV infections provides optimal conditions for rapid
		"disease progression. As a result, pediatric AIDS has become a major"
		epidemiological challenge. Oral fungal colonization remains one of the most
		common opportunistic infections observed in both adult and pediatric HIV infected
		patients. Although Candida albicans is the most frequently isolated opportunistic
		"fungal species, a recently characterized Candida species, C. dubliniensis, has"
		gained considerable attention due to its almost exclusive association with
		HIV-seropositive individuals. The purpose of this study was to prospectively
		screen for the presence of C. dubliniensis among pediatric HIV+ patients.
		METHODS: Oral samples taken from twenty-seven children were cultured for the
		presence of yeast. All positive yeast isolates obtained were screened for the
		presence of C. dubliniensis by use of tests for germ tube and chlamydospore
		"production, detection of inability to grow at 45 degrees C, by colony color on"
		"CHROMagar Candida medium, coaggregation with Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 49256"
		and by the results of sugar assimilation testing with the API 20C AUX yeast
		"identification system. RESULTS: Among the 27 patients tested, 3 patients were"
		"found to harbor C. dubliniensis, one of which also grew C. glabrata; 12 patients"
		"were colonized with C. albicans, while the remaining 12 patients were negative"
		for yeast. Identification of the three C. dubliniensis isolates was genetically
		confirmed by electrophoretic karyotyping. All three C. dubliniensis isolates were
		found to be susceptible to fluconazole (MIC < or = 0.25 ug/ml). CONCLUSIONS:
		These results confirm the presence of this novel species in a dental pediatric
		HIV seropositive population and support the need for further investigation into
		the prevalence and pathogenesis of C. dubliniensis.

		penetrating keratoplasty.
PG	-	1243-4
AB	-	PURPOSE: Candida glabrata is a rare cause of endophthalmitis after penetrating
		keratoplasty. Adequate therapy is still under discussion. With respect to severe
		"complications and side effects of antifungal therapy, a substantial knowledge of"
		sensitivity and resistance of the organism is necessary. METHODS: We report on a
		26-year-old man with a hyperacute onset of the infection only 10 hours after
		surgery. A combined therapy for fluconazole and steroids administered over 3
		months had shown no effect on intraocular infection. RESULTS: After topical and
		intracameral application of amphotericin B in combination with topical
		"prednisolone 3 months after the onset of the endophthalmitis, the infection"
		"disappeared within 14 days, and the graft remained clear for 2 months. No toxic"
		"effects were noticed. CONCLUSION: In the case presented here, topical and"
		intracameral application of amphotericin B was sufficient and safe in the therapy
		for C. glabrata endophthalmitis after penetrating keratoplasty. Although
		"typically the intraocular infection is first noticed within the first 2 weeks, a"
		hyperacute onset has to be considered.

TI	-	Candidal liver abscesses and cholecystitis in a 37-year-old patient without
		underlying malignancy.
PG	-	1725-7
AB	-	We report a case of candidal liver abscesses and concomitant candidal
		"cholecystitis in a diabetic patient, in whom differences were noted relative to"
		"those found in patients with hematologic malignancies. In our case, the proposed"
		entry route of infection is ascending retrograde from the biliary tract. Bile and
		"aspirated pus culture repeatedly tested positive, and blood negative, for Candida"
		albicans and Candida glabrata. Cholecystitis was cured by percutaneous
		gallbladder drainage and amphotericin B therapy. The liver abscesses were
		successfully treated by a cumulative dosage of 750 mg amphotericin B. We conclude
		that in cases involving less immunocompromised patients and those without
		"candidemia, a lower dosage of amphotericin B may be adequate in treating candidal"
		liver abscesses.

AB	-	"PURPOSE: To describe temporal trends in the epidemiology, clinical management and"
		outcome of candidemia in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. METHODS: This study
		"was a retrospective analysis of 1,392 episodes of candidemia in 647 adult ICU"
		patients from 22 Brazilian hospitals. The characteristics of candidemia in these
		"ICU patients were compared in two periods (2003-2007, period 1; 2008-2012, period"
		"2), and the predictors of 30-day mortality were assessed. RESULTS: The proportion"
		of patients who developed candidemia while in the ICU increased from 44 % in
		period 1 to 50.9 % in period 2 (p = 0.01). Prior exposure to fluconazole before
		"candidemia (22.3 vs. 11.6 %, p < 0.001) and fungemia due to Candida glabrata"
		"(13.1 vs. 7.8 %, p = 0.03) were more frequent in period 2, as was the proportion"
		"of patients receiving an echinocandin as primary therapy (18.0 vs. 5.9 %, p <"
		0.001). The 30-day mortality rate decreased from 76.4 % in period 1 to 60.8 % in
		period 2 (p < 0.001). Predictors of 30-day mortality by multivariate analysis
		"were older age, period 1, treatment with corticosteroids and higher APACHE II"
		"score, while treatment with an echinocandin were associated with a higher"
		probability of survival. CONCLUSIONS: We found a clear change in the epidemiology
		and clinical management of candidemia in ICU patients over the 9-year period of
		the study. The use of echinocandins as primary therapy for candidemia appears to
		be associated with better outcomes.

TI	-	Post-mortem findings in patients with repeatedly mycological demonstration of
		Candida glabrata.
PG	-	125-32
AB	-	In our mycological laboratory we saw an increase in the occurrence of Candida
		"glabrata isolates from 0.5% in 1990 to 22.2% in 1996, mainly isolates of"
		high-risk patients of the intensive care unit and the oncological ward. We were
		interested to analyse whether this increase in C. glabrata was also demonstrable
		in a corresponding number of deep-seated candidosis. Eighteen patients were
		"autopsied and examined microscopically. In all patients, repeated occurrence of"
		"C. glabrata, with or without C. albicans during the hospital treatment, was"
		found. Serology and fungal cultures of these intensive care/oncological patients
		"were indicative of invasive candidosis. In 12 of these 18 patients, there was no"
		evidence of deep-seated candidosis at autopsy. Three patients had a typical
		"aspergillosis of the lungs, which was not diagnosed during their hospital"
		"treatment. In five patients (two of them with an aspergillosis of the lungs), we"
		"found sporadic yeast cells in kidney or lung tissue, characterized by size and"
		missing pseudomycelium as C. glabrata. In no case was a cellular intravital
		"defensive reaction against these yeast cells found. Therefore, we interpreted the"
		demonstration of C. glabrata in tissues as a transitory fungaemia and not as a
		deep-seated C. glabrata mycosis.

AB	-	Echinocandins are commonly used as initial empiric therapy in cases of moderate
		to severe invasive candidiasis. The authors demonstrate that caution should be
		exercised in applying this approach in certain clinical situations. A case of
		Candida glabrata fungemia and associated chorioretinitis that was clinically

		is presented. The authors then briefly review current issues regarding the

AB	-	Results from a cross-sectional observational study on candidemia conducted at
		"Hospital de Clínicas, Federal University of Paraná, are presented. From January"
		"2001 to December 2004, one hundred candidemia cases were evaluated. The incidence"
		"was 1.27 episodes per 1,000 hospitalizations and Candida was the eighth most"
		frequently isolated agent from bloodstream infections. The patients ages ranged
		"from five days to 89 years, with a mean of 32 years. Sixty percent of the cases"
		occurred in adults (66% > 50 years old) and 40% in children (52% < one year old).
		Fifty-nine percent had been admitted to medical wards and 41% to the intensive
		care unit. Candida albicans was the most (59%) frequent species followed by
		Candida tropicalis (15%) and Candida parapsilosis (9%). The most (97%) prevalent
		"coexisting conditions were the use of antibacterial drugs, central venous"
		"catheter (77%), H2 blockers (57%), total parenteral nutrition (49%) and admission"
		"to the intensive care unit (41%). Out of the 51 isolates tested, three of Candida"
		glabrata presented dose-dependent susceptibility to fluconazole and resistance to
		itraconazole. One sample of Candida krusei presented dose-dependent
		susceptibility to fluconazole and one of Candida pelliculosa presented
		"dose-dependent susceptibility to itraconazole. Among the study population, 68%"
		"received antifungal therapy, but the mortality was 56%."

PG	-	82-6
AB	-	"We describe a severe case of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), secondary"
		to a candida glabrata retroperitoneal abscess in a 41-year-old simultaneous
		pancreas-kidney transplantation (SPKT) recipient. Despite percutaneous abscess
		"drainage and antifungal therapy, general status deteriorated with persistent"
		"fever, severe pancytopenia and liver dysfunction. Presence of"
		"hypertriglyceridemia, very high serum levels of ferritin and hemophagocytosis in"
		"a bone-marrow aspirate gave the diagnosis of HLH. Of note, change from tacrolimus"
		to cyclosporine together with dexamethasone produced rapid response with status
		"improvement. We concluded that HLH, a rare but often fatal condition"
		"characterized by excessive activation of lymphocytes and macrophages, is a"
		diagnostic and therapeutic challenge in solid-organ transplanted patients and
		"must be suspected in the presence of fever, blood cytopenia and liver"
		dysfunction. Specific antiinfectious therapy together with cyclosporine and
		dexamethasone may be a therapeutic approach.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Serious infections caused by Torulopsis glabrata, once rarely"
		"encountered, have become common over the last 3 decades. The most frequent"
		"manifestations of serious fungal infections include septicemia, endocarditis,"
		"hepatosplenic infections, and meningitis. We report a case of fungemia and pelvic"
		abscess caused by T glabrata following gynecologic surgery. CASE: A 43-year-old
		"woman developed fever, abdominal pain, and abdominal distention following a total"
		abdominal hysterectomy and right salpingo-oophorectomy. Empirical treatment with
		broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents was not successful. Three sets of blood
		"cultures were positive for T glabrata, and radiologic investigations revealed"
		pelvic and lesser sac fluid collections. Cultures of the pelvic abscess grew T
		"glabrata. Treatment was changed to amphotericin B, with complete clinical"
		recovery. CONCLUSION: Serious T glabrata infections are rare following
		"gynecologic surgery, especially in immunocompetent patients. Given the morbidity"
		"and mortality associated with these infections, aggressive treatment with"
		amphotericin B and drainage of abscesses is warranted.

TI	-	Fungal infection of ventriculoperitoneal shunts in children.
PG	-	1049-53
AB	-	Infection is still the most common complication of shunt procedures in children.
		"However, fungal infection is still considered to be rare. We found that fungi"
		accounted for 17% of shunt infections (8 of 48) in a retrospective study. All of
		the patients were premature babies and had received a ventriculoperitoneal shunt
		because of hydrocephalus. The clinical manifestations were subtle and insidious.
		The time of onset of infection ranged from 1 month to 1 year after the insertion
		of the shunt. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid of infected patients showed
		mild pleocytosis with an elevated protein concentration. Candida species
		"(including Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis, and Candida tropicalis) or"
		"Torulopsis glabrata were isolated. In all but one case, shunts were removed and"
		systemic therapy with amphotericin B was administered. Amphotericin B was given
		"intrathecally to two patients, who did not respond to systemic therapy. Treatment"
		with fluconazole failed for one patient. We suggest performing fungal cultures in
		"cases of shunt infection, especially those involving premature infants."
		"Extraventricular drainage, systemic therapy with amphotericin B, and insertion of"
		a new shunt remain the principal components of the treatment regimen for fungal
		shunt infections in children.

		Candida glabrata: report of a case.
PG	-	651-4
AB	-	A case of active prosthetic valve infective endocarditis (PVE) due to Candida
		glabrata was successfully treated by the systemic administration of fluconazole.
		A 66-year-old Japanese man with infective endocarditis of unknown etiology
		underwent aortic and mitral valve replacement to treat severe aortic and mitral
		regurgitation associated with multiple organ failure. Postsurgical cultures of
		"arterial blood were repeatedly positive for C. glabrata, and therefore"
		fluconazole was administered either intravenously or orally at a dose of 400
		mg/day for 46 days. During that time the signs of inflammation including fever
		such as an elevated white blood cell count and the presence of C-reactive protein
		(CRP) all improved while the blood cultures became negative. Fluconazole is thus
		considered to be effective in treating PVE caused by C. glabrata. When
		"administering this treatment, it is also important to monitor the patient's renal"
		and liver function.

		right eye. «Snowball-like» retinal lesions were found in both eyes on
		examination. Due to a lack of improvement with intravitreal antifungal empirical
		"treatment, vitreous culture was performed and Candida glabrata was isolated. The"
		"patient then received intravitreal amphotericin B, as well as systemic treatment"
		with caspofungin and amphotericin B lipid complex. DISCUSSION: Endogenous fungal
		endophthalmitis is a sight-threatening condition. There are few reports of
		Candida glabrata endogenous endophthalmitis. Treatment regimens for Candida
		"endophthalmitis include combinations of systemic and/or intravitreal antifungals,"
		as well as vitrectomy.

AB	-	PURPOSE: To report 2 cases of exogenous Candida glabrata endophthalmitis after
		penetrating keratoplasty in recipients of corneas from the same donor
		"transplanted on the same day. METHODS: Case reports with ophthalmologic, electron"
		"microscopic, and microbiological findings including fungal strain analysis."
		RESULTS: Two patients developed fungal keratitis and endophthalmitis caused by
		the same C. glabrata strain within 1 day after penetrating keratoplasty of
		corneas from the same donor on the same day. Donor-to-host transmission was
		postulated when eye bank sterility checks were repeatedly negative. CONCLUSIONS:
		"A short death-to-harvesting time, routine donor rim cultures, and respecting of a"
		time interval before transplantation may provide an additional safety feature in
		dealing with corneal tissue from high-risk donors.

AB	-	In order to update the epidemiological and mycological profile of candidaemia in
		"Europe, the European Confederation of Medical Mycology conducted a prospective,"
		"sequential, hospital population-based study from September 1997 to December 1999."
		"A total of 2,089 cases were documented by 106 institutions in seven European"
		"countries. Rates of candidaemia ranging from 0.20 to 0.38 per 1,000 admissions"
		were reported. Candida albicans was identified in 56% of cases. Non-albicans
		Candida species were most frequently isolated from patients with haematological
		"malignancies (65%). With increasing age, an increasing incidence of Candida"
		glabrata was seen. The 30-day mortality rate was 37.9%. The survey results
		"underline the burden of candidaemia in a wide range of patient populations,"
		"confirm the importance of non- albicans species, and provide baseline data for"
		future surveillance studies at a European level.

AB	-	The authors report two cases of interface fungal keratitis following Descemet's
		stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK). Two patients developed
		culture-proven interface keratitis with Candida albicans and Candida glabrata
		following DSAEK. Both patients presented with white interface opacities at
		approximately 1 month after uncomplicated DSAEK. Adjunct confocal microscopy
		identified fungal elements prior to surgical therapy. A penetrating keratoplasty
		was performed in both cases after failed medical therapy with fungal elements
		confirmed by corneal histopathology. Interface fungal keratitis must be
		recognized as a potential complication of endothelial keratoplasty. Surgeons
		should consider corneal donor rim cultures on all endothelial keratopathy cases
		and confocal microscopy on cases with new interface opacities in the early
		postoperative period. These measures may lead to early identification and
		treatment of fungal interface infections.

TI	-	Spontaneous fungal peritonitis (Candida glabrata) in a patient with cirrhosis.
PG	-	362-4
AB	-	We report a case of spontaneous fungal peritonitis in a patient with cirrhosis. A
		70-year-old woman with cirrhosis secondary to autoimmune hepatitis was admitted
		"with fever and abdominal distention. Paracentesis revealed neutrocytosis, and"
		"despite appropriate antibacterial coverage, no clinical improvement was noted and"
		the ascitic fluid white cell count increased on repeat paracentesis. Two
		"consecutive ascitic fluid cultures grew Candida glabrata, and antifungal therapy"
		"with amphotericin was initiated, pending sensitivity of the isolate. Because of"
		"worsening renal function, amphotericin was discontinued and itraconazole was"
		"started, as sensitivity of the isolate was then available. Antifungal therapy"
		resulted in resolution of ascitic fluid neutrocytosis and culture negativity.
		"However, the patient's renal function continued to deteriorate, necessitating"
		"hemodialysis. Despite multiple courses of antibiotics, she died of fulminant"
		sepsis and multiorgan failure.

TI	-	Long-term epidemiological survey of Candida species: comparison of isolates found
		in an intensive care unit and in conventional wards.
PG	-	169-74
AB	-	The aim of this study was to compare the distribution of Candida species in
		patients hospitalized in an intensive care unit (ICU) and in conventional wards.
		A retrospective analysis was performed covering an 18-year period in a 700-bed
		teaching hospital. Various body sites were investigated in all patients admitted
		during the study and isolates were identified by microscopic and macroscopic
		"morphology, and by commercially available kits. The susceptibility of strains to"
		"amphotericin B and flucytosine was assessed by the ATB-fungus system,"
		itraconazole and fluconazole by Etest. No difference was observed between the
		distribution of Candida species in ICU and in conventional wards. Candida
		albicans represented about 70% of isolates and Candida glabrata was the second
		most common species involved in infection or colonization. The small number of C.
		glabrata resistant to fluconazole suggested this antifungal agent as suitable
		empirical treatment for non-immunocompromized patients in whom a fungal infection
		was suspected.

		transplantation.
PG	-	176-9
AB	-	The authors report the case of a 48-year-old man in whom candida (Torulopsis
		glabrata) liver abscesses developed 8 years after liver transplantation. After a
		"week of fever, computed tomography and Doppler ultrasonography showed several"
		fluid-filled loculations in the left lobe of the liver and hepatic arterial
		stenosis. Aspirates from the abscesses contained T. glabrata organisms. This
		complication probably developed because hepatic arterial stenosis resulted in
		"bile infarcts (bilomas), which were contaminated via the biliary tract with"
		candida from the biliary-enteric anastomosis. Catheter drainage and
		administration of amphotericin B for 10 weeks permitted successful
		"retransplantation. T. glabrata liver abscesses, a life threatening complication"
		"that can occur long after liver transplantation, can be successfully managed by"
		aggressive medical treatment followed by retransplantation.

AB	-	"Candida species, including Candida glabrata (CG), are common causes of"
		bloodstream infections among intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Many CG isolates
		have decreased susceptibility to fluconazole. Constructing a scoring model of
		factors associated with CG candidemia in ICU patients that can be used if
		fluconazole susceptibility testing is not readily available. We identified
		patients with candidemia that were admitted to the ICU of the Mayo Clinic in
		"Rochester, Minnesota from 1998 to 2006. Using patient demographical and clinical"
		"data abstracted via chart review, a multivariable logistic regression model was"
		developed to distinguish those with CG candidemia. We identified 246 patients
		with candidemia including 68 CG cases. Multivariable analysis identified four
		"independent factors associated with CG candidemia: absence of renal failure, less"
		"than 7 days in the hospital, abdominal surgery and fluconazole use. The"
		"predictive ability of the model, based on the c-statistic, was 0.727. In a large"
		"ICU cohort, a scoring model that included four risk factors, which are readily"
		"ascertainable at the bedside, was created to distinguish candidemia due to CG"
		from other causes of candidemia. The identification of risk factors associated
		with CG candidemia could aid physicians in the selection of the optimal initial
		antifungal therapy.

TI	-	Keratitis caused by Candida glabrata in a patient with chronic granulomatous
		disease.
PG	-	782-3
AB	-	PURPOSE: To report an unusual ocular presentation of Candida glabrata in a
		patient with chronic granulomatous disease. METHODS: Interventional case report.
		A 15-year-old boy with chronic granulomatous disease presented with bilateral
		limbal infiltrates. He had been receiving broad-spectrum systemic antibiotics for
		recurrent liver abscesses. The keratitis did not respond to antibiotics and did
		not resolve after a course of topical steroids. RESULTS: Corneal cultures
		revealed Candida glabrata. The same species was simultaneously isolated from the
		surgical drainage of the liver abscesses. The ocular and hepatic findings
		resolved on intravenous amphotericin B. CONCLUSION: Candida glabrata has recently
		emerged as an important nosocomial pathogen. It may present as a limbal keratitis
		in the setting of systemic infection.

AB	-	We report the case of a 61-year-old female with Crohn's disease dependent on
		total parenteral nutrition who developed a central venous catheter bloodstream
		"infection and septic arthritis, complicated further by osteomyelitis and"
		persistent Candida glabrata fungemia. Fluconazole treatment led to persistent
		"infection, and micafungin therapy failed with development of FKS-associated"
		resistance. Infection responded after initiation of amphotericin B plus
		"voriconazole. Echinocandin resistance is increasingly recognized, suggesting a"
		role for alternative antifungal therapies.

TI	-	Intracardiac giant cells after left ventricular assist device placement.
PG	-	417-20
AB	-	Multinucleated giant cells are seen in the heart in several distinct pathologic
		"conditions, including giant cell myocarditis, sarcoidosis and infectious"
		etiologies. We describe the first report of solitary multinucleated giant cells
		scattered throughout the heart after placement of a left ventricular assist
		device (LVAD) and transient Candida glabrata infection. The pathologic findings
		were noted in the explanted heart of a patient undergoing orthotopic cardiac
		transplantation 7 months after LVAD surgery. The presence of solitary giant cells
		without adjacent inflammation was a distinct histologic finding in this case. An
		awareness of this entity is important to avoid making a diagnosis of a more
		"severe giant cell-related pathologic disease, which may recur in a transplanted"
		heart.

AB	-	Acute emphysematous pyelonephritis (AEP) is a severe form of urinary tract
		infection. It occurs usually in diabetics. The most concerned agents are the
		Gram-negative bacilli. We report a first case of bilateral AEP due to Candida
		"glabrata, occurred in a 64-year-old diabetic woman. The clinical presentation"
		"started with fever and abdominal pains, without signs of urinary tract infection."
		"Within six hours, the patient had developed a septic shock with renal failure and"
		ketoacidosis. The diagnosis was confirmed by CT scan and the pathogen was
		"isolated in urine. Despite antibiotic and antifungal treatment, she died from a"
		septic shock. Acute emphysematous pyelonephritis due to Candida species is rare.
		"However, the addition of antifungal therapy seems justified if a severe"
		emphysematous pyelonephritis is associated with risk factors of Candida
		infection.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive fungal diseases have increased in recent years. Candida
		"species are the most common aetiology. Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis,"
		"Candida tropicalis, Candida glabrata and Candida krusei are the cause of most of"
		them. The aim of this work is to describe the first isolation of Candida fabianii
		in the blood of a non-neonatal paediatric patient. CASE REPORT: A 2 year-old male
		"with short bowel syndrome, severe malnutrition, and hypophosphataemic rickets"
		deficiency was admitted to paediatric intensive care due to a respiratory tract
		infection and suspicion of an intestinal pseudo-obstruction. He received several
		cycles of broad-spectrum antibiotics for several infections due to Pseudomonas
		aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. After the surgical correction of the intestinal
		disorder he suffered a new episode of sepsis where yeasts were isolated by
		culture. The species identification was performed by means of mass spectrometry
		"(MALDI-TOF system, Bruker Daltonic). The identity of the isolate was C.fabianii"
		(anamorph)/Pichia fabianii (teleomorph) with a score of 2.149. Antifungal
		"treatment with caspofungin was prescribed, with good progress of the patient."
		CONCLUSIONS: Molecular techniques are important for the identification of these
		"species, although mass spectrometry offered a reliable and rapid diagnosis."
		Treatment with caspofungin was effective.

TI	-	Selection of resistant fungi in liver transplant recipients during use of newer
		antifungal agents -- a report of two cases.
PG	-	287-90
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Because invasive fungal infections cause significant morbidity and
		"mortality in liver transplant recipients, the use of antifungal prophylaxis, and"
		"the early empirical use of antifungal agents, is widespread on liver transplant"
		units. The new-generation azoles such as voriconazole and the echinocandins have
		been welcome additions to the antifungal armamentarium. These agents have become
		"the leading options for prophylaxis in liver transplant units, despite the"
		absence of strong data for their efficacy in this setting. CLINICAL PICTURE: We
		report two recipients of living-donor liver transplants who became
		infected/colonised with fungi resistant to an echinocandin and the azoles after
		exposure to these agents. One patient developed trichosporonosis while on
		caspofungin and the other became infected/ colonised with Candida glabrata that
		was resistant to voriconazole and posaconazole. CONCLUSION: We report these to
		highlight some of the consequences of using the newer antifungal agents.

		"Medical Mycology (FIMUA) from September 1997 to December 1999. In total, 569"
		"episodes were reported with an overall rate of 0.38/1000 admissions, 4.4/100000"
		patient days. Predisposing factors included presence of an intravascular catheter
		"(89%), antibiotic treatment (88%), surgery (56%), intensive care (45%), solid"
		"tumour (28%), steroid treatment (15%), haematological malignancy (7%), HIV"
		"infection (6%), fetal immaturity (4%). Mucous membrane colonization preceded"
		"candidaemia in 83% of patients. Candida albicans was identified in 58% of cases,"
		"followed by Candida parapsilosis (15%), Candida glabrata (13%), Candida"
		"tropicalis (6%). Septic shock occurred in 95 patients. Crude mortality was 35%,"
		"the highest in C. tropicalis fungaemia (44%), the elderly (64%) and solid tumour"
		cancer patients (43%). Intravascular catheter removal was associated with higher
		survival rate (71 vs. 47%). This survey underscores the importance of candidaemia
		in hospital settings.

TI	-	Analysis of Candida glabrata strains with reduced sensitivity to micafungin in
		vitro isolated from a patient with persistent Candidemia.
PG	-	332-7
AB	-	We report the appearance of Candida glabrata strains with reduced sensitivity
		during treatment with the echinocandin drug micafungin (MCF). Four C. glabrata
		"strains were isolated from sputum, gastric juice, and blood taken from a patient"
		"during hospitalization. Two of these strains, one of which was obtained after"
		treatment with MCF for suspected Candida pneumonia and the other of which was
		"obtained during MCF treatment for candidemia, were isolated from blood and found"
		to have a reduced susceptibility to MCF. These two clinical isolates showed a
		"high minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for MCF, with this change in MIC"
		being unique for MCF among established antifungal drugs. To further investigate
		"the mechanism underlying this reduced sensitivity, an in vivo mouse infection"
		model and in vitro enzymatic analysis were performed. MCF had little effect in
		the mouse disseminated infection model and enzymatic analysis showed the low
		"affinity of MCF to the 1,3-Beta-D-glucan synthase of the clinical isolates,"
		although the enzymes of both clinical isolates and control strain were
		"noncompetitively inhibited by MCF. Taken together, this low affinity of MCF for"
		the enzymes is likely to cause the reduced sensitivities. These data further
		indicate that MCF could induce acquired MCF-resistant strains during clinical
		use.

TI	-	Fungal infection of the epiglottis simulating a clinical malignancy.
PG	-	124-6
AB	-	Primary fungal infection of the larynx is rare. We present a case of primary
		laryngeal invasive fungal infection in a patient with Felty syndrome. The lesion
		in the epiglottis resembled a malignant process and the whole epiglottis was
		excised endoscopically. No neoplasia was found and the cultures of the epiglottis
		grew Candida glabrata. We propose that the diagnosis of laryngeal candidiasis be
		"considered in adult patients with certain predisposing factors, eg,"
		"immunodeficiency syndromes, but the possibility of underlying malignancy must be"
		ruled out.

		following coinfection by Candida glabrata and Candida albicans is reported.
		Genomic random amplified polymorphic DNA typing suggested that the Candida

		strengthens the evidence that Candida species other than Candida albicans can be
		involved in the pathogenesis of disseminated candidiasis in heroin addicts.

		woman developed Torulopsis glabrata osteomyelitis during a course of prolonged
		antibiotic therapy for staphylococcal pneumonia that occurred as a postoperative
		complication of a total knee arthroplasty for osteoarthritis. Roentgenograms and
		a biopsy sample revealed a destructive inflammatory lesion of the vertebrae. The

AB	-	We describe the first case of infection of a neurosurgical shunt by Candida
		"glabrata in an adult. The risk factors, clinical picture and response to therapy"
		have been similar to similar cases caused by other Candida sp. We must emphasize
		the unequivocal features of infection and the rapid and probably complete
		response to removal of the device.

AB	-	We identified a case of breakthrough candidemia in a 25-year-old patient
		receiving micafungin prophylaxis (50 mg/day). Five Candida glabrata isolates were
		"obtained from blood cultures and were classified as multidrug-resistant isolates,"
		since all of them exhibited high MICs for echinocandin and azole drugs. A
		mutation (S663F) in hot spot 1 of the FKS2 gene was found in all five isolates.
		"This mutation yielded a 1,3-β-D-glucan synthase enzyme with highly reduced"
		sensitivities to echinocandin drugs.

PG	-	81-4
LID	-	10.1016/j.riam.2012.03.004 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candida peritonitis in postoperative patients is an independent
		predictor of mortality. Empirical early antifungal therapy should be started in
		"these patients, since according to the results of studies in patients with"
		"candidemia, this has an impact on the prognosis. The treatment recommended by"
		clinical practice guidelines in patients with haemodynamic instability are
		"candins, but they do not make explicit recommendations for patients with"
		"dysfunction of other organs, or high lactate levels. CASE REPORT: A case of"
		rescue treatment with anidulafungin in a patient with candidemia and Candida
		"glabrata peritonitis postoperative haemodynamically stable, but with an acute"
		"renal failure and elevated plasma lactate, is reported. We discuss the antifungal"
		treatment recommendations established by clinical practice guidelines.
		CONCLUSIONS: One conclusion based on this case is that the haemodynamic
		instability as a marker of severe sepsis must be equated with dysfunction of any
		organ and/or a plasma lactate level ≥ 2.5 mmol/l in order to advocate candins as
		"an antifungal treatment. In addition, it should be emphasised that anidulafungin"
		was effective in a clinically difficult patient with candidemia and Candida
		"peritonitis, even when used as late rescue antifungal treatment."

AB	-	The incidence of disseminated candidiasis is increasing. Liver involvement is
		frequent but rarely diagnosed. The authors report a case of disseminated
		candidiasis due to Candida glabrata with liver metastases. The presence of
		hepatic lesions was diagnosed by CT scan and parasitological examination of liver
		abscess contents obtained by CT-scan-directed puncture-aspiration. The outcome
		was favorable with amphotericin-B (cumulative dose of 1 g) and flucytosin.
		"Aspects of hepatic involvement in disseminated candidiasis is discussed, together"
		with the role of Candida glabrata in pathology of this type.

		keratoplasty.
PG	-	13-Aug
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To attempt to identify common events or factors in four cases of
		endophthalmitis that developed after penetrating keratoplasty performed within a
		1-week interval. DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: Tertiary care eye hospital in
		"Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. PATIENTS: Four patients in whom endophthalmitis developed"
		after penetrating keratoplasty performed in May 1993. OUTCOME MEASURES: Source of
		"donor tissue, transportation of corneas, handling of corneas at the eye hospital,"
		and causative organism and sensitivity profile. RESULTS: The donor tissue in all
		four cases originated from the same eye bank. Organisms were cultured from 10 of
		the 11 donor rims from eye bank A tissue used during the week in question. The
		causative organisms were Enterococcus faecalis in three patients and Torulopsis
		glabrata in one patient. In each case the same organism was cultured from the
		recipient eye and the corresponding donor rim. Two of the four patients had a
		favourable outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Donor rim culture is essential if the cause of
		endophthalmitis after penetrating keratoplasty is to be determined. Close
		"communication between eye bank personnel, the microbiology laboratory and the"
		"operating surgeon is important as it may influence early detection, choice of"
		treatment and outcome of endophthalmitis after penetrating keratoplasty.
		Epidemiologic studies from both the source eye bank and the recipient facility
		are required to fully investigate the cause of a cluster of endophthalmitis cases
		from contaminated donor tissue following penetrating keratoplasty.

		nystatin].
PG	-	959-63
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: The rates of Candida species and susceptibility to nystatin were
		"evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the period from January 1, 1998 to December"
		"31, 1998 mycological tests have been carried out for identification of yeast"
		species in the group of pregnant and delivering women hospitalized in the
		Obstetrics-Gynecological Departments of the Municipal Hospital in Bydgoszcz. We
		used two commercial media: Albicans ID and CHROMagar Candida. Noted have been 389
		positive inoculation results for Candida from vaginal secretions. RESULTS AND
		CONCLUSIONS: From the total number of 416 differentiated fungus strains decidedly
		dominant was the species Candida albicans--constituting 81.97% of all strains.
		The second frequently occurring fungus species was Candida glabrata--11.06%.
		"Further species were C. krusei--2.16%, C. tropicalis--1.20% and C."
		guilliermondii--1.20%. In 10 cases (2.41%)--in spite of carrying out the
		laboratory activities that are necessary in such a situation--the species type of
		tested strains could not be determined. The simultaneous occurrence of two
		Candida species has been noted in material originating from 27 women (6.94% of
		cases). Defining the drug-resistance of 93 Candida species strains against
		nystatin by means of the disk-diffusion method--it has been started that this
		drug is highly effective--81.72% of sensitive strains.

		replacement: a potential role for caspofungin in the induction and maintenance
		treatment.
PG	-	e70-3
AB	-	Conventional antifungal therapy for fungal endocarditis has been associated with
		"a poor cure rate. Therefore, combined medical and surgical therapy has been"
		"recommended. However, new potent antifungal agents, such as echinocandins, could"
		"increase the medical options and, in some cases, avoid the need for surgery. We"
		report a case of Candida endocarditis treated successfully without valve
		"replacement with intravenous liposomal amphotericin B (total dose, 4 g) and"
		intravenous caspofungin (a 100-mg loading dose followed by 50 mg per day for 8
		weeks) as induction therapy and intravenous caspofungin (100 mg 3 times per week
		for 12 weeks) as maintenance therapy.

TI	-	Clones of Lactobacillus casei and Torulopsis glabrata associated with recurrent
		abdominal wall abscess.
PG	-	356-60
AB	-	Infectious disease caused by Lactobacillus sp has not been previously reported in
		Taiwan. We present a case of recurrent abdominal wall abscess in a chronically
		"ill 36-year-old woman, and review the literature on Lactobacillus infection. Five"
		"isolates of L. casei were recovered from blood and pus samples, and two isolates"
		of Torulopsis glabrata were isolated from two blood specimens 3 months apart. Two
		clones of L. casei and T. glabrata were identified by means of antibiotyping with
		the E test and molecular methods. The abscess was surgically removed because of
		poor response to 7 months of antimicrobial therapy for the second infectious
		episode. Recurrent Lactobacillus infection can occur in chronically ill or
		immunosuppressed patients. Treatment of these infections may require a longer
		"duration of antibiotic therapy, or surgical intervention."

TI	-	Fatal outcome of disseminated candidosis after allogeneic bone marrow
		transplantation under treatment with liposomal and conventional amphotericin-B. A
		report of 4 cases with determination of the Mic values.
PG	-	313-6
AB	-	Four patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation were treated with
		liposomal (3 patients) and conventional (one patient) amphotericin-B for
		"disseminated candidosis. Candida krusei was isolated from 3, and C. glabrata from"
		1 patient. The patients were treated with liposomal amphotericin-B in doses from
		3 to 5 mg/kg. The fourth patient received conventional amphotericin-B in a
		reduced dose due to renal impairment. The patients died from multiorgan failure
		"due to disseminated fungal infection. In 1 case, the switch to the conventional"
		"drug resulted in clearance before death. The 3 fungus isolates, together with the"
		fourth strain obtained from patient no. 4 without any exposition to liposomal
		"amphotericin-B were tested for their susceptibility to conventional, liposomal"
		and discoidal amphotericin-B. All strains showed good sensitivity to the
		conventional and discoidal drug. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of
		liposomal amphotericin-B were 1 to 3 titre steps higher indicating a reduced
		sensitivity of the tested strains to this preparation. We conclude that the use
		of liposomal amphotericin-B is recommended mainly on the base of the low
		"incidence of side-effects. Intensive microbial resistance tests, pharmacokinetic"
		investigations and randomized studies are necessary before the conventional drug
		is replaced as the gold standard for systemic antimycotic therapy.

AB	-	Fungal endocarditis is an exceedingly rare complication of indwelling central
		venous catheters in adults. Here we describe what appears to be the first case of
		a right atrial thrombus superinfected with the yeast Torulopsis (Candida)
		glabrata and attached to an indwelling superior vena cava catheter that was not
		used for parenteral nutrition. A large vegetation-like mass adherent to the
		catheter tip was visualized by transesophageal echocardiography in a patient who
		"presented with signs of septic pulmonary embolism. Following open-heart surgery,"
		the definitive diagnosis was established by histopathologic examination of the
		surgical specimen.

TI	-	Fungal retinitis: a case of Torulopsis glabrata infection treated with
		miconazole.
PG	-	672-5
AB	-	Presumptive embolic chorioretinal Torulopsis glabrata infection is described in a
		patient who had received prolonged intravenous antibiotic therapy. The ocular
		findings are compared and contrasted with embolic lesions due to Candida
		albicans. The patient was treated for 6 weeks with intravenous miconazole. During
		"this time there was shrinkage of the ocular lesions, some improvement in vision"
		and abolition of fungaemia. Improvement in tests of immune function during
		treatment suggests that an early immunological deficit was secondary to the
		infection. Intravenous miconazole is a relatively nontoxic alternative to
		amphotericin and deserves further evaluation in the treatment of ocular mycosis.

AB	-	We report a case of Candida glabrata perinephric abscess in a patient with
		diabetes mellitus who recently underwent ureteropelvic surgery for lithiasic
		urinary tract obstruction. Surgical drainage and amphotericin B treatment led to
		resolution of the infection. C. glabrata urinary infection has become more
		prevalent over the last decade in immunocompromised patients. Drainage is
		indicated for development of a fungal abscess in the perinephric area. Most
		authors recommend administration of an antifungal adjuvant treatment.

AB	-	The cases of four liver transplant recipients who developed invasive candidiasis
		"(2 cholangitis, 1 perihepatic abscess, 1 candidemia) due to azole-resistant,"
		Candida glabrata are reported. Three patients were receiving azolic compounds (2
		"itraconazole, 1 fluconazole) when the infection was diagnosed. All four patients"
		received fluconazole as intestinal decontamination during the first three weeks
		post transplantation. The infections occurred two months after transplantation in
		"all patients, and in one patient Candida infection was the direct cause of death."
		Infection of the biliary tree was the origin of candidiasis in three patients;
		the fourth patient developed neutropenic-related candidemia. Fluconazole MICs
		"exceeded 16 micrograms/ml in all cases; itraconazole MICs were 16, 2, 1, and 2"
		"micrograms/ml, respectively. The potential role of Candida species other than"
		albicans in these patients after administration of azole agents is discussed.

TI	-	Occurrence of yeast bloodstream infections between 1987 and 1995 in five Dutch
		university hospitals.
PG	-	909-12
AB	-	The aim of this study was to identify retrospectively trends in fungal
		bloodstream infections in The Netherlands in the period from 1987 to 1995.
		"Results of over 395,000 blood cultures from five Dutch university hospitals were"
		"evaluated. Overall, there were more than 12 million patient days of care during"
		"the nine-year study period. The rate of candidemia doubled in the study period,"
		"reaching an incidence of 0.71 episodes per 10,000 patient days in 1995. The"
		general increase in candidemia was paralleled by an increase in non-Candida
		"albicans bloodstream infections, mainly due to Candida glabrata. However, more"
		than 60% of the infections were caused by Candida albicans. Fluconazole-resistant
		species such as Candida krusei did not emerge during the study period. The
		increasing rate of candidemia found in Dutch university hospitals is similar to
		"the trend observed in the USA, but the rate is lower and the increase is less"
		pronounced.

AB	-	Episodes of candida infection at a teaching hospital were investigated. During a
		"3-year period from 1998 to 2000, there were 53 cases of candidaemia. Candida"
		"albicans (64.2 %) was the most common causative species, followed by Candida"
		glabrata (17.0 %) and Candida parapsilosis (15.1 %). Molecular analysis of a
		cluster of eight infections from a single unit was performed using Southern
		blotting with Ca3 probe hybridization. This showed that the patients were each
		"infected by unrelated strains of C. albicans. On occasion, isolates were found to"
		"be closely related within individual patients. Following Southern blot analysis,"
		it was concluded that the infections were not part of an outbreak caused by a
		"single, epidemic strain."

PG	-	969-70
AB	-	Fungi are becoming increasingly common nosocomial pathogens in the neonatal
		"intensive care patient. The fungus Torulopsis glabrata, a common skin inhabitant,"
		is a potential pathogen in the high-risk neonate. In this report we have reviewed
		the cases of two infants in which systemic T glabrata infection was diagnosed.
		One patient survived without apparent sequelae; the other died before diagnosis
		and initiation of therapy. Five other cases of systemic infection by T glabrata
		"in neonates have been reported previously, with only one survivor. Early"
		recognition and treatment of this nearly uniformly fatal infection is imperative.

PG	-	691-9
AB	-	"The objective of this case-control study, conducted in a large Italian university"
		"hospital over a 12-month period, was to evaluate the risk factors associated with"
		the emergence of azole resistant oral candidosis in 64 Human Immunodeficiency
		Virus (HIV) infected patients. A swab was obtained from each patient by brushing
		"candidal lesions. Candida albicans was isolated in 41 patients (64%), Candida"
		"glabrata in ten (16%), Candida krusei in five (8%), Candida kefyr in two (3%),"
		"Candida tropicalis in two (3%), and Candida lipolytica and Candida guilliermondii"
		"in one case, respectively. Two patients suffered a double infection i.e. C."
		"albicans+C. krusei and C. albicans+C. glabrata, respectively. Candida species"
		"were tested in vitro for their susceptibility to ketoconazole, fluconazole,"
		itraconazole and amphotericin B. MICs of the four antifungal drugs were obtained
		for each yeast using a microdilution broth method developed in our laboratory.
		Twenty four (37%) of the isolated strains were resistant both to itraconazole and
		"fluconazole, five (8%) to fluconazole alone, and two (3%) to ketoconazole alone,"
		while none of the isolated strains was resistant to amphotericin B. Patients with
		oral candidosis caused by a strain resistant to one or more azole drug were
		compared to control patients with azole-susceptible oral candidosis. On
		"univariate analysis, more than five episodes of oral candidosis in the last year"
		"(P = 0.01), previous use of azole therapy (P = 0.001), C2-3 category of HIV"
		infection (P = 0.01) and low number of circulating CD4+ T-cells (P = 0.03) were
		significantly associated with an increased risk for the development of azole
		"resistance. However, previous use of azole therapy was the only factor selected"
		by a stepwise logistic regression analysis which was independently associated
		with the isolation of azole resistant strains (P = 0.003). Our findings indicate
		"that, in view of the potential risk for the emergence and selection of azole"
		"resistant strains of Candida in patients with AIDS, it is important to carefully"
		choose the antifungal drug for the therapy of mild fungal infections after
		evaluation of the in-vitro susceptibility of the isolated strains.

PG	-	670-5
LID	-	10.3855/jidc.2623 [doi]
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Bloodstream infections due to Candida species are becoming a major
		cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. The spectrum of
		"candidemia has changed with the emergence of non-albicans Candida species,"
		especially among critically ill patients. METHODOLOGY: In a retrospective study
		"(July 2009 to December 2009) on candidemia, various Candida species isolated from"
		blood cultures were characterized and studied along with the determination of
		"their antifungal susceptibility to amphotericin B, itraconazole, and fluconazole"
		by Etest. Probable risk factors for patients in the intensive care unit (ICU)
		"presenting with candidemia were also analyzed. RESULTS: During the study period,"
		"a total of 4651 samples were received, out of which 468 samples (10.06%) were"
		positive for growth of organisms: 441 (94.20%) aerobic bacterial pathogens and 27
		(5.79%) Candida species. The most common Candida spp. isolate was C. tropicalis
		"(40.8%) followed by C. albicans (29.6%), C. glabrata (18.5%) and others (11.1%)."
		"Out of the 27 Candida strains, 24 (88.9%) were isolated from patients treated in"
		"the ICU. Among these, association of previous use of broad-spectrum antibiotics"
		in 22 patients (91.6%) and central line catheter insertion in 20 patients (83.3%)
		were found to be statistically significant as compared to non-candidemia patients
		(p <0.05). Antifungal susceptibility testing of the isolates revealed a lower
		level of drug resistance to amphotericin B (18.5% of the isolates) versus 77.8%
		"resistance to fluconazole. CONCLUSION: Rapid changes in the rate of infection,"
		"potential risk factors, and emergence of non-albicans Candida demand continued"
		surveillance of this serious bloodstream fungal infection.

AB	-	We isolated and identified yeasts from burn wounds and evaluated the ability of
		Candida parapsilosis isolates from burn wounds to penetrate an acellular dermal
		matrix (ADM). A prospective study was conducted with patients from the burn
		"treatment center of North Paraná University Hospital in Londrina, Brazil from"
		February 2015 to January 2016. Yeast cultures were obtained from the tissue of
		burn wounds that had been debrided and cleansed with 2% chlorhexidine. After
		"identification and confirmation of the purity of the culture, the yeasts were"
		placed on ADM fragments and incubated for three or seven days. During the study
		"period, 273 patients were treated, and 36 of these patients fulfilled the"
		inclusion criteria and provided samples for culture. Yeasts were isolated in
		"19.44% (n = 7) of the cultures, and the following species were identified: C."
		"parapsilosis (57.1%), C. albicans (28.6%), and C. glabrata (14.3%). C."
		"parapsilosis, the most frequent species, was chosen for the ADM tests. We"
		demonstrated active penetration of the ADM by the yeast isolates from burn
		"wounds. C. parapsilosis grew on ADM and penetrated the matrix, indicating that"
		"this yeast, which is common in skin and cutaneous wounds, has the potential to"
		"colonize and pass through ADM, a medical device that is frequently used to dress"
		and regenerate burn wounds.

AB	-	BACKGROUND Candida albicans is the principal human fungal opportunistic organism
		commonly detected in the gastrointestinal and genitourinary systems. Five species
		"of candida (Glabrata, Tropicalis, Albicans, Parapsilosis, and Kruzei) are"
		"responsible for most cases of invasive candidiasis or candidemia, which is a"
		"growing public health concern due to the increasing complexity of patients,"
		leading to a high fatality rate. CASE REPORT We report an extremely rare case of
		"candida pericarditis due to esophagopericardial fistula in a young, heavy,"
		"alcoholic adult diagnosed by culture of the drained pericardial fluid, which"
		showed a growth of Candida albicans. CONCLUSIONS We highlight the first case of
		candida pericarditis in immunocompetent adult successfully treated by
		pericardiocentesis and oral fluconazole.

AB	-	The use of improved microbiological procedures associated with molecular
		"techniques has increased the identification of Candida bloodstream infections,"
		even if the isolation of more than one species by culture methods remains
		uncommon. We report the cases of two children presenting with severe
		gastrointestinal disorders and other risk factors that contribute to Candida
		"infections. In the first patient, C. albicans DNA was initially detected by a"
		"nested-amplification and C. tropicalis was found later during hospitalization,"
		"while blood cultures were persistently negative. In the second child, there was"
		"amplification of C. albicans and C. glabrata DNA in the same samples, but blood"
		cultures yielded only C. albicans. Both patients received antifungal therapy but
		had unfavorable outcomes. These two cases illustrate that PCR was more successful
		than culture methods in detecting Candida in the bloodstream of high risk
		"children, and was also able to detect the presence of more than one species in"
		the same patient that might impact therapy when the fungi are resistant to azole
		compounds.

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the epidemiology of
		"candidemia, the fungal susceptibility, the first-line therapy and the morality"
		rate over 5 years. Knowing the differences of the yeasts in the candidemia local
		"epidemiology, is essential to obtain information on fungal epidemiology to adapt"
		antifungal strategies. MATERIALS/METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted
		from January 2014 to December 2018. The susceptibility of the Candida strains
		"were tested for amphotericin B, caspofungin, voriconazole and fluconazole."
		"RESULTS: The 304 strains were isolated from 290 patients (40 patients in 2014, 65"
		"in 2015, 72 in 2016, 62 in 2017 and 51 in 2018). The three most common Candida"
		"spp isolated from blood cultures were Candida albicans (44%), Candida glabrata"
		(22%) and Candida parapsilosis (13%). The proportion of non-albicans Candida
		decreased from 68% in 2014 to 45% in 2018. C. albicans and C. parapsilosis were
		"to the four antifungals tested. As first-line therapy, 60% of patients received"
		caspofungin and 26% fluconazole. There was no significant difference in the
		"mortality between the two arms of patients (, 27% and 21%, p = 0.47 at 30 days"
		respectively). Thirty day all-cause mortality was 31% and it decreased from 2014
		(46%) to 2018 (18%). CONCLUSIONS: We report that the absence of antifungal
		resistance of our C. albicans and C. parapsilosis candidemia suggests possible
		treatment after MALDI-TOF identification with fluconazole as first-line therapy
		"in our hospital, as soon as possible and while continuing to perform the"
		antifungal test.

AB	-	Candida nivariensis is a cryptic fungal species classified within the Candida
		glabrata complex. It was described for the first time in 2005 by the means of DNA
		sequencing. We report a rare case of C. nivariensis deep-seated infection
		occurring in a 77-year-old man hospitalized for cysto-prostatectomy. Phenotypic
		testing based on the direct examination and the macroscopic features of the in
		"vitro culture initially suggested C. glabrata species, while MALDI-TOF mass"
		spectrometry enables correct identification. The isolate was found resistant to
		"fluconazole, like in almost 20% of the reported cases. Herein, we present our"
		"practical strategy to reliably characterize this rare cryptic species. To date,"
		MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry-based analysis showed very good results for such a
		purpose.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive candidiasis (IC) is the most common cause of invasive fungal
		infections. Identification of risk factors for such infection may help in the
		empirical therapeutic decision-making process. We conducted this study to
		characterize the clinical epidemiology of such infection and to differentiate
		risk factors between Candida albicans and Candida non-albicans species. METHODS:
		"We retrospectively evaluated patients with IC from 2011 to 2013. Clinical data,"
		"antibiotic therapy, underlying condition, and invasive procedures were analyzed"
		and compared between C. albicans and C. non-albicans species. RESULTS: C.
		albicans was the most frequently isolated Candida species (48.6% of all IC
		"patients), although C. non-albicans spp. were more commonly isolated overall. C."
		"albicans, Candida tropicalis, and Candida parapsilosis have a high susceptibility"
		"rate to all antifungal agents (>90%), whereas Candida glabrata showed decreased"
		susceptibility to fluconazole and itraconazole. Amphotericin B demonstrated
		excellent antifungal activity against all Candida species. Univariate analyses
		showed that IC patients with C. albicans had a higher ratio of older age
		"(p = 0.008), solid tumor (p = 0.029), and hypoproteinemia (p = 0.019), whereas"
		those with C. non-albicans spp. had a higher ratio of hospital length of stay
		"(p = 0.005), usage of corticosteroids (p = 0.011), duration on corticosteroids"
		"(p = 0.005), chemotherapy (p = 0.022), hematologic malignancy (p = 0.039),"
		"neutropenia (p = 0.030), and usage of glycopeptides (p = 0.002). Multivariate"
		analyses showed that a significant predictor of IC due to C. albicans was
		"hypoproteinemia [odds ratio (95% confidence interval) = 2.133 (1.164-3.908),"
		p = 0.014]. CONCLUSION: C. albicans was the most frequently isolated Candida
		species. The risk factors between C. albicans and C. non-albicans species are
		different.

		(14.5%) and Candida glabrata which was isolated from only four (4.8%) patients.
		Presence of a urethral catheter (odds ratio [OR] 2.38; 95% confidence interval
		"[CI] 1.09-5.19; P = 0.02), previous use of antibiotics (OR 2.61; 95% CI"
		"1.05-6.46; P = 0.03), RBC transfusions (OR 2.14; 95% CI 1.16-3.94; P = 0.01) and"
		parenteral nutrition (OR 4.44; 95% CI 2.43-8.11; P < 0.01) were found as
		independent risk factors for candidemia. TPN (Total Parenteral Nutrition) was an
		independent risk factor for both C. albicans and non-Candida albicans Candida
		species (P < 0.001). Most of the risk factors were invasive procedures and former
		medications. We conclude that a great number of candidemia cases are preventable
		by means of reduction of unnecessary invasive procedures and the use of

TI	-	[A case of chronic mucocutaneous candidasis cured with micafungin].
PG	-	143-8
AB	-	Chronic mucocutaneous candidasis (CMC) is a chronic intractable infection of
		"skin, nails, and mucous membrane with Candida. Until very recently, the main stay"
		of therapy had been the use of transfer factor or antifungal azole derivatives.
		"Although they show definite benefits, the effects are temporal and recurrences"
		"are inevitable. Furthermore, the prolonged use of antifungals will sometimes"
		"induce resistant strains, making the treatment more difficult. Recently we"
		experienced a case of CMC caused by resistant Candida spp. and treated it
		"successfully with a new antifungal agent, micafungin (MCFG). The patient is a"
		"37-year-old woman. She was eight month, her tongue was covered with a white coat."
		"Two months later, intractable cutaneous eruptions appeared on the head and back"
		and the diagnosis of CMC was made. Since then she has been treated on multiple
		"occasions with transfer factor, recombinant IL-2, ketoconazole or clotrimazole."
		"She was referred to us because of esophageal candidiasis. On admission, oral and"
		esophageal mucous membranes were thickly coated with white pseudomembranes. The
		titer of Candida antigen test was less than twice ; plasma beta-D-gulcan was
		20.14 pg/mL ; and CD4 was 376/microL. A few Candida albicans and (1+) Candida
		glabrata were cultured from oral swab. Both species were resistant to
		itraconazole but sensitive to MCFG and amphotericin B (MIC: < 0.03microg/ml for
		both). A drip infusion of MCFG (75mg/day) was started and three days later the
		"oral lesions disappeared. At the end of a 2-week course of i. v. MCFG, the"
		interior of the esophagus was clear. No recurrence was noted in one month. Less
		"toxic than amphotericin B, MCFG will be a drug of choice in patients infected"
		with azole-resistant fungi. To avoid the abuse of MCFG and the development of the
		"resistant strains, the susceptibility test is recommended in every case of"
		systemic candidiasis.

		"amphotericin, caspofungin, and a novel monoclonal antibody specific for candidal"
		"heat shock protein 90 (Mycograb, Neutec Pharma, Manchester, UK). DESIGN: Case"
		report. SETTING: Pediatric intensive care unit in a tertiary care children's
		"hospital. PATIENT: A 7-yr-old male with a history of global developmental delay,"
		"epilepsy, and gastroesophageal reflux, who presented to the emergency department"
		with a transdiaphragmatic herniation of bowel and subsequent Candida glabrata
		infection. INTERVENTIONS: Efungumab 1 mg/kg twice daily for 5 days. MEASUREMENTS
		"AND MAIN RESULTS: C-reactive protein fell from 225 mg/L to 99 mg/L, and"
		physiological monitoring parameters improved when Mycograb was used in
		conjunction with high-dose antifungals. CONCLUSIONS: Mycograb therapy was well
		"tolerated, but further experience with this therapy in children is needed."

PG	-	60-6
AB	-	A case initially presenting as chronic hyperplastic candidosis is described.
		After treatment with nystatin on three separate occasions over a seven-year
		"period, a lesion similar to that diagnosed originally occurred in the same site."
		Further examination of this later occurrence showed it to be associated with the
		imperfect fungus Candida glabrata which had a high minimum inhibitory
		concentration for nystatin (greater than 30 micrograms/ml). The lesion eventually
		resolved following treatment with miconazole gel and surgical excision of the
		hyperplastic tissue. The patient has remained symptomless for a two-year
		follow-up period.

TI	-	Molecular and phenotypic analysis of Candida dubliniensis: a recently identified
		species linked with oral candidosis in HIV-infected and AIDS patients.
PG	-	S96-101
AB	-	"The discovery and characterisation of a novel species of Candida, termed Candida"
		"dubliniensis, associated with oral candidosis in HIV-infected individuals is"
		described. These organisms share several phenotypic characteristics in common
		"with Candida albicans and Candida stellatoidea, including the ability to produce"
		"germ tubes and chlamydospores. However, in contrast to these latter two species,"
		"C. dubliniensis isolates produce abundant chlamydospores, which are often"
		"arranged in contiguous pairs, triplets and other multiples suspended from a"
		single suspensor cell. They belong to C. albicans serotype A and exhibit atypical
		substrate assimilation profiles. Genomic DNA fingerprinting analysis with the C.
		albicans-specific probe 27A and five different oligonucleotide probes consisting
		"of short repeat sequence-containing motifs, demonstrated that C. dubliniensis has"
		a distinct genomic organisation relative to C. albicans and C. stellatoidea. This
		was confirmed by karyotype analysis and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)
		analysis. Comparison of 500 bp of the V3 variable region of the large ribosomal
		subunit genes from 14 separate C. dubliniensis isolates and the corresponding
		"sequences from C. albicans, C. stellatoidea, C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, C."
		"parapsilosis, C. kefyr and C. krusei demonstrated that the C. dubliniensis"
		"isolates formed a homogenous cluster (100% similarity), representing a discrete"
		taxon within the genus Candida that was significantly different from the other
		species analysed.

PG	-	251-253
LID	-	10.1111/jcpt.13482 [doi]
AB	-	WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Studies have demonstrated that ECMO leads to
		"pharmacokinetic changes, with alterations in volume of distribution, clearance"
		and drug sequestration by the circuit. We describe a successful dosing approach
		for daptomycin and micafungin for the treatment of VRE faecium bacteremia and
		C. glabrata fungemia in a patient receiving veno-venous ECMO and CRRT. CASE
		SUMMARY: We report a case of a patient with ARDS on veno-venous ECMO complicated
		by VRE faecium bacteremia and C. glabrata fungemia. The patient was treated with
		daptomycin 10 mg/kg every 24 h and micafungin 150 mg every 24 h for 14 days. Key
		observations included the documented bacteremia and fungemia clearance without
		the need for ECMO circuit exchange. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: This case report
		demonstrates successful bacteremia and fungemia clearance in an adult without the
		need for ECMO circuit exchange. It also highlights the need for more research to
		identify optimal antimicrobial dosing strategies in similar scenarios.

TI	-	Torulopsis glabrata spinal osteomyelitis involving two contiguous vertebrae. A
		case report.
PG	-	866-70
AB	-	STUDY DESIGN: A case report and literature review of the five previous case
		reports. OBJECTIVES: To outline the features of Torulopsis glabrata spinal
		"osteomyelitis, including its risk factors, diagnosis, and recommended treatments."
		SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Fungal infections in general and Torulopsis glabrata
		in particular are becoming increasingly prevalent. Involvement of the spine will
		likely be more common in the future. METHODS: The literature was exhaustively
		reviewed and the five previous reported cases of Torulopsis glabrata identified
		and evaluated. This case report is analyzed in the context of the previous five
		"cases. RESULTS: All patients responded to treatment, which varied from medical"
		alone to medical with operative debridement and spinal fusion. CONCLUSION:
		Various risk factors that predisposed patients to Torulopsis glabrata
		osteomyelitis were present in all known cases. Diagnosis should rely on
		"examination, history, and radiographic and laboratory evaluations. Medical"
		"therapy should be the initial treatment in most cases; however, operative"
		intervention may be needed in patients who do not respond appropriately.

		System.
PG	-	569-579
LID	-	10.1373/jalm.2018.027201 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Fast diagnostic tests providing earlier identification (ID) of
		"pathogens, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) may reduce time to"
		"appropriate antimicrobial therapy (AAT), decrease mortality, and facilitate"
		antimicrobial deescalation (ADE). Our objective was to determine the theoretical
		reduction in time to AAT and opportunities for ADE with Accelerate Pheno(TM)
		"System (AXDX). METHODS: The prospective cohort (April 14, 2016 through June 1,"
		"2017) was from the Barnes-Jewish Hospital, a 1250-bed academic center. Emergency"
		department (ED) or intensive care unit (ICU) blood cultures Gram-stain positive
		for gram-negative bacilli (GNB) or yeast. AXDX was used in parallel with
		standard-of-care (SOC) diagnostics to determine differences in time to pathogen
		ID and AST. Theoretical opportunities for ADE from AXDX results were determined.
		"RESULTS: In total, 429 blood cultures were screened, 153 meeting inclusion"
		"criteria: 110 on-panel GNB, 10 Candida glabrata, and 5 Candida albicans. For GNB"
		"SOC, median time from blood culture positivity to ID and AST were 28.2 and 52.1"
		h. Median time to ID and AST after AXDX initiation was 1.37 and 6.7 h for
		"on-panel organisms. For on-panel Candida, time to ID was approximately 21 h"
		faster with AXDX. ADE or AAT was theoretically possible with AXDX in 48.4%. Of
		"on-panel organisms, 24.0% did not receive initial AAT. In-hospital mortality was"
		"46.7% without initial AAT, and 11.6% with AAT. Coverage of AXDX was 75.3%,"
		"specificity 99.7%, positive predictive value (PPV) 96.0%, and negative predictive"
		"value (NPV) 97.6%. On-panel sensitivity was 91.5%, specificity 99.6%, PPV 96.0%,"
		and NPV 99.0%. CONCLUSIONS: AXDX provides more rapid ID and AST for GNB and ID
		for yeast than SOC. AXDX could potentially reduce time to AAT and facilitate ADE.

PG	-	2223-4
LID	-	10.1016/j.transproceed.2009.06.017 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: We sought to present our results of topical intrabronchial
		installation of amphotericin B lipid complex (AmpB lipid). PATIENT AND METHODS: A
		deposit of fungal material was observed in a bilateral lung transplant recipient
		who experienced stenosis of the left anastomosis and have been fitted with a
		double endobronchial prosthesis. The deposit was adherent to the prosthetic
		"material, causing marked local laceration, risk of perforation, and exacerbation"
		"of the bronchial stenosis. Upon cultivation of a bronchial aspirate (BAS), we"
		"isolated Aspergillus fumigatus, Scedosporium prolificans, and Candida glabrata."
		Systemic antifungal treatment was begun with oral voriconazole (200 mg every 12
		hours) and inhaled AmpB lipid (25 mg once daily). The fungal deposit on the
		prosthetic material was treated by topical instillation of a solution of 25 mg
		"AmpB lipid before and after each therapeutic fibrobronchoscopy (FB), which was"
		performed weekly at 5 consecutive examinations. Tolerance was excellent. RESULTS:
		The improvement obtained after the procedure made it possible to withdraw one of
		the displaced prostheses. Subsequent cultivation for the fungi found in the BAS
		was persistently negative over a follow-up of 2 years. CONCLUSION: Topical
		intrabronchial instillation of AmpB lipid has proven effective and well tolerated
		for the treatment of localized fungal colonies. This use could be extended by
		protocol to FB in the early postoperative period after lung transplantation for
		antifungal prophylaxis.

PG	-	18
LID	-	10.1186/1471-2415-10-18 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candida glabrata endophthalmitis following keratoplasty is rare and
		almost always associated with positive donor rim culture. CASE PRESENTATION: A
		"63-year-old patient, diagnosed Fuch's endothelial dystrophy in both eyes"
		underwent a penetrating keratoplasty in his right eye. He had multiple underlying
		"medical problems, which included diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypoadrenalism"
		on oral dexamethasone and fatty liver secondary to hypertrigliseridemia. He
		"developed multiple suture abscesses, corneal haziness, retrocorneal white plaques"
		and a level of hypopyon two weeks after an uneventful penetrating keratoplasty in
		his right eye. Cultures of the donor button and the transport media culture were
		negative. Candida glabrata was isolated successfully from the aqueous and
		"vitreous taps. He was treated with a combination of topical, intracameral,"
		intravitreal and intravenous Amphotericin B. His final visual acuity remained
		poor due to the haziness of the corneal button. CONCLUSION: Candida glabrata
		endophthalmitis following penetrating keratoplasty can occur in negative donor
		rim and transport media cultures. The growth of the organism is facilitated by
		the patient's immunocompromised status. Awareness by the ophthalmologists and
		appropriate choice of antibiotics are mandatory in this challenging condition.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: In recent years the incidence of candidemia caused by non-albicans
		Candida species has been increasing. Two cryptic species have been described
		"within the Candida glabrata complex, Candida nivariensis and Candida bracarensis,"
		which may be troublesome in laboratory identification and have lower
		susceptibility to fluconazole. AIMS: To describe the first isolation of C.
		nivariensis in the Iberian Peninsula from a patient suffering from a
		catheter-related fungemia. CASE REPORT: An 81-year-old man was hospitalized for
		surgical treatment of an intestinal fistula that was associated to a severe
		malnutrition. Cultures of the patient's central venous catheter tip and blood
		"yielded white colonies in BD CHROMagar Candida(®) medium, which could not be"
		identified by conventional microbiological methods. Although intravenous
		"fluconazole was administered, blood cultures continued being positive 5 days"
		"later. The MIC values of the isolate were as follows: 1 μg/ml for amphotericin B,"
		"0.015 μg/ml for anidulafungin, 0.125 μg/ml for caspofungin, 0.015 μg/ml for"
		"micafungin, 4 μg/ml for fluconazole, 0.25 μg/ml for itraconazole, 0.25 μg/ml for"
		"posaconazole, and 0.03 μg/ml for voriconazole. Antifungal treatment was changed"
		to intravenous caspofungin for 2 weeks. The intestinal fistula was surgically
		"treated. There was no evidence of relapse during the following month, and the"
		patient was discharged. The isolate was identified as C. nivariensis based on DNA
		sequencing of the ITS regions of rRNA. CONCLUSIONS: C. nivariensis should be
		regarded as an emerging pathogen which requires molecular methods for a
		definitive identification. Our patient was successfully treated with caspofungin.

TI	-	Bittersweet: infective complications of drug-induced glycosuria in patients with
		diabetes mellitus on SGLT2-inhibitors: two case reports.
PG	-	284
LID	-	10.1186/s12879-021-05982-3 [doi]
LID	-	284
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are novel
		hypoglycemic agents which reduce reabsorption of glucose at the renal proximal
		"tubule, resulting in significant glycosuria and increased risk of genital mycotic"
		infections (GMI). These infections are typically not severe as reported in large
		systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the medications. These reviews have also
		demonstrated significant cardiovascular benefits through other mechanisms of
		"action, making them attractive options for the management of Type 2 diabetes"
		mellitus (T2DM). We present two cases with underlying abnormalities of the
		urogenital tract in which the GMI were complicated and necessitated cessation of
		the SGLT2 inhibitor. CASE PRESENTATIONS: Both cases are patients with T2DM on
		"empagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor. The first case is a 64 year old man with"
		Candida albicans balanitis and candidemia who was found to have an obstructing
		renal calculus and prostatic abscess requiring operative management. The second
		case describes a 72 year old man with Candida glabrata candidemia who was found
		"to have prostatomegaly, balanitis xerotica obliterans with significant urethral"
		stricture and bladder diverticulae. His treatment was more complex due to
		fluconazole resistance and concerns about urinary tract penetration of other
		antifungals. Both patients recovered following prolonged courses of antifungal
		therapy and in both cases the SGLT2 inhibitor was ceased. CONCLUSIONS: Despite
		"their cardiovascular benefits, SGLT2 inhibitors can be associated with"
		complicated fungal infections including candidemia and patients with anatomical
		abnormalities of the urogenital tract may be more susceptible to these infections
		as demonstrated in these cases. Clinicians should be aware of their mechanism of
		"action and associated risk of infection and prior to prescription, assessment of"
		urogenital anatomical abnormalities should be performed to identify patients who
		may be at risk of complicated infection.

TI	-	Fungal Infections in Patients With Walled-off Pancreatic Necrosis.
PG	-	1447-1451
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the influence of fungal infection and
		antifungal treatment on outcome in patients with walled-off pancreatic necrosis
		(WON). METHODS: A retrospective description of fungal infections in a cohort of
		"consecutive patients undergoing endoscopic, transmural drainage and necrosectomy"
		"for WON, treated in a tertiary referral center was reviewed. RESULTS: Between"
		"2005 and 2013, fungal infection in WON was documented in 57 (46%) of 123"
		patients. The most common isolates at first positive culture were Candida
		albicans (55%) and Candida glabrata (20%). Thirty-nine (70%) patients were
		treated with antifungals after the first fungal finding. There was no significant
		"difference in mortality (21% vs 13%, P = 0.517) or organ failure (34% vs 33%, P ="
		0.903) between the group treated with adequate antifungals after the first fungal
		finding compared to the group not treated or treated inadequately.The in-hospital
		"mortality was 18% (10 patients). Concomitant fungemia was found in 6 patients, of"
		"which 3 died, as opposed to 7 with fungi in the necrosis only (50% vs 14%, P ="
		0.027). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a high incidence and associated high
		"in-hospital mortality of fungal infection in WON, thus emphasizing the importance"
		of fungal infections in WON.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: To characterize and identify prognostic factors for 28-day mortality
		among patients with hospital-acquired fungemia (HAF) in the Intensive Care Unit
		"(ICU). METHODS: A sub-analysis of a prospective, multicenter non-representative"
		cohort study conducted in 162 ICUs in 24 countries. RESULTS: Of the 1156 patients
		with hospital-acquired bloodstream infections (HA-BSI) included in the EUROBACT
		"study, 96 patients had a HAF. Median time to its diagnosis was 20 days (IQR"
		"10.5-30.5) and 9 days (IQR 3-15.5) after hospital and ICU admission,"
		respectively. Median time to positivity of blood culture was longer in fungemia
		than in bacteremia (48.7 h vs. 38.1 h; p = 0.0004). Candida albicans was the most
		"frequent fungus isolated (57.1%), followed by Candida glabrata (15.3%) and"
		Candida parapsilosis (10.2%). No clear source of HAF was detected in 33.3% of the
		episodes and it was catheter-related in 21.9% of them. Compared to patients with
		"bacteremia, HAF patients had a higher rate of septic shock (39.6% vs. 21.6%; p ="
		0.0003) and renal dysfunction (25% vs. 12.4%; p = 0.0023) on admission and a
		higher rate of renal failure (26% vs. 16.2%; p = 0.0273) at diagnosis. Adequate
		treatment started within 24 h after blood culture collection was less frequent in
		HAF patients (22.9% vs. 55.3%; p < 0.001). The 28-day all cause fatality was
		"40.6%. According to multivariate analysis, only liver failure (OR 14.35; 95% CI"
		"1.17-175.6; p = 0.037), need for mechanical ventilation (OR 8.86; 95% CI"
		1.2-65.24; p = 0.032) and ICU admission for medical reason (OR 3.87; 95% CI
		1.25-11.99; p = 0.020) were independent predictors of 28-day mortality in HAF
		patients. CONCLUSIONS: Fungi are an important cause of hospital-acquired BSI in
		the ICU. Patients with HAF present more frequently with septic shock and renal
		dysfunction on ICU admission and have a higher rate of renal failure at
		"diagnosis. HAF are associated with a significant 28-day mortality rate (40%), but"
		delayed adequate antifungal therapy was not an independent risk factor for death.
		"Liver failure, need for mechanical ventilation and ICU admission for medical"
		reason were the only independent predictors of 28-day mortality.

AB	-	The frequency of breakthrough invasive fungal diseases (IFDs) during echinocandin
		therapy is unclear. We retrospectively analyzed 534 hematologic patients treated
		"with echinocandin (caspofungin, N = 55; micafungin, N = 306; anidulafungin,"
		"N = 173). Four proven IFDs were found, caused by Candida parapsilosis (N = 2), C."
		"parapsilosis and Candida glabrata (N = 1), and Fusarium species (N = 1). Four"
		"cases of possible IFDs were observed, all showing pulmonary infection. One case"
		showed features suggestive of hepatosplenic candidiasis. Six of these eight cases
		had previously received the purine analog clofarabine. Breakthrough IFD during
		"echinocandin treatment occurred infrequently (1.5 %), caused predominantly by"
		Candida species. Clofarabine usage was an important risk factor.

AB	-	"INTRODUCTION: Vulvovaginal candidiasis is the most common mycosis, however, the"
		available information about antifungal susceptibilities of these yeasts is
		limited. AIM: To compare the gold standard fungal culture with a new molecular
		identification method and report the incidence of yeast species in vulvovaginitis
		candidosa. METHOD: The authors studied 370 yeasts isolated from vulvovaginal
		candidiasis and identified them by phenotypic and molecular methods. RESULTS: The
		"most common species was Candida albicans (85%), followed by Candida glabrata, and"
		other Candida species. CONCLUSION: At present there are no recommendations for
		the evaluation of antifungal susceptibility of pathogenic fungal species
		occurring in vulvovaginal candidiasis and the natural antifungal resistance of
		the different species is known only. Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization
		Time of Flight identification can be used to differentiate the fluconazole
		resistant Candida dubliniensis and the sensitive Candida albicans strains.

AB	-	The aim of the study is to determine the effectiveness of the single per oral
		application of 200 mg Fungolon (Fluconazolum) in adolescent girls with proven
		"Candida spp. Vaginal infection. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective, case control"
		"study in 50 girls, aged 9 to 18 years, was performed. Patients were recruited in"
		the outpatient Clinic of Paediatric and Adolescent Gynecology at the University
		"Hospital ""Majchin dom"", Sofia, Bulgaria. They suffered from vaginal discharge"
		and/or pruritus of the external genitalia. Candida spp. Was proven in all of the
		microbiological investigation performed. The treatment with Fungolon was
		"performed per os, in single dose of 200 mg. RESULTS: The complaints and Candida"
		in the vaginal smear (controlled 1 week after the treatment) disappeared in 43 of
		50 patients (86%) treated. No effect was observed in 7 girls (14%). A reinfection
		with Candida was observed in 6 of the 38 patients (16%) at the second week after
		the treatment. The typisation of the resistant to Fungolon Candida shown
		predominance of Candida glabrata. There were no side effects registered during
		the Fungolon treatment. CONCLUSION: The treatment of Candida spp. Vaginal
		infection in adolescent girls by a single per oral application of 200 mg Fungolon
		(Fluconazolum) is very convenient and efficient. It gives a prompt effect (the
		"complaints disappear in one or two days), high percentage of healed patients"
		"(86%), with absence of side effects. The usage of Fungolon should be highly"
		recommended for treatment of vaginal mycoses in puberty and adolescence.

TI	-	Candiduria in critically ill patients admitted to intensive care medical units.
PG	-	1069-76
AB	-	BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of
		candiduria in critically ill patients admitted to intensive care medical units
		"(ICUs), to identify risk factors for candiduria and to assess the frequency"
		distribution of different Candidaspp. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This was a
		"prospective cohort observational and multicenter study. A total of 1,765 patients"
		older than 18 years of age who were admitted for at least 7 days to 73
		medical-surgical ICUs of 70 Spanish hospitals were included in the study. Urine
		"cultures were performed once a week. RESULTS: In 389 patients (22%), Candidaspp."
		"in one or more urine samples were isolated. In the multivariate analysis,"
		"independent risk factors for candiduria included: age >65 years, female sex,"
		"length of hospital stay before ICU admission, diabetes mellitus, total parenteral"
		"nutrition, mechanical ventilation and previous use of antimicrobials. Candida"
		"albicanswas recovered in 266 cases (68.4%), followed by C. glabrata(32 cases,"
		"8.2%) and C. tropicalis(14 cases, 36%). Previous use of antifungal agents was the"
		"only risk factor for the selection of Candidanon-albicans candiduria (OR 2.64,"
		"95% CI 1.35-5.14, P=0.004). In-hospital mortality was 48.8% in patients with"
		candiduria compared to 36.6% in those without candiduria ( P<0.001). Significant
		"differences were also found for ICU mortality (38.% vs. 28.1%, P<0.001)."
		CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-two percent of critically ill patients admitted for more than
		7 days in the ICU developed candiduria. C. albicanswas the most frequent
		causative pathogen. Previous use of antifungals was the only risk factor for the
		selection of Candidanon-albicans.

TI	-	Candida biofilm production is associated with higher mortality in patients with
		candidaemia.
PG	-	352-360
LID	-	10.1111/myc.13049 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candidaemia is a common life-threatening disease among hospitalised
		"patients, but the effect of the Candida biofilm-forming ability on the clinical"
		outcome remains controversial. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to determine the impact of
		"biofilms, specifically focusing on biofilm mass and metabolic activity, on the"
		mortality in candidaemia. PATIENTS/METHODS: The clinical data of patients
		"(n = 127) treated at the University of Debrecen, Clinical Centre, between January"
		"2013 and December 2018, were investigated retrospectively. Biofilm formation was"
		"assessed using the crystal violet and XTT assays, measuring the biofilm mass and"
		"metabolic activity, respectively. Isolates were classified as low, intermediate"
		and high biofilm producers both regarding biofilm mass and metabolic activity.
		"The susceptibility of one-day-old biofilms to fluconazole, amphotericin B,"
		"anidulafungin, caspofungin and micafungin was evaluated and compared to"
		planktonic susceptibility. RESULTS: Intermediate/high biofilm mass was associated
		"with significantly higher mortality (61%). All Candida tropicalis, Candida"
		parapsilosis and Candida glabrata isolates originating from fatal infections were
		"intermediate/high biofilm producers, whereas this ratio was 85% for Candida"
		albicans. Solid malignancy was associated with intermediate/high biofilm
		producers (P = .043). The mortality was significantly higher in infections caused
		by Candida strains producing biofilms with intermediate/high metabolic activity
		"(62% vs. 33%, P = .010). The ratio of concomitant bacteraemia was higher for"
		"isolates forming biofilms with low metabolic activity (53% vs 28%, P = .015)."
		CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that the Candida biofilms especially
		with intermediate/high metabolic activity are related to higher mortality in
		candidaemia.

PG	-	1387-1395
LID	-	10.1111/myc.13297 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Considering the emergence of fungaemia due to rare yeasts at our
		"centre, we performed a systematic epidemiologic study on fungaemia due to rare"
		yeast. OBJECTIVES: We undertook the present prospective observational study to
		explore the epidemiological features and clinical characteristics of fungaemia
		due to rare yeasts in paediatric ICUs at our centre. METHODS: The successive
		yeasts isolated from blood at our PICUs during December 2017 through March 2019
		were identified by molecular methods. Fungaemia due to yeasts other than
		"C. albicans, C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, C. krusei and C. parapsilosis was"
		categorised as rare yeasts. Antifungal susceptibility testing of the yeast
		isolates was performed as per clinical and laboratory standards institute (CLSI)
		guidelines. We also compared different clinical parameters of fungaemia due to
		"common versus rare yeasts, and rare yeasts in neonates versus non-neonates."
		"RESULTS: During the study period, 212 yeast isolates were obtained from 159"
		"patients at PICUs of our hospital, and 127 isolates from 98 patients (61.6%) were"
		categorised as rare yeasts. Neonates acquired fungaemia significantly earlier
		after ICU admission than non-neonates (median:4 vs 6 days; p = .005). Regarding
		"epidemiology study of rare yeast fungaemia, Wickerhamomyces anomalus (43.8%) and"
		Candida utilis (40.8%) were common isolates; surgical intervention and
		"gastrointestinal disease were significantly associated; overall, azole,"
		"echinocandin and amphotericin B resistance was at 9.1%, 1.02% and 1.02%,"
		respectively; overall mortality was 65.3%. CONCLUSIONS: The emergence of rare
		yeasts especially W. anomalus and C. utilis causing fungaemia in our children
		demands urgent attention to control the spread.

PG	-	198-201
AB	-	A cross-sectional study was performed in two primary schools with different
		"socioeconomic status in the suburban and central areas of Manisa, Turkey, in"
		order to determine the prevalence of tinea pedis and onychomycosis. A full
		dermatological examination and a questionnaire on socioeconomic conditions were
		performed in a group of 785 randomly selected children aged 6-14. Of 9 clinically
		"suspected tinea pedis and 4 onychomycoses cases, KOH examination (direct"
		"microscopy) and/or mycological cultures were positive in six boys, in whom"
		Candida glabrata and C. tropicalis grew. Older age and higher number of siblings
		were found to be significant factors for fungal infection.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Oral candidiasis (OC) is a common opportunistic infection in
		immunocompromised patients. Species identification is sometimes important for
		treatment. objective: to determine the prevalence of different Candida species
		colonising or infecting the oral mucosa (OM) of diabetic (DM) and non-diabetic
		"(non-DM) chronic kidney disease patients, comparing both groups and exploring"
		potential risk factors. METHODS: 56 DM and 80 non-DM patients on chronic dialysis
		were examined. OM swabs were cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar plates. Candida
		species were identified with API® galleries. OC was confirmed by exfoliative
		"cytology. Statistical associations were analysed using χ2, Fisher's exact test"
		"(ET), and multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: Candida prevalence was 43.4%:"
		"53.6% DM and 36.3% non-DM, (p=.045). The species identified were C. albicans"
		"74.6%, C. glabrata 22.0%, C. tropicalis 15.2%, C. parapsilosis 3.4 %, C. kefyr"
		3.4% and C. famata 1.7% without difference between groups. DM patients had a
		higher xerostomia prevalence (p=.002) and lower salivary flow (p=.008) and lower
		"serum albumin (p=.018). 16.9% of patients had OC, 23.2% DM compared with 12.5%"
		"non-DM, (p=.101). The following were associated with the presence of Candida in"
		"the OM: the use of dental prostheses (odds ratio [OR] 25.6, 95% confidence"
		"interval [CI] 2.5 to 253, P=.001), xerostomia (OR 9.6, 95% CI 2.4 to 38.1,"
		"P=.001) and low serum albumin values (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.98, P=.044)."
		CONCLUSIONS: The presence of Candida sp. in the OM was associated with dental
		"prostheses, xerostomia and low serum albumin."

AB	-	The epidemiology of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) after liver transplantation
		(LT) is continuing to evolve in the current era of antifungal prophylactic
		therapy. This multicenter retrospective cohort study aimed to evaluate the
		"epidemiology, risk factors, and outcomes of IFIs among LT recipients in the"
		current era.We analyzed a total of 482 LT recipients aged 18 years and older who
		were admitted to 3 tertiary hospitals in Korea between January 2009 and February
		2012.Twenty-four episodes of IFIs occurred in 23 patients (4.77%; 23/482). Of
		"these episodes, 20 were proven cases and 4 were probable cases according to"
		"EORTC/MSG criteria. Among these cases, IFI developed within 30 days of"
		"transplantation in 47.8% of recipients, from 31 to 180 days in 34.8% of"
		"recipients, and from 181 to 365 days in 17.4% of recipients. The most common"
		"isolates were Candida species (n = 12, 52.2%; Candida albicans, 6 cases; Candida"
		"tropicalis, 1 case; Candida glabrata, 1 case; Candida parapsilosis, 1 case; and"
		"unspecified Candida species, 1 case) and Aspergillus species (n = 7, 30.4%). The"
		mortality in patients with IFIs was significantly higher than that in patients
		"without IFIs (47.83% [11/23] vs 7.18% [33/459], P < .001). The incidence of"
		"late-onset IFIs is increasing in the antifungal prophylactic era, and"
		fluconazole-resistant non-albicans Candida species have not yet emerged in Korea.

LID	-	10.3290/j.qi.a44630 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To assess the relationship between the development of denture-related
		"stomatitis (DRS) and the identification of commonly isolated yeast species, and"
		to evaluate various predisposing factors in Saudi participants wearing new
		removable dental prostheses. METHOD AND MATERIALS: A total of 75 edentulous male
		"participants were recruited, and 64 patients finished the present case-series."
		All participants received new conventional complete dentures. Colonization of
		"Candida species was assessed, and species were identified by means of the VITEK 2"
		(bioMérieux) laboratory components. RESULTS: The most prevalent type of Candida
		"at baseline was C albicans, followed by non-C albicans species (C glabrata)."
		Counts of Candida species significantly increased from the day of insertion to
		"the first month (P < . 05), but there were no significant changes between the"
		"first and second month (P > . 05). On the day of insertion, C tropicalis, C"
		"dubliniensis, and C krusei were extracted from few subjects only, with no"
		significant changes over the first and second month (P > .05). Patients revealing
		habits of sleeping with their dentures were found to frequently suffer from DRS;
		"development of the latter was rapid, and mixed Candida biofilms (with high CFU/mL"
		"counts), along with inadequate oral and denture hygiene, turned out to be"
		contributing factors (P < .05). CONCLUSION: DRS can develop faster than
		"previously reported, even with new dentures; continued denture wearing and poor"
		cleaning of dentures revealed a considerable impact on DRS onset. In the present
		"cohort, C albicans was the most identified kind of yeast, and was followed by C"
		glabrata infection in cases with DRS.

PG	-	379-83
LID	-	10.1001/archinte.169.4.379 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Bloodstream infections (BSIs) caused by Candida glabrata have
		increased substantially. Candida glabrata is often associated with resistance to
		"fluconazole therapy. However, to our knowledge, risk factors for"
		fluconazole-resistant C glabrata BSIs have not been studied. METHODS: A
		"case-case-control study was conducted at 3 hospitals from January 1, 2003, to May"
		"31, 2007. The 2 case groups included patients with fluconazole-resistant C"
		glabrata BSIs (minimum inhibitory concentration > or =16 microg/mL) and patients
		with fluconazole-susceptible C glabrata BSIs (minimum inhibitory concentration <
		or =8 microg/mL). Hospitalized patients without C glabrata BSIs were randomly
		selected for inclusion in the control group and were frequency matched to cases
		on the basis of time at risk. Two case-control studies were performed using this
		"shared control group. The primary risk factor of interest, previous fluconazole"
		"use, was evaluated at multivariate analyses, adjusting for demographic data,"
		"comorbid conditions, and antimicrobial exposures. RESULTS: We included 76"
		"patients with fluconazole-resistant C glabrata BSIs, 68 patients with"
		"fluconazole-susceptible C glabrata BSIs, and 512 control patients. Previous"
		"fluconazole use (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 2.3 [1.3-4.2])"
		and linezolid use (4.6 [2.2-9.3]) were independent risk factors for
		fluconazole-resistant C glabrata BSIs; previous cefepime use (2.2 [1.2-3.9]) and
		metronidazole use (2.0 [1.1-3.5]) were independent risk factors for
		fluconazole-susceptible C glabrata BSIs. CONCLUSIONS: Previous fluconazole use is
		a significant risk factor for health care-associated fluconazole-resistant C
		glabrata BSIs. Future studies will be needed to evaluate the effect of decreasing
		fluconazole use on rates of fluconazole-resistant C glabrata BSIs.

AB	-	Contamination of preservation solution (PS) with yeasts during solid organ
		recovery can lead to life-threatening complications in the recipients. The
		prevalence of such a contamination needs to be established. From January 2004 to
		"December 2008, we prospectively investigated the potential fungal contamination"
		of all the PSs collected in our institution using a standardised procedure
		consisting in centrifugation of 10 mL PS and incubation of the pellet seeded on
		"fungal-specific medium for 15 days at 30 degrees C. During the study period, 728"
		"transplantations (397 kidneys, 262 livers and 69 hearts) were performed for which"
		"659 PSs (90.5%) were available. The yeast contamination rate was 0% (0/62), 3.1%"
		"(11/356) and 4.1% (10/241) for heart, kidney and liver transplants, respectively."
		"We identified 10 Candida albicans, five C. glabrata, two C. krusei, one C."
		"tropicalis, one C. valida, one Pichia etchelsii and one Rhodorula sp. Routine"
		bacterial analysis identified only five of these 21 fungal contaminations. Twenty
		recipients were alive after at least one year of follow-up and one died from
		meningeal carcinomatosis at seven months. Three patients were found to have the
		same species of Candida from their surgical drains but did not develop any
		infection or abnormalities upon ultrasound investigation. Fourteen patients
		received antifungal drugs. Yeast contamination occurred in 3.4% of all kidney and
		liver PSs tested. Its clinical consequences and therapeutic management remain to
		be defined. Our study also suggests that optimisation/standardisation of
		"microbiological procedures is warranted, including analysis of large PS volume,"
		seeding of fungal-specific medium and prolonged incubation.

AB	-	"PURPOSE: This study was carried out to assess the carriage rates, counts and"
		species distribution of Candida in saliva of 6- to 12-year-old Yemeni children
		and relate that to their caries experience. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred
		eighty children were recruited. Oral hygiene and caries were assessed using the
		"simplified oral hygiene index and dft/DMFT index, respectively. Detection and"
		quantification of 4 Candida species in unstimulated saliva were performed using
		CHROMagar Candida medium. Data were analysed using regression analysis. RESULTS:
		Candida was detected in 60% of the children with a mean count of 923 ± 1875
		CFU/ml. C. albicans accounted for 60% of the isolates and was the only species to
		be detected with more than 1000 CFU/ml. Non-albicans candida and unidentified
		"species represented 16.3% and 23.1% of the isolates, respectively. One novel"
		finding was that a significant proportion (38%) of the carriers harboured two or
		"more species, which for the first time allowed the identification of four"
		age-dependent carriage patterns (clusters). Another somewhat new observation was
		that carriage at ≥ 1000 CFU/ml in particular significantly correlated with caries
		"in primary and permanent dentitions (r = 0.23 and 0.18, respectively) as well as"
		"a caries-active status (OR = 6.9). Interestingly, the C. glabrata cluster had"
		significantly lower primary caries scores than other clusters. CONCLUSIONS: The
		findings substantiate claims of geographical variations in candida carriage and
		the relation between candida carriage and caries. The validity of carrier
		clusters and the use of 1000 CFU/ml as a risk marker should be further
		investigated.

PG	-	O952-9
LID	-	10.1111/1469-0691.12688 [doi]
AB	-	Posaconazole (PSC) is currently recommended as primary prophylaxis in neutropenic
		patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and in allogenic haematopoietic stem
		cell transplantation (AHSCT) recipients with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).
		Studies focusing on breakthrough invasive fungal disease (IFD) upon PSC
		prophylaxis show disparate results. In order to evaluate the incidence of IFD in
		"patients on PSC prophylaxis and identify IFD risk factors, we carried out a"
		retrospective study of all consecutive patients on PP from January 2007 to
		December 2010 in our hospital. Breakthrough IFDs were identified from the
		"database of the central pharmacy and the French administrative database (PMSI),"
		registering final medical diagnoses of hospitalized patients. Medical data were
		"reviewed to study proven or probable IFD, according to EORTC/MSG definition. PSC"
		plasma concentrations (PPC) were also retrieved. Poisson models were used for
		statistical analysis. Two hundred and seventy-nine patients received PSC
		prophylaxis for a median duration of 1.4 months (range 0.2-17.9). Proven (n=6) or
		probable (n=3) IFDs were diagnosed in nine cases (3.2%). IFD incidence rate per
		"100 person-month was 1.65 (95% CI, 0.79-2.97). IFDs were candidaemia (Candida"
		"glabrata, n=2), pulmonary invasive aspergillosis (n=3), disseminated fusariosis"
		"(n=2) and pulmonary mucormycosis (n=2). Seven deaths were reported, directly"
		related to IFD in three patients (33.3%). First dosage of PPC under 0.3 mg/L was
		"the single significant risk factor for IFD (RR, 7.77; 95% CI, 1.30-46.5; p"
		0.025). Breakthrough IFD in patients receiving PSC prophylaxis is rare but
		associated with a poor outcome. Low PSC plasma concentrations are associated with
		an increased risk of IFD.

LID	-	e0210527
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: The aim of this cross-sectional observational study was to compare
		the prevalence of different oral Candida spp. in patients with Type 2 Diabetes
		and chronic periodontitis in two oral sites: dorsal surface of the tongue and
		subgingival area. In order to determine subgingival areas as potential reservoirs
		"of yeasts, this study aimed to find differences in the yeasts' detection between"
		"the dorsum of the tongue, as the oral site most commonly inhabited with"
		"microorganisms, and subgingival samples. Additionally, potential predictors for"
		the yeasts prevalence were determined. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Subjects (N = 146)
		were divided into four groups: group A- healthy individuals without
		"periodontitis, group B- healthy individuals with chronic periodontitis, group C-"
		Type 2 Diabetes patients with good glycoregulation and Chronic periodontitis and
		group D- Type 2 Diabetes patients with poor glycoregulation and Chronic
		periodontitis. Samples were obtained from the tongue by swabbing. Subgingival
		plaque samples were taken by paper points and periodontal curette. Isolation and
		identification of different Candida spp. was done using ChromAgar medium. In
		"addition, germ-tube production and carbohydrate assimilation tests were"
		performed. RESULTS: The prevalence of Candida spp. was higher in diabetics with
		poor glycoregulation. The most frequently isolated species was Candida albicans
		"followed by Candida glabrata and Candida tropicalis. In 15.6% of cases, Candida"
		spp. was present in the subgingival area while absent on the tongue. Multivariate
		regression model showed that HbA1c was Candida spp. predictor for both locations.
		CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirmed that there are Candida spp. carriers among
		"subjects with clinically healthy oral mucosa. Also, this study identified"
		subgingival areas as potential reservoirs of these pathogenic species.
		Glycoregulation has been recognized as a positive predictor factor of Candida
		spp.

TI	-	Orointestinal yeast colonization of paediatric bone marrow transplant recipients:
		surveillance by quantitative culture and serology.
PG	-	51-7
AB	-	We quantitatively studied the orointestinal yeast colonization of 15 consecutive
		paediatric patients who underwent 16 bone marrow transplantations (BMT). Cultures
		"were performed initially, longitudinally weekly during the period of aplasia"
		"(in-patient treatment) and, if possible, also during out-patient follow-up. With"
		"one exception, all patients received fluconazole as antifungal prophylaxis."
		Patients remained free of yeasts during the complete observation period only in
		six out of 16 cases (38%). Non-albicans species of Candida were isolated in six
		"out of 16 cases (38%), mainly C. glabrata (five out of 16; 31%). All of these"
		"patients had undergone allogeneic BMT. In one case, there was indirect evidence"
		of systemic invasion by C. glabrata. Even combined prophylaxis with fluconazole
		and and amphotericin B suspension could not reliably prevent yeast colonization
		but this combination at present appears to be the optimal regime. Regular
		concomitant Candida serology (determination of specific antibodies by three
		methods) proved to be a valuable additional surveillance method.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at providing original data on fungemia in the Centre
		"Hospitalier de Mayotte in terms of prevalence, epidemiological characteristics of"
		"infected patients, yeast species distribution and profile of in vitro antifungals"
		susceptibility. METHODS: A total of 223 positive blood cultures for yeasts were
		retrospectively reported during the period April 2010-April 2020. RESULTS:
		Ninety-five episodes were identified corresponding to an incidence rate of 3.7
		"cases/100,000 inhabitants. The average age of patients was 33.5 years, and 63.3%"
		patients were hospitalized in intensive care unit. The main co-morbidities were
		"surgery in the 30 days prior to fungemia (27.8%), neoplasia (22.8%), parenteral"
		"nutrition (17.7%), diabetes (16.5%) and immunosuppressive medications (31.6%)."
		Candida spp accounted for the majority of isolates (92.4%) with a predominance of
		"non-albicans species (55.8% vs 33.7%), including C. albicans (33.7%),"
		C. tropicalis (30.5%) and C. parapsilosis (20%). The antifungal susceptibility
		profiles did not differ from expected results for each species and did not change
		significantly over time. DISCUSSION: Fungemia remain frequent hospital infections
		associated with high mortality in Mayotte. The vast majority of fungemia was due
		to Candida spp. Non-albicansCandida species reach half of the Candida isolates
		"with a high percentage of C. tropicalis. Surprisingly, no case of candidemia due"
		to C. glabrata were identified. The management of candidemia remains satisfactory
		and the treatment was adapted according to the international recommendations.
		"However, the high susceptibility of Candida spp. isolates to fluconazole may"
		invite to reconsider the use of this molecule as empirical and first-line
		treatment of candidemia in Mayotte.

PG	-	4158-63
LID	-	10.1128/JCM.05474-11 [doi]
AB	-	Data on fungemia epidemiology and antifungal susceptibility of isolates from
		"children are scarce, leading frequently to pediatric empirical treatment based on"
		available adult data. The present study was designed to update the
		"epidemiological, mycological, and in vitro susceptibility data on fungal isolates"
		from children with fungemia in Spain. All fungemia episodes were identified
		prospectively by blood culture over 13 months at 30 hospitals. Tests of
		"susceptibility to amphotericin B, flucytosine, fluconazole, itraconazole,"
		"posaconazole, voriconazole, anidulafungin, caspofungin, and micafungin were"
		performed at participant institutions by a microdilution colorimetric method. New
		"species-specific clinical breakpoints for fluconazole, voriconazole, and"
		echinocandins were also applied. A total of 203 episodes of fungemia in 200
		children were identified. A higher proportion of fungal isolates was from general
		"wards than intensive care units (ICU). Candida parapsilosis (46.8%), Candida"
		"albicans (36.5%), Candida tropicalis (5.9%), Candida glabrata (3.9%), and Candida"
		guilliermondii (2.5%) were the leading species. C. parapsilosis was the
		predominant species except in neonates. C. albicans was the most frequent in
		"neonatal ICU settings (51.9%). Intravascular catheter (79.3%), surgery (35%),"
		"prematurity (30%), and neutropenia (11%) were the most frequent predisposing"
		factors. Most Candida isolates (95.1%) were susceptible to all antifungals. When
		"the new species-specific clinical breakpoints were applied, all C. parapsilosis"
		"isolates were susceptible to echinocandins except one, which was micafungin"
		resistant. This is the largest published series of fungemia episodes in the
		"pediatric setting. C. parapsilosis is the most prevalent species in Spain,"
		followed by C. albicans and C. tropicalis. Resistance to azole and echinocandin
		agents is extremely rare among Candida species. The fluconazole resistance rate
		in Spain has decreased in the last 10 years.

		in Turkey.
PG	-	514-8
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence and risk factors of tinea capitis and tinea
		pedis in school children in Turkey. METHODS: The study included 8122 students
		"from 24 schools in the rural and urban areas around Kayseri,Turkey. We asked"
		every student for their personal identification and also for their sanitation in
		order to get an idea about dermatophytosis. Samples taken from suspicious lesions
		were collected and inoculated onto Sabouraud dextrose agar slants. For
		"identification of grown fungi, macroscopic appearance of colonies, microscopic"
		examination and biochemical tests were used. RESULTS: There were 41 (0.5%)
		suspicious lesions in feet and 31 (0.3%) in scalp and 22 (0.2%) students were
		diagnosed as tinea pedis and 9 (0.1%) as tinea capitis by fungal culture. The
		"predominant etiologic agents in feet were Trichophyton rubrum 8 (36%),"
		"Trichophyton mentagrophytes 1 (4%), Rhodotorula 8 (36%), Trichosporon 2 (9%),"
		"Candida glabrata 2 (9%), Candida albicans 1 (4%), while Trichophyton verrucosum 8"
		(88%) and Trichophyton mentagrophytes 1 (12%) were identified in scalp samples.
		School settlement was found as risk factors on the frequency of tinea pedis and
		capitis. Age and gender were also found as risk factors on the frequency of tinea
		pedis. CONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrate a low prevalence of
		tinea capitis and tinea pedis in school children of central Anatolia of Turkey.
		School settlement is a very important factor affecting the prevalence of tinea
		capitis and pedis in school children in central Anatolia of Turkey.

		was designed and data from six different centres in Turkey between 2011 and 2016
		years were gathered and analysed for the distribution and frequency of yeast
		species in order to assist clinicians in their choice of early and appropriate
		antifungal therapy. All laboratories used automated blood culture systems for the
		isolation of blood strains. All the participating centres performed the
		identification of their own isolates by conventional methods using germ tube
		"test, morphology on corn meal agar with tween 80 and chromogenic media and the"
		"identification was confirmed by API 20C AUX, API ID 32C or matrix-assisted laser"
		desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrophotometry (MALDI-TOF MS)
		systems. The analysis of the results was performed on the basis of intensive care
		"units (ICUs), other inpatient clinics (OICs) and totally all clinics (ACs)."
		Totally 2547 yeast isolates were determined from six participating centres during
		"six years. According to the total ACs results, Candida albicans was the most"
		"prevalent species (43.1%), followed by Candida parapsilosis complex (29.1%),"
		"Candida glabrata (10.1%), Candida tropicalis (7.5%), Candida krusei (2.4%) and"
		Candida kefyr (1.6%) and the remaining (6.2%) of them consisted of other yeast
		species. The distribution of the Candida species did not show statistically
		"significant difference between the years, however the increase of C.parapsilosis"
		"complex in 2016 was statistically significant, (p= 0.02). During the study"
		"period, totally 1054 yeast isolates were obtained from the ICUs of the centres."
		C.albicans predominated with 476 (45.2%) isolates and C.parapsilosis complex
		"(28.7%), C.glabrata (10.7%) and C.tropicalis (7.3%) were the other leading"
		species in ICUs. Among 1493 isolates of the OICs of six centres participated in
		"the study, C.albicans was the most prevalent species with 622 (41.7%) isolates."
		"The other frequent species of OICs were C.parapsilosis complex (29.5%),"
		C.glabrata (9.6%) and C.tropicalis (7.6%) resembling ICU results. It can be
		concluded that C.albicans is still the leading cause of bloodstream infections in
		the six different centres located in various geographical areas of Turkey.

AB	-	PURPOSE: To assess donor rim culture results and outcomes of ocular infections in
		the Cornea Preservation Time Study (CPTS). METHODS: Donor corneal rim cultures
		were optional. Donor characteristics were assessed for association with positive
		cultures using the Fisher exact test and Poisson regression analyses. Incidence
		"rates of ocular infections were estimated, and 95% confidence intervals were"
		calculated. RESULTS: Cultures were performed in 784 (58.9%) of the 1330 cases.
		"For the 0 to 7-day versus 8 to 14-day preservation time groups, respectively,"
		positive fungal growth occurred in 10 of 397 (2.5%) versus 5 of 387 (1.3%)
		"corneas (P = 0.30), whereas positive bacterial cultures occurred in 6 of 397"
		(1.5%) versus 4 of 387 (1.0%) corneas (P = 0.75). Surgeon-prepared tissue
		remained a significant risk for positive fungal cultures [relative risk (RR) of
		"surgeon- versus eye-bank-prepared, 2.85; 95% CI (1.02-7.98)], whereas younger"
		"donors [RR per year of age, 0.96; 95% CI (0.93-1.00)] and accidental death donors"
		"[RR of accident versus disease, 3.71; 95% CI (1.36-10.13)] were at a greater risk"
		for positive bacterial cultures. Fungal infection (Candida glabrata) developed in
		"1 (6.7%) of 15 recipients with a positive fungal culture, and no recipient"
		infections occurred with positive bacterial culture. With one additional fungal
		keratitis (Candida albicans) and one bacterial endophthalmitis (E. coli) with no
		"rim culture performed, a total of 2 of 1330 eyes (0.15%) developed fungal and"
		1/1330 eyes (0.08%) developed bacterial postkeratoplasty infections. CONCLUSIONS:
		A longer preservation time was not associated with a higher rate of positive
		donor rim cultures. The overall rate of infection across the entire cohort was
		low.

AB	-	"OBJECTIVE: To describe the microbiology, underlying medical conditions and risk"
		factors contributing to bloodstream infection (BSI) and mortality at a University
		"Hospital in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. METHODS: We conducted this study at"
		"King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, wherein clinical data from"
		"patients who died with BSI were collected. All isolates from these patients, from"
		"1 January to 31 December 2004, were identified and antimicrobial susceptibilities"
		"were determined. RESULTS: Of the total 778 patients with BSI, 82 (10.5%) died."
		Among which 34 (41.5%) were elderly. Half of the patients were from the intensive
		care units (ICUs). Cardiovascular diseases were the most common diagnosis in 14
		"(17.1%) patient, followed by malignancy 13 (15.9%), and respiratory diseases 12"
		"(14.6%). Eleven (13.4%) had chronic liver diseases, 6 (7.3%) with renal diseases,"
		"sepsis in 5 (6.1%), 4 (4.8%) were post- surgical cases, 3 (3.7%) cases had"
		systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and 3 premature infants. The majority of BSI
		"episodes were monobacterial, 71(86.5%). Over 90% of the isolates were hospital"
		acquired. Coagulase negative Staphylococci (CoNS) were the most common organisms
		"representing 25 (30.5%) of all organisms isolated, while Gram positive as a whole"
		represented 50 (61%). Thirty one (38%) were Gram negative bacteria among which
		Pseudomonas species 6 (7.3%) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) 5 (6%) were the most
		common. Two (2.4%) of isolates were Candida glabrata. CONCLUSION: Mortality in
		our patients with BSI was attributed to old age and underlying medical
		"conditions. The risk factors for nosocomial BSI were ICU admission, intravascular"
		catheterization and respiratory tract infections.

LID	-	e25712
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass
		spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) for yeast identification is limited by the
		requirement for protein extraction and for robust reference spectra across yeast
		species in databases. We evaluated its ability to identify a range of yeasts in
		comparison with phenotypic methods. METHODS: MALDI-TOF MS was performed on 30
		reference and 167 clinical isolates followed by prospective examination of 67
		clinical strains in parallel with biochemical testing (total n = 264).
		Discordant/unreliable identifications were resolved by sequencing of the internal
		transcribed spacer region of the rRNA gene cluster. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Twenty
		"(67%; 16 species), and 24 (80%) of 30 reference strains were identified to"
		"species, (spectral score ≥2.0) and genus (score ≥1.70)-level, respectively. Of"
		"clinical isolates, 140/167 (84%) strains were correctly identified with scores of"
		"≥2.0 and 160/167 (96%) with scores of ≥1.70; amongst Candida spp. (n = 148),"
		"correct species assignment at scores of ≥2.0, and ≥1.70 was obtained for 86% and"
		"96% isolates, respectively (vs. 76.4% by biochemical methods). Prospectively,"
		"species-level identification was achieved for 79% of isolates, whilst 91% and 94%"
		"of strains yielded scores of ≥1.90 and ≥1.70, respectively (100% isolates"
		identified by biochemical methods). All test scores of 1.70-1.90 provided correct
		"species assignment despite being identified to ""genus-level"". MALDI-TOF MS"
		"identified uncommon Candida spp., differentiated Candida parapsilosis from C."
		"orthopsilosis and C. metapsilosis and distinguished between C. glabrata, C."
		nivariensis and C. bracarensis. Yeasts with scores of <1.70 were rare species
		such as C. nivariensis (3/10 strains) and C. bracarensis (n = 1) but included
		4/12 Cryptococcus neoformans. There were no misidentifications. Four novel
		species-specific spectra were obtained. Protein extraction was essential for
		"reliable results. CONCLUSIONS: MALDI-TOF MS enabled rapid, reliable"
		identification of clinically-important yeasts. The addition of spectra to
		databases and reduction in identification scores required for species-level
		identification may improve its utility.

TI	-	Fungal surveillance of an open haematology ward.
PG	-	288-92
AB	-	Air sampling and surveillance cultures for fungi were performed in a Scottish
		general haematology ward over a five-month period in 1997. The mean total fungal
		count from the air sampling appeared to be correlated with the number of patients
		colonized by Aspergillus. The most commonly isolated species were Aspergillus
		"versicolor, A. fumigatus and A. niger. Rooms with portable air filtration units"
		had significantly lower total fungal counts than the others. Swabs were taken
		from 70 patients (mean age 62 years); 114 of the 563 cultures (20.2%) were
		"positive. The most commonly isolated species were A. fumigatus, Candida albicans,"
		C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis. Samples taken from the tongue and perineum
		showed colonization more often than those taken from the nostrils. Almost half
		"the patients (48.6%) were colonized on, or within seven days of, admission; 11.4%"
		became colonized whilst on the unit. One patient developed fatal aspergillosis.
		We conclude that colonization or high air-borne spore concentrations are not
		necessarily predictive of fungal infection but may prompt early treatment or more
		aggressive prophylaxis of potentially fatal invasive infections.

PG	-	149-50
AB	-	There has been a gradual increase in the incidence of non-Candida
		albicans-related nosocomial infections. Candida glabrata urinary tract infections
		"have increased in frequency, and treating these infections can be difficult"
		"because the organism may be resistant to fluconazole. A newer antifungal agent,"
		"micafungin, which belongs in the class of echinocandins, provides an alternative"
		and effective therapy against C glabrata. The present report describes three

		treatment of C glabrata and azole-resistant C albicans-associated urinary tract
		infection with an echinocandin.

PG	-	919-24
AB	-	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Nosocomial pneumonia in patients in an intensive care
		unit (ICU) are a great problem as a cause of increased morbidity and mortality as
		well as the resulting high cost of treatment. This study was aimed at determining
		the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia and the risk factors for its occurrence in
		patients with severe neurological disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1.1. and
		"31.12.1997, 217 patients (125 men, 92 women; average age 63.4 years) were"
		prospectively included if they were treated for more than 48 hours in the ICU of
		the Neurology Department of Erlangen University. The occurrence of nosocomial
		"pneumonia (NP) was noted, using the criteria of the Center of Disease Control and"
		"Prevention (CDC). Incidence of the diseases was related to age, sex, initial"
		"state of consciousness, type of ventilation, duration of stay in the ICU and any"
		associated medical condition. RESULTS: NP was diagnosed in 68 patients (31.4%).
		"Statistically significant relative risks were male sex (2.4 fold, P < 0.01),"
		"clouded consciousness with a Glasgow coma score < 8 (6.2 fold, P < 0.001),"
		"mechanical ventilation (8.4 fold, P < 0.001), time in ICU > or = 8 days (9.3"
		"fold, P < 0.001) and associated medical condition (3.3 fold, P < 0.005). In 17.7%"
		of cases no relevant pathogen was identified microbiologically. A mixed infection
		"was present in 36.8% of cases. The most common Gram-positive organism was Staph,"
		"aureus (35.3%), the most common Gram-negative ones were Ps. aeruginosa (25%), Kl."
		"pneumoniae and Kl. oxytoca (11.8%), E. Coli (10.3%) and Acinetobacter species"
		(7.4%). There was also a high rate of infection or infestation with Candida
		albicans or glabrata (41.2%). NP played a clinically decisive role in the fatal
		"course of 13 of the 47 patients who died. CONCLUSION: These data (incidence,"
		"relative risk) can, by taking into consideration various aspects of specialist"
		"and hospital hygienic practices, contribute to a continuing optimization of the"
		prevention and treatment of disease.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Onychomycosis is a world-wide public health concern in children,"
		requiring epidemiological data for different regions for control and prevention.
		AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the predominant pathogens and risk
		"factors for onychomycosis in school children living in Kayseri, Turkey. METHODS:"
		"This study included 8122 school children, aged 5-16 years, living in the rural"
		and urban areas around Kayseri. Onychomycosis was clinically classified as distal
		"and lateral subungual (DLSO), proximal subungual, superficial white, endonyx and"
		totally dystrophic onychomycosis. Nail samples from children with clinically
		"diagnosed onychomycosis were collected, examined by direct microscopy and"
		inoculated for culture study. The demographic features and possible risk factors
		were recorded and assessed by logistic regression models. RESULTS: We clinically
		"diagnosed onychomycosis in 152 out of 8,122 (0.18%) school children. DLSO was the"
		"most frequent clinical diagnosis (120/152, 78.9%). Culture-positive onychomycosis"
		was detected in 27/152 (17.7%) children. The prevalence of culture-positive
		onychomycosis was determined as 0.33%. All culture-positive samples were only
		from toenails. The onychomycosis causative agents were dermatophytes in 17/27
		"cases (62.9%), including Trichophyton rubrum 12 (44.4%), Trichophyton"
		"mentagrophytes 1 (3.7%), Trichophyton tonsurans 1 (3.7%) and Trichophyton spp. 3"
		"(11.1%) and yeasts in 10/27 cases (37.1%), including Candida glabrata 4 (14.8%),"
		"Candida parapsilosis 1 (3.7%), Trichosporon 2 (7.4%) and Rhodotorula 3 (11.1%)."
		"Age, father's occupation, number of siblings and rooms were statistically"
		associated with the frequency of onychomycosis. CONCLUSIONS: Although to be
		prevalence of onychomycosis in school children in central Anatolia of Turkey
		"seems very low degree, pediatric onychomycosis is a growing public health concern"
		all over the world. Children having more siblings or unemployed fathers and
		children living in small house as well as older children should be examined
		carefully for onychomycosis.

PG	-	15-Sep
AB	-	PURPOSE: To determine the incidence of and risk factors for fungal keratitis and
		endophthalmitis in patients with a Boston keratoprosthesis (KPro) and to
		determine whether surveillance cultures were helpful in predicting fungal
		infection. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed of 182 patients
		(202 eyes) who received a type 1 (through cornea) or type 2 (through cornea and
		"lid) KPro between March 1, 1990, and December 31, 2004, and who were followed for"
		"at least 1 month (range, 1 month to 13 years; mean, 2.84 years). There were 148"
		"eyes with type 1 and 54 eyes with type 2. Beginning in late 1999, many eyes were"
		"given a prophylactic topical regimen containing vancomycin, and many eyes with"
		type 1 KPro were given therapeutic contact lenses. Cases of fungal keratitis or
		"endophthalmitis were analyzed. To determine the fungal colonization rate, 70"
		surveillance cultures of the ocular or lid surface around the KPro optic were
		obtained of 36 uninfected KPro eyes (35 patients) at random time-points over 1
		year (August 2002 to July 2003). RESULTS: There were 4 definite and 1 probable
		"fungal infections in 6893 patient-months of follow-up, or 0.009 fungal infections"
		per patient-year. These included 3 cases of definite or probable Candida
		"endophthalmitis (C. parapsilosis, C. glabrata, and C. albicans) and 2 cases of"
		"mold keratitis (Alternaria, Fusarium). The rate was higher in eyes receiving a"
		vancomycin-containing topical prophylactic regimen than those with on a
		non-vancomycin regimen (5 cases/2774 person-months vs. 0 cases/4119
		"person-months; P = 0.011). In eyes with type 1 KPro, the rate was higher with"
		therapeutic contact lens wear than without (4/1682 vs. 0/3115 person-months; P =
		"0.015). Surveillance cultures did not predict fungal infection, and none of the 6"
		surveillance eyes colonized with fungi (all Candida) developed a fungal
		infection. The prevalence of fungal colonization in KPro eyes had not changed
		"since our 1996 surveillance study (11% vs. 10%, P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Fungal"
		infections in KPro eyes have appeared since we introduced broad-spectrum
		"antibiotic prophylaxis and therapeutic contact lenses 5 years ago, but the"
		infection rate remains very low in our mostly New England-based patient
		population. Cleaning or replacing the contact lens on a regular basis and
		prescribing a short course of topical amphotericin at the first visible signs of
		fungal colonization may prevent these infections.

AB	-	"Candiduria is a common nosocomial infection in hospitalized patients, which may"
		progress into life-threatening candidemia. Successful treatment of urosepsis
		"requires early and effective antifungal therapy, while the available agents"
		within three pharmacological classes each have characteristic pharmacokinetics
		"and side effect profiles. Moreover, treatment of Candida spp. infections is"
		"becoming challenging due to increasing multi drug-resistance. Here, we present a"
		case of candidemia resulting from a multi drug-resistant C. glabrata infection of
		the urinary tract. Due to resistance to fluconazole and a contraindication for
		"amphotericin B, micafungin was used in the treatment, regardless of its"
		unfavorable pharmacokinetic properties. Our study showed that despite the
		"expected low levels in the urinary tract, micafungin was successful in the"
		"eradication of C. glabrata allowing full recovery of the patient. Thus,"
		micafungin should be considered in the management of urosepsis caused by
		sensitive Candida spp.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: While fungaemia caused by two or more different species of yeasts
		"(mixed fungaemia, MF) is infrequent, it might be underestimated. AIMS: This study"
		"aimed to determine the incidence of MF, clinical characteristics of the patients,"
		and antifungal susceptibility profiles of the isolates with a systematic review
		of the literature. SOURCES: Data sources were PubMed and Scopus. STUDY
		ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Studies reporting ten or more mixed fungaemia episodes.
		CONTENT: Study included MF episodes in adults between January 2000 and August
		"2018 in Hacettepe University Hospitals, Turkey. The isolation, identification and"
		antifungal susceptibility testing (AFST) of the isolates were by standard
		mycological methods. Patient data were obtained retrospectively. Literature
		search was performed using relevant keywords according to PRISMA systematic
		review guidelines. A total of 32 patients with 33 MF episodes were identified.
		"Among all fungaemia episodes, MF incidence was 3.7% (33/883). All patients had"
		"one or more underlying disorders among which solid-organ cancer (50.0%, 16/32)"
		was the most common. Overall mortality was 51.5% (17/33). The most preferred
		"antifungal agents for initial treatment were fluconazole (48.5%, 16/33) and"
		"echinocandins (39.4%, 13/33). Fluconazole susceptible-dose-dependent (S-DD) or"
		"-resistant Candida species were detected in 15 episodes, and an isolate of"
		C. parapsilosis was classified as S-DD by AFST. All Candida isolates were
		susceptible to echinocandins. Non-candida yeasts with intrinsic
		resistance/reduced susceptibility to both echinocandins and fluconazole were
		detected in two episodes. Systematic review of the literature revealed 24 studies
		that reported more than ten MF episodes. Methodology was variable. Improvement of
		detection rates was reported when chromogenic agars were used. Most studies
		underlined detection of isolates with reduced susceptibility. IMPLICATIONS:
		"Although rare, the MF rate is affected by the detection methods, which have"
		improved in recent years. Fluconazole and echinocandins were used for initial
		"treatment in accordance with the current guideline recommendations; however,"
		isolates non-susceptible to both were detected. Detection of a mixed infection
		offers an opportunity for optimum treatment.

TI	-	High urine ethanol and negative blood and vitreous ethanol in a diabetic woman: a
		"case report, retrospective case survey, and review of the literature."
PG	-	96-8
AB	-	Several studies have shown that ethanol can be produced in urine infected with
		yeast or bacteria in vitro. We present the unusual case of a diabetic woman in
		whom ethanol was produced in her urine in vivo. The decedent was a 19-year-old
		woman who was noncompliant with her diabetes treatment. She presented to a local
		hospital in severe diabetic ketoacidosis and died shortly thereafter. Upon
		"arrival at the hospital, a blood glucose of 553 mg/dL was detected. A urinalysis"
		"was positive for ketones (> 80 mg/dL), glucose (> 1000 mg/dL), and large budding"
		yeast forms. A drug screen performed on the urine was positive for ethanol. At
		"the coroner/medical examiner office, an autopsy was negative for significant"
		"anatomic findings. Toxicology analysis revealed a urine ethanol level 0.32 g/dL,"
		although no ethanol was detected in blood or vitreous samples. A urine gram stain
		and culture identified Candida glabrata. A retrospective case review of all
		deaths related to diabetes examined at the coroner/medical examiner office from
		1986 to 2003 did not reveal other cases with similar findings. This case of a
		"noncompliant, juvenile-diabetic woman illustrates a rare finding of apparent in"
		vivo glucose fermentation by C. glabrata to form ethanol in the urine. This case
		also highlights a potential difficulty in toxicologic analysis and interpretation
		using urine only.

PG	-	780-785
AB	-	A retrospective analysis of fungal infections was carried out in a health-care
		burn center between 2011 and 2014 using the patients' medical records (n = 36).
		"Patients ranged from 18 to 87 years of age, with 23 (63.9%) being women. The most"
		prevalent widespread total body surface area affected (TBSA) was 30-50% (p =
		"0.03), and 71-100% in younger patients, mainly associated with femicide. Fourth"
		"degree burns were revealed in 69.4% of the patients while in 50%, inhalation"
		injuries were observed to represent a higher mortality rate (p = 0.04). The
		Candida score was 3 in 77.7% of cases respectively. Central venous catheter and
		mechanical ventilation were used. All patients received antibiotic treatment and
		91.7% antifungal treatment. Surgical excision of the burn was performed in 33
		"(91.7%) patients, and skin autografting in 29 (80.6%). The median of the fungal"
		infection developed was 21.4 days after admission to the ICU. The specimens
		analyzed involved 52 yeast samples isolated from different cultures: urine
		"(42.3%), blood (26.9%), skin biopsy (9.6%), catheter tip (15.4%) and tracheal"
		aspirate (5.8%). The use of microbiological culture and molecular methods allowed
		"for the identification of Candida albicans (53.8%), C. tropicalis (23.1%), C."
		"parapsilosis sensu stricto (13.5%), C. krusei (5.8%), C. glabrata (1.9%) and C."
		dubliniensis (1.9%). Fungal infections observed in skin burns lead to severe

PG	-	1077-82
AB	-	Evaluation of the fungal involvement in the etiology of ventilator-associated
		pneumonia (VAP) after cardiac surgery. The study had as target the patients
		diagnosed with VAP after cardiac surgery at the Institute of Cardiovascular
		"Diseases in Iaşi, between April 2nd 2002 and December 31st 2009. MATERIAL AND"
		METHOD: Our study included only cases with fungal etiology of VAP. We examined
		quantitatively the tracheal aspirates with cytology quality score Q = 2+:
		microscopy and cultivation. The isolates with clinical significance (=
		10(6)UFC/mL significantly associated to inflammatory cells) were identified by
		standard methods or based on the API system (bioMérieux) and tested by the
		breakpoints method for susceptibility to antifungal agents. RESULTS: Among the
		"2167 operated patients, 35 of them were diagnosed with VAP through the clinical"
		pulmonary infection score = 6. Fungi caused 15 of 44 VAP episodes. With a
		"frequency of 30.19%, fungi are on 2nd place within the etiologic agents of VAP"
		after non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli (45.28%). The fungi involved in VAP
		"were: Candida albicans (16.97%), Pneumocystis jirovecii (3.77%), while Candida"
		"glabrata, Candida sake, Candida krusei, Geotrichum capitatum and Cryptococcus"
		"humicola, amounted 1.89% each. The widespread use of broad spectrum antibiotics"
		led to the emergence of fungi as a common cause of ventilator-associated
		"pneumonia. The involvement in the VAP etiology of P. jirovecii, an un-cultivable"
		"fungus with special sensitivity to antibiotics, requires a careful microscopy of"
		specimens.

AB	-	Invasive Candida glabrata infections are not common complications after radical
		"cystoprostatectomy. Furthermore, resistance to echinocandins arising during the"
		course of a patient's treatment is rarely recognised. We described a case of
		development of echinocandin resistance in a patient with muscle-invasive bladder
		"cancer (pT2b N0 M0, high grade) diagnosis, subjected to radical"
		cystoprostatectomy and exposed to echinocandins. A male patient with a previous
		"surgical history after a traffic accident, who was operated on due to bladder"
		"cancer, underwent an episode of candidemia and mixed postoperative wound and"
		urinary tract infection caused by C. glabrata and extended spectrum β-lactamase
		(ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli during hospital treatment. The patient was
		started on caspofungin. Repeat blood cultures showed clearance of the bloodstream
		"infection; however, infection persisted at the surgical site. Resistance to"
		echinocandins developed within 2 months from the day of initiation of therapy
		with caspofungin in the C. glabrata strain obtained from the surgical site. The
		isolates sequentially obtained during the patient's treatment demonstrated
		resistance to echinocandins due to the mutation in hotspot 1 FKS2. Although
		"resistance to echinocandins is relatively rare, it should be considered in"
		oncological patients with increased complexity of treatment and intestinal
		surgery.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the prevalence of Candida spp. in
		diabetics and nondiabetics with and without denture stomatitis (DS). STUDY
		DESIGN: Mycologic samples were taken from the dentures of 90 healthy subjects
		"(control group [CG]), 80 denture stomatitis nondiabetics (DSND), and 40 denture"
		stomatitis diabetics (DSD; well controlled type 2) for identification of Candida
		"spp. Results were analyzed by Fisher exact test, Bonferroni-corrected confidence"
		"interval, and χ(2) test (α = .05). RESULTS: Candida albicans was the predominant"
		"species isolated (81.9%; P < .016), with C. tropicalis and C. glabrata"
		"demonstrating similar prevalence (15.71% and 15.24%, respectively). The"
		prevalence of C. albicans and C. tropicalis in the DS groups were significantly
		higher (P < .01) than in the CG. The prevalence of C. tropicalis significantly
		increased with the highest degree of inflammation (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The
		prevalence of Candida spp. was similar between diabetic and nondiabetic patients
		with DS. Candida tropicalis may play a role in the progression of DS.

PG	-	e13486
LID	-	10.1111/tid.13486 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Data on the risk factors and outcome of intra-abdominal fungal
		infections (IAFI) following simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation (PKT)
		are scarce. MATERIALS/METHODS: A retrospective monocentric study was conducted on
		all patients who underwent simultaneous PKT from January 2007 to December 2016.
		Deep sites positive cultures for fungi during the first post-transplantation year
		"were collected. Clinical, radiological, and microbiological data of proven and"
		probable invasive fungal infections were analysed. RESULTS: Among sixteen PKT
		"patients, 15 were included. Seven patients (47%) developed an invasive fungal"
		"infection, exclusively IAFI (six proven, one probable). The proven IAFI included"
		"four peritonitis, one pancreatic necrosis with infected hematoma, and one patient"
		with positive preservation fluid only (PF). Candida albicans (n = 4) was the most
		"prevalent species (associated with Galactomyces candidus in one case), C"
		"glabrata, C dubliniensis, and C krusei were found in one case each. Three"
		patients had either a positive direct examination and/or culture for renal or
		pancreatic PF and the culture of PF was positive for the same species that caused
		IAFI. IAFIs were significantly associated with pancreatic graft arterial
		"thrombosis (5/7 vs 0/8, P = .007) and fungal contamination of PF (3/7 vs 0/8,"
		"P = .008). Among patients with IAFI, all required an early surgical revision"
		post-transplantation [1-18 days] and six had early or delayed pancreatic graft
		removal. One patient died in the first post-transplant year. CONCLUSION: IAFI is
		"a common complication in PKT, associated with pancreatic graft thrombosis or"
		"fungal contamination of the graft PF, and can sometimes lead to pancreatic"
		detransplantation.

		antifungal therapy in 41 cancer patients receiving antineoplastic chemotherapy:
		analysis of aetiology risk factors and outcome.
PG	-	373-80
AB	-	Forty-one episodes of breakthrough fungaemia occurring over a 7.5 year period in
		"the National and St Elizabeth's Cancer Institutes in Bratislava, Slovakia, were"
		analysed. Five of them occurred during prophylaxis with fluconazole (one
		"Torulopsis glabrata, one Hansenula anomala, two Candida krusei and one Candida"
		"parapsilosis), ten with itraconazole (three Trichosporon pullulans, one"
		"Trichosporon beigelii, one Cryptococcus laurentii, three Candida albicans and two"
		"T. glabrata), 11 during prophylaxis with ketoconazole (one Candida norvegenesis,"
		"one C. parapsilosis, one C. krusei, one Candida tropicalis, five C. albicans, one"
		Candida stellatoidea and one C. laurentii and 15 during empirical therapy with
		"amphotericin B (ten C. albicans, two T. beigelii and three Candida lusitaniae)."
		"The most frequent risk factors for breakthrough fungaemia were neutropenia,"
		previous therapy with multiple antibiotics and recent catheter insertion.
		Comparing these episodes with 38 non-breakthrough fungaemias (appearing at the
		same institute in the same period) differences in certain risk factors were
		noted: breakthrough fungaemias were more frequently observed in patients with
		"acute leukaemia (39.0% vs 5.2%, P < 0.001), mucositis (34.2% vs 13.1%, P < 0.05),"
		"prophylaxis with quinolones (58.5% vs 15.8%, P < 0.0001) and catheter-associated"
		"infections (29.3% vs 2.6%, P < 0.003). In this subgroup overall mortality (36.6%"
		vs 28.8%) or early attributable mortality (22.0% vs 23.6%) were not significantly
		different.

AB	-	"Coinfections with bacteria or fungi may be a frequent complication of COVID-19,"
		but coinfections with Candida species in COVID-19 patients remain rare. We report
		the 53-day clinical course of a complicated type-2 diabetes patient diagnosed
		"with COVID-19, who developed bloodstream infections initially due to"
		"methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, secondly due to multidrug-resistant"
		"Gram-negative bacteria, and lastly due to a possibly fatal Candida glabrata. The"
		development of FKS-associated pan-echinocandin resistance in the C. glabrata
		isolated from the patient after 13 days of caspofungin treatment aggravated the
		situation. The patient died of septic shock shortly before the prospect of
		receiving potentially effective antifungal therapy. This case emphasizes the
		importance of early diagnosis and monitoring for antimicrobial drug-resistant
		coinfections to reduce their unfavorable outcomes in COVID-19 patients.

PG	-	1050
LID	-	10.12688/f1000research.24854.2 [doi]
AB	-	Background:  Candida species are one of the most important opportunistic fungal
		"pathogens that cause both superficial and systemic infections, especially in"
		immunocompromised individuals. Considering the sharp increase in the rate of 
		"Candida infections, and resistance to commonly used antifungal agents in the last"
		decades; this study was conducted to determine the rate of resistance among
		"clinical isolates of  Candida species, and to characterize some of the resistant"
		genes among resistant isolates collected in Khartoum.  Methods: This is a
		cross-sectional laboratory-based study included 100 pre-screened  Candida species
		isolates from Khartoum state hospitals. Chromogenic media was used for 
		Candida isolation and/or identification. The standard disc diffusion method was
		"performed to investigate the susceptibility to fluconazole, itraconazole, and"
		"amphotericin. Following genomic DNA extraction, the entire  ERG11 gene was"
		"amplified from some C. albicans resistant isolates, sequenced, and further"
		"analyzed. Results: Out of 100 clinical isolates collected, 51% were  C. albicans,"
		"followed by  C. glabrata (31%),  C. krusie (8%),  C. tropicals (5%), and C."
		"dupliniens (5%). Resistance rate was 23% for fluconazole, 4% for itraconazole,"
		while there were no amphotericin resistant isolates detected. C. albicans 
		"ERG11 gene sequence reveals 15 different mutations. Among these, three (D116E,"
		"E266D, and V488I) were missense mutations; however, these substitutions do not"
		contribute to fluconazole resistance. Conclusion:  C. albicans was found to be
		the most common species. Resistance against fluconazole was observed most
		"frequently; however, mutations in ERG11 are unlikely to be the reason behind"
		fluconazole resistance among these isolates.

		admitted to a large university hospital.
PG	-	138-143
LID	-	10.1111/myc.13533 [doi]
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Candida auris is an emerging pathogen in health care-associated
		"infections. In contrast to many other countries with rising numbers of C. auris,"
		"only seven cases have been reported in Germany from 2015 to 2017, mostly from"
		patients who received prior medical treatment abroad. We therefore established a
		mandatory screening for C. auris colonisation at our tertiary care centre for all
		patients who were admitted as international patients or previously hospitalised
		in a foreign country within the past 6 months. METHODS: Colonisation of patients
		was assessed using a previously established screening protocol for multidrug
		"resistant bacteria. Since 2017, all screening samples were additionally analysed"
		"for C. auris using CHROMagar Candida (CHROMagar, Paris, France). Yeast isolates"
		were identified using matrix-assisted laser ionisation time-of-flight (MALDI
		"TOF), except for C. albicans (identified by the typical green colour on"
		chromogenic agar). Data were analysed retrospectively. RESULTS: Our study cohort
		included 655 patients and an overall number of 1399 samples. Fifty-three patients
		"were colonised with Candida species (C. albicans, n = 37; C. glabrata, n = 14;"
		others n = 9). No case of C. auris was detected. Candida spp. were mainly
		detected from respiratory samples (5.4% positive) and gastrointestinal specimen
		"(5.2%). Laboratory costs were 14,689 € and analyses resulted in 98.7 h of"
		additional technician's work. CONCLUSION: No colonisation with C. auris was
		detected among patients with previous hospitalisation abroad. Universal C. auris
		screening of patients with any contact to foreign health care does not seem to be
		cost-effective in our setting and more targeted screening strategies have to be
		developed.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: The aim of our study was to evaluate the concordance between the
		two antifungal susceptibility testing of Candida sp. isolates using agar
		diffusion method: Neo-Sensitabs(®) tablets and Bio-Rad(®) disks. MATERIALS AND
		METHODS: This is a prospective study conducted in the Laboratory of Parasitology
		and Mycology of the Mohammed V military teaching hospital from February to August
		"2012. Upon receiving blood cultures and peripheral sites samples, the"
		identification of Candida isolates performed using routine phenotypic standard
		tests and the realization of the antifungal susceptibility was carried out on
		Neo-sensitabs(®) tablets and Bio-Rad(®) disks. RESULTS: A total of 38 Candida
		"strains were isolated: 15 C. albicans (39%), 13 C. glabrata (34%), 5 C."
		"tropicalis (13%), 4 C. krusei (11%) and 1 C. dubliniensis (3%). There were no"
		significant difference (P>0.05) in susceptibility rate between both methods for
		all antifungal agents tested except for 5-fluorocytosine. The concordance
		"percentage between two methods was 100% for amphotericin B, 97.4% for"
		"fluconazole, 94.7% for voriconazole and 73% for 5-fluorocytosine. CONCLUSION:"
		"Both methods are easy to perform, rapid and cost effective. Our results showed"
		the best agreement between the two methods for testing the susceptibility of
		"Candida isolates to amphotericin B, fluconazole and voriconazole while for the"

AB	-	CASE SUMMARY: An 11-year-old female spayed Maine Coon cat was referred for
		"assessment of hyporexia, weight loss, vomiting and diarrhoea. An abdominal"
		ultrasound revealed an enlarged and hypoechoic pancreas containing two large
		fluid-filled structures. Fine-needle aspiration of the cyst-like structures was
		"performed, and cytology revealed moderate-to-marked predominantly suppurative"
		inflammation with yeast cells. Candida glabrata was cultured from the fluid. The
		"patient was treated with oral itraconazole and the clinical signs resolved,"
		although repeat abdominal ultrasound and cytology revealed persistence of the
		infected cyst-like structures. The patient remained asymptomatic for 8 months
		"after the discontinuation of antifungal medications, despite the persistence of"
		the pancreatic infection with C glabrata. RELEVANCE AND NOVEL INFORMATION: To our
		"knowledge, this is the first report of pancreatic infection with Candida species"
		"in a cat, followed by a chronic subclinical infection persisting for at least 8"
		months after treatment discontinuation.

AB	-	Candiduria detection in hospitalized or immunocompromised patients is of great
		clinical significance. The aim of our study was to describe the isolation
		frequency of significant species of yeasts in urine samples processed in our
		"hospital during the period 2010- 2013, and to analyze their susceptibility to"
		commonly used antifungal agents. Species identification was performed by seeding
		"on a chromogenic medium, the filamentation test and automated systems (ASM Vitek"
		"and MALDI Biotyper), while susceptibility was determined using the ASM Vitek"
		"system. Of the 632 yeast isolates in urine, 371 were Candida albicans species and"
		261 non-C. albicans Candida spp. The species with the highest number of resistant
		"isolates were Candida glabrata and Candida krusei. Based on the results obtained,"
		we believe that species identification and the susceptibility study should be
		current practice in the laboratories when species other than C. albicans are
		isolated.

AB	-	We report a case of an oesophageal intramural pseudodiverticulosis leading to a
		mediastinal collection caused by Candida glabrata presenting as a non-resolving
		pneumonia and mimicking an oesophageal mass. The patient was a 60-year-old
		diabetic male who was referred from another hospital and presented with a history
		of low-grade fever and breathlessness. His computed tomography (CT) of the chest
		disclosed a mediastinal mass alongside the oesophagus with pleural collection.
		Endobronchial ultrasound scope was inserted through the oesophagus (EUS-B) and
		fine-needle aspirate was taken from the mass. The cultures of specimen from the
		mediastinum grew drug-resistant C. glabrata. The patient was managed with oral
		voriconazole along with oesophageal stenting after which he showed remarkable
		recovery. Repeat CT revealed a near-complete reduction of the mediastinal
		"infection. The case highlights the need of a high degree of suspicion, right"
		approach to diagnostic work-up and appropriate histopathological and
		microbiological examination of clinical specimens.

PG	-	679-82
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To determine the various oral Candidal species among healthy Malaysian
		adults. DESIGN: Case-control study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: This study was
		"collaborated between the Department of Medical Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine"
		"and Department of Oral Pathology, Oral Medicine and Periodontology, Faculty of"
		"Dentistry, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, between September 2002"
		till January 2004. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred adults (50 smokers and 50
		"non-smokers), aged between 40 and 70 years were studied. Swabs and carbohydrate"
		"assimilation (Saboraud Dextrose Agar, Corn Meal Agar, API 20C AUX System) were"
		"performed. Specimens were collected from dorsum of the tongue, buccal mucosa and"
		commissures (right and left each). Colony forms were established by positive
		"colony forming units, on SDA medium (24-48 hours). Germ tube test for"
		(true/pseudohyphae) growth was done on Corn Meal Agar Medium. Candida biotypes
		"were evaluated by API 20C AUX system, which had a numerical 7 digit profile,"
		added to evaluate a definite Candida species. RESULTS: Thirty-five percent of
		Malaysian adults harbored Candida intraorally. Candidal species identified among
		"100 subjects had C. albicans (27) 77%, C. glabrata (3) 8%, C. famata, C."
		"tropicalis, C. krusei, C. lusitaniae and C. guilliermondii (1) 3% each."
		Thirty-three positive cases comprised of 35 species i.e. two cases had two
		species each. Fifty seven percent of these were smokers and 43% non-smokers.
		"These included 40% Chinese, 36% Malays and 24% Indians. Species were, however,"
		"not specified according to intra-oral sites i.e. buccal, commissural mucosa and"
		dorsum of tongue. CONCLUSION: On this series C. albicans is the most common
		species found in the oral cavity of Malaysian adults. It is equally frequent in
		"smokers and non-smokers, but showed a predilection for the ethnic Chinese group."

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating
		autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system. Since immune system
		"plays a key role in this disease, patients with MS can present higher risk of"
		infections. PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of Candida
		spp. in the oral cavity of MS patients in relation to a control group METHODS: In
		"total, 100 individuals were selected: 55 diagnosed with MS and 45 healthy"
		individuals (control group). Saliva samples were collected and seeded in culture
		"media selecting for Candida. Following an incubation period of 48 h,"
		colony-forming units (CFU mL(-1)) were counted and colonies were isolated for
		Candida species identification by multiplex PCR. The results were analysed by
		chi-squared and Mann-Whitney U statistical tests considering a significance level
		of 5%. RESULTS: Candida spp. were confirmed in the oral cavity of 50.09% patients
		in the MS group and 35.55% individuals in the control group. In individuals
		"positive for the growth of Candida spp., the median values of Candida colonies"
		were 220 CFU mL(-1) for the MS group and 120 CFU mL(-1) for the control group.
		"However, no statistically significant differences were observed between groups"
		"for both prevalence and CFU mL(-1) count. Of the Candida species identified,"
		"73.91% were C. albicans, 21.73% C. glabrata, 2.17% C. tropicalis, and 2.17% C."
		krusei. CONCLUSIONS: The colonization of Candida spp. in the oral cavity of
		individuals with multiple sclerosis was higher than in the control group; however
		these findings were not proven to be statistically significant.

LID	-	10.1007/5584_2016_196 [doi]
AB	-	Biofilm forming capacity of yeasts colonizing the intravenous devices is
		considered a key factor involved in the pathogenesis of Candida catheter-related
		bloodstream infections (CCRBSI). The biofilm production of strains of Candida
		spp. isolated both from the CVC and from the blood of patients with CCRBSI was
		"compared to that of strains isolated from patients not having CCRBSI. Results,"
		"expressed in terms of Biofilm Index (BI), revealed that biofilm-producing strains"
		were isolated in the CCRBSI group with a frequency significantly higher than in
		"the non-CCRBSI group (χ(2) = 4.25, p = 0.03). The species more frequently"
		"cultured was C. parapsilosis complex (including C. parapsilosis sensu stricto, C."
		orthopsilosis and C. metapsilosis). When this species was isolated from the CVC
		tip cultures of the CCRBSI group it showed BIs significantly (p = 0.05) higher
		than those found in the non-CCRBSI group. All the strains of C. tropicalis
		isolated from the CCRBSI group produced biofilm. Instead most of the isolates of
		C. glabrata were non-producers. The cumulative BI of non-albicans Candida strains
		isolated from CCRBSI patients was significantly higher than that of non-albicans
		strains cultured from patients non-CCRBSI (χ(2) = 6.91; p = 0.008). C. albicans
		was a biofilm producer both in the CCRBSI and in the non-CCRBSI group. When
		isolated from the blood it showed enhanced biofilm production in the CCRBSI group
		"only, while when colonizing the CVC it displayed high BIs both in the CCRBSI"
		group and in non-CCRBSI group. Our data seem to indicate that the biofilm
		production capacity should be considered in the clinical management of CCRBSI.

		Control Study.
PG	-	78-84
LID	-	10.1089/chi.2015.0194 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Differences in relative proportions of gut microbial communities in
		adults have been correlated with intestinal diseases and obesity. In this study
		"we evaluated the gut microbiota biodiversity, both bacterial and fungal, in obese"
		and normal-weight school-aged children. METHODS: We studied 28 obese (mean age
		10.03 ± 0.68) and 33 age- and sex-matched normal-weight children. BMI z-scores
		"were calculated, and the obesity condition was defined according to the WHO"
		criteria. Fecal samples were analyzed by 16S rRNA amplification followed by
		denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis and sequencing. Real-time
		polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to quantify the most representative
		microbial species and genera. RESULTS: DGGE profiles showed high bacterial
		biodiversity without significant correlations with BMI z-score groups. Compared
		"to bacterial profiles, we observed lower richness in yeast species. Sequence of"
		"the most representative bands gave back Eubacterium rectale, Saccharomyces"
		"cerevisiae, Candida albicans, and C. glabrata as present in all samples."
		Debaryomyces hansenii was present only in two obese children. Obese children
		"revealed a significantly lower abundance in Akkermansia muciniphyla,"
		"Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Bacteroides/Prevotella group, Candida spp., and"
		"Saccharomyces spp. (P = 0.031, P = 0.044, P = 0.003, P = 0.047, and P = 0.034,"
		"respectively). CONCLUSION: Taking into account the complexity of obesity, our"
		data suggest that differences in relative abundance of some core microbial
		"species, preexisting or diet driven, could actively be part of its etiology. This"
		study improved our knowledge about the fungal population in the pediatric
		school-age population and highlighted the need to consider the influence of
		cross-kingdom relationships.

AB	-	A 38-year-old female patient with well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus
		treated with canagliflozin underwent ureteral stent placement for obstructive
		"renal calculi. Ten days following ureteroscopy and ureteral stenting, she"
		developed fevers and blood cultures grew Candida glabrata (C. glabrata). The
		patient was successfully treated with an extended course of broad-spectrum
		antibiotics and antifungal agents. The clinical presentation of candidemia is
		indistinguishable from bacteremia resulting in delay in diagnosis and treatment.
		"Candiduria is commonly seen in patients with type 2 diabetes, however it rarely"
		leads to candidemia in an otherwise healthy person following a relatively simple
		urologic procedure. Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors act by
		its glycosuric effect and further increases the risk of genitourinary candida
		infection. Urologic procedures may lead to bloodstream entry of the genitourinary
		fungal organisms and result in life-threatening fungemia. Our case emphasizes the
		importance of awareness of the increased risk of potentially life threatening
		fungemia in patients using SGLT-2 inhibitors to avoid delay in diagnosis and
		treatment.

AB	-	Fungal osteomyelitis (OM) is relatively rare. There is scarce literature
		discussing fungal OM in diabetic foot infections (DFIs). This case series
		explores the clinical characteristics of patients treated at a large tertiary
		academic center for DFI and found to have a causative agent of fungal origin in
		"their bone on surgical intervention. Between July 2017 and March 2018, a"
		prospective longitudinal analysis was performed of patients with diabetes
		admitted to our institution who underwent operative management of OM.
		"Demographic, clinical, radiographic, and laboratory data were collected for all"
		patients. Data between bacterial and fungal OM cohorts was analyzed for
		differences and similarities in patient characteristics and outcomes. All
		patients were followed 20 weeks postoperatively. Five patients with fungal OM
		were identified from the 35 cases where OM was confirmed through podiatric
		"surgical intervention. In each fungal case, a Candida species was isolated from"
		"operative bone culture which included subspecies Candida albicans, C"
		"parapsilosis, and C glabrata. A P value ⩾.05 was found in clinical"
		characteristics between our cohorts. Wound healing was achieved in 40% of
		"patients with fungal OM, and oral fluconazole successfully treated Candida OM in"
		the cases that achieved healing. Diabetes can increase the risk of Candida OM. In
		"DFIs, fungus can impede wound healing if not recognized and treated. Because"
		"Candida OM is typically indolent in nature, bone biopsy and mycological culture"
		is recommended for definitive diagnosis and treatment.

LID	-	9995583
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Small bowel transplantation is a potential option for patients with
		"intestinal-failure, and the incidences of infections caused by Candida species"
		that are more resistant to antifungal drugs are increasing in these patients. In
		"this manuscript, we reported a case of fatal colitis after small bowel"
		transplantation induces by multidrug-resistant (MDR) Candida glabrata. Case
		Presentation. A 52-year-old man has undergone an extensive small bowel resection
		with the length of the remaining bowel which was less than 40 cm who became a
		"candidate for transplantation. Four months after transplantation, the patient"
		experienced severe bloody diarrhea with abdominal distension. Ileoscopy and
		colonoscopy did not show neither pathological change and rejection nor
		cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection posttransplantation. Abdomen computed tomography
		showed diffuse moderate small bowel wall thickening. After detection of budding
		"yeast in the stool samples, stool culture was positive for Candida, DNA was"
		"extracted, and ITS1-5.8s-ITS2 region of the fungal agent was amplified."
		Sequencing analysis of PCR and antifungal susceptibility testing revealed that
		"this isolate was multidrug-resistant C. glabrata. Besides, there was no evidence"
		for other pathogens known to cause infection in various laboratory tests.
		"Immediate antifungal treatments with caspofungin remained unsuccessful, and on"
		"the eighteenth day of admission, the patient expires with septic shock."
		CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the challenging management of candidiasis in
		patients with small bowel transplantation. Infectious diseases due to MDR
		organisms have emerged as a vital clinical problem in this patient population.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Coupled with the increasing use of indwelling vascular catheters
		and prosthetic cardiac valves is an uptrend in sepsis secondary to fungemia. An
		"insidious onset often shrouds the initial diagnosis, contributing to poor"
		outcomes. Candida infective endocarditis (CIE) is a feared complication of
		"candidemia, associated with high mortality rates. It requires prolonged hospital"
		"stays for medical and, often, surgical management. We report a case of a massive"
		intracardiac Candida mass in an adult with native valve CIE. CASE: A 51-year-old
		male on chronic total parenteral nutrition (TPN) because of bowel resection
		"presented with fevers, night sweats, and unintentional weight loss. He was"
		"febrile and tachycardiac on admission, with a benign physical examination."
		Laboratory workup showed elevated inflammatory markers and an acute kidney
		injury. Extended blood cultures showed growth of Candida glabrata (C. glabrata)
		and Candida dubliniensis (C. dubliniensis). Transthoracic (TTE) and
		transesophageal echocardiography revealed a large mobile right atrial mass
		"(4 cm × 6 cm × 2.5 cm), extending to the right ventricular outflow tract. Since"
		"he was a poor surgical candidate, management with micafungin was initiated and"
		continued for 8 weeks. He responded well to the regimen with resolution of the
		fungal mass on follow-up TTE 3 months later. In anticipation of the future need
		"for TPN, he continues on lifelong suppressive oral fluconazole. CONCLUSION: CIE"
		"may be an insidious complication of indwelling central venous catheters,"
		"necessitating a high index of suspicion. Conservative management, with antifungal"
		"therapy, can yield favorable outcomes in poor surgical candidates."

PG	-	631-6
AB	-	"OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to report the clinical aspects, the etiologies, the"
		treatment and the evolution of the psoas abscess in the adult. METHODS: Our
		retrospective study concerns 38 cases of psoas abscesses collected in the
		"Department of Infectious Diseases of Sfax (Tunisia), over a period of 16 years"
		(January 1990 - December 2005). RESULTS: The average age is 44 years (extremes:
		16-76 years). The sex-ratio is 1.4. Six patients were diabetics and one had a
		chronic renal injury at the stage of hemodialysis. The clinical manifestations
		"were: a fever (76.4%), an abdomino-pelvic ache (84.2%) and a psoitis (34.2%). All"
		patients had a biologic inflammatory syndrome with a hyperleucocytosis in 28
		cases. The abscess was one-sided in 29 cases and bilateral in 9 cases. After
		"microbiological study and/or histological study, pathogens were identified in 31"
		"patients, they were Staphylococcus aureus (10 cases), Staphylococcus lugdunensis"
		"(1 case), Streptococci (3 cases), Escherichia coli (2 cases), Bacteroides"
		"fragilis (1 case), Actinomyces (2 cases), Brucella (3 cases), Mycobacterium"
		tuberculosis (8 cases) and Candida glabrata (1 case). The psoas abscess was
		primary in 10 cases and secondary in 28 cases. All the patients received an
		"antibiotherapy or an antifungal therapy adapted to the micro-organism in cause,"
		with a drainage of the abscess in 25 cases (surgical in 9 cases and percutaneous
		in 16 cases). The evolution was favourable in 36 cases. One patient presented
		recurrences and one patient died. CONCLUSION: The psoas abscess of the adult is
		characterized by a polymorphe clinical presentation. Germs in cause are very
		variable.

		esophageotracheal fistula].
PG	-	18-24
AB	-	The results of the microbiological diagnosis of infective inflammatory
		complications in patients with iatrogenic esophageotracheal fistula and the
		tactics of their antibacterial prophylaxis and therapy within a 9-year
		observation period (2003-2011) were analysed. The main organisms colonizing the
		"tracheobronchial tree in the patients were S. epidermidis, S. aureus, enteric"
		"bacteria, P. aeruginosa and Candida. An increase of the S. epidermidis resistance"
		"to rifampicin, moxifloxacin and especially ciprofloxacin was observed. The"
		resistance of S. aureus did not significantly change. Within the observation
		"period, high susceptibility of all the Staphylococcus isolates to vancomycin and"
		"linezolid remained stable. Among the nonfermenting gramnegative bacteria, the P."
		aeruginosa isolates were the most frequent and characterized by a lower portion
		of the isolates with preserved susceptibility to the agents (except polymyxin B)
		"known earlier as antipyocyanic antibiotics, i.e. to imipenem and cefepim. Since"
		the proportion of P. aeruginosa in the etiology of pyoinflammatory processes in
		"the region of esophageotracheal fistula ranged within 9.3 to 17.5%, the fact"
		should be considered in the antibiotic therapy. There was observed an increase in
		the frequency of infectious complications due to other nonfermenting gramnegative
		bacteria (acinetobacters) and first of all A.baumannii. Various Candida isolates
		were characterized by dependence of the susceptibility on the selective pressure
		"of irrational therapy, as well as their species (the presence of such species as"
		"C. Krusei and C. glabrata with natural resistance), that required not only the"
		species identification but also determination of the Candida isolates resistance
		in every particular case.

TI	-	Role of environmental surfaces and hands of healthcare workers in perpetuating
		multi-drug-resistant pathogens in a neonatal intensive care unit.
PG	-	619-628
LID	-	10.1007/s00431-021-04241-6 [doi]
AB	-	Neonates admitted to neonatal intensive care units are at a risk of developing
		"healthcare-associated infections, leading to increased risk of mortality. This"
		study aimed to identify organisms causing such late-onset infections in neonates
		and determine whether these isolates were genetically identical to those from the
		surrounding environmental surfaces and hands of healthcare workers (HCWs). A
		cross-sectional study was carried out over a period of 4 months in a university
		neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Samples were collected from all neonates
		with symptoms of late-onset infections (n = 180). Fingerprint samples of 21
		healthcare workers as well as 330 random environmental samples were also taken
		"from the unit. Isolates from neonates, environment and fingerprints were"
		subjected to protein electrophoresis followed by sequencing to detect genetic
		"similarities. Almost half of neonatal samples were culture positive (91/180,"
		"50.6%), out of which 72% of bacterial isolates (49/68) were multi-drug resistant."
		Klebsiella pneumoniae (32.6%) and Candida spp. (28.4%) were the commonest
		neonatal isolates. A cluster of two homologous Klebsiella pneumoniae strains was
		"isolated from a neonate and an examining bed, while another homologous cluster"
		was from a neonatal sample and a portal incubator. A third cluster was isolated
		from hands and three neonatal samples. This cluster (caused by Klebsiella
		pneumoniae strain NH54 chromosome) was found to perpetuate over the 4 months of
		the study. All three clusters were multi-drug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. A
		homologous pair of each of Candida tropicalis and Candida glabrata was isolated
		"from the blood of two neonates, and one neonatal and a crash cart sample,"
		"respectively. Overall, 8.8% (8/91) of neonatal samples were found to be"
		"homologous to other neonatal/environmental/hand isolates, denoting perpetuation"
		of pathogens between neonates themselves and also other reservoirs of
		"infections.Conclusion: The hands of HCWs, crash carts and incubators are"
		reservoirs of pathogens and can lead to nosocomial infections. Clusters of
		multi-drug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and Candida spp. were the predominant
		neonatal pathogens in this NICU. What is Known: • The role of hands and the
		environment in transmission of infections to neonates is a subject of debate. •
		Genetic sequencing provides solid evidence for detecting homologous strains. What
		"is New: • K. pneumoniae was the most frequently isolated pathogen, and"
		concomitant isolation was found in two cases from the neonatal surroundings
		(bed/incubator) and hands. • Candida spp. with homology were also found in
		different neonates and environmental samples suggesting risk of transmission.

		"an alkaline guanidine-phenol-Tris reagent, amplification of a variable region of"
		"the 28S rRNA gene with universal primers, and amplicon identification by probe"
		hybridization or DNA sequencing performed under conditions identical for all
		fungi. The results obtained by testing a panel of fungal isolates and a variety

TI	-	Safety and efficacy of itraconazole in prevention of fungal infections in
		neutropenic patients.
PG	-	84-91
AB	-	In a non-randomized study the efficacy of itraconazole in preventing fungal
		infections in neutropenic patients was investigated. Forty-seven patients with
		acute leukemia or advanced lymphoblastic lymphoma were enrolled. Ninety-two
		episodes of severe neutropenia after chemotherapy were observed. Mean duration of
		neutropenia was 24 days. Norfloxacin was administered as prophylaxis against
		gram-negative infections and itraconazole 200 mg b.i.d. as antifungal
		"prophylaxis. Surveillance cultures of throat, urine, feces and vagina or prepuce"
		"were performed regularly. Four patients died, two patients due to heart failure,"
		two patients due to staphylococcal pneumonia. Only in one case Candida albicans
		was cultured from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. No systemic mycosis or
		Aspergillus fumigatus pneumonia was documented. In a similar group of patients
		treated in the preceding 18 months nystatin was used as antifungal prophylaxis.
		"In this group of patients six cases of Aspergillus fumigatus pneumonia, two cases"
		of Candida albicans fungemia and one case of Candida glabrata pneumonia occurred
		of which six patients died. Itraconazole seems to be effective in preventing
		fungal infections in neutropenic patients and is well tolerated.

		syndrome.
PG	-	1367-1378
LID	-	10.1111/odi.12896 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to investigate the pattern of oral yeast colonization
		"of Sjögren's syndrome patients and its correlation to salivary flow rates, age,"
		and time of the disease progression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Saliva and swab
		specimens were obtained from 45 patients (primary Sjögren's syndrome = 15/
		secondary Sjögren's syndrome = 15/ healthy controls = 15). Yeast species were
		identified using culture method through chromogenic medium followed by polymerase
		chain reaction and Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: Eleven species from six different
		genera were detected. The most prevalent species found was Candida albicans
		"followed by Candida tropicalis, Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis, and"
		Candida krusei. Both groups of Sjögren's syndrome showed higher counts of
		"C. albicans (Total and CFU counts) when compared to control group. In contrast, a"
		greater variety of yeast species was identified on samples of the control group.
		"CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that C. albicans is the most prevalent yeast, but"
		also that a variety of other yeast species can colonize the oral cavity of
		Sjogren's syndrome patients. The identification of most of the colonies was not
		obtained by culturing-PCR methods combined.

		"information, pathogen identification and antibiotic sensitivity results of 425"
		newborns with neonatal sepsis admitted to Nanjing Maternity and Child Health Care
		"Hospital from 2010 to 2017. Of the 425 positive blood-cultures, 148 (34.82%) were"

		"premature delivery (78.70%, n=218), low birth weights (67.15%, n=186) and"
		"cesarean delivery (59.57%, n=165) were significantly increased in LOS (P<0.05)"
		"compared with those rates in EOS, which were 41.89% (n=62), 37.84% (n=56) and"

		"(47.29%) respectively, and the rest was Candida glabrata (1.88%, n=8)."
		Escherichia coli 68 (16.00%) was the predominant isolate followed by Klebsiella

		positive isolates exhibited high resistance to penicillin (90.32%-100.00%) and
		"cephalosporin group antibiotics (25.00%-100.00%). Similarly, the majority of the"
		"gram negative isolates showed higher resistance to ampicillin (83.33%-100.00%),"
		"but susceptible to aminoglycosides (0-11.76%), quinolones (0-17.65%) and"

		"preterm, low birth weight and cesarean section were higher in LOS while"
		parturients fever and meconium-like amniotic fluid were higher in EOS. The
		pathogens with the highest detection rate were Escherichia coli and Klebsiella
		pneumoniae. The results of antibiotic susceptibility test showed that common
		pathogens had high resistance to commonly used antibacterial drugs.

PG	-	21S-24S
AB	-	Torulopsis glabrata is a yeast of low virulence and commensal within the female
		genitourinary tract. The first case of congenital infection with Torulopsis
		glabrata was reported in 1980. An additional example of perinatal Torulopsis
		infection which is associated with maternal sickle cell anemia is reported. The
		most common source of congenital fungus infection is Candida albicans.
		"Differences in morphology between T glabrata and C albicans are apparent,"
		particularly the pathologic response within the placenta. Pathogenicity in this
		case may be associated with increased susceptibility to infection in patients
		with sickle cell anemia.

PG	-	880-3
AB	-	"OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical characteristics, therapeutic measures and risk"
		factors of pulmonary fungal infection in patients after renal transplantation.
		METHODS: The clinical data of 176 patients receiving renal allograft
		transplantation with postoperative infections were retrospectively analyzed.
		"Among the patients, 40 were diagnosed to have pulmonary fungal infection, and"
		"their clinical symptoms, signs, radiographic findings, pathogenic bacterial"
		"culture, histopathological examination, and treatments were analyzed. RESULTS:"
		The 40 recipients with postoperative pulmonary fungal infection included 25 male
		and 15 female patients with a mean age of 49 years. Twenty-eight of the patients
		developed pulmonary fungal infection within 6 months after transplantation.
		"Positive pathogen cultivation was reported in 19 cases, and Candida albicans was"
		"detected in 11 cases, Candida krusei in 2 cases, Candida glabrata in 3 cases,"
		"Candida tropicalis in 1 case, aspergillosis in 1 case, and Candida mycoderma in 1"
		case. Twenty-four of out of the 40 cases were found to have co-infection. All the
		"patients received antifungal drugs and adjuvant treatments, and 38 patients were"
		cured and 2 died. CONCLUSION: Pulmonary fungal infection often occurs within 6
		months after renal transplantation. The most common fungal pathogen is Candida
		"albicans, and the patients often had coinfections. Early diagnosis and timely"
		intervention with antifungal drugs and comprehensive measures are critical in the
		management of pulmonary fungal infection following renal transplantation.

PG	-	80-84
LID	-	10.1159/000511553 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: C. nivariensis is a rare Candida species which is phenotypically
		closely related to Candida glabrata and Candida bracarensis. The 3 species form
		"the C. glabrata sensu lato complex. Here, we describe the first isolation and"
		characterization of a C. nivariensis isolate cultured from the tracheal aspirate
		obtained from a young man in Kuwait. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The yeast isolate was
		initially tested by VITEK 2 followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption
		ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and multiplex PCR. The
		identification was confirmed by sequencing of internal transcribed spacer (ITS)
		"region of rDNA. Antifungal susceptibility testing was performed by Etest, and"
		phylogenetic comparison with other international strains was carried out by using
		MEGA version 7 software. RESULTS: The C. nivariensis isolate was misidentified by
		"VITEK 2, but correctly identified by MALDI-TOF MS with updated software and"
		multiplex PCR. The identity was confirmed by sequence comparisons of ITS region
		of rDNA. Antifungal susceptibility testing revealed high minimum inhibitory
		"concentration (MIC) against fluconazole, but low MICs against amphotericin B and"
		"echinocandins. Phylogenetically, our isolate was closely related to Indian"
		isolates. CONCLUSIONS: This report extends the geographic distribution of C.
		nivariensis to the Arabian Peninsula. MALDI-TOF MS with updated software and
		molecular tests are needed to correctly identify C. nivariensis. Since C.
		"nivariensis may exhibit reduced susceptibility to antifungal agents, accurate"
		"identification and antifungal susceptibility testing are essential, particularly"
		"for isolates from sterile sites, for optimal patient management."

		Endophthalmitis.
PG	-	485-491
LID	-	10.1159/000511594 [doi]
AB	-	We report a case of Candida glabrata endophthalmitis which was effectively
		treated by intravitreal liposomal amphotericin B (L-AMB) injection. A 72-year-old
		man was referred to our department for positive blood culture of Candida
		glabrata. First ophthalmologic examination revealed a chorioretinal lesion in
		"left eye, and the patient was diagnosed as possible candida chorioretinitis."
		"Despite systemic antifungal therapy, his chorioretinal lesion increased in both"
		eyes and complicated by vitritis. Intravitreal administration of L-AMB was
		"introduced for probable candida endophthalmitis. Finally, improvement of vitritis"
		and regression of chorioretinal lesions were obtained by total of 9 times
		intravitreal injection. Our case suggests the safety and efficacy of intravitreal
		L-AMB injection for Candida glabrata endophthalmitis.

		Diagnosis requires mycological culture of a puncture or biopsy specimen.
		Therapeutic management is based on prolonged course of azole or liposomal
		amphotericin B. We reported the case of Candida glabrata brain abscess in a 27
		"year-old female patient, with no past history and not secondary to candidemia."
		The fungus was isolated from a puncture of abscess with complete resection. The
		outcome was favorable under antifungal treatment by voriconazole.

AB	-	Necrotizing urethritis is a rare malady with only one other case reported in the
		literature found to be due to an infectious cause. We report a case of
		necrotizing urethritis caused by Candida glabrata and review all relevant
		literature to date. The patient is a 56-year-old man with a past medical history
		significant for poorly controlled insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus and
		incomplete bladder emptying who presented to the University Medical Center with
		"perineal pain, fever, and urinary retention. Cross-sectional imaging showed"
		"emphysematous changes in the bulb of the corpus spongiosum. After admission, his"
		"fever and leukocytosis persisted, and his physical exam worsened with intravenous"
		"antibiotics alone. Subsequently, the patient underwent cystourethroscopy with"
		"incision and debridement of the corpus spongiosum. Postoperatively, he improved"
		clinically and his spongiosum wound and urine grew Candida glabrata. To our
		"knowledge, we report the first case of necrotizing urethritis caused by Candida"
		glabrata.

		Report.
PG	-	e1371
LID	-	10.7759/cureus.1371 [doi]
LID	-	e1371
AB	-	"Candida glabrata is a low virulent commensal fungal organism that, rarely, can"
		cause osteomyelitis. Diagnosis of such an infection is often difficult as the
		case typically presents with an insidious onset of back pain and minimally
		"elevated biomarkers of inflammation. Furthermore, it is difficult to eradicate"
		and often resistant to common antifungals.  A 61-year-old man presented with an
		eight-month history of persistent low back pain which had unsuccessfully been
		managed by his primary care physician. He had a past surgical history of gastric
		"by-pass complicated by adhesions, ulceration, and perforation with an infection"
		of Candida glabrata that had been treated with intravenous micafungin.
		Radiological examination showed degenerative changes with suspicion of
		osteomyelitis and a computerized tomography (CT)-guided biopsy provided tissue
		samples with subsequent positive cultures for Candida glabrata. The patient was
		"admitted for fungal osteomyelitis with Candida glabrata, treated with intravenous"
		"micafungin, and his infection was resolved after six months. At two-year"
		follow-up his back pain has been resolved and no infection was present. In a
		patient with osteoarticular pain and a previous history of candidal infection
		"with possible candidemia, one should maintain suspicion for fungal osteomyelitis."

PG	-	387-93
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-011-9398-6 [doi]
AB	-	This epidemiological survey was a retrospective study on three nodes during the
		"past three decades on fungal infections representing the China, including Taiwan."
		Owing to rare publications reporting on dynamic epidemiological trends in the
		"pathogen epidemiology in China, we surveyed the isolation rates and pathogenic"
		fungi from 8 representative districts in China using uniform identification with
		uniform methodology. The pathogenic fungi isolation rates and species obtained
		"from 1986 (n=9,096), 1996 (n=19,009), and 2006 (n=33,022) suggested that"
		Trichophyton rubrum was the commonest organism cultured in 1980s (45.4%) and
		"1990s (34.5%), but Candida albicans increased significantly and reaching to its"
		"peak (26.9%) in 2006s' survey, and has become the most common isolate of fungal"
		"infections in China currently. In addition, Candida glabrata became the most"
		"common non-albicans species of Candida in 2006s' survey. At the same time, the"
		incidence of molds also gradually increased. According to comparative analysis of
		"the results of these three surveys, we found apparent differences in the"
		isolation rates of different pathogenic fungi and the forefront 10 species in
		"China varied significantly, and the dermatophytes decreased markedly, while"
		"yeasts, especially the Candida species and the molds, increased gradually during"
		the past three decades. Less dermatophytic infections may suggest better access
		to healthcare or increase in Candida species indicated higher incidence of
		hospital acquired infections.

TI	-	Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis: Yeast Species Isolated from Stool Samples of Children
		with Suspected or Diagnosed Autism Spectrum Disorders and In Vitro Susceptibility
		Against Nystatin and Fluconazole.
PG	-	7-Jan
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-015-9949-3 [doi]
AB	-	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a general term for a group of complex
		neurodevelopmental disorders of brain development that limits a person's ability
		"to function normally. Etiology has not been clearly defined up to date. However,"
		gut microbiota and the bidirectional communication between the gastrointestinal
		"tract and brain, the so-called microbiota-gut-brain axis, are hypothesized, which"
		may be involved in the etiology of several mental disorders. Recent reports
		"suggest that Candida, particularly Candida albicans, growth in intestines may"
		cause lower absorption of carbohydrates and minerals and higher toxin levels
		which are thought to contribute autistic behaviors. The aim of this study was to
		identify the 3-year deposited yeasts isolated from stool samples of children with
		diagnosed or suspected ASD and to determine in vitro activity of nystatin and
		fluconazole against these isolates using Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute
		M27-A3 guidelines. A 17-year retrospective assessment was also done using our
		"laboratory records. Among the species identified, intrinsically"
		fluconazole-resistant Candida krusei (19.8 %) and Candida glabrata (14.8 %) with
		"elevated MICs were remarkable. Overall, C. albicans (57.4 %) was the most"
		commonly isolated species in 17 years. The species identification and/or
		antifungal susceptibility tests have to be performed using the strain isolated
		"from stool sample, to select the appropriate antifungal agent, if antimycotic"
		therapy is needed.

PG	-	79-84
AB	-	"Otomycosis, which is otitis externa caused by fungi, is common throughout the"
		"world especially in tropical and subtropical countries. However, the"
		epidemiologic data about the etiologic agents of otomycosis in Turkey is limited.
		The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the agents of otomycosis in
		patients living at Manisa region (located at western Anatolia of Turkey). A total
		"of 2279 cases [1465 male, 813 female; age range 1-87 (mean: 41.7) years] who were"
		"clinically prediagnosed as otomycosis at Celal Bayar University Hospital, between"
		"February 1995 and July 2011, were included in the study. External ear swab"
		samples from patients with suspicion of otomycosis have been evaluated by routine
		mycological methods. Identification of mold-like fungi was based on colony
		"morphology and microscopic examination of fungal structure, whereas germ tube"
		"test, growth characteristics on cornmeal-Tween 80 agar and API 20C AUX"
		"(bio-Mérieux, France) system were used for the identification of yeast-like"
		"fungi. Of the samples, 28% (638/2279) were found positive by direct microscopy"
		and 24% (544/2279) by culture methods. Among culture-positive cases the isolation
		"rates of mold-like and yeast-like fungi were 66% (359/544) and 34% (185/544),"
		respectively. The number of distribution of the molds were as follows;
		"Aspergillus niger (180), Aspergillus fumigatus (95), Aspergillus terreus (32),"
		"Aspergillus flavus (23), Aspergillus spp. (14), Penicillium spp. (13),"
		"Trichophyton spp. (T.rubrum 1, T.mentagrophytes 1); while this distribution was"
		"as follows for the yeasts; Candida tropicalis (97), Candida albicans (39),"
		"Candida parapsilosis (21), Candida glabrata (19), Candida kefyr (4),"
		"C.guilliermondii (2), Candida krusei (1), Geotrichum candidum (1) and"
		Trichosporon capitatum (1). It was notable that 96% (344/359) of mold-like fungi
		"were Aspergillus spp., and 99% (183/185) of yeast-like fungi were Candida spp."
		The results of this study indicated that the most frequent agents of otomycosis
		"were non-dermatophyte species such as Aspergillus, followed by Candida."
		Dermatophytes were isolated in a small number of otomycosis cases. These data
		will provide support to the establishment of antifungal therapy guidelines for
		otomycosis.

AB	-	"Objective: To retrospectively analyze the diagnosis time, pathogen distribution,"
		and drug resistance of fungal bloodstream infection in severe burn patients.
		Methods: Blood samples were collected from 55 severe burn patients with fungal
		"bloodstream infection (including 46 males and 9 females, aged 42 (1, 78) years)"
		admitted to the intensive care unit of the Institute of Burn Research of the
		First Affiliated Hospital of Army Medical University (the Third Military Medical
		University) from July 2011 to May 2019 for retrospective analysis. Microbial
		"monitoring system was used to cultivate pathogens, API yeast identification kit"
		"and Candida chromogenic medium were used to identify pathogens, and Kirby-Bauer"
		paper disk diffusion method was used to detect drug resistance of fungi to
		"fluconazole, amphotericin B, itraconazole, ketoconazole, and voriconazole. The"
		"positive rate of blood fungal culture, mortality rate, distribution of local"
		"fungal proliferation sites, the diagnosis time distribution of fungal bloodstream"
		"infection, the distribution of fungal species, resistance to commonly-used"
		"antifungal drugs, and the use of antibiotics were assessed. The WHONET 5.6"
		software was applied to analyze the distribution and drug resistance of fungi.
		"Results: (1) Totally 4 839 blood samples were collected during the 9 years, and"
		"122 strains of fungi were isolated, with positive rate of 2.52%. The mortality"
		rate was 14.55% (8 patients) in 55 patients. Catheter fungal proliferation ranked
		the first among 30 cases of local fungal proliferation. (2) The diagnosis time of
		fungal bloodstream infection mainly distributed in ≤1 week of hospitalization
		"[32.73% (18/55)]. (3) Among the 55 strains of fungi detected, the detection rate"
		"of Candida parapsilosis ranked the first (21.82%, 12 strains), Candida glabrata"
		"was the second (18.18%, 10 strains), and Candida tropicalis was tied with Candida"
		"albicans in the third place (14.55%, 8 strains). All the detected fungi were"
		"sensitive to amphotericin B, and the resistance rates to voriconazole,"
		"fluconazole, itraconazole, and ketoconazole were between 4.5% and 9.1%. (4)"
		"Droad-spectrum antibiotics were used in all the 55 patients, ≥3 kinds of"
		"antibiotics were used in 44 patients, and 37 patients used antibacterial drugs ≥7"
		days. Conclusions: The diagnosis time of fungal bloodstream infection in the 55
		severe burn patients was mainly within 1 week of hospitalization. Candida
		parapsilosis is the most commonly detected fungal species. Catheter fungal
		proliferation occurs most commonly among the 30 patients with local fungal
		"proliferation. All the detected fungi were sensitive to amphotericin B, with low"
		"drug resistance to voriconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, and ketoconazole."
		Broad-spectrum antibiotics were overused in the severe burn patients with fungal
		bloodstream infection.

TI	-	Yeast mediates lactic acidosis suppression after antibiotic cocktail treatment in
		short small bowel?
PG	-	1246-50
AB	-	"During acidotic periods in a girl with a short small bowel, very high D-lactic"
		acid concentrations were measured in blood and urine; the patient's
		"characteristic faecal flora contained mainly lactobacilli, and during antibiotic"
		cocktail treatment also many yeasts. In this case report we sought to understand
		the beneficial effect of the antibiotic cocktail. Microbiological analysis was
		performed in faecal samples. Total lactic acid in serum and urine was studied
		"using capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and D- and L-lactic acid in"
		serum and urine by enzymatic assay. The results were coupled to patient's
		"condition. Antibiotic cocktail therapy reduced the acidosis-associated symptoms,"
		"faecal lactobacilli and D-lactic acid production, but simultaneously the"
		antibiotic therapy strongly increased the percentage of yeast in the faecal
		flora. Four to six weeks after each course of treatment the percentage of yeast
		"decreased, whereas the percentage of intestinal lactobacilli increased; D-lactic"
		acid also simultaneously increased in blood and urine. The patient felt well and
		"showed a high percentage of intestinal yeast, but she often suffered from"
		acidosis owing to a high percentage of lactobacilli. The yeast was identified as
		the pathogenic Candida glabrata. From the mentioned data together with data from
		the literature it was concluded that during several weeks the selected pathogenic
		"yeast, C. glabrata, acted as a microbiological and metabolic buffer. Shortly"
		after the course of antibiotic treatment this intestinal yeast strongly competed
		"with the intestinal lactobacilli and thus prevented renewed rapid growth, massive"
		D-lactic acid production from glucose and consequently also D-lactic
		acid-associated acidosis. The emergence of this yeast led us to consider
		probiotic lactobacilli or yeast for therapeutic use. The lack of knowledge
		regarding bile acid-deconjugating activity in both lactobacilli and probiotic
		yeast means that a final recommendation is not yet possible.

TI	-	Candida glabrata infection of a pancreatic pseudocyst in a COVID-19 patient: A
		case report and review of the literature.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Pancreatic pseudocysts remain a feared complication of acute or
		chronic pancreatitis and are often characterized by collections of fluids due to
		"underlying damage to the pancreatic ducts, culminating in a walled-off region"
		bereft of an epithelial layer but surrounded by granulation tissue. While fungal
		"infections of pancreatic pseudocysts are rarely encountered, candida albicans"
		remains the most frequently implicated organism. CASE PRESENTATION: A 55-year-old
		"male presented with pain in the left-hypochondriac region, accompanied by"
		"non-bilious emesis and nausea. Interestingly, the patient also tested positive"
		for a COVID-19 infection. Investigative workup divulged enhancing pancreatic
		walls with a radiologic impression consistent with a pancreatic pseudocyst. An
		ultrasound-guided external drainage was performed; the drainage was conducted
		"unremarkably, with the resultant fluid collection revealing the presence of"
		Candida Glabrata. The patient was commenced on antifungal therapy and continues
		to do well to date. DISCUSSION: Infectious ailments of pancreatic pseudocysts
		"remain a widely known complication of acute pancreatitis. While it is rare,"
		fungal infection is a crucial consideration for patients with pancreatic
		"pseudocysts, especially in the context of a lack of an adequate response to"
		"antibiotics, deterioration, comorbidities, and immunocompromised states."
		CONCLUSION: Rapid identification of the microbe responsible for pancreatic
		pseudocyst infection is vital for time-sensitive treatment and a more rapid
		"recovery, curbing associated morbidity and mortality."

AB	-	The incidence of candidemia has been reported to be high in some cardiovascular
		surgery units. Congenital heart disease has been considered a risk factor for
		acquisition of candidemia. This present case is a postoperative Candida glabrata
		"in a child with congenital heart disease. A 3-year-old child, a previously"
		"diagnosed case of situs-solitus D loop situs with double outlet right ventricle,"
		"ventricular septal defect, pulmonary stenosis and large ostium secundum atrial"
		"septal defect, was admitted with history of effort intolerance. A left modified"
		Blalock-Taussig shunt was performed and then the child underwent closure of the
		ventricular septal defect and the atrial septal defect. On the third day the
		patient developed fever. Klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated from blood which
		"responded to piperacillin + tazobactam but on the twelfth day, the patient again"
		developed fever spikes. The blood cultures performed at this time showed repeated
		isolation of Candida glabrata. Amphotericin B was started but still the patient
		deteriorated and died on the 22(nd) day after operation. The antifungal
		susceptibility of the isolate performed showed that the isolate was resistant to
		Amphotericin B.

LID	-	923
AB	-	The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with a significant increase in the incidence
		"of invasive mycosis, including pulmonary aspergillosis, mucormycosis, and"
		candidiasis. Fungal empyema thoracis (FET) is an uncommon clinical presentation
		"of invasive fungal disease (IFD) associated with significant mortality. Here, we"
		describe the first report of a patient with post-COVID-19 multifocal necrotizing
		pneumonia complicated by a polymicrobial empyema that included Candida glabrata.
		Candida empyemas represent another manifestation of a COVID-19-associated fungal
		"opportunistic infection, and this infrequently encountered entity requires a high"
		degree of clinical suspicion for timely identification and management. Therapy
		for empyemas and other non-bloodstream Candida infections may differ from
		candidemia due to several pharmacokinetic parameters impacting bioavailability of
		"the antifungal in the affected tissue (e.g., pleural space) and is an area that"
		needs more investigation.

		"alcohol intake, trauma, diabetes and surgery. Clinical presentation will"
		"typically include severe abdominal pain, abdominal distension and shock. Here we"
		present the only reported case to our knowledge of Emphysematous gastritis with

LID	-	898245
AB	-	Fungal infections after kidney transplantation are a major cause of morbidity and
		"mortality, and Candida infection of the pancreas is considered an infrequent but"
		important agent in necrotizing pancreatitis. We report the case of a 43-year-old
		Caucasian patient who underwent simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation
		"because of diabetes type I, and chronic renal failure with peritoneal dialysis."
		The postoperative course was complicated by acute pancreatitis due to the
		"thrombosis of the splenic artery of the graft, the subsequent acute rupture of"
		"the external iliac artery caused by fungal arteritis (Candida glabrata), and"
		peritonitis a few days later caused by sigmoid perforation with detection of
		Candida glabrata infection of the resected intestinal tract. The present case
		remarks that awareness and prevention of fungal infection are major issues in the
		transplant field. Important information can be added by systematic culture of
		"conservation perfusates but, probably, the best way for early recognition of a"
		critical level of infectious risk remains the routine application of the
		"colonization index screening. In cases of positive results, preemptive antifungal"
		therapy could be warranted.

		"associated with pancreatic infections are Escherichia coli, Klebsiella"
		"pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., and Enterococcus spp. We report a case of a"
		45-year-old gentleman with recent acute pancreatitis who presented with
		"hypoglycemia, altered mental status, worsening epigastric pain, and early"
		satiety. He was diagnosed with a large peripancreatic infected cyst which grew
		"multidrug-resistant (MDR) Burkholderia cepacia, Candida glabrata, and Candida"
		dubliniensis. This case report focuses on the importance of distinguishing and

AB	-	"PURPOSE: To describe the clinical presentation, management, and visual outcomes"
		of 6 eyes with endophthalmitis after Descemet stripping endothelial keratoplasty
		"(DSEK). DESIGN: Retrospective case series. METHODS: Setting: Tertiary, academic"
		eye center. StudyPopulation: Individuals developing endophthalmitis after DSEK at
		"the Duke Eye Center from January 1, 2009, to January 1, 2018, with at least"
		6 months of follow-up. ObservationProcedure: Retrospective chart review.
		"OutcomeMeasures: Diagnostic procedures, microbiological yield, and visual"
		outcomes. RESULTS: Six eyes of 6 patients were identified. Mean time from surgery
		"to presentation was 51 days (range, 4-137 days). Dense vitreous opacities were"
		present in all cases. Five of 6 cases (83%) had culture-proven infectious
		"endophthalmitis (2 Candida glabrata, 2 coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, 1"
		Streptococcus pneumoniae). Aqueous tap yielded positive culture in 2 of 2 cases
		with adequate sample (100%); needle vitreous tap yielded positive culture in 0 of
		"3 cases. One eye underwent vitrectomy on presentation, and 3 eyes (50%) underwent"
		subsequent vitrectomy for persistent endophthalmitis after a mean of 37 days.
		Mean pre-endophthalmitis visual acuity (VA) was 20/64; mean VA at 6 months was
		20/2069 (average 15 ETDRS lines lost). VA at 6 months was light perception or no
		light perception in 3 of 6 cases (50%). One eye underwent enucleation at
		"6 months, and 1 eye became phthisical 1 year after endophthalmitis. CONCLUSIONS:"
		"DSEK-related endophthalmitis may lead to severe vision loss, even with prompt and"
		appropriate treatment. Aqueous tap had a higher culture yield than needle
		vitreous tap in our series.

PG	-	3151-3

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Bacteremia is among the known complications in simultaneous
		pancreas-kidney transplantation (SPKT). This study evaluated the frequency of
		microbial isolates and their susceptibility profiles among cultures of clinical
		samples obtained from blood and from the tips of blood vessel catheters of 26
		SPKT recipients suspected of bacteremia in the early posttransplant period.
		PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data on microbiologic blood cultures of 26 adult patients
		undergoing SPKT were collected prospectively from 2001 to the end of 2006. The
		isolation and identification of cultured microorganisms were performed according
		to standard microbiological procedures and commercially available tests. The
		susceptibility of the strains to antibacterial agents was established by the
		Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. RESULTS: All patients
		were followed prospectively for the first 4 weeks after surgery. Among 66
		"clinical samples, there were 23 microbial isolates from blood samples of 17"
		recipients and catheter tips of 12 recipients. The most common isolates were
		Gram-positive bacteria (73.9%) with domination of staphylococci (64.7%) and MRCNS
		"strains (81.8%). Gram-negative bacteria comprised 17.4% of positive cultures,"
		"whereas yeast-like fungi, 8.7% with a predominance of Candida glabrata."
		CONCLUSION: Our study showed predominately Gram-positive bacteria in 73.9% of
		isolates. The increased proportion of multi-drug-resistant bacteria and fungi to
		antimicrobial agents may be due to the frequent use of these agents for
		prophylaxis of bacterial infections in patients.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Persistent Candida from fungal cultures of respiratory secretions are
		often ignored and not treated due to assumptions concerning benign colonization.
		OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical course of patients with chronic sputum and
		"fungi on culture, including response to antifungal treatment. METHODS: All"
		patients seen at a single long term acute care hospital (LTAC) between May 2009
		and September 2010 with at least two months of daily sputum and fungus on more
		"than one sputum culture were identified. LTAC, inpatient, and outpatient records"
		through June 2011 were reviewed to assess clinical features and response to
		"therapy or to cessation of therapy. RESULTS: Eleven patients were identified,"
		"having sputum duration of 5 months to 28 years, and respiratory cultures growing"
		"Candida species. Fungi included C albicans (8 patients), C glabrata (2), C krusei"
		"(2), C tropicalis (1), C parapsilosis (1), Aspergillus fumigatus (1), Aspergillus"
		"terreus (1), and Scedosporium (1), the latter 3 in conjunction with Candida"
		"species. All had abnormal chest CT scans, often with bronchiectasis and sometimes"
		"atelectasis or consolidation, and ten of 11 patients were on chronic steroids"
		"(inhaled and/or systemic). Antifungal therapy, mostly oral voriconazole and"
		"nebulized amphotericin, led to improved respiratory symptoms and sputum within 3"
		weeks in 10 of 10 treated patients. Lack of antifungal therapy or early cessation
		of treatment was associated with progressive or recurrent symptoms and death of
		one patient. CONCLUSIONS: This case series suggests that chronic candidal
		bronchitis is associated with significant morbidity and responds well to
		treatment. Such patients may benefit from extended antifungal therapy. Guidelines
		for the treatment of Candida in pulmonary secretions should be reevaluated.

AB	-	Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is an inborn error of immunity caused by
		inactivating genetic mutations in any one of the components of the phagocyte
		nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase complex. Phagocytic
		cell reactive oxygen species generation is impaired in the absence of a
		"functional NADPH oxidase complex. As a result, patients with CGD are at high risk"
		of developing deep-seated infections with certain bacteria and fungi.
		"Additionally, aberrant inflammation and granuloma formation may occur in multiple"
		"organs including the bowels, with inflammatory bowel disease seen as a common"
		"inflammatory complication of CGD. Traditionally, TNF-α inhibitors are considered"
		effective biological therapies for moderate-to-severe inflammatory bowel disease.
		While limited case series and reports of patients with CGD have shown improvement
		"in fistula healing with use of TNF-α inhibitors, several patients have developed"
		"severe, even fatal, infections with CGD-related pathogens while on TNF-inhibitor"
		"therapy. In this case report, we describe an adolescent male with X-linked CGD"
		"and steroid-refractory colitis with perirectal fistula and abscesses, who was"
		"initiated on treatment with infliximab, a TNF-α inhibitor. Following his first"
		"two infliximab doses, the patient developed a Candida glabrata lymphadenitis and"
		"associated ulcerating oropharyngeal lesions, requiring hospitalization and"
		therapy with amphotericin B for resolution. We compare our patient's case to
		prior reports of infliximab use in CGD-related inflammatory bowel disease.

AB	-	Bezoars are accumulations of human or plant fiber located in the gastrointestinal
		"tract of both humans and animals. Patients remain asymptomatic for several years,"
		and the symptoms develop as these accumulations increase in size to the point of
		obstruction or perforation. We report the case of a 21-year-old patient at 10 d
		"postpartum, who presented with acute abdomen associated with sepsis. Given the"
		"urgency of the clinical picture, at no point was the presence of a giant bezoar"
		"at gastric level suspected, specifically a trichobezoar. The emergency abdominal"
		and pelvic ultrasound revealed only unspecific signs of perforated hollow viscus.
		Diagnosis was therefore made intraoperatively. A complete gastric trichobezoar
		was found with gastric perforation and secondary peritonitis. The peritoneal
		fluid culture revealed Candida glabrata.

		fungal mycetomas and received systemic treatment initially with micafungin and
		then fluconazole after urine cultures returned with the growth of Candida
		glabrata. Therapy was expanded to systemic AmBd when the fungal balls persisted.
		"The patient subsequently developed hepatic re-injury with 1 dose of AmBd, and the"
		therapy was discontinued. Caution should be exerted when utilizing AmBd in
		treating patients with previous hepatic injury.

AB	-	Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive bacteria and etiological agent of
		listeriosis. It has the ability to colonize the intestinal lumen and cross the
		"intestinal, blood-brain, and placental barriers, leading to invasive listeriosis"
		responsible for septicemia and meningitis in subjects at risk such as patients
		"with diabetes mellitus, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals and, for"
		maternal-neonatal infection in pregnant women. We report a rare case of L.
		monocytogenes septicemia and meningitis complicated by Candida glabrata fungemia
		"on a patient with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism,"
		"hypertension, chronic kidney failure, chronic ischemic vascular encephalopathy,"
		and atrial fibrillation. Although adequate therapy was rapidly started with an
		"initial partial clinical improvement, the patient suddenly experienced clinical"
		worsening concomitantly with Candida septicemia resulting in a fatal outcome. To
		"our knowledge, this is the first described case of an invasive L. monocytogenes"
		infection complicated by Candida sepsis. We hypothesize that concomitant Candida
		infection may play a significant role in the pathogenesis and virulence of L.
		monocytogenes.

PG	-	764-7

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of Candida spp.
		and presence of oral lesions in Brazilian leprosy patients under multidrug
		"therapy (MDT). METHODS: Thirty-eight individuals (18 males and 20 females, median"
		age 53 years) clinically and microbiologically diagnosed as leprosy (lepromatous
		"variant), and under MDT for at least 45 days were studied. The control group"
		"constituted by 38 healthy individuals (median age 53.5), matched to the test"
		"group in relation to age, gender and oral conditions. Oral rinses were collected"
		and the Candida identification was performed by phenotypic tests. The existence
		of Candida dubliniensis among the isolates was analyzed using a validated
		multiplex PCR assay. Twenty-nine leprosy patients were examined intra-orally for
		the presence of lesions. Data were analyzed by z- and Mann-Whitney tests (alpha =
		5%). RESULTS: Yeast carriage rate between leprosy patients (65.8%) and controls
		"(47.4%) was similar (P = 0.099), and no significant difference between yeast"
		counts was observed (P = 0.1004). Candida albicans was the most frequently
		"isolated species in both groups. In the leprosy group, Candida tropicalis and"
		"Candida parapsilosis were also identified. In the control group, we additionally"
		"identified Candida tropicalis, Candida glabrata and Candida kefyr. Candida"
		dubliniensis was not detected. No leprosy-related oral lesion was registered.
		"CONCLUSION: Within the limits of the study, we concluded that Brazilian leprosy"
		patients under MDT showed similar levels of carriage and Candida species
		distribution in relation to the controls.

TI	-	Limitations of caspofungin in the treatment of obstructive pyonephrosis due to
		Candida glabrata infection.
PG	-	126
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Caspofungin is a new antifungal agent with high-level activity
		against a number of Candida species including those that are resistant to azoles.
		Its good safety profile and low nephrotoxicity makes it an attractive drug to
		"treat fungal infections in patients with compromised renal function. However,"
		little is known about the clinical efficacy in the treatment of complicated
		urinary tract infections due to Candida species such as pyonephrosis. CASE
		PRESENTATION: We report a case of obstructive pyonephrosis due to an azole
		(fluconazole and itraconazole) resistant Candida glabrata strain that failed to
		respond to intravenous treatment with caspofungin. A sustained clinical and
		microbiological response was only achieved after percutaneous drainage and
		instillation of amphotericin B deoxycholate into the renal pelvis in combination
		with intravenous liposomal amphotericin B. CONCLUSION: This case demonstrates the
		limitation of intravenous antifungal agents such as caspofungin as the sole
		treatment of an obstructive upper urinary tract infection due to Candida species.
		"In order to achieve long term sustained cure from an obstructive pyonephrosis,"
		pus and fungal balls should be drained and an anti-fungal agent such as
		amphotericin B deoxycholate instilled locally. The pharmacokinetics and role of
		caspofungin in the treatment of complicated Candida urinary tract infection is
		reviewed.

AB	-	Spontaneous fungal peritonitis (SFP) is an infrequent but severe complication
		most commonly described in patients with liver cirrhosis. We present the first
		case of culture-proven SFP occurring in cardiogenic ascites. The diagnosis of SFP
		was clinically challenging as the initial ascites was consistent with the more
		common diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient did not
		"respond to antibacterial therapy, however, and the final diagnosis was only made"
		with positive ascitic cultures that grew Candida glabrata. SFP should be
		considered in patients with either cardiac or cirrhotic ascites and have a
		delayed or lack of response to traditional SBP treatment.

AB	-	PURPOSE: To report the first case of Candida donor to host transmission following
		descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK). METHODS: A retrospective case
		report. RESULTS: A patient underwent uneventful DMEK. Following surgery the donor
		rim was culture positive for Candida. The patient developed fungal
		endophthalmitis that was treated medically with multiple injections of
		voriconazole and amphotericin. Medical treatment was unable to clear the
		infection and removal of the donor material was required. Following removal the
		infection subsided. CONCLUSION: Candida interface keratitis and endophthalmitis
		can occur following DMEK and may be difficult to treat medically. Early removal
		of the donor material should be considered.

		"Candida Tropicalis, Candida Glabrata, and Staphylococcus lugdenensis leading to a"
		diagnosis of spontaneous esophageal rupture. We concluded that pleural effusion
		with fungal and multi-organism growth should immediately raise suspicion for
		underlying missed esophageal perforation. Prompt diagnosis of esophageal
		"perforation can prevent fatal complications like pleuritis, pneumothorax,"
		"hydrothorax, pneumomediastinum, mediastinitis, acute respiratory distress"
		"syndrome, and septic shock."

TI	-	Spontaneous Fungal Peritonitis as a Rare Complication of Ascites Secondary to
		Cardiac Cirrhosis: A Case Report.
PG	-	1526-1529
LID	-	10.12659/AJCR.917757 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND Spontaneous fungal peritonitis (SFP) is a life-threatening infection
		which occurs more commonly in patients with liver failure. SFP is not as common
		as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and has higher mortality rates due to
		late recognition and difficulty in differentiation between SFP and SBP.
		Spontaneous fungal peritonitis is extremely uncommon in patients with cardiac
		"ascites due to a high protein content, which predisposes to a low risk of"
		infections. CASE REPORT This report presents a rare case of spontaneous fungal
		"peritonitis in a patient with cardiogenic ascites. To the best of our knowledge,"
		this is the second known case of SFP occurring in a patient with cardiac
		cirrhosis. The patient did not respond to initiation of SBP treatment and after
		"ascitic fluid grew Candida glabrata, the diagnosis of SFP was made. The patient's"
		clinical status improved after initiation of intravenous caspofungin. CONCLUSIONS
		SFP should be a differential diagnosis in patients who have cardiac or liver
		"cirrhosis, who are not improving with empirical antibiotic therapy for"
		spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

LID	-	e32137
AB	-	Candida nivariensis is a rarely isolated yeast that is now considered a species
		within the Candida glabrata complex. Anti-fungal susceptibilities and treatments
		"of Candida nivariensis are often assessed on a case-by-case basis. In this case,"
		a 70-year-old male with a complex medical history presented to a large academic
		"medical center in the United States for vascular surgery. After surgery, the"
		patient's white blood cell count increased prompting an infectious workup. The
		patient was found to have a Candida nivariensis bloodstream infection of unknown
		"origin. Given the patient's clinical stability and QTc prolongation, he was"
		treated with a 14-day course of oral isavuconazole. The patient experienced
		resolution of symptoms and clearance of subsequent blood cultures. At the time of
		"writing this case report (11 months later), he has had no relapse of his fungal"
		"infection. Based on a search of the medical literature, this appears to be the"
		first published case of Candida nivariensis fungemia successfully treated with
		oral isavuconazole.

TI	-	Surgical Management of a Chronic Neck Abscess in a U.S. Navy Bottlenose Dolphin.
PG	-	e360-e364
LID	-	10.1093/milmed/usy316 [doi]
AB	-	Surgical intervention on cetaceans is rarely performed due to challenges
		including general anesthesia and post-operative wound healing. This report
		describes the evaluation and treatment of an adult female bottlenose dolphin
		"(Tursiops truncatus) with the US Navy Marine Mammal Program, with a chronic"
		ventral cervical abscess caused by Candida glabrata. Despite aspiration and
		"lavage along with multiple antifungal drugs, the patient developed inspiratory"
		stridor with decreased performance level and surgical treatment was pursued.
		Under general anesthesia with the dolphin in dorsal recumbency position a 12-cm
		longitudinal ventral midline neck incision was used for exploration.
		Intraoperative ultrasound aided the identification of surgical landmarks and the
		"abscess cavity. After adequate drainage and curettage, a closed-suction drain was"
		placed in the surgical site. Retention sutures were used to close the incision
		and the external drain bulb was secured to a pectoral fin strap. One-year
		"post-op, the dolphin was clinically normal and follow-up imaging showed no"
		significant recurrence of the abscess. This case demonstrates a novel surgical
		"approach of managing abscesses in dolphins, including placement and management of"
		a negative suction drain in a submerged patient. The successful collaboration
		"between veterinary anesthesiology, veterinary medicine, radiology, and general"
		surgery allowed the patient to continue her normal activities as a full-duty
		service member.

TI	-	Caspofungin as primary antifungal prophylaxis in stem cell transplant recipients.
PG	-	1644-50
AB	-	STUDY OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and tolerability of caspofungin as
		primary prophylaxis against invasive fungal infections in stem cell transplant
		recipients who are poor candidates for triazole or lipid amphotericin B
		"prophylaxis due to renal or hepatic dysfunction, and to determine whether any"
		patient characteristics are independently associated with an increased risk of
		breakthrough invasive fungal infection during caspofungin prophylaxis. DESIGN:
		Retrospective medical record review. SETTING: Tertiary care comprehensive cancer
		center. PATIENTS: One hundred twenty-three adult stem cell transplant recipients
		who received caspofungin 35-50 mg/day for up to 100 days after transplantation as
		"primary antifungal prophylaxis between January 1, 2002, and June 30, 2005."
		MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Data were collected on host and transplant
		"characteristics such as transplant type, neutropenia, graft-versus-host disease"
		"(GVHD), and corticosteroid use, as well as evidence of breakthrough invasive"
		"fungal infections. Of the 123 patients, 117 (95.1%) were allogeneic recipients,"
		and the median time to engraftment was 12 days (range 6-26 days). Fifty (40.7%)
		of the patients developed GVHD of grade 2 or greater and received corticosteroids
		for more than 21 days. Median duration of caspofungin prophylaxis was 73 days
		(range 10-100 days). Nine patients (7.3%) developed breakthrough invasive fungal
		infections (two cases of mixed Aspergillus species and one each of Aspergillus
		"terreus, Rhizopus, Exserohilum, an unspecified mold, Cryptococcus, Candida"
		"glabrata, and Candida tropicalis). Median time to invasive fungal infection"
		development was 65 days (range 12-88 days). Only one case occurred during the
		neutropenic period before engraftment. Multivariate analysis showed that
		Pseudomonas coinfection (p=0.04) and infliximab therapy (p=0.02) were associated
		with breakthrough invasive fungal infections in patients receiving caspofungin.
		"By day 100, there were five (4.1%) deaths, two of which were directly"
		attributable to invasive fungal infections. No caspofungin-related adverse events
		were reported. CONCLUSION: Caspofungin seems to be an effective and
		well-tolerated option for primary antifungal prophylaxis in the highly
		immunosuppressed stem cell transplant patient population.

AB	-	Invasive candidiasis remains an important cause of mortality and morbidity in
		"patients with underlying diseases. Here, we report a case of gastric perforation"
		due to Candia glabrata infection in a 74-year-old-male with Paroxysmal nocturnal
		hemoglobinuria (PNH) who received long-term corticosteroid treatment of
		hemophagocytic syndrome associated with acute cholecystitis. Total gastrectomy
		"was performed, and he was treated liposomal amphotericin B. The patient was"
		"extubated successfully on the 2nd postoperative day, but the patient died of"
		Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP). An autopsy revealed that there was a
		"small amount of the cystic form of Pneumocystic jirovecii, but there was not the"
		"presence of Candida spp. Concerning the prophylaxis of invasive candidiasis,"
		there is no strong evidence-based data in clinical practice in immunocompromised
		"patients, such as those receiving long-term immunomodulatory therapy or"
		corticosteroids. Our present case suggests the importance of fungal management
		and may indicate the need for a new approach to the fungal prophylaxis in such
		patients.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Pressure sores are sometimes refractory to treatment, often due to"
		malnutrition. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) obstructs absorption
		"in the digestive tract and causes malnutrition. However, little is known about"
		"the association between pressure sore wound healing and SIBO. Here, we report a"
		case of a patient with a refractory sacral pressure sore and SIBO. CASE
		PRESENTATION: A 66-year-old woman who was spinal cord injured 14 years before
		visiting our hospital presented with the chief complaint of a sacral pressure
		"sore, 10.0 × 6.5 cm in size, which was refractory to treatment. Physical"
		"examination showed abdominal distension and emaciation, with a body mass index of"
		"15. Further examination revealed elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (1260 U/L),"
		"bilateral tibial fracture, multiple rib fracture, and osteoporosis. We diagnosed"
		the patient with osteomalacia with vitamin D deficiency. Despite oral
		"supplementation, serum levels of calcium, phosphorous, and vitamin D remained"
		"low. Also, despite concentrative wound therapy for the sacral pressure sore by"
		"plastic surgeons, no wound healing was achieved. Due to a suspicion of"
		"disturbances in nutrient absorption, we performed bacterial examination of"
		"collected gastric and duodenal fluid, which showed high numbers of bacteria in"
		"gastric content (10(4) E. coli, 10(5) Streptococcus species, and 10(5) Neisseria"
		"species) and duodenal content (10(6) E. coli, 10(4) Candida glabrata). Therefore,"
		we diagnosed the patient with SIBO and started selective decontamination of the
		digestive tract using polymyxin B sulfate and amphotericin B. After starting
		"treatment for SIBO, the sacral pressure sore began to heal and was nearly healed"
		"after 285 days. The patient's serum levels of calcium, phosphorous, vitamin D,"
		and other fat-soluble vitamins also gradually increased after starting treatment
		for SIBO. CONCLUSION: We report a case of a patient with a refractory sacral
		pressure sore that healed after starting treatment for SIBO. We conclude that
		SIBO may be an overlooked cause of malnutrition and poor wound healing in
		patients with chronic pressure sores.

PG	-	111-115
LID	-	10.5114/ceji.2016.65893 [doi]
AB	-	The number of patients with hematological malignancies who develop invasive
		fungal disease (IFD) has increased dramatically in recent decades. This increase
		is attributed to impairment of the host immune system due to intensive cytotoxic
		"chemotherapies, use of corticosteroids and profound immunosuppression after"
		"hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Additionally, the increasing"
		"prevalence of fungal infections caused by emerging and rare pathogens, IFD of"
		mixed etiology or of atypical localization is observed. There are also much more
		"patients with IFD who do not belong to a well-described risk group, like patient"
		"with lymphoproliferative disorders. Within this heterogeneous group of patients,"
		IFD epidemiology is not well defined and antifungal prophylaxis practices vary.
		The aim of this paper is to present the case of a 58-year-old patient with
		"refractory Hodgkin disease, focusing on infectious complication after subsequent"
		lines of chemotherapy. During deep and prolonged neutropaenia the patient
		"developed symptoms of pneumonia. Despite antifungal prophylaxis with fluconazole,"
		IFD of mixed etiology with the presence of Candida glabrata and Aspergillus
		fumigatus was diagnosed. The infection showed a poor response to monotherapy with
		"liposomal amphotericin B, but was successfully treated with therapy involving"
		micafungin. Analysis of the presented case demonstrated the necessity of new
		approaches to the prevention of IFD in patients with lymphoproliferative
		disorders heavily pretreated with numerous chemotherapy protocols. Prolonged
		neutropenia and high corticosteroid exposure put these patients in high risk of
		IFD like patients with acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome or after
		allogeneic HSCT.

TI	-	Intrathecal amikacin for the treatment of pseudomonal meningitis.
PG	-	992-5
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To report a case of gram-negative bacillary meningitis (GNBM)
		secondary to multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa that was treated with
		intravenous meropenem and intrathecal and intravenous amikacin. CASE SUMMARY: A
		76-year-old Arabic woman with previous placement of an extraventricular device
		developed meningitis secondary to P. aeruginosa as a result of a previous
		"pneumonia. The patient was treated with intravenous meropenem and amikacin, with"
		"the addition of intrathecal amikacin, until cerebrospinal cultures remained"
		negative for 18 days. She did not experience any adverse effects as a result of
		the administration of the intrathecal amikacin. Although the meningitis
		"subsequently resolved, the patient eventually died due to Candida glabrata"
		fungemia. DISCUSSION: Dual therapy is recommended for patients with P. aeruginosa
		"meningitis. In our patient, the increasing resistance to imipenem and resistance"
		to all other potential antibiotics resulted in the use of an alternative
		administration technique that has not been well documented in recent literature.
		"CONCLUSIONS: In patients who have GNBM due to P. aeruginosa, the combination of"
		"intrathecal and intravenous amikacin may be an option for therapy, especially"
		"when clinical options are limited by resistance, severity of illness, and"
		location of the infection. More information is required and further study is
		needed on this topic.

AB	-	"A 52-year-old man presented to our hospital complaining of general malaise,"
		"cough, and fever. Total body computed tomography revealed scattered pneumonia and"
		urethral foreign bodies that had been inserted during adolescence. Candida
		"glabrata was detected in blood and urine cultures. Based on these findings, the"
		patient was diagnosed with candidemia that developed due to Candida urinary tract
		"infection, complicated by septic pulmonary embolism and severe diabetes mellitus."
		Candidemia likely persisted despite the initiation of intravenous antifungal
		"therapy and control of blood sugar level. Therefore, surgical removal of the"
		"urethral foreign bodies was performed, which resulted in resolution of the"
		"patient's symptoms. Herein, we report a rare case of candidemia complicated by"
		Candida urinary tract infection that developed due to the long-term presence of
		"urethral foreign bodies. A multidisciplinary therapeutic approach, including"
		"surgical removal of the infected foreign bodies, is effective in such cases. This"
		case indicates that long-term presence of foreign bodies and acquired immune
		"dysfunction can be risk factors for candidemia. Therefore, detailed history"
		should be obtained and systemic examination should be performed to identify the
		complicating risk factors on diagnosis of candidemia.

TI	-	Immunomodulatory Therapy and an Insidious Presentation of a Large Intra-Abdominal
		Abscess.
PG	-	280-2
AB	-	Crohn's disease is a disorder characterized by transmural inflammation which can
		potentially affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from the mouth to the
		perianal area. Cohn's disease is a systemic disease characterized by a relapsing
		"remitting course, with variable intestinal and extra-intestinal complications."
		Abdominal and pelvic abscesses are not an uncommon complication of Crohn's
		disease occurring in 10-30 percent of all patients. We present the case of a
		21-year-old male with Crohn's disease presenting with a massive abdominal
		"abscess, whose diagnosis was delayed given lack of typical symptoms. Shortly"
		after initiating therapy with Prednisone and Adalimumab he presented with
		worsening abdominal distention. Cross sectional imaging of the abdomen with IV
		contrast (Figure 1) demonstrated a 34cm x 23 cm x 11 cm rim-enhancing fluid
		collections in the abdomen and pelvis consistent with a large intra-abdominal
		"abscess. He underwent an exploratory laparotomy, abdominal washout, and wound"
		vacuum placement. Five liters of purulent fluid were aspirated and cultures grew
		"citrobacter, veillonella and candida glabrata. A bowel perforation was suspected"
		as the etiology for abscess formation; however magnetic resonance heterography
		"(Figure2) was unremarkable. He was treated with appropriate antibiotics,"
		"antifungal agents, and was started on Aprisa. His course was complicated with"
		recurrence of intra-abdominal abscesses and a colocutaneous fistula for which he
		underwent an open sigmoidectomy with a diverting loop colostomy. After
		"condirmation of healing with repeat imaging, he was an uneventful postoperative"
		course. He followed as an outpatient and continues to do well on Infliximab. Most
		abscesses are picked up in their early stages given characteristic symptoms;
		however in presence of immunosuppressive therapy the host immune system can be
		suppressed leading to delayed diagnosis. The presence of a massive
		intra-abdominal purulent fluid collection of this size has not been described on
		"our review of the literature. Furthermore, despite the abscess taking up most of"
		"the abdominal cavity, the fairly limited symptom burden highlights the importance"
		of having high degree of clinical suspicion for infectious compications in
		Crohn's disease patients even when classical symptoms are not present.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: The poorly known mycobacterial species Mycobacterium monacense is a
		rapidly growing non-tuberculous mycobacterium that was first described in 2006
		"(Reischl et al., Int J Syst Evol Microbiol 56:2575-8, 2006); it has been reported"
		"that its isolation is usually associated with skin and lung infections,"
		"especially in immunosuppressed patients (Hogardt et al., Jpn J Infect Dis"
		"61:77-8, 2008; Taieb et al., J Hand Surg Am 33:94-6, 2008; Therese et al., Lung"
		"India 28:124-6, 2011; Shojaei et al., Ann Lab Med 32:87-90, 2012; Romero et al.,"
		"New Microbes New Infect 10:112-5, 2016 ). The clinical significance of"
		"Mycobacterium monacense is not yet fully understood. Here, we report the first"
		isolation of Mycobacterium monacense from the blood culture of a patient in China
		"with severe pneumonia. CASE PRESENTATION: On June 26, 2018, a 38-year-old man was"
		"admitted to the intensive care unit with breathing difficulty. One day prior, he"
		was discovered with his face immersed in a small pond (non-chlorinated water) and
		with limb convulsions. He had undergone craniocerebral surgery after trauma
		"5 years earlier, which left him with epilepsy as a sequela. Bilateral diffuse"
		ground-glass opacity was found in the lungs on chest X ray and chest CT image at
		admission. The result of the HIV serology test of the patient was negative. The
		patient was diagnosed with severe pneumonia. Drug-susceptible Klebsiella
		"pneumoniae and Candida glabrata were isolated in the BALF, and yellow-pigmented"
		colonies were isolated from blood cultures of the patient. The strain isolated
		"from blood was identified by 16S rDNA sequencing as Mycobacteria monacense, which"
		is a rapidly growing mycobacterium (RGM). The patient was treated with a
		"combination of cefoperazone sulbactam, linezolid and voriconazole for 10 days,"
		"and the symptoms improved. During the one-year follow-up time, the patient did"
		not relapse. CONCLUSIONS: We report the first case of M. monacense isolated from
		"blood cultures in a patient with severe pneumonia, which provided evidence that"
		the environmental microorganism possessed pathogenic characteristics.

TI	-	Late polymicrobial transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt infection in a
		liver transplant patient: A case report.
PG	-	846-853
LID	-	10.4254/wjh.v14.i4.846 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Infection of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS)
		stent is a rare and serious complication that most commonly occurs during TIPS
		creation and revision. Patients typically present with recurrent bacteremia due
		to shunt occlusion or vegetation. To date there are approximately 58 cases
		reported. We present a patient diagnosed with late polymicrobial TIPS infection
		five years following TIPS creation. CASE SUMMARY: A 63-year-old female
		status-post liver transplant with recurrent cirrhosis and portal hypertension
		presented with sepsis and recurrent extended-spectrum beta-lactamase Escherichia
		coli bacteremia. Computed tomography of the abdomen revealed an occluded TIPS
		"with thrombus extension into the distal right portal vein, and focal thickening"
		of the cecum and ascending colon. Colonoscopy revealed patchy ulcers in these
		areas with histopathology demonstrating ulcerated colonic mucosa with
		fibrinopurulent exudate. Shunt thrombectomy and revision revealed
		infected-appearing thrombus. Patient initially cleared her infection with
		"antibacterial therapy and TIPS revision; however, soon after, she developed"
		Enterobacter cloacae bacteremia and Candida glabrata and C. albicans fungemia
		with recurrent TIPS thrombosis. She remained on antifungal therapy indefinitely
		and later developed vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium with recurrent TIPS
		thrombosis. The option of liver re-transplant for removal of the infected TIPS
		was not offered given her critical illness and complex shunt anatomy. The patient
		became intolerant to linezolid and elected hospice care. CONCLUSION: Clinicians

		in Pseudoaneurysm of Internal Maxillary Artery: A Case Report.
PG	-	562-566
LID	-	10.12659/AJCR.913469 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND Pseudomonal infection is the most common cause of malignant otitis
		"externa (MOE), which typically affects elderly diabetic patients. Fungi are a"
		rare cause of MOE. MOE can be life-threatening if not recognized and treated
		"promptly. It can result in a wide spectrum of complications, including skull-base"
		"osteomyelitis, cranial nerve palsy, cerebral venous thrombosis, and brain"
		abscess. Pseudoaneurysm formation of the intracranial vessels is a
		life-threatening complication of MOE that is seldom reported in the literature.
		CASE REPORT We report the case of a 66-year-old diabetic man with MOE who was
		initially treated with antipseudomonal antibiotics after negative initial culture
		"results. His MOE resulted in a cascade of complications, including facial nerve"
		"palsy, skull base osteomyelitis, and sigmoid sinus thrombosis, and culminated in"
		left maxillary artery pseudoaneurysm formation resulting in massive epistaxis and
		hemodynamic instability. Endovascular embolization resulted in a successful
		obliteration of the pseudoaneurysm. A subsequent functional endoscopic sinus
		surgical (FESS) tissue biopsy confirmed Candida glabrata as the etiological
		agent. The patient was successfully treated with antibiotics and antifungal and
		"anticoagulation therapy, and was discharged home in good condition. CONCLUSIONS A"
		"high index of suspicion for the diagnosis of fungal MOE, particularly in"
		"intractable cases of MOE with negative initial cultures, should be maintained."
		Pseudoaneurysm formation is a life-threatening complication of MOE that is seldom
		reported in the literature and should be suspected in any patient with MOE who
		presents with epistaxis or intracranial bleeding.

		extension into the pituitary fossa with visual loss has only been described in a
		few reports in the literature. Following publication of a recent report of
		"pituitary abscess by Candida glabrata, we describe our own experience with a"
		"similar pathology. CASE DESCRIPTION: In the present report, we overview a"
		diabetic patient who sustained aspergilloma in his sphenoid sinus with extension
		to the pituitary fossa. Clinical presentations are discussed along with an
		emphasis on the role of endoscopic endonasal drainage of the abscess as the
		mainstay of treatment. Following administration of intravenous amphotericin B for
		"6 days, endoscopic drainage of the aspergillus abscess was done. Visual acuity"
		"improved immediately after the operation. At the 12-month follow-up visit, the"
		improvement in visual acuity was maintained and magnetic resonance imaging showed
		"no recurrence. CONCLUSION: Correction of the underlying immune deficiencies,"
		"administration of intravenous antifungal agents perioperatively, endoscopic"
		"endonasal drainage of abscess, and a meticulous debridement of necrotic material,"
		"followed by a course of oral antifungal medication, comprises the standard"
		treatment protocol for a fungus ball (aspergilloma) of the sphenoid sinus.

AB	-	We report two cases of advanced gastric cancer with severe postoperative
		complications after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). The first case is a
		60-year-old man who was diagnosed as a type 2 advanced gastric cancer with
		paraaortic lymph node metastases and the elevation of serum CA19-9 level. NAC was
		"started, but no reductions were noted after 3 courses. Palliative total"
		"gastrectomy with distal pancreatectomy, splenectomy, cholecystectomy, and partial"
		hepatectomy for T4 gastric cancer exhibiting obstruction were performed in June
		"2007. On postoperative day 10, abdominal CT scan revealed left subphrenic"
		"abscess, then CT-guided percutaneous drainage was performed. A culture of the"
		abscess yielded Candida albicans and Candida glabrata. The second case is a
		58-year-old man who was diagnosed as a type 2 advanced gastric cancer with
		multiple lymph node metastases and the elevation of serum CA19-9 level. NAC were
		"performed, but no reductions were noted. A distal gastrectomy was performed in"
		"January 2008. On the first postoperative day, a severe abdominal distension was"
		"appeared suddenly and increasingly. An emergency laparotomy was undergone, but no"
		"findings of the bowel obstruction were observed. On postoperative day 2, a rise"
		of serum beta-D-glucan level was recognized. Both cases were improved by an
		antifungal drug therapy.

PG	-	373-7
AB	-	A 20-year-old man was admitted to our institution complaining of gradually
		"worsening motor weakness in the right extremities. On admission, the radiological"
		"examination revealed a mass located in the left parietal region. On April 4,"
		"1988, a left fronto-parietal craniotomy was performed and the tumor was"
		subtotally removed. The pathological findings of the surgical specimen confirmed
		"no specific tumor, but the presence of a small mingled Candida glabrata supported"
		the diagnosis of fungal granuloma. Amphotericin B (AmB) was administered
		intravenously for the later enlargement of the tumor. MRI 4 weeks after the
		beginning of this treatment demonstrated the tumor to be prominently decreased in
		"size. At discharge 3 months later, there was no tumor except only a minimal one"
		"in the paraventricular region. However, the recurrence of the tumor was"
		"discovered again over the next 8 months. AmB was administered as before, but the"
		"tumor continued to be enlarged. In May, 1990, surgery was performed again, and"
		the histological diagnosis was germinoma accompanied with considerable
		"granulomatous reaction. Subsequently, local irradiation was given and complete"
		remission was maintained up to the present time 8 months after irradiation. AmB
		"is a polyene antifungal antibiotic, that has also been reported to enhance the"
		response of antitumor drugs to some tumors on the basis of increased tumor cell
		permeability. Recent investigations revealed that AmB had immunoadjuvant
		"properties mediated through activated lymphocytes and macrophages, which resulted"
		in an increased host resistance against infectious diseases and even tumors in
		vivo or in vitro studies. We reported a rare case of intracranial germinoma which
		responded well to AmB probably through its own antitumor effect caused by
		immunoadjuvant properties. We discussed the possibility of AmB to be used as
		immunoadjuvant agent or in combination with other antitumor drugs for the
		effective treatment of some tumors.

TI	-	Corneal Perforation as a Complication of Fungal Interface Infectious Keratitis
		after Deep Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty.
PG	-	184-188
LID	-	10.4103/meajo.meajo_114_21 [doi]
AB	-	Deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) is a surgical intervention for corneal
		diseases that do not affect the endothelium. The creation of an interface between
		the donor graft and recipient bed is a typical feature of DALK. Interface
		infectious keratitis (IIK) is an uncommon complication that originates at this
		point of contact. The onset of IIK following lamellar keratoplasty can cause
		"delayed visual loss and subsequent endophthalmitis, with primarily fungal"
		"etiology (e.g., Candida spp.) and occasionally bacterial etiology. Infection of"
		the lamellar interface may be attributed to contamination of the donor material
		"or to precipitating factors such as loose sutures, persistent epithelial defects,"
		and prolonged topical steroid use; fungal IIK is frequently resistant to medical
		"treatment. Here, we describe the previously unreported occurrence of corneal"
		perforation as a complication of fungal IIK after DALK. A 26-year-old otherwise
		healthy woman underwent uneventful DALK for advanced keratoconus in the left eye.
		She was discharged with instructions to apply topical prednisolone acetate and
		topical moxifloxacin. Culture of the donor corneoscleral rim showed growth of
		"Candida glabrata, although the patient exhibited no clinical signs of infection."
		"Approximately 3 months later, the patient exhibited mild blurring of vision in"
		"her left eye. Therefore, treatment was modified to topical amphotericin B and"
		"oral voriconazole. One week later, the patient developed multiple, sheath-like"
		"whitish creamy infiltrates, primarily in the lamellar interface; a positive"
		Seidel test result indicated the presence of corneal perforation. As treatment
		"for IIK, excisional penetrating keratoplasty (PK) was performed, followed by"
		topical amphotericin B and topical prednisolone acetate treatment. During 12
		"months of follow-up after PK, the corneal graft was clear and there was no"
		clinical evidence of recurrent keratitis. Prompt excisional PK prevented the
		progression of IIK to endophthalmitis in our patient. Early intervention with
		excisional PK should be considered when a diagnosis of fungal IIK is suspected in
		"a patient with a positive donor rim culture, and in whom the condition does not"
		respond to medical treatment. This early intervention is essential to prevent
		"delayed treatment, which could result in corneal perforation and endophthalmitis,"
		with ultimately poor visual outcomes.

AB	-	We report on a 28-year-old female patient who had no history of diseases and who
		was brought to our intensive care unit in a comatose state by the ambulance
		service. The clinical picture corresponded to sepsis with a massively increased
		blood sugar concentration (> 2000 mg/dl) as well as a pronounced skin mycosis in
		the groin region of the very obese patient (body mass index [BMI]: 33.7 kg/m(2))
		in the physical examination. The treatment of sepsis was initially supplemented
		by a calculated antifungal treatment. The blood culture diagnosis confirmed the
		presence of Candida albicans and Candida glabrata. Despite adequate
		"anti-infective treatment, the patient developed a septic shock in the further"
		"course, so that the additional escalation of treatment was initiated by renal"
		replacement therapy on the second day and venovenous extracorporeal membrane
		oxygenation because of an ARDS. Despite all of these measures and maximum
		"intensive care treatment, the patient developed a progressive multiple organ"
		"failure. When the pupils became rigid to light, a cerebral computed tomography"
		was carried out. This showed evidence of a severe cerebral edema without signs of
		cerebral bleeding. Multiple examinations of somatosensory evoked potentials and
		electroencephalograms showed signs of irreversible brain damage. In view of this
		poor prognosis the therapeutic measures were limited. The patient died on day 24
		after admission to the intensive care unit. The case study shows that antifungal
		treatment should definitely be considered in the context of sepsis treatment if
		there is a clinically justified suspicion.The role of the severely altered
		metabolic situation with massive hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis cannot be finally
		assessed.
