TI	-	The Changing Epidemiology of Invasive Fungal Infections.
PG	-	17-65
AB	-	Invasive fungal infections (IFI) are an emerging problem worldwide with invasive
		candidiasis and candidemia responsible for the majority of cases. This is
		predominantly driven by the widespread adoption of aggressive immunosuppressive
		"therapy among certain patient populations (e.g., chemotherapy, transplants) and"
		the increasing use of invasive devices such as central venous catheters (CVCs).
		The use of new immune modifying drugs has also opened up an entirely new spectrum
		of patients at risk of IFIs. While the epidemiology of candida infections has
		"changed in the last decade, with a gradual shift from C. albicans to non-albicans"
		"candida (NAC) strains which may be less susceptible to azoles, these changes vary"
		between hospitals and regions depending on the type of population risk factors
		"and antifungal use. In certain parts of the world, the incidence of IFI is"
		strongly linked to the prevalence of other disease conditions and the ecological
		niche for the organism; for instance cryptococcal and pneumocystis infections are
		particularly common in areas with a high prevalence of HIV disease. Poorly
		controlled diabetes is a major risk factor for invasive mould infections.
		Environmental factors and trauma also play a unique role in the epidemiology of
		"mould infections, with well-described hospital outbreaks linked to the use of"
		contaminated instruments and devices. Blastomycosis is associated with
		"occupational exposure (e.g., forest rangers) and recreational activities (e.g.,"
		camping and fishing).The true burden of IFI is probably an underestimate because
		of the absence of reliable diagnostics and lack of universal application. For
		"example, the sensitivity of most blood culture systems for detecting candida is"
		typically 50 %. The advent of new technology including molecular techniques such
		as 18S ribosomal RNA PCR and genome sequencing is leading to an improved
		understanding of the epidemiology of the less common mould and dimorphic fungal
		infections. Molecular techniques are also providing a platform for improved
		"diagnosis and management of IFI.Many factors affect mortality in IFI, not least"
		"the underlying medical condition, choice of therapy, and the ability to achieve"
		"early source control. For instance, mortality due to pneumocystis pneumonia in"
		HIV-seronegative individuals is now higher than in seropositive patients. Of
		significant concern is the progressive increase in resistance to azoles and
		"echinocandins among candida isolates, which appears to worsen the already"
		significant mortality associated with invasive candidiasis. Mortality with mould
		"infections approaches 50 % in most studies and varies depending on the site,"
		underlying disease and the use of antifungal agents such as echinocandins and
		"voriconazole. Nevertheless, mortality for most IFIs has generally fallen with"
		"advances in medical technology, improved care of CVCs, improved diagnostics, and"
		more effective preemptive therapy and prophylaxis.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Patients with severe COVID-19 have emerged as a population at high
		"risk of invasive fungal infections (IFIs). However, to our knowledge, the"
		prevalence of IFIs has not yet been assessed in large populations of mechanically
		"ventilated patients. We aimed to identify the prevalence, risk factors, and"
		mortality associated with IFIs in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19
		"under intensive care. METHODS: We performed a national, multicentre,"
		observational cohort study in 18 French intensive care units (ICUs). We
		retrospectively and prospectively enrolled adult patients (aged ≥18 years) with
		RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and requiring mechanical ventilation for
		"acute respiratory distress syndrome, with all demographic and clinical and"
		biological follow-up data anonymised and collected from electronic case report
		forms. Patients were systematically screened for respiratory fungal
		microorganisms once or twice a week during the period of mechanical ventilation
		up to ICU discharge. The primary outcome was the prevalence of IFIs in all
		eligible participants with a minimum of three microbiological samples screened
		"during ICU admission, with proven or probable (pr/pb) COVID-19-associated"
		pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) classified according to the recent ECMM/ISHAM
		"definitions. Secondary outcomes were risk factors of pr/pb CAPA, ICU mortality"
		"between the pr/pb CAPA and non-pr/pb CAPA groups, and associations of pr/pb CAPA"
		"and related variables with ICU mortality, identified by regression models. The"
		"MYCOVID study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04368221. FINDINGS:"
		"Between Feb 29 and July 9, 2020, we enrolled 565 mechanically ventilated patients"
		with COVID-19. 509 patients with at least three screening samples were analysed
		"(mean age 59·4 years [SD 12·5], 400 [79%] men). 128 (25%) patients had 138"
		episodes of pr/pb or possible IFIs. 76 (15%) patients fulfilled the criteria for
		"pr/pb CAPA. According to multivariate analysis, age older than 62 years (odds"
		"ratio [OR] 2·34 [95% CI 1·39-3·92], p=0·0013), treatment with dexamethasone and"
		"anti-IL-6 (OR 2·71 [1·12-6·56], p=0·027), and long duration of mechanical"
		"ventilation (>14 days; OR 2·16 [1·14-4·09], p=0·019) were independently"
		associated with pr/pb CAPA. 38 (7%) patients had one or more other pr/pb IFIs: 32
		"(6%) had candidaemia, six (1%) had invasive mucormycosis, and one (<1%) had"
		"invasive fusariosis. Multivariate analysis of associations with death, adjusted"
		"for candidaemia, for the 509 patients identified three significant factors: age"
		"older than 62 years (hazard ratio [HR] 1·71 [95% CI 1·26-2·32], p=0·0005), solid"
		"organ transplantation (HR 2·46 [1·53-3·95], p=0·0002), and pr/pb CAPA (HR 1·45"
		"[95% CI 1·03-2·03], p=0·033). At time of ICU discharge, survival curves showed"
		that overall ICU mortality was significantly higher in patients with pr/pb CAPA
		"than in those without, at 61·8% (95% CI 50·0-72·8) versus 32·1% (27·7-36·7;"
		p<0·0001). INTERPRETATION: This study shows the high prevalence of invasive
		pulmonary aspergillosis and candidaemia and high mortality associated with pr/pb
		CAPA in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19. These findings highlight
		the need for active surveillance of fungal pathogens in patients with severe
		COVID-19. FUNDING: Pfizer.

TI	-	Epidemiology of invasive fungal disease in haematologic patients.
PG	-	252-256
LID	-	10.1111/myc.13205 [doi]
AB	-	Invasive fungal disease (IFD) is frequent in patients with haematologic
		malignancies and in recipients of haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). An
		epidemiologic study conducted in Brazil reported a high incidence of IFD in
		"haematologic patients, and invasive fusariosis was the leading IFD. A limitation"
		of that study was that galactomannan was not available for at least half of the
		study period. In order to characterise the epidemiology and burden of IFD in
		"three cohorts, HCT, acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or myelodysplasia (MDS), and"
		"acute lymphoid leukaemia (ALL), we conducted a prospective multicentre cohort"
		"study in four haematologic Brazilian centres. From August 2015 to July 2016, all"
		"patients receiving induction chemotherapy for newly diagnosed or relapsed AML,"
		"MDS or ALL, and all HCT recipients receiving conditioning regimen were followed"
		during the period of neutropenia following chemotherapy or the conditioning
		"regimen. During a 1-year period, 192 patients were enrolled: 122 HCT recipients"
		"(71 allogeneic, 51 autologous), 46 with AML, and 24 with ALL. The global"
		"incidence of IFD was 13.0% (25 cases, 11 proven and 14 probable). Invasive"
		"aspergillosis (14 cases) was the leading IFD, followed by candidemia (6 cases)"
		"and fusariosis (3 cases). The incidence of IFD was 26.1% in AML/MDS, 16.7% in"
		"ALL, 11.3% in allogeneic HCT, and 2.0% in autologous HCT. The burden of IFD in"
		"haematologic patients in Brazil is high, with a higher frequency in AML and ALL."
		"Invasive aspergillosis is the leading IFD, followed by invasive candidiasis and"
		fusariosis.

PG	-	723-730
LID	-	10.1093/cid/ciz282 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Isavuconazole (ISA) is an attractive candidate for primary
		mold-active prophylaxis in high-risk patients with hematologic malignancies or
		"hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. However, data supporting the use"
		of ISA for primary prophylaxis in these patients are lacking. METHODS: We
		conducted a retrospective review of breakthrough invasive fungal infections
		(bIFIs) among adult hematologic malignancy patients and HCT recipients who
		received ≥7 days of ISA primary prophylaxis between 1 September 2016 and 30
		September 2018. The incidence of bIFIs in patients receiving ISA was compared to
		those receiving posaconazole (POS) and voriconazole (VOR) during the same time
		period. RESULTS: One hundred forty-five patients received 197 courses of ISA
		"prophylaxis. Twelve bIFIs (Aspergillus fumigatus [5], Aspergillus species [2],"
		"Mucorales [2], Fusarium species [2], and Candida glabrata [1]) occurred,"
		"representing 8.3% of patients and 6.1% of courses, after a median duration of 14"
		days of ISA prophylaxis. All bIFIs occurred during periods of neutropenia. Seven
		"patients (58.3%) died within 42 days of onset of bIFI. In addition, bIFIs"
		"complicated 10.2% of ISA, 4.1% of POS, and 1.1% of VOR courses among patients"
		with de novo or relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia during the study
		"period, with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) complicating 6.8% of ISA,"
		"1.3% of POS, and zero VOR courses. CONCLUSIONS: Although ISA has been approved"
		"for treatment of invasive Aspergillus and mucormycosis, we observed an increased"
		"rate of bIFI, notably IPA, using ISA for primary prophylaxis. These results"
		support the need for further study to determine the role of ISA as primary
		prophylaxis.

AB	-	The use of multi-locus DNA sequence analysis has led to the description of
		"previously unknown 'cryptic' Aspergillus species, whereas classical"
		morphology-based identification of Aspergillus remains limited to the section or
		species-complex level. The current literature highlights two main features
		"concerning these 'cryptic' Aspergillus species. First, the prevalence of such"
		species in clinical samples is relatively high compared with emergent filamentous
		"fungal taxa such as Mucorales, Scedosporium or Fusarium. Second, it is clearly"
		important to identify these species in the clinical laboratory because of the
		high frequency of antifungal drug-resistant isolates of such Aspergillus species.
		Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry
		(MALDI-TOF MS) has recently been shown to enable the identification of
		filamentous fungi with an accuracy similar to that of DNA sequence-based methods.
		"As MALDI-TOF MS is well suited to the routine clinical laboratory workflow, it"
		facilitates the identification of these 'cryptic' Aspergillus species at the
		routine mycology bench. The rapid establishment of enhanced filamentous fungi
		identification facilities will lead to a better understanding of the epidemiology
		and clinical importance of these emerging Aspergillus species. Based on routine
		"MALDI-TOF MS-based identification results, we provide original insights into the"
		key interpretation issues of a positive Aspergillus culture from a clinical
		sample. Which ubiquitous species that are frequently isolated from air samples
		are rarely involved in human invasive disease? Can both the species and the type
		"of biological sample indicate Aspergillus carriage, colonization or infection in"
		a patient? Highly accurate routine filamentous fungi identification is central to
		"enhance the understanding of these previously unknown Aspergillus species, with a"
		vital impact on further improved patient care.

TI	-	Deep cutaneous fungal infections in immunocompromised children.
PG	-	857-64
LID	-	10.1016/j.jaad.2009.02.052 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Life-threatening infections from ubiquitous fungi are becoming more
		prevalent in adults and children because of the increased use of
		immunosuppressive agents and broad-spectrum anti-infective drugs. Extremely low
		birth weight premature neonates and patients with a disrupted epidermal barrier
		"are also at increased risk. Lethality is high, particularly with delayed"
		diagnosis. As cutaneous lesions are often the first manifestation of such
		"infections, early recognition of suspicious lesions is crucial to decrease"
		associated morbidity and mortality. The clinical features of deep cutaneous
		fungal infection (DCFI) in immunocompromised children deserve special attention.
		"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to characterize our pediatric patients with DCFI,"
		"the causative fungi, and the associated risk factors. METHODS: A medical record"
		review was conducted of pediatric patients with DCFI treated at out institution
		using data retrieved from the hospital's pathology and microbiology database
		"(1980-2008). RESULTS: In all, 26 patients with DCFI were identified (9 girls and"
		"17 boys) ranging in age from 1 day to 18 years (mean age: 8 years), the majority"
		"of whom had a hematologic disorder. All patients were immunocompromised, 90% were"
		"receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, and 50% had severe neutropenia (absolute"
		neutrophilic count < or = 500 x 10(6)/L). Necrotic ulcers (42%) and papules (34%)
		represented the most frequent lesion morphology. Fungal species were identified
		by culture in 20 (87%) of 23 patients tested and were observed
		histopathologically in 20 of 23 patients tested. Aspergillus was identified in 12
		"(44%) patients and Candida in 9 (33%). The other species included Fusarium (one),"
		"Exserohilum rostratum (one), Alternaria (one), Zygomycetes (two), and"
		Blatomycetes (one). All but two patients received systemic antifungal therapy;
		"wide surgical excision was performed in 13. Infection resolved in 20 (77%),"
		whereas 6 (23%) died of disseminated infection. LIMITATIONS: This study was
		limited by the small number of cases and the retrospective nature of the
		collected data. DISCUSSION: DCFI should rank high in the differential diagnosis
		of any suspicious skin lesions in immunocompromised children. Early biopsies
		"should be performed for histopathology and microbiological analysis, as lethality"
		is high if appropriate treatment is delayed.

AB	-	"In a multicenter, prospective study of filamentous fungal keratitis in Greece,"
		"predisposing factors, etiology, treatment practices, and outcome, were"
		determined. Corneal scrapings were collected from patients with clinical
		"suspicion of fungal keratitis, and demographic and clinical data were recorded."
		"Fungal identification was based on morphology, molecular methods, and matrix"
		assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass-spectrometry. A total of
		35 cases were identified in a 16-year study period. Female to male ratio was
		"1:1.7 and median age 48 years. Corneal injury by plant material, and soft contact"
		"lens use were the main risk factors (42.8% and 31.4%, respectively). Trauma was"
		"the leading risk factor for men (68.1%), contact lens use (61.5%) for women."
		"Fusarium species were isolated more frequently (n = 21, 61.8%). F. solani was"
		"mostly associated with trauma, F. verticillioides and F. proliferatum with soft"
		"contact lens use. Other fungi were: Purpureocillium lilacinum (14.7%), Alternaria"
		"(11.8%), Aspergillus (8.8%), and Phoma foliaceiphila, Beauveria bassiana and"
		"Curvularia spicifera, one case each. Amphotericin B and voriconazole MIC(50)s"
		against Fusarium were 2 mg/L and 4 mg/L respectively. Antifungal therapy
		"consisted mainly of voriconazole locally or both locally and systemically, alone"
		or in combination with liposomal AmB. Cure/improvement rate with antifungal
		"therapy alone was 52%, keratoplasty was required in 40% of cases, and enucleation"
		"in 8%. In conclusion, filamentous fungal keratitis in Greece is rare, but with"
		considerable morbidity. A large proportion of cases resulted in keratoplasty
		despite appropriate antifungal treatment.

PG	-	625-631
LID	-	10.1111/myc.13089 [doi]
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Fungal diseases have an ever-increasing global disease burden,"
		although regional estimates for specific fungal diseases are often unavailable or
		"dispersed. OBJECTIVES: Here, we report the current annual burden of"
		life-threatening and debilitating fungal diseases in the Netherlands. METHODS:
		"The most recent available epidemiological data, reported incidence and prevalence"
		"of fungal diseases were used for calculations. RESULTS: Overall, we estimate that"
		the annual burden of serious invasive fungal infections in the Netherlands totals
		"3 185 patients, including extrapulmonary or disseminated cryptococcosis (n = 9),"
		"pneumocystis pneumonia (n = 740), invasive aspergillosis (n = 1 283), chronic"
		"pulmonary aspergillosis (n = 257), invasive Candida infections (n = 684),"
		mucormycosis (n = 15) and Fusarium keratitis (n = 8). Adding the prevalence of
		"recurrent vulvo-vaginal candidiasis (n = 220 043), allergic bronchopulmonary"
		aspergillosis (n = 13 568) and severe asthma with fungal sensitisation
		"(n = 17 695), the total debilitating burden of fungal disease in the Netherlands"
		"is 254 491 patients yearly, approximately 1.5% of the country's population."
		CONCLUSION: We estimated the annual burden of serious fungal infections in the
		Netherlands at 1.5% of the population based on previously reported modelling of
		fungal rates for specific populations at risk. With emerging new risk groups and
		"increasing reports on antifungal resistance, surveillance programmes are"
		warranted to obtain more accurate estimates of fungal disease epidemiology and
		associated morbidity and mortality.

PG	-	26-32
LID	-	10.1111/ceo.13346 [doi]
AB	-	IMPORTANCE: Fungal keratitis is a rare but sight-threatening ocular infection.
		"The epidemiology varies with geography, in particular climate and demography."
		BACKGROUND: We present descriptive epidemiology of fungal keratitis in
		"Queensland, a large, geographically heterogenous Australian state. DESIGN:"
		Descriptive ecological study. PARTICIPANTS: Queensland residents in the period
		1996 to January 2016. METHODS: We searched the state-wide pathology database for
		"positive fungal cultures from corneal scrapings, aqueous humour, vitreous humour"
		"or contact lens specimens. Data were analysed by age, sex, climate and location."
		Cumulative incidence rates were estimated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Episodes of
		"fungal keratitis, from which the abovementioned positive fungal cultures were"
		assumed to originate. RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty-one episodes of fungal
		keratitis in 215 Queensland residents were identified (140 males and 75 females).
		The median age was 48 years and the modal age range was 25-50 years. Seasonal
		variation was seen in tropical Queensland. Fusarium (33%) and Aspergillus (13%)
		were the commonest pathogens. The cumulative incidence per 100 000 population was
		"4.7, but was significantly higher in rural/regional (5.4) and tropical Queensland"
		"(7.9). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In Queensland, fungal keratitis occurs most"
		frequently in males under 50 with increased case identification associated with
		the hot dry season in tropical Queensland. The sex and age distribution may
		reflect increased environmental exposure to fungi related to occupation. The
		higher cumulative incidence in tropical Queensland is in keeping with the rates
		observed in other tropical regions of the world. Knowledge of the epidemiology of
		the condition is essential in formulating empirical antifungal regimens in
		suspected fungal keratitis.

TI	-	Do high MICs predict the outcome in invasive fusariosis?
PG	-	1063-1069
LID	-	10.1093/jac/dkaa516 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive fusariosis (IF) affects mostly severely immunocompromised
		hosts and is associated with poor outcome. Since Fusarium species exhibit high
		"MICs for most antifungal agents, this could explain the poor prognosis. However,"
		a clear-cut correlation between MIC and outcome has not been established.
		OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the correlation between MIC and outcome (6 week death
		rate) in patients with IF. METHODS: We performed a multicentre retrospective
		study of patients with IF who received treatment and had MIC levels determined by
		EUCAST or CLSI for the drug(s) used during treatment. We compared the MIC50 and
		MIC distribution among survivors and patients who died within 6 weeks from the
		"diagnosis of IF. RESULTS: Among 88 patients with IF, 74 had haematological"
		diseases. Primary treatment was monotherapy in 52 patients (voriconazole in 27)
		and combination therapy in 36 patients (liposomal amphotericin B + voriconazole
		in 23). The MIC50 and range for the five most frequent agents tested were:
		"voriconazole 8 mg/L (range 0.5-64), amphotericin B 2 mg/L (range 0.25-64),"
		"posaconazole 16 mg/L (range 0.5-64), itraconazole 32 mg/L (range 4-64), and"
		isavuconazole 32 mg/L (range 8-64). There was no difference in MIC50 and MIC
		"distribution among survivors and patients who died. By contrast, persistent"
		neutropenia and receipt of corticosteroids were strong predictors of 6 week
		mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Our study did not show any correlation between MIC and
		mortality at 6 weeks in patients with IF.

AB	-	A retrospective cohort study was conducted on two Egyptian horse farms with most
		of horses were suffered from abdominal pain to describe the associations between
		the occurrence of mycotoxicosis and equine colic. The farms owner complain was an
		unexpected increase in number of colic cases and deaths among horses. The
		"association between colic and risk factors (sex, type of food either dry or mixed"
		with roughages and hematobiochemical parameters) was compared using independent
		sample T-test. The associations between possible prognostic indicators for colic
		caused by mycotoxicosis was estimated using logistic regression analysis model.
		"The cumulative incidence, incidence rates for colic attacks, survival rate among"
		diseased horses were additionally estimated. Our results showed that a total of
		24 out of the 132 horses suffered from colic due to feeding of ration
		"contaminated with high percent of mycotoxin including Aflatoxins, Ochratoxins and"
		or fusarium mycotoxins. The total cumulative incidence of colic due to
		mycotoxicosis was 19.7%. The horses fed on dry rations had more chance of
		developing colic than horses fed on mixed rations (P < 0.05). The overall
		incidence rate of colic due to mycotoxicosis was estimated at 18 colic
		attack/1000 horse/month. The mortality rate of horses suffered from colic due to
		"mycotoxicosis was estimated at 5.9% (5/85), while the case fatality rate was"
		"estimated at 25% (n = 5/20). Inconclusion, our results showed that mycotoxicosis"
		are considered an important risks factor for colic cases development in equine
		practice.

PG	-	43-7
AB	-	"Despite a number of recent advances in diagnosis and treatment strategies, fungal"
		infections remain an important cause of morbidity and mortality in neutropenic
		and immunosuppressed patients. The main fungal infections are candidosis and
		"aspergillosis, although an increased incidence of rarer fungal infections"
		"including Fusarium spp., Aurebasidium pullulans and Mucor spp. has been noted."
		Mortality may be decreased with earlier diagnosis and aggressive treatment with
		lipid-associated amphotericin B. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) in the
		neutropenic host presents particular challenges in terms of diagnosis and
		therapy. We undertook a prospective study over a 36 month period to link the
		status of early diagnosis and early aggressive therapy with lipid-associated
		amphotericin B. Early investigation comprised the use of bronchoscopy and
		bronchoalveolar lavage together with real-time PCR to detect Aspergillus spp.
		This combined approach revealed the incidence of proven or probable IPA to be
		19%. Early therapy resulted in no mortality from IPA. In treating the rarer
		"fungal species, AmBisome was found to be the most effective agent, and could be"
		used at doses of up to 12 mg/kg with few side effects.

PG	-	1027-30
AB	-	"Keratitis, inflammation of the cornea, can result in partial or total loss of"
		"vision and can result from infectious agents (e.g., microbes including bacteria,"
		"fungi, amebae, and viruses) or from noninfectious causes (e.g., eye trauma,"
		"chemical exposure, and ultraviolet exposure). Contact lens wear is the major risk"
		factor for microbial keratitis; outbreaks of Fusarium and Acanthamoeba keratitis
		"have been associated with contact lens multipurpose solution use, and poor"
		"contact lens hygiene is a major risk factor for a spectrum of eye complications,"
		including microbial keratitis and other contact lens-related inflammation.
		"However, the overall burden and the epidemiology of keratitis in the United"
		States have not been well described. To estimate the incidence and cost of
		"keratitis, national ambulatory-care and emergency department databases were"
		"analyzed. The results of this analysis showed that an estimated 930,000 doctor's"
		"office and outpatient clinic visits and 58,000 emergency department visits for"
		keratitis or contact lens disorders occur annually; 76.5% of keratitis visits
		result in antimicrobial prescriptions. Episodes of keratitis and contact lens
		"disorders cost an estimated $175 million in direct health care expenditures,"
		including $58 million for Medicare patients and $12 million for Medicaid patients
		"each year. Office and outpatient clinic visits occupied over 250,000 hours of"
		clinician time annually. Developing effective prevention messages that are
		disseminated to contact lens users and investigation of additional preventive
		efforts are important measures to reduce the national incidence of microbial
		keratitis.

LID	-	1012334
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a form of cancer that is
		"characterized by infiltration of the bone marrow, blood, and other tissues by"
		"proliferative, clonal, abnormally differentiated, and occasionally poorly"
		differentiated cells of the hematopoietic system. Patients with acute myeloid
		leukemia (AML) receiving azacitidine (AZA) alone or in combination with
		venetoclax (VEN-AZA) are at increased risk for invasive fungal infections (IFIs).
		We compared the incidence and risk of IFI during these treatment regimens in a
		single Taiwan hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 61 patients with AML
		received at least one course of AZA in the hematology ward of China Medical
		"University Hospital (Taichung, Taiwan) between September 2012 and June 2020."
		Thirty-eight patients (62.3%) received AZA monotherapy; 23 (37.7%) received
		"VEN-AZA. RESULTS: Incidence rates of probable and proven IFI were 18% and 1.6%,"
		"respectively, during AZA treatment. One proven case of Fusarium spp. infection"
		was isolated by skin and soft tissue culture. Most (75%) IFI cases occurred
		during the first cycle of AZA therapy. Half of all IFI cases occurred in patients
		with prolonged neutropenia. The risk of IFI was significantly higher for the
		European LeukemiaNet (ELN) nonfavorable-risk group (intermediate- and
		adverse-risk group) versus the ELN favorable-risk group and for patients with
		prolonged neutropenia versus those without (P<0.05 for both comparisons). In this
		"study, median OS did not differ significantly between patients with and without"
		IFIs during AZA-containing regimens (14.6 months vs 13.7 months; P=0.59).
		CONCLUSION: The incidence of IFI was high in this AML cohort treated with
		AZA-containing regiments in Taiwan. The majority of IFI cases occurred during the
		early cycles of AZA (cycles 1-2). Prospective studies are needed to determine the
		optimal choice of antifungal prophylaxis agent during VEN-AZA therapy for AML.

AB	-	Fungal wound infections are increasing worldwide. The aim of this retrospective
		"study, conducted at the Aga Khan University laboratory, Karachi, Pakistan, was to"
		determine the frequency of fungal isolation in wound specimens. Data of wound
		samples received for culture from all over the country between September and
		October 2018 was reviewed. Samples were processed for bacterial cultures and
		"additionally inoculated on Sabouraud's dextrose medium. Demographic information,"
		medical history and information on the type of wound was collected. A total of
		"140 cases were included, of which 87 (81%) were culture positive, while 10 (7%)"
		cases yielded fungi. Burn and blast wounds had the highest proportion of fungal
		"isolation, i.e. 2 out of 4 (50%). Candida species were the most common fungi"
		"(n=4), followed by Fusarium species (n=3). This study reports an alarming rate of"
		fungal wound infections. As fungal necrotising wound infections have high
		"morbidity and mortality, it is, therefore, important to accurately diagnose and"
		treat such infections in local setting.

AB	-	Few estimates of fungal disease frequency have been attempted in the Middle East.
		We have estimated the burden of fungal infections in Qatar. The aim of the study
		"was to compute and determine the burden of serious fungal infections, in an"
		"attempt to estimate fungal disease frequency, which has not previously been"
		attempted in this country. Disease statistics were collected from the
		Microbiology laboratory database and from 2011 WHO statistics. The data are
		"expressed per 100,000 populations. The reported cases of candidaemia rose to 288"
		"with an estimated rate of 15.4/100,000. A real increase in the burden of"
		"candidaemia was found over that previously reported (12.9/100,000) for the years"
		"2004-2009. Candida peritonitis was estimated in 8.02 cases/100,000 population."
		"Recurrent (≥4 year(-1) ) vaginal infections affect at least 32,782 women with a"
		"rate of 3506/100,000 inhabitants. Severe asthma with fungal sensitisation"
		"affected 1486 people, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis 1126 people and"
		"chronic pulmonary aspergillosis 176 people. Rhinosinusitis, mucormycosis and"
		"Fusarium infection occurred at rates of 2.31, 1.23, 1.86 cases/100,000"
		respectively. The estimated rate of invasive aspergillosis was very low
		"(0.6/100,000). Low rates of Cryptococcus meningitis and Pneumocystis pneumonia"
		"are attributable to low HIV infection rates. In conclusion, fungal infections are"
		"increasingly reported, especially candidaemia. Surveillance and guidelines are"
		"needed to optimise care and management of common fungal infections. In addition,"
		a fungal registry system needs development for surveillance.

AB	-	PURPOSE: To evaluate the clinical and microbiological features of a large cohort
		with culture-confirmed fungal endophthalmitis across India. DESIGN:
		"Cross-sectional, hospital-based, retrospective medical record review."
		PARTICIPANTS: Seven large tertiary eye care centers from different regions of
		India. METHODS: Patient data were pooled from electronic or physical medical
		records of each participating center. Fellowship-trained vitreoretinal
		"specialists clinically managed all patients, and in-house microbiology"
		laboratories performed all microbiological workups. The clinical and
		microbiological procedures were broadly uniform across all participating centers.
		The essential treatment consisted of vitreous surgery as well as intravitreal and
		systemic therapies with antifungal agents. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical
		outcome of the causative event and causative fungus. RESULTS: In the period from
		"2005 to 2020, 7 centers treated 3830 cases of culture-proven endophthalmitis, and"
		"of these, 19.1% (n = 730) were cases of culture-confirmed fungal endophthalmitis."
		"It included 46.9% cases of postoperative (87.4% postcataract surgery), 35.6% of"
		"traumatic, and 17.5% of endogenous endophthalmitis. The fungi included 39.0% of"
		"Aspergillus (high prevalence in central, east, and south zones), 15.1% of Candida"
		"(high prevalence in west zone), and 15.9% of Fusarium (high prevalence in north"
		and west zones). The time to symptom development was between 1 week and 4 weeks
		"in more than one third of the patients, except in patients with traumatic"
		endophthalmitis. Less than half of the patients had hypopyon on presentation. The
		presenting visual acuity (PVA) in most patients was <20/400. Nearly all patients
		needed vitrectomy and an average of 2 intravitreal injections of antifungal
		"agents. At least 10% of eyes needed therapeutic keratoplasty, and up to 7% of"
		"eyes were eviscerated. After treatment, the final (best corrected) visual acuity"
		"(FVA) was >20/400 in 30.5% (n = 222) of eyes and >20/40 in 7.9% (n = 58) of eyes,"
		and 12% (n = 88) of eyes lost light perception. A post hoc analysis showed the
		male sex to be significantly more associated with traumatic endophthalmitis than
		"with postoperative (P < 0.0001) and endogenous (P = 0.001) endophthalmitis, more"
		isolation of Candida species in patients with endogenous endophthalmitis than in
		"those with postoperative (P = 0.004) and traumatic (P < 0.0001) endophthalmitis,"
		"better PVA in eyes with Candida species infection (P < 0.0001), and poorer FVA in"
		eyes with Aspergillus species infection. CONCLUSIONS: Fungal endophthalmitis is
		not uncommon in India. The inclusion of antifungal agents with antibiotics as the
		first empirical intravitreal therapy before microbiological confirmation should
		be considered when a fungal infection is suspected.

AB	-	"OBJECTIVE: To describe the incidence, clinical progress, visual outcome, and"
		laboratory findings of equine keratomycosis in Japan. PROCEDURE:  Retrospective
		study of the medical records of horses clinically and mycologically diagnosed
		with keratomycosis at the Equine Hospitals of the Japan Racing Association from
		2005 to 2011. RESULTS: The diagnosis of keratomycosis was confirmed in eight
		horses (40.0% of the 20 horses with infectious keratitis from which fungi and/or
		bacteria were isolated). Fungi recovered from corneal swabs were identified as
		"Aspergillus flavus (4), Aspergillus niger (1), Fusarium solani (1), and"
		Mortierella wolfii (2). All horses were treated medically with topical
		"antifungals, and one horse was also treated surgically. The median of treatment"
		period was 40 days. Two horses were rendered blind in the affected eye and the
		others retained vision. CONCLUSIONS: Equine keratomycosis comprises a
		"considerable portion of infectious keratitis in Japan, and the causative fungi"
		that we isolated had been isolated previously from horses with keratomycosis in
		other regions with the exception of M. wolfii. Culture and cytological
		examination of corneal lesions should be immediately performed on eyes with signs
		"of keratitis, particularly on those not improving with antibacterial medication,"
		as early initiation of aggressive antifungal treatment tended to result in better
		outcome and shorter treatment period.

AB	-	"PURPOSE: To determine the seasonality, clinical profile, and treatment outcome of"
		Fusarium keratitis. METHODS: A retrospective medical chart review of 97 patients
		with culture-proven Fusarium keratitis at a tertiary eye care institution from
		January 2018 to December 2019. RESULTS: The median (SD) age at enrollment was
		44.6 (16) years; 75 (79.8%) of them were male. Presence of infiltrate less than 4
		mm(2) at baseline indicated 4.4 times the odds of achieving final BCVA more than
		20/60 (95% CI: 1.4-13.3; P=0.008). The absence of surgical management indicated
		8.1 times the odds of achieving final BCVA of more than 20/60 (95% CI: 0.9-71.5;
		"P = 0.06). The visual acuity at presentation, duration between symptoms and"
		"presentation, history of ocular trauma, previous use of topical medications, and"
		presence of hypopyon were not identified as significant predictors of final BCVA
		in the multivariable regression analysis. CONCLUSION: Smaller infiltrate size and
		absence of surgical management are the significant predictors of good visual
		"outcome. Visual outcome of Fusarium keratitis is poor, and a significant number"
		of patients did not respond to anti-fungal therapy and had to undergo surgeries.
		"To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest case series on Fusarium"
		keratitis to date.

PG	-	331-5
LID	-	10.1097/ICL.0b013e318235c5af [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To report a case of multidrug-resistant Fusarium sp keratitis that
		progressed to endophthalmitis and that eventually required enucleation. METHODS:
		Case report and literature review. Isolate identification and susceptibility
		"testing were performed by the Fungus Testing Laboratory at San Antonio, TX."
		RESULTS: A 52-year-old soft contact lens wearer had a corneal abrasion and
		developed a corneal infiltrate. Examination of corneal scrapings revealed
		filamentous hyphae with septation and conidia. Despite aggressive antifungal
		"therapy with topical natamycin, amphotericin B, and systemic fluconazole, the"
		"keratitis progressed, and a penetrating keratoplasty was performed."
		Histopathologic analysis of the corneal button showed disruption of Descemet's
		membrane with periodic acid-Schiff-positive fungal hyphae on both sides.
		Recurrent infection of the graft and progression to endophthalmitis was treated
		"with repeated intravitreal amphotericin B injections, repeat penetrating"
		"keratoplasties, and pars plana vitrectomies. Even after systemic use of"
		"itraconazole, voriconazole, and posaconazole and topical use of voriconazole, the"
		infection progressed and an enucleation was required. Isolate identification and
		susceptibility testing found a multidrug-resistant Fusarium solani species
		"complex, partially sensitive to natamycin only. CONCLUSIONS: Multidrug-resistant"
		Fusarium sp is rare and may have devastating consequences in patients with
		advanced keratitis progressing to endophthalmitis. Such an extensive multidrug
		resistance is surprising in that resistance to antifungal treatment is supposedly
		rare. Empirical antifungal therapy is usually instituted using one or more
		"antifungal agents, without checking antifungal sensitivities. In light of the"
		"growing concern for increased emergence of resistant strains, we propose a lower"
		threshold to check for sensitivities in the face of unresponsive fungal
		infections.

LID	-	10.1016/j.transproceed.2014.07.056 [doi]
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Fungal infections, although less frequent than bacterial infections,"
		represent a severe comorbidity with an exponential increase in mortality rate in
		liver transplantation patients. The incidence of invasive fungal infections
		"(IFIs) after solid organ transplantation ranges from 7% to 42%, with Candida spp."
		and Aspergillus spp. as the most common pathogens. Fungal infections in liver
		transplant recipients have been associated with poor outcome and mortality rates
		ranging from 65% to 90% for invasive aspergillosis and 30% to 50% for invasive
		candidiasis. The results largely depend on early diagnosis and early initiation
		"of specific treatment for IFIs. Therefore, the diagnosis must be prompt,"
		"preferably based on microbiological data, both cultures and biomarkers, and/or"
		based on clinical features and known risk factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This
		study evaluated the incidence of fungal infections in patients after liver
		transplantation in our center between January 2003 and December 2012. The
		retrospective analysis of 215 consecutive liver transplantation patients was
		"undertaken to estimate incidence, risk factors, and clinical courses of IFIs in"
		the first 3 months after liver transplantation. RESULTS: Candidemia and invasive
		"candidiasis microbiologically proven were found in 26 patients (12%), whereas in"
		6 patients (2.8%) invasive fungal infections from other non-Candida fungi
		"developed: Aspergillus (4 cases: 2 A fumigatus, 2 A terreus), Fusarium oxysporum"
		"(1 case), and Rhodotorula rubra (1 case). Two patients with Aspergillus and the"
		patient with Fusarium died. The patient with Rhodotorula as well as 22 of the
		patients with candidemia (85%) survived. All of the episodes developed during the
		first 3 months posttransplantation. All cases have followed a previous
		polymicrobial bacterial infection (especially in the biliary tract) with large
		use of combined antibiotic therapies. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of fungal infection
		was found to increase in parallel with the number of risk factors. Prophylactic
		strategies can decrease the risk of fungal infections. Early detection and
		treatment with adequate early empiric therapy is the key to obtaining a better
		outcome in liver transplantation patients.

TI	-	Detection of circulating DNA for the diagnosis of invasive fusariosis:
		retrospective analysis of 15 proven cases.
LID	-	myac049 [pii]
LID	-	10.1093/mmy/myac049 [doi]
AB	-	Fusarium spp. are plant pathogens and opportunistic pathogens in severely
		"immunocompromised (hematological malignancy, neutropenia, solid organ"
		"transplantation, etc.) and severely burned patients. Invasive fusariosis often"
		disseminates and mortality remains high partly due to delayed diagnosis in the
		absence of a positive culture. The aim of our study is to design a quantitative
		PCR (qPCR) assay and evaluate the detection of Fusarium spp. DNA for early
		diagnosis of invasive infection. A qPCR assay was designed and optimized to
		identify all Fusarium species complex and secondarily evaluated on patient
		samples. A total of 81 blood samples from 15 patients diagnosed with proven
		invasive fusariosis from 9 centers in France were retrospectively tested.
		Circulating DNA was detected in 14 patients out of 15 (sensitivity of 93% [95%
		"Confidence Interval (CI95), 70.1-99.7]). Detection was possible up to 18 days"
		(median 6 days) before the diagnosis was confirmed by positive blood culture or
		biopsy. By comparison serum galactomannan and ß-D-glucan were positive in 7.1 and
		58.3% of patients respectively. qPCR was negative for all patients with other
		invasive fungal diseases (IFD) tested (n = 12) and IFD-free control patients
		(n = 40). No cross-reactions were detected using DNA extracted from 81 other
		opportunistic fungi. We developed and validated a pan-Fusarium qPCR assay in
		"serum/plasma with high sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility that could"
		facilitate early diagnosis and treatment monitoring of invasive fusariosis. LAY
		ABSTRACT: Fusariosis ranks third among invasive mould infections. It is
		frequently diagnosed late due to the lack of specific tools. We designed and
		evaluated a new qPCR assay with high sensitivity and specificity allowing
		detection of Fusarium DNA in serum samples up to 18 days before conventional
		diagnosis.

TI	-	Update on fungal keratitis in France: a case-control study.
PG	-	159-163
LID	-	10.1111/aos.14910 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: To report an epidemiological update of documented fungal keratitis (FK)
		in a French tertiary ophthalmological centre from 2014 to 2018 in comparison with
		a previous period from 1993 to 2008. METHODS: Sixty-two consecutive FK documented
		by microbiological corneal scrapings were compared with the 64 FK of the previous
		study. Amphotericin B and voriconazole eye drops were administered hourly.
		"Population characteristics, clinical findings, aetiological organisms and"
		treatments were analysed. RESULTS: The most frequently identified fungi were
		"Fusarium (61%), Aspergillus (6.5%) and Candida (5%). Thirty out of 44 cases"
		examined with in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) presented filaments. Ten
		"required conventional cross-linking, 9 therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty, and"
		2 enucleation. Risk factors significantly associated with the absence of response
		"to medical treatment were patient age (p = 0.01), presence of a deep stromal"
		infiltrate at presentation (p = 0.04) and high numbers of filaments in IVCM
		"images (p = 0.01). The two populations were comparable in age, but not in sex"
		ratio males/females (18/44 versus 37/26 in the previous study; p = 0.001). The
		frequency of contact lens-associated infection increased from 35.5% to 71%
		"(p = 0.0001) between the two periods. Since then, filamentous FK increased from"
		69% (44/64) to 95% (59/62) (p = 0.0001). A history of keratoplasty was less
		frequently reported during the last period (3.2% (2/62) versus 17% (11/64) of
		cases (p = 0.01)). A clear decrease in the frequency of therapeutic keratoplasty
		was noted from 39% (25/64) to 14% (9/62) (p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: The frequency of
		filamentous keratomycosis is currently increasing. Elderly patients and the
		presence of numerous filaments in IVCM are associated with poor clinical
		outcomes.

TI	-	Fungal Infections After Boston Type 1 Keratoprosthesis Implantation: Literature
		Review and In Vitro Antifungal Activity of Hypochlorous Acid.
PG	-	1599-605
LID	-	10.1097/ICO.0000000000000639 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: To review the current literature describing cases of fungal keratitis
		and endophthalmitis after Boston keratoprosthesis (KPro) implantation and to
		characterize the antifungal activity of 0.01% hypochlorous acid against medically
		relevant fungi. METHODS: A literature review of fungal keratitis or
		"endophthalmitis in KPro patients from January 2001 to April 2015, and an in vitro"
		time kill assay characterizing the fungicidal activity of 0.01% hypochlorous acid
		"against fungi causing ocular infections. RESULTS: Fifteen publications,"
		"predominantly retrospective case series, were identified. Infection rates after"
		KPro implantation ranged from 0.009 to 0.02 fungal infections per patient-year of
		follow-up. The largest single-surgeon series reported an incidence of 2.4% for
		fungal endophthalmitis during a 10-year period. Causative organisms included both
		yeasts and molds. Outcomes were favorable if infections were caught early and
		treated appropriately; less favorable outcomes were reported in developing
		countries where fungal species are endemic and resources are limited. 0.01%
		"hypochlorous acid is rapidly fungicidal, reducing the number of viable yeast"
		cells or mold conidia by at least 99.99% within 60 seconds. The antifungal
		"activity extended to all molds (Acremonium kiliense, Aspergillus flavus,"
		"Aspergillus fumigatus, Fusarium solani, and Mucor indicus) and yeast species"
		(Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis) tested. CONCLUSIONS: Fungal
		infections remain a lifelong concern in patients after KPro implantation. There
		"is a growing need for a standard antifungal prophylaxis regimen, especially in"
		the developing world. The rapid broad-spectrum in vitro fungicidal activity of
		0.01% hypochlorous acid against all fungi tested makes it an attractive candidate
		as an antifungal prophylaxis in KPro patients.

AB	-	PURPOSE: To categorize vitrectomy cytologic diagnoses and ancillary tests to
		address appropriate processing of low-volume vitreous samples. DESIGN:
		Retrospective case series. PARTICIPANTS: Five thousand seven hundred thirty-six
		vitreous samples. METHODS: Cytologic diagnoses of therapeutic and diagnostic
		vitrectomy samples and their processing protocols from 3 teaching institutions
		were reviewed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Diagnostic results were categorized as
		"negative for malignancy, suspicious for malignancy, and positive for malignancy."
		"All ancillary studies performed were documented, including special stains,"
		"immunohistochemistry analysis, cytokine levels, and polymerase chain reaction"
		"(PCR) analysis. RESULTS: Of the 5736 vitreous samples analyzed, 4683 (81.64%)"
		"were from Tufts Medical Center (TMC), 955 (16.65%) were from Boston Medical"
		"Center (BMC), and 98 (1.70%) were from Massachusetts Eye Research and Surgery"
		Institution (MERSI). Cases from TMC and BMC were therapeutic and diagnostic
		"vitrectomies, and MERSI cases were diagnostic vitrectomies. Most vitrectomies"
		"showed negative results for malignancy: 99.47% of TMC cases, 99.89% of BMC cases,"
		and 79.6% of MERSI cases. These included vitreous hemorrhage and inflammatory or
		infectious findings. Ancillary studies performed in this category included
		"Periodic Acid-Schiff staining for fungi, PCR analysis for toxoplasmosis,"
		"cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), herpes simplex virus I and II, and"
		"vitreous cultures for infections (coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Candida,"
		"Fusarium, and Propionibacterium species). Interleukin (IL) 10-to-IL-6 ratios were"
		performed on 38.7% of cases from MERSI. Fourteen cases from TMC were suspicious
		"for malignancy based on cytologic evaluation. Eleven cases from TMC, 1 case from"
		"BMC, and 20 cases from MERSI showed positive results for malignancy and included"
		"B-cell lymphoma, retinoblastoma, melanoma, and metastatic adenocarcinoma. The"
		ancillary testing included PCR for heavy chain immunoglobulin gene
		"rearrangements, immunohistochemistry for EBV, in situ hybridization for κ and λ"
		"light chains, and cytogenetics. CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest data pool of"
		reported cytologic diagnoses of diagnostic and therapeutic vitrectomy samples.
		Cytologic evaluation of therapeutic vitrectomy samples provides a valuable
		baseline of nonpathologic findings that assist in differentiation between
		"malignancy, infections, and inflammatory conditions. Allocation of small-volume"
		vitreous samples to select ancillary testing from the plethora of available
		diagnostic tests requires preoperative communication between surgeons and
		pathologists to ensure appropriate and timely treatment methods.

AB	-	Fungal endophthalmitis is a potentially blinding condition. It is more often
		"reported from Asia, including India. The incidence is lower than bacterial"
		endophthalmitis. But it is relatively more challenging to treat than bacterial
		endophthalmitis. Many eyes may need therapeutic keratoplasty and/or evisceration.
		The current mainstays of treatment are vitrectomy irrespective of the presenting
		"vision, intravitreal antifungal agents, and systemic therapy; additionally, the"
		patients could require prolonged treatment with repeat vitreous surgeries and
		"intravitreal injections. Difficulty in clinical diagnosis, delay in"
		"microbiological culture, and limited options of antifungal drugs make the"
		treatment more difficult and less rewarding. Three common fungi causing
		"endophthalmitis are Aspergillus, Fusarium, and Candida. The former two are molds,"
		"often identified in exogenous endophthalmitis, postoperative and traumatic; the"
		latter is yeast and is more often identified in endogenous endophthalmitis. A
		faster diagnosis with newer molecular microbiological technologies might help
		institute treatment earlier than it is currently possible. A target trial using
		big data from different regions of the world might emulate a randomized clinical
		"trial to design a definite treatment strategy. Given fewer antifungal drugs, one"
		must be mindful of antifungal stewardship to prevent resistance to the existing
		drugs.

TI	-	Identification and molecular characterization of Subramaniula asteroides causing
		human fungal keratitis: a case report.
PG	-	82
LID	-	10.1186/s12879-021-05768-7 [doi]
LID	-	82
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Keratitis due to by filamentous fungi are not easy to diagnose thus
		causing a delay in correct therapy. There are many descriptions of keratitis due
		"to Candida, Fusarium and Aspergillus genera. Subramaniula genus has only recently"
		been reported to cause human infections and there are few descriptions of eye
		infections due to this filamentous fungus. Diagnosis of fungal keratitis is
		usually based on microscopic and cultural techniques of samples obtained by
		corneal swabbing or scraping. Considering the amount of time required to obtain
		"culture results it is wise to use other diagnostic methods, such as molecular"
		analyses. Therapeutic options against these fungi are limited by low tissue
		penetration in the eye due to ocular barriers. We describe the first case of S.
		asteroides human keratitis treated with isavuconazole. CASE PRESENTATION: We
		describe a rare case of fungal keratitis unresponsive to antimicrobial treatment
		in a 65-year-old male patient without a history of diabetes or immunological
		diseases. He reported that the onset of symptoms occurred during a long holiday
		in Cape Verde Island. Initial treatment with topical antibiotics associated to
		"steroids were ineffective, allowing a slow clinical progression of disease to"
		"corneal perforation. On admission in our Hospital, slit-lamp examination of the"
		"left eye showed conjunctival congestion and hyperemia, a large inferior corneal"
		"ulceration with brown pigment, corneal edema, about 3 mm of hypopyon and"
		irido-lenticular synechiae. The slow clinical progression of the disease to
		corneal perforation and the aspect of the ulcer were consistent with a mycotic
		etiology. Molecular methods used on fungal colonies isolated by Sabouraud's
		dextrose agar cultures allowed the identification of Subramaniula asteroids from
		corneal scraping. Antimicrobial test showed a good susceptibility of this
		"filamentous fungus to voriconazole and isavuconazole. Moreover, this fungal"
		"keratitis was successfully treated with isavuconazole, without side effects,"
		observing a progressive clinical improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular methods may
		be useful for the identification of filamentous fungal keratitis on scraping
		samples thus shortening the time of diagnosis. Systemic therapy by isavuconazole
		"could be useful to treat the filamentous fungal keratitis, reducing the possible"
		adverse effects due to the use of voriconazole by systemic administration.

TI	-	Fusariosis: An Invasive Fungal Disease in a Neutropenic Patient With Acute
		Myeloid Leukemia.
PG	-	e29303
LID	-	10.7759/cureus.29303 [doi]
LID	-	e29303
AB	-	Although rare in the U.S invasive Fusariosis (IF) is increasingly being
		recognized as a cause of severe invasive fungal disease in patients with
		neutropenia in the setting of hematologic malignancy and hematopoietic stem cell
		"transplants (HSCT). IF in these patients is associated with high mortality,"
		"moreover there are no guidelines on effective therapy, thus early diagnosis and"
		involvement of an expert with experience in treating Fusariosis are imperative.
		We present a case of IF in a patient with profound prolonged neutropenia in the
		"setting of chemotherapy for relapsed, refractory acute myeloid leukemia. A"
		33-year-old woman with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was hospitalized for
		re-induction chemotherapy. Five days post cycle 1 she became neutropenic. She was
		"treated with prophylactic antimicrobials that included acyclovir, levofloxacin,"
		and Posaconazole. On day sixty she began to run a high-grade fever. The physical
		exam was remarkable for a temperature of 102 degrees Fahrenheit and a heart rate
		"of 116 beats per minute. Complete blood count was remarkable for 130 WBC/ml, Hb"
		"6.5 g/dl, hematocrit (HCT) 18.7%, 13000 platelets/ml, absolute neutrophils counts"
		(ANC) of 0. Her CT chest showed new bilateral lung nodules. Antibiotics were
		"changed to cefepime, vancomycin, and metronidazole on day sixty-two without"
		response. On day sixty-five meropenem was started and cefepime stopped. On day
		sixty-eight posaconazole was stopped and amphotericin B was started and two days
		later fever became low grade. She developed hyperpigmented skin lesions with
		necrotic centers on extremities that were biopsied. Histopathology staining
		favored the presence of rare fungal hyphae. The culture of the biopsy sample grew
		Fusarium spp that was identified by DNA sequencing as Fusarium falciforme.
		Voriconazole and terbinafine were added. Her fevers resolved within the next 24
		hours and she remained afebrile. Fusarium is a hyaline mold present in the
		"environment. Infection is acquired by inoculation into the skin, intravascular"
		"devices, or inhalation. IF incidence is low in the United States. F. solani and"
		F. oxysporum are the most predominant disease-causing species complexes. Invasive
		Fusariosis (IF) is a rare disease seen in patients with hematologic malignancy
		and hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT) with profound
		neutropenia. Immunocompromised patients suffer disseminated disease to multiple
		"sites as in this case, with mortality rates of between sixty to eighty percent in"
		this patient population. Blood and skin lesions biopsy cultures are diagnostic.
		Blood cultures are positive in up to sixty percent of cases in about four days.
		Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can identify Fusarium but species identification
		by PCR is difficult. Newer molecular methods are better for species
		identification. Histopathology can be helpful. Differential diagnoses include
		"invasive aspergillosis (IA), mucormycosis, mycobacterial and dimorphic fungal"
		infections. There are no guidelines for standard therapy. Amphotericin B or
		voriconazole are preferred. Combination therapy may be indicated. Neutrophil
		recovery is crucial. Adjunctive and preventive measures have roles.

PG	-	565-71
AB	-	Molds are quite more often suspected as pathogens by the public than by the
		"medical care community. Molds may, however, cause serious medical problems, and"
		mold infections can develop incognito. Among the mycoses caused by opportunistic
		"molds, alternariosis and fusariosis together with aspergillosis are of particular"
		importance. They are more common than other groups with pathological
		characteristics. The aim of our presentation is to demonstrate the important role
		of common molds as causative agents in skin and ear infections. The clinical
		"picture, etiology and pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment, and course and"
		prognosis of cutaneous infections will be given. The spectrum of clinical
		"symptoms ranges from eczemalike lesions to chronic erythematous, verrucous"
		"lesions of the skin or multiple acute infiltrations of the dermis, occasionally"
		"forming abscesses. The mycologic direct preparation of the specimens,"
		"particularly with optical brighteners, and a histological examination of a skin"
		biopsy are strongly recommended. The outbreak of cutaneous infections is
		triggered by weakened host defense mechanisms. A review of the literature
		regarding immunosuppressed and immunocompetent patients will be given.

AB	-	Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is a life-saving procedure for the
		"treatment of many end-stage diseases, but infectious and acute rejection episodes"
		remain major causes of morbidity and mortality. Bacterial and fungal infections
		"can be due to intra-abdominal, biliary, respiratory, urinary, wound, central"
		venous catheters (CVC) or unknown sources. Using the computerized database of our
		"microbiology laboratory, we analyzed all the bacterial and fungal infections in"
		the first three months following OLT among 151 consecutive adult recipients at
		"single center between January 2005 and December 2011. Samples included blood,"
		"bile CVC, urine, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimen. Culture and"
		identification of the isolated microorganisms was done in accordance with
		standard microbiological procedures. Three hundred thirteen samples from the
		"above sites showed positive results for gram-positive cocci (n = 137; 43.8%),"
		"gram-negative rods (n = 156; 49.8%), and Candida species (n = 19; 6.1%). One"
		patient (0.3%) experienced a CVC-related infection caused by Fusarium oxysporum.
		Bacterial and particularly biliary tract infections seem to play major roles in
		morbidity and mortality in the first three months following OLT. The major
		contributors to patient morbidity and mortality were candidemia and/or invasive
		candidiasis mainly from the biliary tract and/or CVC-related infections.

		disease.
PG	-	52-7
LID	-	10.1016/j.mycmed.2011.12.079 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: Fungal infection presents a serious risk to individuals with
		compromised immune systems. Chronic granulomatous disease is a primary
		immunodeficiency with X-linked or autosomal recessive inheritance. Patients with
		CGD are predisposed to bacterial and fungal infections. The aim of this study was
		"to determine the incidence of fungal infections, identify the most common fungal"
		"pathogens, and determine the risk factors associated with fungal infections and"
		mortality in patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). MATERIAL AND
		METHODS: We reviewed retrospectively 12 patients with CGD in the period of
		1995-2008. All of the patients were suspected to fungal infections. The data was
		gathered from the medical records of all patients as having CGD. Twelve patients
		had adequate medical records to enter the study. The diagnostic of fungal
		"infections were confirmed by histopathology and direct preparation, culture"
		"techniques, histopathology of surgical biopsies, and radiological examination of"
		the affected site. RESULTS: We evaluated 12 cases of chronic granulomatosis.
		"Patients that are susceptible to recurrent, sever infections. Patients consisted"
		of seven males and five females. The median age of patients at the time of the
		study was 11.66 years (3 to18). Neutrophil oxidative burst were absent (NBT=0) in
		all patients. Fungal infections were confirmed in five patients (41/7%) by
		histology and mycological methods. The most common isolated fungi in this study
		"were Aspergillus spp. Out of five cases of fungal infections identified, tree"
		"were Aspergillus spp, and two Fusarium spp. The most common manifestations of CGD"
		"due to fungal infections (in descending order) were osteomyelitis (42.8%),"
		"pulmonary infections (28.6%), lymphadenopathy (14.3%) and skin involvement"
		(14.3%) during their illness. CONCLUSION: Invasive fungal infections are a
		frequent and life-threatening complication in CGD patients. The lungs and
		"skeletal, were the most commonly affected organ; however, lymphatic, and skin"
		involvement have also been described. Our present study showed that fusariosis
		also is a threat to CGD patients.

AB	-	"PURPOSE: Fusarium, Aspergillus, and Dematiaceous are the most common fungal"
		species causing keratitis in tropical countries. Herein we report a prospective
		study on fungal keratitis caused by these three fungal species. METHODOLOGY: A
		prospective investigation was undertaken to evaluate eyes with presumed fungal
		keratitis. All the fungal isolates (n = 73) obtained from keratitis infections
		were identified using morphological and microscopic characters. Molecular
		identification using sequencing of the ITS region and antifungal susceptibility
		tests using microdilution method were done. The final clinical outcome was
		evaluated in terms of the time taken for resolution of keratitis and the final
		visual outcome. The results were analyzed after segregating the cases into three
		"groups, namely, Fusarium, Aspergillus, and Dematiaceous keratitis. RESULTS:"
		Diagnosis of fungal keratitis was established in 73 (35.9%) cases out of 208
		"cases. The spectra of fungi isolated were Fusarium spp. (26.6%), Aspergillus spp."
		"(21.6%), and Dematiaceous fungi (11.6%). The sequence of the ITS region could"
		"identify the Fusarium and Aspergillus species at the species complex level, and"
		the Dematiaceous isolates were accurately identified. Using antifungal agents
		"such as fluconazole, natamycin, amphotericin B, and itraconazole, the minimum"
		"inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for Fusarium spp. were >32  μ g/mL, 4-8  μ g/mL,"
		"0.5-1  μ g/mL, and >32  μ g/mL, respectively. Antifungal susceptibility data"
		showed that Curvularia spp. was highly resistant to all the antifungal agents.
		"Overall, natamycin and amphotericin B were found to be the most effective"
		antifungal agents. The comparative clinical outcomes in all cases showed that the
		healing response in terms of visual acuity of the Dematiaceous group was
		significantly good when compared with the Fusarium and Aspergillus groups (P <
		0.05). The time required for healing in the Fusarium group was statistically
		significantly less when compared with the Aspergillus and Dematiaceous groups.
		CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates important differences in microscopic features
		of scraping material and antifungal susceptibility between the three groups.
		"Early and accurate identification coupled with the MIC data, and thereby"
		appropriate treatment is crucial for complete recovery.

		development. Thirty-six of 240 patients (13%) developed at least one proven or
		probable IFD. Seventy-eight percent of the proven or probable IFDs were due to
		Candida or Aspergillus species. Infection due to Fusarium and Mucorales was
		uncommon. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of <500 µL/L at the start of induction
		was associated with an increased risk of IFD. One hundred and eighty-seven
		"patients (78%) were started on systemic antifungal drugs, even without"
		microbiologic evidence of an IFD. IFDs remain frequent in AML patients undergoing

PG	-	603-8
AB	-	Diabetes mellitus affects all socioeconomic and age groups and its incidence is
		rapidly increasing worldwide. The diabetic foot complication represents one of
		the most complex and serious complications in these patients. Fungal infections
		can also contribute to the severity of the diabetic foot. The aim of the present
		study was to evaluate the prevalence of foot skin and toenail mycosis in a group
		of 75 patients with diabetic foot complication and in a matched control group.
		Diabetic patients showed onychomycosis in 53.3% and foot skin mycosis in 46.7% of
		"the cases, with a prevalence of both fungal infections significantly higher than"
		that observed in the control group. At least one type of these fungal infections
		was present in 69.3% of diabetic subjects with a highly significant difference
		compared to control group (P<0.001). Trichophyton rubrum and Trichophyton
		interdigitale were the most common species responsible of both nail and skin
		"infections. Candida spp, Fusarium spp, Aspergillus spp and other moulds. were"
		found in about 1/3 onychomycosis. Previous toe amputation was significantly
		associated with both skin and nail mycosis. The present study confirms that both
		tinea pedis and onychomycosis have a high prevalence in subjects suffering from
		"diabetic foot complication, and that the problem of fungal infections of the foot"
		"in diabetic subjects is still highly underestimated. Consequently, there is an"
		important clinical rationale for careful mycological examination of diabetic foot
		and an adequate treatment tailored for each individual patient according to the
		fungal species involved.

AB	-	PURPOSE: To study the clinical profile and management of a case of fungal
		postoperative endophthalmitis caused by fusarium solani. CASE REPORT: A
		40-year-old male underwent an uneventful cataract surgery developed postoperative
		endophthalmitis. The infection was fulminant and was treated aggressively with
		pars plana vitrectomy with intravitreal and oral antifungals. The microbiology
		culture of vitreous sample showed fusarium solani. There was a late recurrence in
		the form of a fungal ball behind the iris after 6 months of the initial episode.
		This fungal ball was then managed by transscleral cryotherapy. The eye became
		hypotonus due to chronic inflammation and silicone oil was instilled to salvage
		the eye. CONCLUSION: Fusarium endophthalmitis needs an aggressive management. Due
		to late recurrence regular follow-up is mandatory. Early vitrectomy with oral and
		intravitreal voriconazole is the treatment of choice. Transscleral cryotherapy is
		a useful option to treat fungal balls behind the iris tissue.

TI	-	Invasive fungal sinusitis in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation.
PG	-	203-8
AB	-	Invasive fungal sinusitis is becoming increasingly common in patients undergoing
		"BMT. This study was undertaken to evaluate the incidence, presenting symptoms,"
		"diagnosis procedures, treatment and outcome of invasive fungal sinusitis. The"
		study population comprised 423 consecutive BMT patients at Hadassah University
		Hospital from January 1986 to August 1992. Eleven patients (2.6%) developed
		"invasive fungal sinusitis, 8 had underlying hematologic malignancies and 3 severe"
		aplastic anemia (SAA). Median interval between BMT and fungal sinusitis was 22.5
		days (range 2-106 days). Eight of 11 patients had protracted neutropenia (median
		8 days with median neutrophil count at the time of fungal sinusitis diagnosis of
		0.25 x 10(9)/l). Four patients developed GVHD before fungal sinusitis was
		"diagnosed. Presenting symptoms were fever (100%), orbital swelling (63%), facial"
		pain (54%) and nasal congestion (36%). In 8 patients Aspergillus species were
		"isolated (A. flavus in 7, A. quadrilineatus in 1); in 1 patient Candida albicans"
		was isolated and in the other 2 fungal elements were detected histologically
		"(Fusarium and Mucor, respectively). Six of the patients underwent surgical"
		debridement at diagnosis. Three received granulocyte transfusions. All patients
		received systemic amphotericin B (7 conventional and 4 amphotericin B colloidal
		dispersion (ABCD)). Only 2 of the 11 patients responded completely to therapy
		with a follow-up of 15 months. It appears that invasive fungal sinusitis is a
		potentially fatal complication in immunocompromised patients post-BMT. Current
		treatment approaches are largely ineffective and new methods of management of
		this serious problem are needed.

		single-centre study.
PG	-	2899-905
LID	-	10.1093/jac/dkv198 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: Invasive mould sinusitis (IMS) is a severe infection in patients with
		haematological malignancies. Because of a paucity of contemporaneous data about
		"IMS, we sought to evaluate clinical aspects and outcome of IMS in these patients."
		METHODS: The records of adult haematological malignancy patients with proven or
		probable IMS over a 10 year period were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: We
		identified 44 patients with IMS. Mucorales were isolated in 13 (35.1%) patients
		and Fusarium and Aspergillus were isolated in 9 (24.3%) patients each. Patients
		with IMS owing to Mucorales were more likely to have a history of diabetes
		mellitus (P = 0.003) and high-dose corticosteroid use (P = 0.03). Thirty-five
		(80%) patients received antifungal combinations and 36 (82%) underwent surgical
		debridement. The 12 week IMS-attributable mortality was 36.4% (16 patients). A
		relapsed and/or refractory haematological malignancy was an independent risk
		"factor for 6 week IMS-attributable (P = 0.038), 12 week all-cause (P = 0.005) and"
		12 week IMS-attributable (P = 0.0015) mortality. Neutrophil count <100/µL and
		lymphocyte count <200/µL were associated with increased 12 week IMS-attributable
		"and 6 week all-cause mortality, respectively (P = 0.044 and 0.013). IMS due to"
		Aspergillus was an independent risk factor for both 12 week all-cause (P = 0.011)
		and IMS-attributable (P = 0.026) mortality. Initial antifungal therapy with a
		triazole-containing regimen was associated with decreased 6 week all-cause (P =
		0.032) and IMS-attributable (P = 0.038) mortality. Surgery was not an independent
		factor for improved outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Despite combined medical and surgical
		"therapy, IMS had high mortality. Mortality risk factors were relapsed and/or"
		"refractory malignancy, cytopenia and Aspergillus infection in this study."

AB	-	Introduction: Recognizing fungal keratitis based on the clinical presentation is
		challenging. Topical therapy may be initiated with antibacterial agents and
		"corticosteroids, thus delaying the fungal diagnosis. As a consequence, the fungal"
		infection may progress ultimately leading to more severe infection and blindness.
		"We noticed an increase of fungal keratitis cases in the Netherlands, especially"
		"caused by Fusarium species, which prompted us to conduct a retrospective cohort"
		"study, aiming to describe the epidemiology, clinical management, and outcome."
		Materials and Methods: As fungi are commonly sent to the Dutch mycology reference
		"laboratory for identification and in vitro susceptibility testing, the fungal"
		"culture collection was searched for Fusarium isolates from corneal scrapings,"
		"corneal swabs, and from contact lens (CL) fluid, between 2005 and 2016. All"
		Fusarium isolates had been identified up to species level through sequencing of
		the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region of the rDNA and TEF1 gene. Antifungal susceptibility
		testing was performed according to the EUCAST microbroth dilution reference
		"method. Antifungal agents tested included amphotericin B, voriconazole, and"
		"natamycin. In addition, susceptibility to the antisepticum chlorhexidine was"
		tested. Ophthalmologists were approached to provide demographic and clinical data
		of patients identified through a positive culture. Results: Between 2005 and
		"2016, 89 cases of Fusarium keratitis from 16 different hospitals were identified."
		The number of cases of Fusarium keratitis showed a significant increase over time
		"(R(2) = 0.9199), with one case in the first 5 years (2005-2009) and multiple"
		cases from 2010 and onwards. The male to female ratio was 1:3 (p = 0.014).
		"Voriconazole was the most frequently used antifungal agent, but treatment"
		strategies differed greatly between cases including five patients that were
		treated with chlorhexidine 0.02% monotherapy. Keratitis management was not
		"successful in 27 (30%) patients, with 20 (22%) patients requiring corneal"
		transplantation and seven (8%) requiring enucleation or evisceration. The mean
		"visual acuity (VA) was moderately impaired with a logMAR of 0.8 (95% CI 0.6-1,"
		Snellen equivalent 0.16) at the time of Fusarium culture. Final average VA was
		"within the range of normal vision [logMAR 0.2 (95% CI 0.1-0.3), Snellen"
		equivalent 0.63]. CL wear was reported in 92.9% of patients with Fusarium
		keratitis. The time between start of symptoms and diagnosis of fungal keratitis
		was significantly longer in patients with poor outcome as opposed to those with
		"(partially) restored vision; 22 vs. 15 days, respectively (mean, p = 0.024)."
		Enucleation/evisceration occurred in patients with delayed fungal diagnosis of
		more than 14 days after initial presentation of symptoms. The most frequently
		isolated species was F. oxysporum (24.7%) followed by F. solani sensu stricto
		(18%) and F. petroliphilum (9%). The lowest MICs were obtained with amphotericin
		"B followed by natamycin, voriconazole, and chlorhexidine. Conclusion: Although"
		"Fusarium keratitis remains a rare complication of CL wear, we found a significant"
		increase of cases in the Netherlands. The course of infection may be severe and
		fungal diagnosis was often delayed. Antifungal treatment strategies varied widely
		"and the treatment failure rate was high, requiring transplantation or even"
		enucleation. Our study underscores the need for systematic surveillance of fungal
		keratitis and a consensus management protocol.

AB	-	"Primary immunodeficiency diseases (PID), encompass a heterogeneous group of"
		"diseases, with increased susceptibility to recurrent, severe infections. Invasive"
		fungal infections raise a serious concern related to their morbidity and
		"mortality. Herein, we describe various fungal infections among different PID"
		patients. Twenty-eight PID patients diagnosed with fungal infections were
		"included; fourteen patients with chronic granulomatous disease, two with Hyper"
		"Immunoglobulin E syndrome, one with LRBA deficiency and one with MHC class II"
		"defect, one with unclassified immune dysregulation, one with CD4 lymphopenia and"
		one patient with Immune dysregulation Polyendocrinopathy Enteropathy X-linked
		syndrome. Aspergillus species were the most common isolated causative organisms
		"in 78% of patients, Candida species were the causative organisms in 32%,"
		"Pneumocystis jirovecii caused infections in 7% followed by Malassezia furfur,"
		"Fusarium spp., Mucormycosis, and Penicillium chrysogenium 3.5% for each. The"
		mortality rate among our patients was 10/28 (35.7%). PID patients are at high
		risk of developing fungal infections.

LID	-	10.1136/bjo.2008.142364 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND/AIMS: To study the susceptibility of Fusarium and Aspergillus isolated
		"from keratitis to amoxicillin, cefazolin, chloramphenicol, moxifloxacin,"
		tobramycin and benzalkonium chloride (BAK). METHODS: 10 isolates of Fusarium and
		10 isolates of Aspergillus from cases of fungal keratitis at Aravind Eye Hospital
		in South India were tested using microbroth dilution for susceptibility to
		"amoxicillin, cefazolin, chloramphenicol, moxifloxacin, tobramycin and BAK. The"
		minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) median and 90th percentile were
		determined. RESULTS: BAK had the lowest MIC for both Fusarium and Aspergillus.
		"Chloramphenicol had activity against both Fusarium and Aspergillus, while"
		moxifloxacin and tobramycin had activity against Fusarium but not Aspergillus.
		"CONCLUSIONS: The susceptibility of Fusarium to tobramycin, moxifloxacin,"
		chloramphenicol and BAK and of Aspergillus to chloramphenicol and BAK may explain
		anecdotal reports of fungal ulcers that improved with antibiotic treatment alone.
		While some of the MICs of antibiotics and BAK are lower than the typically
		"prescribed concentrations, they are not in the range of antifungal agents such as"
		"voriconazole, natamycin and amphotericin B. Antibiotics may, however, have a"
		modest effect on Fusarium and Aspergillus when used as initial treatment prior to
		identification of the pathological organism.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Superficial and cutaneous fungal infections are common in tropical
		areas. The aim of this study was to provide a basic database of superficial and
		cutaneous mycoses and the most common etiological agents among patients. METHODS:
		"Between 2015 and 2019, a total of 1807 patients suspected of superficial and"
		"cutaneous mycosis referring to the mycology laboratory of Shiraz medical school,"
		"Fars, Iran were evaluated. Specimens were taken from the patients' affected area,"
		and clinical samples were examined by direct microscopy and culture. The
		epidemiological profile of the patients was collected. RESULTS: A total of 750
		patients were confirmed with mycoses. Positive samples totaled 750 cases
		"consisting of the nail (373/49.7%), skin (323/43%), head (47/6.26%), and mucosal"
		"membrane (4/0.5%). The yeasts group included 304 Candida spp. (70.3%),"
		"123 Malassezia spp. (28.47%), and 5 Rhodotorula spp. (1.1%). The filamentous"
		fungi were distributed as 34.8% dermatophytes and 7.5% non-dermatophyte. The
		"clinical types of dermatophytosis were tinea unguium (110/261), tinea capitis"
		"(50/261), tinea pedis (48/261), tinea corporis (37/261), and tinea cruris"
		"(16/261). Non-dermatophyte molds included A. flavus 17, A. niger 4, Aspergillus"
		"spp. 15, Penicillium. 10, Fusarium 6, Mucor 2, Stemphylium 1, and Alternaria 1."
		CONCLUSION: This study provides useful data for the study trends of superficial
		and cutaneous fungal infections in a specific area. The mycological data
		confirmed higher incidence of candidiasis (mainly onychomycosis) and
		"dermatophytosis in patients affected by fungal pathogens, which helped to better"
		understand the epidemiological aspects of these mycoses.

TI	-	The epidemiology of fungal infections in patients with hematologic malignancies:
		the SEIFEM-2004 study.
PG	-	1068-75
AB	-	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence
		and outcome of invasive fungal infections (IFI) in patients with hematologic
		malignancies. DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of
		patients admitted between 1999 and 2003 to 18 hematology wards in Italy. Each
		participating center provided information on all patients with newly diagnosed
		hematologic malignancies admitted during the survery period and on all episodes
		"of IFI experienced by these patients. RESULTS: The cohort was formed of 11,802"
		"patients with hematologic malignacies: acute leukemia (myeloid 3012, lymphoid"
		"1173), chronic leukemia (myeloid 596, lymphoid 1104), lymphoma (Hodgkin's 844,"
		"non-Hodgkin's 3457), or multiple myeloma (1616). There were 538 proven or"
		probable IFI (4.6%); 373 (69%) occurred in patients with acute myeloid leukemia.
		"Over half (346/538) were caused by molds (2.9%), in most cases Aspergillus spp."
		(310/346). The 192 yeast infections (1.6%) included 175 cases of candidemia.
		Overall and IFI-attributable mortality rates were 2% (209/11802) and 39%
		"(209/538), respectively. The highest IFI-attributable mortality rates were"
		"associated with zygomycosis (64%) followed by fusariosis (53%), aspergillosis"
		"(42%), and candidemia (33%). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Patients with"
		hematologic malignancies are currently at higher risk of IFI caused by molds than
		"by yeasts, and the incidence of IFI is highest among patients with acute myeloid"
		"leukemia. Aspergillus spp are still the most common pathogens, followed by"
		Candida spp. Other agents are rare. The attributable mortality rate for
		aspergillosis has dropped from 60-70% to approximately 40%. Candidemia-related
		mortality remains within the 30-40% range reported in literature although the
		incidence has decreased.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Fungal keratitis (FK) has been shown to be a climate-sensitive
		disease. The differentiation between FK from bacterial keratitis (BK) was
		difficult. The purpose of this study was to compare the bacteriology and mycology
		between tropical and subtropical Taiwan and to investigate the independent risk
		factors for identification of fungi from bacteria. METHODS: Two hundred
		ninety-seven patients with clinical suspected microbial keratitis were
		"prospectively enrolled. A fungal to bacteria rate (FBR), the number of fungi"
		"divided by bacteria identified, was determined to estimate the prevalence of"
		"fungi and bacteria. Clinical presentation, profiles of microorganisms, and"
		predisposing risk factors were determined. Univariate and multivariate logistic
		regression analysis were used to investigate the independent risk factors.
		RESULTS: A total of 82 fungi and 143 bacteria were laboratory confirmed. The
		identification rate of fungus was higher in tropical Taiwan (p = 0.010). Among
		"the fungi and bacteria confirmed, the FBR was 0.29 (22.4% vs. 77.6%) in"
		"subtropical Taiwan, and 0.70 (41.3% vs. 58.7%) in tropical Taiwan. Samples"
		"obtained in tropical area (p = 0.019), ocular trauma (p = 0.019), and plant"
		exposure (p = 0.003) were independent risk factors for identification of fungus
		from bacteria. The predominant fungus isolated from corneal scraping were
		Fusarium solani (25%) and Trichosporon faecale (25%) in subtropical Taiwan; in
		tropical Taiwan was Fusarium spp. (50%). CONCLUSIONS: The identification rate of
		fungus was higher in tropical Taiwan than subtropical Taiwan. Awareness of the
		local epidemiology is crucial for early diagnosis of fungal keratitis in tropical
		area.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical-epidemiological characteristics of a case
		"series of fungal keratitis associated with Fusarium spp.., in Spain during the"
		years 2012 to 2014. METHODS: A retrospective study of a case series was conducted
		on a systematic random sample of 10% of patients identified in Health Centres of
		provincial capitals (n=250). The centres were asked whether they had been
		presented with cases of Fusarium spp. keratitis characterised by microbiological
		"methods. Of the 23 centres that responded, 14 had detected cases, with 13 of them"
		"accepting to participate, and 11 of them completing the study. The latter being"
		"sent a previously validated questionnaire. The variables analysed were: age,"
		"gender, habitual residence, profession, disease and medical history (previous"
		"systemic and ocular diseases, previous eye surgeries), and their outcomes."
		"RESULTS: The response rate was 92%, identifying 23 cases of Fusarium spp.. of"
		which 21 (91.3%) of them lived in urban areas. The professions most affected by
		"the disease included chefs, administrative, and technical, with 13 cases (56.5%)."
		The treatment guidelines established to confirm the infection showed the combined
		use of topical antibiotics associated with antiviral and/or antifungal agents.
		The use of contact lenses (86.9%) was the main risk factor. DISCUSSION: This
		"study showed that this is a rare disease in Spain, but that a large percentage of"
		"people who present with the disease are resident in urban areas, and they work in"
		"closed environments, focusing attention on microtraumas caused by use of contact"
		lenses.

LID	-	10.1016/j.burns.2014.10.024 [doi]
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Filamentous fungal infections (FFI) seem to become more frequent in
		"burn patients, in whom they are usually accepted to cause severe. However"
		published data regarding their incidence and consequences in that context remain
		scarce. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of mould infections
		"in our burn centre, and to review characteristics and outcomes of patients with"
		such infections. METHODS: This retrospective single-centre study reviews all
		patients admitted in our centre with acute burns (2000-2011) and positive culture
		for moulds. Wound infections were defined as follows: fungal wound colonisations
		(FWC) for positive mycological cultures without signs of wound infection; fungal
		wound infections (FWI) for positive mycological cultures with local signs of
		wound infection; disseminated infection (DI) for FWI with a positive blood
		culture or a positive galactomannan (for aspergillosis) or severe sepsis or
		"secondary organ localisation(s). RESULTS: Among 1849 patients, 31 patients"
		"presented a FFI. For 29 patients (93%), positive fungal samples were cutaneous:"
		"20 Aspergillosis ASP (5 FWC, 8 FWI and 7 DI), 9 mucormycosis MMC (3 FWC and 6"
		FWI) and 3 fusariosis FUS (3 FWI). Two patients presented a catheter colonisation
		or a pulmonary colonisation (Aspergillus fumigatus). Incidence of FFI was 1.7%.
		"Total body surface area burned, full-thickness burn surface area, Unit Burn"
		"Standard, Tobiasen score and SAPS2 (respectively 55% [40-73], 45% [30-63], 180"
		"[129-259], 11 [8-12] and 50 [40-62]) were markedly higher than in burned patients"
		without FFI hospitalised during the same time period. 30% of the patients with
		burn wound ASP (6/22) died. Mean length of stay was 111±67 days. CONCLUSION: FFI
		"are essentially cutaneous, infrequent and occur in the most severe burned"
		patients. ASP seems to be more serious than other FFI.

AB	-	Zearalenone (ZON) is a non-steroidal estrogenic mycotoxin produced by Fusarium
		species. The exposure risk to humans and animals is the consumption of
		contaminated food and animal feeds. It has been reported that ZON and some of its
		metabolites promote the development of hormone-dependent tumors. The aim of this
		case-control study was to estimate exposure to ZON and its five metabolites
		"(α-zearalenol [α-ZOL], β-zearalenol [β-ZOL], α-zearalanol [zeranol, α-ZAL],"
		"β-zearalanol [teranol, β-ZAL] and zearalanone [ZAN]) by measuring urinary"
		"concentrations of these compounds, and to evaluate the risk of breast cancer"
		related to this exposure. Chemical analyses were carried out by liquid-liquid
		extraction (LLE) and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography with tandem
		mass spectrometry detection (UHPLC-MS/MS). Statistical analyses were performed in
		order to determine the association between exposure to these compounds and the
		development of breast cancer. Crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95%
		confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by unconditional logistic regression
		to estimate the magnitude of the associations. The obtained results (adjusted
		"OR=1.54, 95% CI=1.10-2.77) suggest a potential role of α-ZAL in the risk of"
		developing breast cancer.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Fusarium species are saprophytic fungi with a worldwide distribution.
		"These fungi cause various infections among immunocompromised patients; however,"
		they can also involve immunocompetent individuals. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a
		case of a 41-year-old Iranian woman who presented with ulcerative lesions on her
		lips 10 months ago. She had a long history of anxiety but had no history of
		"classical risk factors such as trauma, cosmetic lip tattoo, burning in her lips,"
		smoking or use of alcohol and opium. A skin biopsy from the lower lip was
		performed and sent for microbiological examinations. Hyaline septate hyphae were
		seen on direct microscopy with potassium hydroxide. The clinical specimen was
		subcultured on sabouraud dextrose agar with chloramphenicol and prepared for
		antifungal susceptibility testing and molecular identification. Considering the
		"minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for antifungals, itraconazole (100 mg"
		"orally twice a day) was started for her, and after 2 months, the lesions were"
		"treated. She followed up for 3 months, and no signs of disease recurrence were"
		observed. CONCLUSIONS: Selecting an appropriate treatment strategy according to
		the laboratory assessments is essential in clinical practice and the management
		of rare infections to prevent related mortality and morbidity of opportunistic
		fungal infections.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Infection remains the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in
		the burns patient population. While candidal infection in burns patients is well
		"described, there is dearth of information regarding non-candidal fungal"
		infections in this setting. METHOD: All adult burns patients who developed
		non-candidal fungal infections over a period of 10 years (between January 2001
		and June 2011) were included. Retrospective data analyzed included patient
		"demographics, organisms cultured, antibiotic susceptibility patterns, treatment,"
		length of stay and overall mortality. RESULTS: The incidence of non-candidal
		fungal infections at our centre over the time period studied was 0.04%. A total
		"of 12 patients had a fungus other than Candida isolated. Of these 12 patients,"
		seven were thought to have clinically significant fungal infections and were
		"treated with targeted anti-fungal therapy. Between them, seven species of fungus"
		"were isolated: Aspergillus fumigatus (n=7), Scedosporium prolificans (n=2),"
		"Fusarium solani (n=2), Mucor spp. (n=2), Absydia corymbifera (n=1), Penicillium"
		"(n=1) and Alternaria spp. (n=1). Of those definitively treated, two died,"
		although fungal infection was not believed to be a contributing factor to these
		deaths. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate a low incidence and attributable mortality of
		non-candidal fungal infections in the setting of early antifungal therapy and
		extensive surgical debridement at our state-wide Burns Service.

TI	-	A retrospective cohort of invasive fusariosis in the era of antimould
		prophylaxis.
PG	-	300-309
LID	-	10.1093/mmy/myz060 [doi]
AB	-	Mould-active prophylaxis is affecting the epidemiology of invasive mycoses in the
		form of a shift toward less common entities such as fusariosis. We analyze the
		characteristics of invasive fusariosis and its association to antifungal
		prophylaxis in a retrospective cohort (2004-2017) from a tertiary hospital in
		"Madrid, Spain. Epidemiological, clinical, microbiological, and antifungal"
		"consumption data were retrieved. Isolates were identified to molecular level, and"
		antifungal susceptibility was tested. Eight cases of invasive fusariosis were
		diagnosed. Three periods were identified according to incidence: <2008 (three
		"cases), 2008-2013 (zero cases), >2014 (five cases). All except one case involved"
		"breakthrough fusariosis. During the earliest period, the episodes occurred while"
		"the patient was taking itraconazole (two) or fluconazole (one); more recently,"
		while on micafungin (three) or posaconazole (one). Early cases involved acute
		"leukemia at induction/consolidation, recent cases relapsed/refractory disease (P"
		= .029). Main risk factor for fusariosis (62.5%) was prolonged neutropenia
		(median 44 days). Galactomannan and beta-D-glucan were positive in 37.5% and 100%
		"of cases, respectively. All isolates except F. proliferatum presented high"
		minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against the azoles and lower MIC to
		amphotericin B. Most patients received combined therapy. Mortality at 42 days was
		62.5%. Resolution of neutropenia was associated with survival (P = .048).
		Invasive fusariosis occurs as breakthrough infection in patients with hematologic
		"malignancy, prolonged neutropenia, and positive fungal biomarkers. Recent cases"
		were diagnosed in a period of predominant micafungin use in patients who had more
		advanced disease and protracted neutropenia and for whom mortality was extremely
		high. Resolution of neutropenia was a favorable prognostic factor.

AB	-	The clinical diagnosis of Acute Invasive Fungal Rhinosinusitis (AIFRS) is
		technically difficult because it presents with non-exclusive and nonspecific
		clinical symptoms. Laboratory confirmation (usually via histopathologic
		techniques such as formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE)) is necessary but it
		"is time-consuming, despite the urgent need for timely diagnosis of AIFRS for"
		effective management. This study aimed to investigate the sensitivity and
		specificity of the GMS frozen-section biopsy in the diagnosis of AIFRS and
		compare the same with that of different tissue staining methods to provide valid
		decision-grounds that may guide clinicians in prompt diagnosis of acute fungal
		invasive rhinosinusitis. A cross-sectional study was conducted in the Medical
		"Mycology Laboratory, Faculty of Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences"
		between 2018 and 2020 on 200 patients with suspected AIFRS referred to
		"Baqiyatallah and Imam Khomeini Hospital, Tehran. All patients were subjected to"
		diagnostic nasal endoscopy and computed tomography (CT) scan of paranasal
		sinuses. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was done in cases of suspected
		"intracranial extension. After screening by routine mycological examination, the"
		"diagnosis was confirmed using complementary molecular methods. The sensitivity,"
		"specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV)"
		of the frozen-section biopsy were also compared with FFPE. Of the 200 suspect
		"patients, 47 cases (23.5%) met the criteria for AIFRS. Species of the genus"
		Aspergillus were the predominant 27 (57.4%) followed by Mucorales species 10
		"(21.3%), and Fusarium spp 3 (6.4%). Also, 3 cases (6.4%) of co-infection due to"
		"Aspergillus/Rhizopus were reported. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV,"
		"and NPV of frozen section assessments were 99.5%, 97.9%, 100%, 100% and 99.3%,"
		"respectively. For GMS frozen-section alone, sensitivity, specificity, NPV, and"
		"PPV was 100%. Overall, the calculated accuracy of FFPE was 98.5%, sensitivity was"
		"94%, specificity was 100%, PPV was 100%, and NPV was 98.1%. Examination of the"
		frozen-section biopsy is a highly predictive tool for a rapid and effective
		diagnosis of patients with suspected AIFRS. We observed that GMS frozen-section
		"is a fast and reliable exam to confirm the diagnosis of fungal invasion, with"

AB	-	"OBJECTIVE: To describe clinical, microbiological, in vivo confocal microscopic,"
		and histopathologic features of fungal keratitis in alpacas and to estimate
		prevalence of the disease in a population of alpacas from the northeastern United
		States. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. Animals-11 alpacas. PROCEDURES:
		Medical records of alpacas evaluated by the ophthalmology service of a veterinary
		teaching hospital were searched to identify animals with a clinical diagnosis of
		fungal keratitis and positive results for fungal culture of a corneal sample
		"between 2003 and 2012. Signalment and historical, clinical, and microbiological"
		"details were recorded. Results of cytologic, histopathologic, and in vivo"
		confocal microscopic corneal examinations were collected when available. RESULTS:
		Fungal keratitis was diagnosed in 11 of 169 (6.5%) alpacas that underwent
		ophthalmologic examination by the ophthalmology service during the study period.
		Ten of the 11 alpacas were evaluated in the summer or fall months. Corneal
		"lesions included stromal ulcer, stromal abscess, corneal perforation, and"
		nonulcerative keratitis. Aspergillus fumigatus and Fusarium solani were the most
		frequently cultured fungi. Fungi were also identified through corneal cytologic
		"examination, histologic examination, or in vivo confocal microscopy in 9 alpacas."
		"Historically, 2 alpacas were evaluated following external ocular trauma and 1"
		following corneal foreign body removal. Nine alpacas had received topical
		treatment with antimicrobials and 2 had antimicrobial-corticosteroid combinations
		administered topically prior to referral. Nine of 10 alpacas for which follow-up
		"information was available were successfully treated, with globe and vision"
		retention. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Fungal keratitis was a relatively
		common ocular disease in this population of alpacas and appeared to share several
		clinical features with keratomycosis in horses.

		across 20 states in the United States. It affected 753 individuals and caused 64
		"deaths who received contaminated spinal injections. In a previous study, we"
		analyzed 26 environmental samples collected from the manufacturing premises of a
		compounding company to determine the possible cause of an outbreak and identified
		"14 distinct fungal species. OBJECTIVES: In this follow-up study, we have analyzed"
		198 environmental samples collected from three additional compounding company
		premises located in the United States for the presence of pathogenic fungi.
		METHODS: Environmental swab samples were initially examined by standard
		"microbiological methods. Subsequently, DNA sequencing was performed on all of the"
		25 recovered fungal isolates at the D1-D2 domain of the large subunit (LSU)
		ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions. RESULTS:
		"Sequence analysis of the ITS1, ITS2, and LSU rRNA regions confirmed the presence"
		of the following fungal species in the environmental samples analyzed: (i)
		Pestalotiopsis cocculi from the region Ia; (ii) Epicoccum nigrum and Trichaptum
		biforme from the region Ib; (iii) Nigrospora sphaerica and Fusarium sp. from the
		"region II; and (iv) Curvularia sp., Fusarium sp., Penicillium sp., and Preussia"
		sp. from the region III. Species identification of 25 recovered fungal isolates
		"matched, in most cases, at 3 sequenced loci (ITS1, ITS2, and LSU). HIGHLIGHTS:"
		"DNA sequencing of ITS1, ITS2, and LSU D1-D2 regions can be used to perform fungal"
		typing and in implementing effective environmental monitoring programs of public
		health importance.

TI	-	Fungal keratitis in Melbourne.
PG	-	124-30
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Description of the clinical and microbiological spectrum of fungal
		"keratitis at a tertiary eye care hospital in Melbourne, Australia. METHODS:"
		Retrospective review of all patients with keratitis with positive fungal cultures
		from corneal or associated samples presenting to the Royal Victorian Eye and Ear
		"Hospital, Melbourne, Australia from July 1996 to May 2004. Demographic data,"
		"predisposing factors, features on presentation, management, outcomes and"
		microbiological data were collected and analysed. RESULTS: The study included 56
		eyes of 56 patients. Thirty-five patients were treated as 'typical' fungal
		"keratitis and used for description and analysis, with a mean follow up of 18"
		"months. Ocular trauma (37.1%), chronic steroid use (31.4%) and poor ocular"
		surface (25.7%) were the major predisposing factors. Perforation was seen in
		"25.7% of patients, penetrating keratoplasty was required in 9 (25.7%) patients"
		and evisceration was performed in 2 (5.7%) patients. Candida albicans (13
		"patients, 37.2%) was the most common fungal isolate accounting for more than"
		"one-third of all organisms followed by Aspergillus fumigatus (six patients,"
		"17.1%) and Fusarium sp. (five patients, 14.3%). CONCLUSIONS: The present study"
		"describes the clinical patterns of fungal keratitis in Melbourne, Australia and"
		contrasts them with reports from other areas of the world. A high incidence of C.
		albicans infection and the prior use of steroids in high proportion of the
		patients are highlighted in this study.

PG	-	39-43
LID	-	10.18502/cmm.8.1.9213 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Disseminated fusariosis is an opportunistic infection
		caused by the hyaline fungus Fusarium spp. and occurs mainly in patients with
		leukemia. CASE REPORT: Two cases of disseminated fusariosis in pediatric patients
		"are presented. Profound and prolonged neutropenia, fever, myalgia, and skin"
		lesions in the legs were present in two girls with leukemia undergoing
		"chemotherapy. In the first case, infection by Fusarium spp. was confirmed by"
		"anatomopathological findings, pathogen isolation, and polymerase chain reaction."
		"In the second case, Fusarium solani infection was confirmed by mass spectrometry"
		using blood cultures and skin lesion samples. CONCLUSION: It is important to
		consider disseminated fusariosis in high-risk patients who present with profound
		and prolonged neutropenia and persistent fever that does not resolve after
		broad-spectrum antibiotics to initiate antifungal therapy in a timely manner.

PG	-	300-3
AB	-	"PURPOSE: To review the clinical course, treatment, and visual outcomes of"
		keratitis with endophthalmitis caused by the filamentary fungus Fusarium. METHOD:
		One hundred fifty-nine cases of Fusarium keratitis at Bascom Palmer Eye Institute
		"between January 1, 1987 and August 21, 2000 were reviewed. Ten patients with"
		culture-proven Fusarium keratitis progressed to endophthalmitis. All 10 underwent
		"standard diagnostic microbiologic evaluation, and topical and oral antifungal"
		therapy was instituted. Surgical therapy was applied when necessary. Main outcome
		measures included the incidence of intraocular invasion of fungal keratitis and
		response to treatment. RESULTS: Ten cases of 159 Fusarium keratitis patients had
		intraocular involvement that was culture proven. The isolated species were
		"Fusarium oxysporum in seven cases and Fusarium solani in two cases, and in one"
		"case, the species could not be identified. Cultures of aqueous and intraocular"
		"tissues grew Fusarium in eight cases, whereas vitreous cultures were positive in"
		two. Nine cases had preexisting risk factors. All patients received oral
		"ketoconazole or fluconazole and topical natamycin 5%. In two cases, intravitreal"
		amphotericin B injections were also given. Four patients required a penetrating
		"keratoplasty, enucleation was performed in two patients, two patients required a"
		"combination of a penetrating keratoplasty and pars plana vitrectomy, and one"
		patient developed phthisis. CONCLUSION: The combination therapy with oral
		imidazoles (fluconazole or ketoconazole) and topical natamycin is inadequate in
		severe Fusarium keratitis with intraocular spread. Early diagnosis and suspicion
		of endophthalmitis in patients with keratomycosis not responding to aggressive
		topical antifungal are important.

		solution.
PG	-	953-63
AB	-	"CONTEXT: Fusarium keratitis is a serious corneal infection, most commonly"
		"associated with corneal injury. Beginning in March 2006, the Centers for Disease"
		Control and Prevention received multiple reports of Fusarium keratitis among
		"contact lens wearers. OBJECTIVE: To define the specific activities, contact lens"
		"hygiene practices, or products associated with this outbreak. DESIGN, SETTING,"
		AND PARTICIPANTS: Epidemiological investigation of Fusarium keratitis occurring
		in the United States. A confirmed case was defined as keratitis with illness
		"onset after June 1, 2005, with no history of recent ocular trauma and a corneal"
		culture growing Fusarium species. Data were obtained by patient and
		ophthalmologist interviews for case patients and neighborhood-matched controls by
		trained personnel. Available Fusarium isolates from patients' clinical and
		environmental specimens were genotyped by multilocus sequence typing.
		Environmental sampling for Fusarium was conducted at a contact lens solution
		manufacturing plant. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Keratitis infection with Fusarium
		"species. RESULTS: As of June 30, 2006, we identified 164 confirmed case patients"
		"in 33 states and 1 US territory. Median age was 41 years (range, 12-83 years)."
		Corneal transplantation was required or planned in 55 (34%). One hundred
		fifty-four (94%) of the confirmed case patients wore soft contact lenses.
		Forty-five case patients and 78 controls were included in the case-control study.
		Case patients were significantly more likely than controls to report using a
		"specific contact lens solution, ReNu with MoistureLoc (69% vs 15%; odds ratio,"
		"13.3; 95% confidence interval, 3.1-119.5). The prevalence of reported use of ReNu"
		MultiPlus solution was similar between case patients and controls (18% vs 20%;
		"odds ratio, 0.7; 95% confidence interval, 0.2-2.8). Fusarium was not recovered"
		"from the factory, warehouse, solution filtrate, or unopened solution bottles;"
		production of implicated lots was not clustered in time. Among 39 isolates
		"tested, at least 10 different Fusarium species were identified, comprising 19"
		unique multilocus genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this investigation
		indicate that this outbreak of Fusarium keratitis was associated with use of ReNu
		with MoistureLoc contact lens solution. Contact lens users should not use ReNu
		with MoistureLoc.

AB	-	The increasing diversity of opportunistic fungi causing serious invasive fungal
		infections (IFI) has been documented. Accurate identification (ID) is important
		"in guiding therapy, determining prognosis for IFIs and in epidemiological"
		surveys. We assessed the utility of PCR-based methods for the ID of yeasts and
		"moulds that either were uncommon, failed conventional ID, or represented unusual"
		"biochemical or phenotypic profiles of common species. Among 1,790 viable fungal"
		"clinical isolates received during the SENTRY Program in 2010, 322 strains from 40"
		study sites had ID confirmed by molecular methods. Isolates were previously
		identified in participant institutions. Yeasts that were not confirmed by
		"morphology on CHROMagar, growth at 45 °C (Candida albicans/dubliniensis), or"
		assimilation of trehalose (C. glabrata) as well as non-Candida yeasts and all
		moulds were amplified and sequenced using primers amplifying one or more of the
		"following genes: ITS, 28S, β-tubulin (Aspergillus spp.), TEF (Fusarium spp.), IGS"
		(Trichosporon spp.). The isolates selected for molecular ID included 149 isolates
		"of Candida species, 77 of Aspergillus species, 73 non-Candida yeasts, and 23"
		"other moulds (a total of 41 different species). Overall, the ID determined by the"
		submitting site was confirmed for 189 isolates (58.7 %): Aspergillus spp. (64.1 %
		correct); Candida spp. (60.1 % correct); non-Candida yeasts (58.9 % correct);
		non-Aspergillus moulds (30.4 % correct). Species with high levels of concordance
		"between conventional and molecular ID included A. fumigatus (95.0  %), C."
		"lusitaniae (100 %), C. dubliniensis (92.3 %), C. kefyr (100 %), and C. neoformans"
		(90.2 %). Only 50.0 % of isolates of C. albicans and 59.1 % of C. glabrata
		selected due to unusual phenotypic or biochemical features were found to be
		correctly identified by the submitting site. Molecular methods for the
		identification of fungal pathogens are an important adjunct to the conventional
		identification of many less common clinically relevant yeasts and moulds
		including species of Candida with unusual or erroneous phenotypic or biochemical
		profiles. Molecular confirmation of fungal identification is essential in
		epidemiological surveys such as SENTRY.

LID	-	10.1167/iovs.10-5977 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: To investigate the predominant causative pathogens and epidemiologic
		"features of fungal keratitis and establish a rapid, specific molecular method to"
		detect fungal keratitis caused by Fusarium solani. METHODS: A total of 174
		patients with presumed fungal keratitis and 174 affected eyes were examined.
		Isolates from corneal specimens were identified according to morphologic and
		physiological characteristics. The primers that were designed for F. solani were
		tested to confirm whether they had species specificity. Multiplex PCR with
		universal fungal and F. solani-specific primers was performed with fungal and
		bacterial strains and was used to detect microorganisms in the clinical
		specimens. RESULTS: A total of 160 patients (92.0%) were diagnosed with fungal
		infection by either potassium hydroxide wet-mount or microbiologic culture.
		Fungal cultures were positive in 128 patients (73.6%) with 139 fungal isolates.
		"Fusarium (48.2%) was the most frequently isolated genus, in which F. solani"
		"(35.2%) was the most common species, followed by the Aspergillus (18.7%) and"
		Candida (16.6%) genera. The PCR results showed that the designed primers were
		species specific and suitable for specific identification of F. solani. The
		multiplex PCR of 3-day broth cultures could identify and distinguish F. solani
		from other pathogens rapidly and specifically from clinical specimens.
		"CONCLUSIONS: Fusarium species, especially F. solani, were found to be the"
		predominant cause of fungal keratitis in northeast China. The established
		multiplex PCR method could have potential advantages for rapid detection of F.
		solani. These findings might have significance for early diagnosis and treatment
		of fungal keratitis.

PG	-	623-628
LID	-	10.1684/ejd.2022.4319 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Disseminated fusariosis is a rare and fatal infection in
		immunocompromised patients. OBJECTIVES: We report a case of disseminated
		amphotericin-resistant fusariosis in a paediatric patient with acute
		lymphoblastic leukaemia and review the features of reported disseminated
		fusariosis in China. MATERIALS & METHODS: Case reports of disseminated fusariosis
		were searched from the Chinese literature over the last two decades. RESULTS: The
		presented case is a 15-year-old female who developed fever and multiple painful
		purple plaques with black necrotic centres and blood blisters. Fusarium was
		detected in blood and skin lesions with a high minimum inhibitory concentration
		(MIC) of amphotericin B (AMB) (>32 μg/mL) and a low MIC of voriconazole (VRC)
		(0.25 μg/mL). The Fusarium fujikuroi species complex was finally identified by
		rRNA gene analysis. Combination therapy of VRC and terbinafine (TRF) successfully
		resolved the disease after more than four months of treatment. Based on the
		"review, the most common manifestations of disseminated fusariosis were fever,"
		"skin lesions and positive blood cultures, comprising nine cases (64.3%). Other"
		"sites of infection, including the lungs, eyes, sinuses or bone marrow, occurred"
		in eight cases (57.1%). Seven patients (50%) were cured after monotherapy or
		combination therapy with AMB and VRC. CONCLUSION: In view of this case and the
		"review of the literature, early identification of Fusarium infection and the"
		appropriate antifungal drugs are critical for successful treatment. Primary
		"therapy should consist of VRC or liposomal amphotericin B (L-AMB), with salvage"
		therapy consisting of posaconazole (PSC). The combination of antifungals is
		probably necessary and more effective.

		"was positive before the diagnosis of IF in 11 of the 12 patients (91.6%), at a"

		"tests, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were"
		"85%, 69%, 7% and 99%, respectively. BDG is positive in the majority of patients"
		"with IF, usually before the diagnosis, but the low positive predictive value"
		"limits its use to diagnose IF earlier. Once therapy is started, decreasing BDG"
		values suggests treatment response.

		cellulitis: a case series.
PG	-	435
LID	-	10.1186/s12879-022-07365-8 [doi]
LID	-	435
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cellulitis is an infection most commonly caused by bacteria and
		"successfully treated with antibiotics. However, certain patient populations,"
		"especially the immunocompromised, are at risk for fungal cellulitis, which can be"
		misidentified as bacterial cellulitis and contribute to significant morbidity and
		mortality. CASE PRESENTATIONS: We describe three cases of opportunistic fungal
		cellulitis in immunosuppressed patients that were initially mistaken for
		"bacterial infections refractory to antibiotic therapy. However, atypical features"
		of cellulitis ultimately prompted further diagnostics to identify fungal
		cellulitis and allow initiation of appropriate antifungals. We discuss: (1) a
		52-year-old male immunosuppressed hematopoietic cell transplant recipient with
		Fusarium solani cellulitis on his right lower extremity that was treated with
		amphotericin B and voriconazole with full resolution of the cellulitis; (2) a
		70-year-old male lung transplant recipient with Fusarium solani cellulitis on his
		left lower extremity that ultimately progressed despite antifungals; and (3) a
		68-year-old male with a history of kidney transplantation with suspected
		Purpureocillium lilacinum cellulitis on his left lower extremity ultimately
		treated with posaconazole with resolution of the skin lesions. CONCLUSIONS:
		Fusarium solani and Purpureocillium lilacinum are important pathogens causing
		opportunistic fungal cellulitis. These cases remind providers to be vigilant for
		fungal cellulitis when skin and soft tissue infection does not adequately respond
		to antibiotics and atypical features of cellulitis are present.

		solid organ transplant.
PG	-	791-6
LID	-	10.1097/TP.0b013e3181837585 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: The incidence of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) in solid organ
		transplant (SOT) recipients has increased during the past 20 years and is
		associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In this post hoc analysis of
		"a large, open-label, multicenter study, we evaluated efficacy and safety of"
		"posaconazole, a new extended-spectrum triazole, as salvage therapy for IFIs in"
		SOT recipients. METHODS: Twenty-three SOT recipients with proven or probable IFI
		"and evidence of disease refractory to, or intolerant of, standard antifungal"
		therapies received posaconazole oral suspension (40 mg/mL) 800 mg daily in
		"divided doses. An independent, blinded data-review committee assessed patient"
		diagnosis and outcome. RESULTS: Complete or partial response was documented in 13
		"of 23 (57%) SOT recipients with proven or probable IFIs, including 1 of 2 (50%)"
		"refractory patients, 5 of 8 (63%) intolerant to prior therapy, and 7 of 13 (54%)"
		who were both. Successes by type of IFI included 7 of 12 with invasive
		"aspergillosis, 2 of 2 with invasive fusariosis, 1 of 1 with cryptococcosis, and 1"
		of 2 with zygomycosis. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were reported in
		12 of 23 patients. Severe TRAEs occurred in 4 of 23 patients including increased
		levels of cyclosporine or tacrolimus requiring immunosuppressive dose adjustments
		"in three patients and in one, termination of posaconazole. Severe TRAEs"
		associated with renal and liver toxicities were uncommon. CONCLUSION:
		Posaconazole was well tolerated and effective against IFIs including invasive
		"aspergillosis, zygomycosis, fusariosis, and cryptococcosis in SOT recipients"
		intolerant of or failing other antifungal therapies. Calcineurin inhibitor levels
		should be closely monitored in patients treated concomitantly with posaconazole
		to avoid toxicity from drug interaction.

AB	-	"PURPOSE: To determine the incidence, clinical features, and outcomes of"
		infectious keratitis after Boston type 1 keratoprosthesis (Kpro) implantation.
		METHODS: Ten cases of infectious keratitis were identified in a retrospective
		chart review of 105 patients (126 eyes) who received Kpro between November 2004
		and November 2010 at the Cincinnati Eye Institute and were followed for at least
		"1 month (range, 1-66 months; mean, 25 months). RESULTS: The incidence was 7.9%."
		"Patient diagnoses included 4 chemical injuries, 3 Stevens-Johnson syndrome, 2"
		"ocular cicatricial pemphigoid, and 1 congenital aniridia. Kpro implantation was"
		indicated in 2 eyes for a failed ocular surface and in 8 for penetrating
		keratoplasty failure. Four patients were contact lens intolerant or noncompliant.
		All were on topical vancomycin and moxifloxacin for prophylaxis and 2 were on
		"topical amphotericin for prophylaxis. Three infiltrates were culture negative, 5"
		"were fungal (3 Candida, 1 Fusarium, 1 Dactylaria constricta), and 2 were"
		bacterial (Rhodococcus equi and Gram-negative cocci). All patients were managed
		with topical agents and 4 were given an oral antifungal agent. Four patients had
		Kpro removal with therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty and 1 had Kpro
		"replacement. At final follow-up, only 2 patients retained their preinfection best"
		vision. Risk factors for infectious keratitis included a diagnosis of cicatrizing
		"conjunctivitis (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, ocular cicatricial pemphigoid, or"
		chemical injury) and a history of persistent epithelial defect (P = 0.0003 and
		"0.0142, respectively). Contact lens wear, vancomycin use, and a history of"
		systemic immunosuppression (or use at the time of infection) were not
		statistically significant risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Infectious keratitis after
		Kpro can occur even when patients are on vancomycin and a fourth-generation
		fluoroquinolone for prophylaxis. Fungal organisms are a growing cause for
		"concern, and we present the details of the first reported case of ocular D."
		constricta. The evolution of our management and prophylaxis strategy for fungal
		keratitis after Kpro implantation is also described.

AB	-	PURPOSE: To evaluate an outbreak of endophthalmitis caused by Fusarium oxysporum
		"after cataract surgery. METHODS: In the present study, we conducted a"
		retrospective review of the medical records of cases of endophthalmitis that
		developed after cataract surgery. All eyes underwent phacoemulsification and
		intraocular lens implantation (PEA + IOL) at a single eye clinic on the same
		date. Symptoms of endophthalmitis occurred 21.5 ± 3.4 days after the cataract
		surgery. RESULTS: Nine eyes of 9 patients with fungal endophthalmitis (5 males
		and 4 females) were enrolled in the current study. The mean age of the patients
		"was 63.4 ± 8.5 years. Soon after the diagnosis of endophthalmitis, pars plana"
		"vitrectomy (PPV) had been performed in all the eyes. However, because there was"
		"no response to the first PPV plus antibacterial drug therapy, we performed repeat"
		"PPV for all the eyes, combined with IOL removal and antifungal therapy (natamycin"
		eye drops plus oral voriconazole or fosfluconazole). After the antifungal drug
		"therapy, no recurrence of endophthalmitis was observed in any of the operated"
		"eyes, and good visual outcomes were obtained. Fusarium oxysporum was identified"
		"by culture and sequencing analysis. CONCLUSION: Early diagnosis and appropriate,"
		adequate treatment are needed for successful management of fungal
		endophthalmitis.

TI	-	Nasosinusal fungal granuloma--clinical profile.
PG	-	470-4
AB	-	Fifty cases of nasosinusal fungal granuloma were admitted under the ENT
		Department in a teaching tertiary care hospital in India during a thirteen-year
		period. Aspergillus species was found to be the most common causative fungus (29)
		"followed by Mucorales (14), Entomophthorales (5) and Fusarium (2) species. There"
		were 13 cases of non-invasive and 16 cases of invasive variants of Aspergillosis.
		"In spite of intravenous amphotericin B therapy and radical surgical debridement,"
		81% in the invasive group showed relapse and required prolonged oral antifungal
		"drugs and multiple surgical procedures. Among the 14 cases of Mucormycosis, all"
		of the 10 cases who received intravenous amphotericin B and radical surgery
		showed complete recovery with no relapse over a period of 2 to 10 years. This is
		contrary to earlier published reports which suggest poor prognosis. The
		"entomophthoromycosis received oral steroids and cotrimoxazole, and oral potassium"
		iodide or intravenous amphotericin in case of relapse. Both the cases of
		Fusariosis recovered completely with oral ketoconazole.

AB	-	PURPOSE: To report two cases of infectious keratitis that developed 2 and 6 years
		after LASIK. METHODS: Case 1 was a 56-year-old woman who presented with redness
		and decreased vision in the right eye 6 years after LASIK. Slit-lamp examination
		"revealed inflammation of the flap interface, a partially detached flap, anterior"
		"chamber reaction, and hypopyon. Corneal scrapings were taken. Case 2 was a"
		23-year-old woman who presented with pain and a corneal infiltrate in the left
		eye 36 hours after eye trauma. She had undergone bilateral LASIK 2 years prior.
		"The condition worsened despite treatment, and a flap amputation was performed."
		"RESULTS: Cultures revealed Pseudomonas mesophilic and Fusarium solani,"
		respectively. Keratitis in case 1 resolved after 21 days of fortified antibiotic
		therapy. Visual acuity of 20/40 was achieved after antibiotic treatment in case
		2. CONCLUSIONS: These case reports demonstrate the risk of microbial keratitis
		occurring years after LASIK and emphasize the need for lifelong postoperative
		vigilance by patient and physician.

TI	-	Brain abscesses in children with cancer.
PG	-	19-21
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Brain abscesses in pediatric patients are rare events, and the"
		causative organism and prognosis vary with the population under study. Children
		with cancer seem to be particularly susceptible to the development of brain
		abscesses because of the immunological changes induced by cancer and its
		treatment. We reviewed the records of children who developed a brain abscess
		"during treatment of a malignancy to define the clinical characteristics,"
		"prognosis, and management of these patients. PROCEDURE: We performed a"
		retrospective review of the clinical and laboratory characteristics of all cancer
		patients younger than age 20 years who were admitted to our institution between
		1980 and 1996 for a brain abscess. RESULTS: Twelve children were identified.
		"Cancer diagnoses were brain tumor in two, systemic PNET in two, and leukemia in"
		eight. Six patients had multiple abscesses. Eleven received prior chemotherapy.
		"Abscesses were surgically excised or aspirated in seven, and empiric antibiotics"
		"were given to the other five. At surgery, Listeria monocytogenes, Aspergillus"
		"fumigatus (3), Fusarium, and Candida lusitanea were cultured. Aspergillus was"
		identified in other locations in four patients. Abscesses were successfully
		"treated in seven patients, two of whom received antibiotics only; five patients"
		(42%) died from infection. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality is high in this
		"immunosuppressed population, in part due to the preponderance of fungal"
		infection. The finding of very rare organisms suggests that drainage and culture
		should be performed whenever possible; empiric antibiotics that include an
		"antifungal agent may, on occasion, be successful."

TI	-	The spectrum of non-Candida fungal infections following bone marrow
		transplantation.
PG	-	78-89
AB	-	We evaluated a consecutive series of patients who underwent bone marrow
		transplantation (BMT) at a single institution between 1974 and 1989 for the
		occurrence of a non-Candida fungal infection in the first 180 days after BMT. Of
		"the 1186 patients, 129 (11%) patients developed a total of 138 significant"
		non-Candida fungal infections in this period. Eight patients had multiple
		"distinct infections. The most common isolate was Aspergillus spp. (n = 97),"
		"followed by Fusarium (n = 10), and Alternaria (n = 6). The 4 clinical subtypes of"
		"infections were minor skin or soft-tissue infections (n = 7), infections of a"
		"single organ or site (n = 61), disseminated fungal infection (n = 58), and"
		isolated fungemia (n = 12). The respiratory tract was involved in 95% of single
		"organ or site infections, and 84% of disseminated infections. Outcome was poor,"
		with only 18% of patients surviving. The cause of death was directly related to
		the non-Candida fungal infection in 66% of patients who died. Mortality rates
		were significantly higher in patients with either single-organ or site infections
		(41%) or disseminated infections (83%). The cause-specific mortality rate was
		"greatest following infections with Aspergillus, Chrysosporium, Fusarium, Mucor,"
		"or Scopulariopsis, in which there was a high potential for invasive disease and"
		"disseminated infection. In contrast, the cause-specific mortality rate was lowest"
		in infections which were either isolated fungemia or were localized and amenable
		"to surgical debridement, most often seen with those infections caused by"
		"Acremonium, Alternaria, Penicillium, and Saccharomyces. The spectrum of clinical"
		infections caused by these uncommon non-Candida fungal isolates both in our
		series and in the literature is reviewed. These unusual opportunistic fungal
		isolates are now gaining recognition in immunosuppressed patients such as the BMT
		"population, and have a significant impact on patient outcome. Effective therapy"
		of non-Candida fungal infections remains difficult. Early aggressive surgical
		debridement appears to be important in control of localized invasive infections.
		"Prolonged therapy with amphotericin B is the standard of care, although the role"
		of the newer antifungal agents is not yet well-defined. Ancillary roles may also
		be provided by granulocyte transfusions and the colony-stimulating factors.

TI	-	Molecular Identification and Susceptibility Testing of Molds Isolated in a
		Prospective Surveillance of Triazole Resistance in Spain (FILPOP2 Study).
LID	-	10.1128/AAC.00358-18 [doi]
LID	-	e00358-18
AB	-	Antifungal resistance is increasing by the emergence of intrinsically resistant
		species and by the development of secondary resistance in susceptible species. A
		previous study performed in Spain revealed levels of azole resistance in molds of
		"between 10 and 12.7%, but secondary resistance in Aspergillus fumigatus was not"
		detected. We used itraconazole (ITZ)-supplemented medium to select resistant
		strains. A total of 500 plates supplemented with 2 mg/liter of ITZ were sent to
		"10 Spanish tertiary hospitals, and molecular identification and antifungal"
		"susceptibility testing were performed. In addition, the cyp51A gene in those A."
		fumigatus strains showing azole resistance was sequenced. A total of 493 isolates
		were included in the study. Sixteen strains were isolated from patients with an
		"infection classified as proven, 104 were isolated from patients with an infection"
		"classified as probable, and 373 were isolated from patients with an infection"
		"classified as colonization. Aspergillus was the most frequent genus isolated, at"
		"80.3%, followed by Scedosporium-Lomentospora (7.9%), Penicillium-Talaromyces"
		"(4.5%), Fusarium (2.6%), and the order Mucorales (1%). Antifungal resistance was"
		"detected in Scedosporium-Lomentospora species, Fusarium, Talaromyces, and"
		Mucorales Three strains of A. fumigatus sensu stricto were resistant to azoles;
		"two of them harbored the TR(34)+L98H mechanism of resistance, and the other one"
		had no mutations in cyp51A The level of azole resistance in A. fumigatus remains
		"low, but cryptic species represent over 10% of the isolates and have a broader"
		but overall higher range of antifungal resistance.

		receiving antifungal prophylaxis.
PG	-	2634-41
LID	-	10.1093/jac/dkw199 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: Antifungal prophylaxis is recommended for haematological patients at
		"high risk of invasive fungal infections (IFIs). Incidence, optimal therapeutic"
		management and outcome of breakthrough IFIs (bIFIs) are largely unknown. METHODS:
		"To assess bIFI incidence, treatment and outcomes, data on patients undergoing AML"
		remission-induction and consolidation chemotherapy and from allogeneic HSCT
		"recipients on antifungal prophylaxis with itraconazole, micafungin or"
		posaconazole were extracted from the Cologne Cohort of Neutropenic Patients
		(CoCoNut). bIFIs were classified according to revised EORTC/MSG criteria.
		"RESULTS: From January 2004 to April 2013, 250 AML patients with 329"
		hospitalizations and 409 HSCT patients with 496 hospitalizations were identified.
		"In AML patients, there were 16 (6.4%) proven or probable bIFIs and 44 (17.6%)"
		"possible bIFIs. In HSCT patients, there were 14 (3.4%) proven or probable bIFIs"
		"and 37 (9.0%) possible bIFIs. Proven cases included five candidaemias, two"
		"mucormycoses, three aspergilloses and one fusariosis. The most frequent choice"
		for bIFI treatment was liposomal amphotericin B in AML patients (21/60; 35.0%)
		and continuation of posaconazole prophylaxis in HSCT patients (16/51; 31.4%). In
		"HSCT recipients, survival on day 365 was significantly lower in bIFI patients"
		"(AML, 63.3% versus 70.0%; P = 0.297; HSCT, 49.0% versus 66.8%; P = 0.012)."
		Comparison of continuation of prophylaxis versus switch of antifungal class as
		first-line treatment showed no significant difference regarding response to
		treatment and survival. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of bIFIs observed in our population
		"were comparable to previous data. There was no clear shift towards rare species,"
		as previously reported. A high variety of treatment approaches was observed.

AB	-	"We compared the clinical characteristics, treatments, and prognoses of fungal"
		keratitis in patients with and without diabetes. Patients diagnosed with fungal
		keratitis at Shandong Eye Institute between January 2010 and December 2016 were
		retrospectively reviewed and classified as diabetic and nondiabetic groups.
		One-hundred-and-eleven patients (111 eyes) with diabetes and 740 patients (740
		eyes) without diabetes were included. The diabetic patients showed significantly
		older (p< 0.05) and lower male:female ratio (p<0.05). Plants trauma was the
		"primary risk factor in both groups, and there was no significant difference of"
		"pathogen type (the most common was Fusarium genus, followed by Alternaria and"
		Aspergillus genera). Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that
		diabetes and topical glucocorticoid use were the independent risk factors for the
		severity of fungal keratitis. The recurrent infection rate between the diabetic
		and nondiabetic patients during the follow-up (6 to 24 months) after penetrating
		keratoplasty (PKP) was not significantly different. Although the recurrent
		"epithelial defect, rejection, and best-corrected visual acuity were similar"
		between the patients with matched bed/graft size (7.75/8.0 mm) in the two groups
		"1 year after PKP, the incidence of delayed re-epithelialization (>7 days) was"
		significantly higher in diabetic patients (3/10 versus 2/43 in nondiabetic
		"patients, p<0.05). More specially, the diabetic patients with the duration ≥10"
		years showed more significantly delayed re-epithelialization than those with the
		"diabetic duration less than 10 years (3/5 versus 1/26, p<0.05). In conclusion,"
		the diabetes mellitus is an independent risk factor that affect the severity of
		fungal keratitis. Corneal re-epithelialization was significantly delayed after
		"PKP in the diabetic patients, especially with the duration ≥10 years."

AB	-	Fungus ball is the most common form of non-invasive fungal rhinosinusitis.
		Aspergillusfumigatus (between 44.8% and 75%) and Aspergillusflavus (14%) are the
		"two most common species recovered. However, recent advances in mycological"
		laboratory methods have enhanced the detection and identification of fungi within
		"fungus balls. Fusarium species, sometimes recovered from other forms of fungal"
		rhinosinusitis such as allergic fungal rhinosinusitis or acute invasive fungal
		"rhinosinusitis, are poorly associated with sinonasal fungus ball. Here, we"
		describe two further cases of a fungus ball due to Fusariumproliferatum and
		provide the first description of this fungal pathogen with a fungus ball of
		odontogenic origin. These case reports demonstrate that uncommon fungal species
		such as Fusarium spp. might be underestimated as agents of sinusal cavity fungus
		"ball. Enhanced mycological detection and diagnostic techniques might give rise,"
		"in the near future, to the emergence of new or rare fungal species associated"
		with this clinical entity.

LID	-	10.1097/MD.0000000000016246 [doi]
LID	-	e16246
AB	-	RATIONALE: Fusarium is the second most common cause of fungi infections in the
		immunocompromised patients with the mortality rate over 80%. Early identification
		and appropriate selection of antifungal drugs is the key to successful treatment.
		PATIENT CONCERNS: A 31-year-old female was diagnosed with acute lymphocytic
		leukemia (pro-B ALL). She developed a high fever and presented with typical
		painful purple nodules with central necrosis formed on the upper and lower limbs
		during the induction chemotherapy. DIAGNOSIS: Combining clinical manifestations
		"with results of blood culture testing and sequencing methods, it was consistent"
		with the diagnosis of disseminated fusariosis. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was
		treated with the combination of tigecycline and antifungal agents (Liposomal
		"Amphotericin B and Voriconazole), OUTCOMES:: The skin lesions generally healed"
		with some scar left after treating with antifungal agents for 6 weeks. The final
		"date of follow-up was 1.5 years later, and the patient was alive with no"
		diseases. LESSONS: This case highlights the importance of the typical cutaneous
		lesions for early diagnosis and proper treatment to decrease the mortality rate
		of this severe infection. This patient was successfully treated with the
		"combination of tigecycline and antifungal agents, which may be the first clinical"
		confirmation of tigecycline that improved the effectiveness of antifungal agents
		"against fusariosis, but it requires more studies to verify. We reviewed 62 cases"
		from literature and analyzed using logistic regression and recognized the
		high-risk factor for fusariosis mortality in patients with acute leukemia was
		non-remission of underlying disease.

TI	-	The epidemiological features and laboratory results of fungal keratitis: a
		10-year review at a referral eye care center in South India.
PG	-	555-9
AB	-	"PURPOSE: To report the epidemiological features and laboratory results of 1,352"
		cases of fungal keratitis diagnosed at the L.V. Prasad Eye Institute (LVPEI) in
		"south India. METHODS: The medical and microbiology records of 1,352 culture"
		"proven cases (1,354 eyes) of fungal keratitis diagnosed at the LVPEI between"
		January 1991 to December 2000 was retrospectively reviewed for demographic
		"features, risk factors, seasonal variation, and laboratory findings. RESULTS:"
		Males (962) were affected significantly more (p< 0.0001) than females (390). Of
		"1,352 patients, 853 (64.4%) were in the younger age group (16-49 years). Ocular"
		"trauma predisposed to infection in 736 (54.4%) of 1,354 eyes. There was a higher"
		incidence of fungal keratitis during the monsoon and winter than summer. A fungal
		"cause was established by smears of corneal scrapings in 1,277 (95.4%) eyes. The"
		"potassium hydroxide preparation (KOH), Calcofluor white (CFW), Gram-, and"
		"Giemsa-stained smears revealed fungus in 1,219 (91.0%), 1,224 (91.4%), 1,181"
		"(88.2%), and 1,139 (85.1%) eyes, respectively. Fusarium(506, 37.2%) and"
		"Aspergillus species (417, 30.7%) predominated the hyaline fungal spectrum (1,133)"
		"and Curvularia species (39, 2.8%) were the highest among the dematiaceous"
		"isolates (218). CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this review presents"
		the epidemiological features and laboratory results of the largest series of
		fungal keratitis ever reported in the literature. Keratomycosis is predominant in
		young adults with trauma as the major predisposing factor. With fungal keratitis
		"being a major ophthalmologic problem in the tropical regions of the world, data"
		available on the epidemiological features of a large series would greatly help
		medical practitioners at primary and secondary health care centers in the
		management of the disease. A simple KOH preparation of corneal scraping alone is
		highly beneficial in confirming the diagnosis.

TI	-	Hypopyon in patients with fungal keratitis.
PG	-	470-5
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Hypopyon is common in eyes with fungal keratitis. The evaluation of
		"the clinical features, culture results and the risk factors for hypopyon and of"
		the possible correlation between hypopyon and the treatment outcome could be
		helpful for making treatment decisions. METHODS: The medical records of 1066
		inpatients (1069 eyes) with fungal keratitis seen at the Shandong Eye Institute
		from January 2000 to December 2009 were reviewed retrospectively for demographic
		"features, risk factors, clinical characteristics, laboratory findings and"
		"treatment outcomes. The incidence of hypopyon, the fungal culture positivity for"
		"hypopyon, risk factors for hypopyon and the effect of hypopyon on the treatment"
		and prognosis were determined. RESULTS: We identified 1069 eyes with fungal
		"keratitis. Of the 850 fungal culture-positive eyes, the Fusarium species was the"
		"most frequent (73.6%), followed by Alternaria (10.0%) and Aspergillus (9.0%)."
		"Upon admission, 562 (52.6%) eyes with hypopyon were identified. The hypopyon of"
		"66 eyes was evaluated via fungal culturing, and 31 eyes (47.0%) were positive. A"
		"total of 194 eyes had ocular hypertension, and 172 (88.7%) of these eyes had"
		hypopyon (P < 0.001). Risk factors for incident hypopyon included long duration
		"of symptoms (P < 0.001), large lesion size (P < 0.001) and infection caused by"
		the Fusarium and Aspergillus species (P < 0.001). The positivity of fungal
		culture for hypopyon was associated with duration of symptoms and lesion size.
		Surgical intervention was more common in cases with hypopyon (P < 0.001).
		Hypopyon was a risk factor for the recurrence of fungal keratitis after corneal
		transplantation (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Hypopyon is common in patients with
		severe fungal keratitis and can cause ocular hypertension. About half of the
		"hypopyon cases were positive based on fungal culture. Long duration of symptoms,"
		large lesion size and infection with the Fusarium and Aspergillus species were
		risk factors for hypopyon. The presence of hypopyon increases the likelihood of
		surgical intervention.

		report.
PG	-	6443-6449
LID	-	10.12998/wjcc.v9.i22.6443 [doi]
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: In recent years, the rate of immunosuppressed patients has increased"
		"rapidly. Invasive fungal infections usually occur in these patients, especially"
		those who have had hematological malignances and received chemotherapy.
		"Fusariosis is a rare pathogenic fungus, it can lead to severely invasive Fusarium"
		"infections. Along with the increased rate of immune compromised patients, the"
		incidence of invasive Fusarium infections has also increased from the past few
		years. Early diagnosis and therapy are important to prevent further development
		to a more aggressive or disseminated infection. CASE SUMMARY: We report a case of
		a 19-year-old male acute B-lymphocytic leukemia patient with fungal infection in
		"the skin, eyeball, and knee joint during the course of chemotherapy. We performed"
		"skin biopsy, microbial cultivation, and molecular biological identification, and"
		the pathogenic fungus was finally confirmed to be Fusarium solani. The patient
		was treated with oral 200 mg voriconazole twice daily intravenous administration
		"of 100 mg liposomal amphotericin B once daily, and surgical debridement."
		Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was administered to expedite neutrophil
		"recovery. The disseminated Fusarium solani infection eventually resolved, and"
		there was no recurrence at the 3 mo follow-up. CONCLUSION: Our case illustrates
		the early detection and successful intervention of a systemic invasive Fusarium
		infection. These are important to prevent progression to a more aggressive
		infection. Disseminate Fusarium infection requires the systemic use of antifungal
		agents and immunotherapy. Localized infection likely benefits from surgical
		debridement and the use of topical antifungal agents.

TI	-	Fungal endophthalmitis: fourteen years' experience from a center in India.
PG	-	1400-7
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: As fungal endophthalmitis is an emerging challenge, the study was"
		carried out to determine the prevalence and the spectrum of fungal agents causing
		"endophthalmitis from a single center, to identify the risk factors, and to"
		correlate clinical course of illness with the agents involved. METHODS: The
		microbiological and clinical records of all fungal endophthalmitis diagnosed
		during January 1992 through December 2005 at a tertiary center in India were
		"reviewed retrospectively. During this period, treatment protocol of the patients"
		"with fungal endophthalmitis was pars plana vitrectomy, instillation of"
		intravitreal amphotericin B (5 microg) and dexamethasone (400 microg).
		"Additionally, oral fluconazole (27 patients) or itraconazole (78 patients) was"
		given in 105 patients. RESULTS: Fungal endophthalmitis was diagnosed in 113
		"patients and they were categorized into: postcataract surgery (53 patients),"
		"posttrauma (48), and endogenous (12) groups. Aspergillus species was the most"
		"common (54.4%) agent isolated, followed by yeasts (24.6%), and melanized fungi"
		"(10.5%). Among Aspergilli, Aspergillus flavus was the most common (24.6%) species"
		whereas Candida tropicalis (8.8%) was in the yeast. Other rare agents isolated
		"include Fonsecaea pedrosoi, Fusarium solani, Paecilomyces lilacinus,"
		"Pseudallescheria boydii, Colletotrichum dematium, Cryptococcus neoformans, and"
		"Trichosporon cutaneum. Visual acuity after therapy remained <20/400 in 77.4%,"
		"64.3%, 50.0%, and 16.7% patients infected with Aspergillus species, yeasts,"
		"melanized fungi and other mycelial fungi, respectively. The outcome was"
		"unfavorable in 52.8%, 66.7%, and 33.3% patients with postoperative, posttrauma,"
		"and endogenous groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the largest"
		series of fungal endophthalmitis from a single center and highlights the fact
		that a vast array of fungi can cause endophthalmitis though Aspergilli are the
		common agents. The combination of pars plana vitrectomy and intravitreal
		amphotericin B with or without fluconazole/itraconazole was the common mode of
		"therapy in such patients. However, the main challenge is suspecting fungal"
		etiology at the time of presentation and accurately diagnosing those patients.

TI	-	Treatment of fusarium osteomyelitis in a diabetic foot ulcer complicated by
		antineoplastic chemotherapy.
PG	-	E37-E41
LID	-	10.25270/wnds/2022.e37e41 [doi]
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO) is a severe complication of
		diabetic foot ulcerations (DFUs). Fusarium osteomyelitis in patients who are
		severely immunocompromised is not well documented in current literature. Fusarium
		is an invasive fungal species that has been shown to respond poorly to antifungal
		"therapy alone, and bone debridement is usually required. Treatment for DFO may"
		"consist of surgical amputation, antimicrobial therapy, and/or conservative"
		surgery (CS) or bone debridement. CASE PRESENTATION: The authors present a case
		of Fusarium osteomyelitis in a 77-year-old female with type 2 diabetes and acute
		"myeloid leukemia, simultaneously undergoing chemotherapy. The patient had a DFU"
		to the second digit with DFO suggested by magnetic resonance imaging. Bone
		cultures revealed coagulase-negative staphylococci and Fusarium species. Due to
		"the patient's severely immunocompromised state, they were treated with CS and"
		joint antifungal and antibiotic therapy. The DFU was healed in 6 weeks with no
		"reoccurrence at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: This case report, to the authors'"
		"knowledge, is the first to demonstrate successful remission of Fusarium"
		osteomyelitis with a conservative procedure and adjunct antifungal therapy in an
		immunocompromised patient.

TI	-	Epidemiology and Early Bacteriology of Extremely Severe Burns from an LPG Tanker
		Explosion in Eastern China.
PG	-	478-485
LID	-	10.1007/s44197-022-00066-0 [doi]
AB	-	The incidence of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)-related accidents in China has
		"increased over the recent years. In addition, infection remains a big challenge"
		"in cases of severe burns. Therefore, the present study aimed to provide valuable"
		information for a better control of infections in the event of such disasters. In
		"this study, a total of 16 patients who suffered extremely severe burns after an"
		"LPG tanker explosion were included. Thereafter, bacteriological culture results"
		"were collected within a week. Of 16 patients, 13 (81.25%) were male and the"
		"average age of all patients was 60.63 years. In addition, the mean burned area"
		"was 83.03% TBSA. Additionally, a total of 553 organism cultures were conducted"
		"out of which 287 isolates (51.90%) showed positive results. Notably, 38.52% were"
		"Gram-negative bacteria, 7.59% were Gram-positive bacteria and 5.79% were fungi."
		"Moreover, the most prevalent Gram-negative bacteria were Stenotrophomonas"
		"maltophilia (28.97%) followed by Acinetobacter baumannii (28.53%), and Klebsiella"
		"pneumoniae (14.02%). On the other hand, the three most predominant Gram-positive"
		"bacteria were Enterococcus faecalis (33.33%), Staphylococcus aureus (28.89%) and"
		"Staphylococcus sciuri (17.78%). Furthermore, the most common fungi included"
		"Candida (38.24%), Fusarium (20.59%) and Aspergillus fumigatus (14.71%). With"
		"regard to the bacterial resistance patterns, carbapenem-resistant organisms"
		"included Acinetobacter baumannii (97.80%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (67.57%), and"
		"Klebsiella pneumoniae (75.56%). In addition, Staphylococcus sciuri,"
		"Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus were identified to be"
		methicillin-resistant. This study revealed that there was a high incidence of
		"infection in victims of severe burns as a result of mass burn accidents,"
		accompanied by early fungal infection.

AB	-	"Deoxynivalenol (DON) or ""vomitoxin"" is a mycotoxin produced by Fusarium species."
		Few food poisoning cases caused by DON have been reported since the 1990s in
		"China. However, on May 16, 2019, the Zhuhai Center for Disease Control and"
		"Prevention received a case report from primary school ""S"" that many students"
		began vomiting after eating breakfast. To discern the cause and control the
		"outbreak effectively, an epidemiological investigation was carried out. This"
		retrospective cohort study defined both suspected and probable cases of food
		poisoning using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple
		quadrupole mass spectrometry to detect 16 mycotoxins simultaneously. A total of
		"101 cases (14 suspected and 87 probable) were identified, with an overall attack"
		rate of 8.1%. All cases were in grades 1-3. The main symptoms of probable cases
		were vomiting (100%) and nausea (63%). The average incubation time was 25 min
		after eating. Comparison of students who ate breakfast provided by the school
		with those who did not revealed the relative risk was 6.0 (95% confidence
		intervals [CI] = 2.2-16) among students in grades 1-3. The concentration of DON
		"in the leftover raw breakfast noodles ranged from 6856 to 11,982 μg/kg and 878.3"
		to 1074.2 μg/kg in leftover cooked noodles. DON exposure was 1.3-1.6 μg/kg body
		weight for grades 1-2 and 1.7-2.1 μg/kg body weight for grade 3. The attack rate
		of grade 3 was 4.3 times higher than that for grades 1-2 (95% CI = 3.0-6.3). The
		"food poisoning outbreak on May 16, 2019 in primary school ""S"" in China, was"
		determined to be caused by DON-contaminated commercial raw noodles.

		"infections due to pathogenic fungi, including dermatophytes, Mucorales, Candida,"
		"Aspergillus, and Fusarium species. Here, we report a case of A. flavus mycetoma"
		confirmed by isolation and molecular identification. The case was a 38-year-old
		"male farmer with a seven-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, living in"
		"Khuzestan, southwest of Iran. The patient presented with a right foot swelling"
		associated with a nodule and multiple discharging sinuses following trauma

		nodule appeared at the site of the trauma two months after the injury. The
		initial diagnosis was based on direct microscopic examination of lesions scraping
		using 20% potassium hydroxide and radiology. Molecular analysis confirmed the
		"isolates to be A. flavus. In vitro susceptibility of the isolate to voriconazole,"
		"posaconazole, caspofungin, itraconazole, and amphotericin B was determined."
		"Treatment with voriconazole (200 mg twice daily) stopped the purulent discharge,"
		"reduced the swelling, and improved the clinical condition within two months. The"
		study emphasizes the importance of wearing footwear to prevent skin trauma as the

AB	-	"SIGNIFICANCE: The significance of the study is that, although conventional"
		culture remains the criterion standard for identifying the causative fungal
		"pathogens, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) may serve as a powerful and"
		high-throughput tool for the early and definitive diagnosis of high-risk patients
		with mycotic keratitis owing to high sensitivity and specificity. PURPOSE: This
		study was focused on comparing the results of PCR with traditional microbial
		studies for the detection and identification of fungal pathogens in patients with
		clinically suspected fungal keratitis. METHODS: Corneal scrapings were collected
		"from 59 patients with clinically suspected fungal keratitis for routine culture,"
		"staining, and seminested PCR assay for fungal pathogen identification. The"
		results of PCR were compared with a conventional microbial workup (smear and
		culture). The samples that were unidentified by culture but were amplified by PCR
		were further identified by nucleotide sequencing. RESULTS: Of the 59 patients
		"with suspected fungal keratitis, 38 (64.40%) were found to be positive by PCR"
		"assay, 24 (40.67%) by culture, 18 (20.3%) by potassium hydroxide wet mount, and 8"
		(13.5%) by Gram stains for fungal pathogens. All the 24 isolates found positive
		"with culture were also positive with PCR, so they had not been sequenced for"
		molecular identification. The remaining 14 isolates that were positive with PCR
		but negative with culture were further identified as Cladosporium
		"cladosporioides, Simplicillium species, Fusarium solani, Alternaria tenuissima,"
		"Chaetomium globosum, Penicillium citrinum, and Rhizopus microsporus by sequencing"
		up to the species level. CONCLUSIONS: The PCR was able to detect the presence of
		fungal pathogens in a high proportion of culture-negative cases. This study
		"suggests that PCR may serve as a rapid, important complement to traditional"
		culture with high-throughput means of fungal pathogen identification in patients
		with clinically suspected fungal keratitis.

		in immunocompromised patients. There have been few studies focusing on deep
		cutaneous mycoses and there are no data from Asian countries. This study aimed to
		"investigate clinical characteristics, underlying predisposing factors,"
		aetiological organisms and outcomes in patients with deep cutaneous mycoses. A
		retrospective medical record review of patients with deep cutaneous mycoses
		treated at a tertiary referral centre in Korea from 1999 to 2010. Forty-one cases
		of deep cutaneous mycosis were identified (median age: 49). Most patients (32/41)
		"had impaired immunological status, and seven of the remaining nine had a history"
		of physical trauma. Neutropenia and long-term use of antibiotics were detected in
		13 and 12 patients respectively. Nodular skin lesions were the most common type
		(17/41) and the morphology of the lesions varied. Fungal organisms were
		identified by culture and histopathology of skin specimens. Candida (16/41) was
		"the most common organism, followed by Aspergillus, Alternaria, Fusarium (4/41"
		"each). Systemic antifungal treatment was successful in 28 patients, while nine"
		patients died from the fungal infection. Our study may lead to improved insights
		into deep cutaneous mycoses as their incidence is increasing and they vary in
		different clinical settings.

TI	-	Mycotic keratitis in India: a five-year retrospective study.
PG	-	171-4
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Mycotic keratitis is a fungal infection of the cornea. This infection
		is difficult to treat and it can lead to severe visual impairment or blindness.
		"It is worldwide in distribution, but is more common in the tropics and"
		"subtropical regions. Trauma is the major predisposing factor, followed by ocular"
		"and systemic defects, prior application of corticosteroids, and prolonged use of"
		antibiotic eye-drops. The objective of this study was to determine causative
		agents and to identify the predisposing factors of mycotic keratitis.
		METHODOLOGY: Corneal scrapings from 90 corneal ulcer patients with suspected
		"fungal etiology were subjected to direct examination by 10% KOH mount, Gram stain"
		"and culture. RESULTS: This study included 90 subjects with corneal ulcers, based"
		"on clinical suspicion, of whom 41 cases were diagnosed with mycotic keratitis in"
		"the laboratory. Among these 41 cases, culture showed fungal growth only in 36"
		cases whereas the remaining five cases were positive only by potassium hydroxide
		(KOH) preparation. Males were more commonly affected and were mostly in the age
		group of 31-40 years. Aspergillus flavus was the most common fungus isolated
		followed by fusarium solani. CONCLUSION: Rapid diagnosis and early institution of
		antifungal therapy is necessary to prevent ocular morbidity and blindness.
		"Although culture helps in definite diagnosis and identification, direct"
		microscopic detection of fungal structures in corneal scrapes or biopsies permits
		a rapid presumptive diagnosis.

PG	-	1191-1195
LID	-	10.4103/ijo.IJO_2176_21 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: To compare the costs associated with medications and travel of patients
		with smear-proven bacterial keratitis and fungal keratitis in a tertiary care
		center in India. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of case records of a cohort of
		patients who presented between April 2017 and March 2018 to a tertiary care
		"center in India, with infectious keratitis who were smear-positive for bacteria"
		"or fungi, and whose costs of treatment and travel were supported by a"
		"philanthropic program. RESULTS: In total, 672 case records of 177 smear-positive"
		bacterial keratitis (BK) and 495 smear-positive fungal keratitis (FK) were
		"included in the study. Further, 62% of BK and 75% of FK received more than one"
		antimicrobial drug (P < 0.001). The mean total medication cost (INR) was
		significantly more in FK (959.1 ± 675.2) compared to BK (674.9 ± 463.7) (P <
		0.0001). The mean medication cost (INR) per visit was also more for FK (201.1 ±
		109.4) compared to BK (155.2 ± 84.1) (P < 0.0001). The mean total medication cost
		was significantly more for FK for both patients who healed with medical treatment
		"(611.6 ± 395.6 for BK, 801.5 ± 599.9 for FK, P = 0.0005) and for patients who"
		"required TPK (953.7 ± 653.1 for BK, 1374.6 ± 701.5 for FK, P = 0.0023) compared"
		to their respective counterparts in BK. CONCLUSION: Patients with fungal
		keratitis incurred significantly more on medications compared to patients with
		bacterial keratitis irrespective of whether they had healed with successful
		medical treatment or required therapeutic keratoplasty. Prolonged duration of
		treatment and the high costs of antifungal medications account for the
		significant economic burden of fungal keratitis.

LID	-	10.1007/s10561-019-09776-5 [doi]
AB	-	To evaluate the characteristics of microbiological contamination in donor corneas
		"preserved for medium-term. A total of 82 donated corneas from June 1, 2014 to"
		"November 30, 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. The corneas were preserved in"
		cornea chambers medium-term solution at 4-8 °C for keratoplasty. After removal of
		"the central corneas for transplantation, the corneoscleral rims were put back"
		into the medium for 1 month at room temperature (20-25 °C). The suspicious
		contaminated storage solutions indicated with transparency or color change were
		examined with bacteria and fungi cultivation for strain identification. The data
		"collected included gender, age, procurement site and causes of death of donors,"
		and follow-up of recipients. Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft
		Excel and SPSS 24.0. Significance level was set at a P value < 0.05. The overall
		"pathogen positive rate was 9.8% (n = 8), including 7 (87.5%) fungi and 1 (12.5%)"
		"bacteria. They were 2 (2.44%) Fusarium, 2 (2.44%) Chromomycosis, 1 (1.22%)"
		"Candida albicans, 1 (1.22%) Aspergillus versicolor, 1 (1.22%) Acremonium species,"
		and 1 (1.22%) Enterococcus. 5 contaminated corneas were used for penetrating
		keratoplasty; although four out of five (80%) had not been given antifungal drugs
		"during more than 6 months following-up period, none of the recipients was"
		"infected with a graft. Donor age (P = 0.839), gender (P = 0.062), procurement"
		sites (P = 0.713) and cause of death (P = 0.711) had no statistically significant
		influence on the contamination rate. All donor corneas have a possibility of
		microbiological contamination. Strict tissue preservation protocol but not
		antifungal drugs following keratoplasty seems necessary to prevent graft
		infection.

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To report the outcomes of therapeutic corneal transplant for managing
		fungal keratitis that is refractory to medical treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
		Retrospective data analyses of the medical records was performed on 17 patients
		who underwent a therapeutic corneal transplant for severe culture-proven fungal
		"keratitis between October 2006 and August 2013. We evaluated demographics, fungal"
		"organism type, surgical data, recurrence presentation, disease course, follow-up,"
		"and graft status. RESULTS: Mean patient age was 53.2 years (range, 33-81 y). The"
		male/female ratio was 12/5. All patients had positive microscopic evaluation and
		positive culture results for fungal infection. The most common fungal agent was
		Fusarium sp. (35%). Nine patients reported a history of injury to the cornea
		and/or contact with plant material or soil. The mean best-corrected visual acuity
		"at the initial visit was 2.45 logMAR unit (range, 0.52-3.10 logMAR unit). The"
		"mean follow-up was 14 months (range, 6-76 mo). Four patients underwent"
		evisceration surgery because of graft lysis or uncontrolled recurrent disease.
		Recurrence of the fungal infection after corneal transplant was seen in 8
		"patients (47.05%). The graft rejection rate was 18.18%. At the final visit, 5"
		"grafts were clear, 4 were translucent, and 2 were opaque. There were 2 phthisis"
		bulbi owing to catastrophic disease. The mean final best-corrected visual acuity
		"was 1.64 logMAR unit (range, 0.22-3.10 logMAR unit). CONCLUSIONS: Although"
		therapeutic corneal transplant has a higher incidence of infection recurrence and
		"graft failure, it continues to be an effective treatment for uncontrolled,"
		refractory fungal keratitis cases to save the affected eye.

AB	-	Fusarium species is a ubiquitous fungus that causes opportunistic infections. We
		present 26 cases of invasive fusariosis categorized according to the European
		Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG)
		criteria of fungal infections. All cases (20 proven and 6 probable) were treated
		from January 2000 until January 2010. We also review 97 cases reported since
		2000. The most important risk factors for invasive fusariosis in our patients
		"were compromised immune system, specifically lung transplantation (n = 6) and"
		"hematologic malignancies (n = 5), and burns (n = 7 patients with skin"
		"fusariosis), while the most commonly infected site was the skin in 11 of 26"
		"patients. The mortality rates among our patients with disseminated, skin, and"
		"pulmonary fusariosis were 50%, 40%, and 37.5%, respectively. Fusarium solani was"
		"the most frequent species, isolated from 49% of literature cases. Blood cultures"
		were positive in 82% of both current study and literature patients with
		"disseminated fusariosis, while the remaining 16% had 2 noncontiguous sites of"
		infection but negative blood cultures. Surgical removal of focal lesions was
		effective in both current study and literature cases. Skin lesions in
		immunocompromised patients should raise the suspicion for skin or disseminated
		fusariosis. The combination of medical monotherapy with voriconazole or
		amphotericin B and surgery in such cases is highly suggested.

TI	-	Infection Profile in Chronic Granulomatous Disease: a 23-Year Experience from a
		Tertiary Care Center in North India.
PG	-	319-328

AB	-	PURPOSE: Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is an inherited phagocytic disorder
		characterized by recurrent infections with usually catalase-positive organisms.
		Infections in CGD from developing countries are expected to be different from
		those in the Western countries. We report the profile of infections in children
		diagnosed with CGD from a tertiary care center in North India. METHODOLOGY: Case
		"records of children diagnosed with CGD at Pediatric Immunodeficiency Clinic,"
		"Advanced Pediatrics Centre, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and"
		"Research, Chandigarh, India, from August 1993 to April 2016 (23 years) were"
		analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-eight children were diagnosed to have CGD. Median
		"follow-up of patients was 2 years (interquartile range 0.75, 6.0). Staphylococcus"
		aureus and Pseudomonas spp. were the two most common causative bacteria isolated.
		Aspergillus was the most common fungus isolated. The most common organ involved
		"was the lung (94.7%). Liver abscesses were identified in 5 patients (13.2%), and"
		20 (52.6%) patients had lymphadenitis. Infections with Pseudomonas spp. were high
		in our cohort (15.7%) compared to the other studies. Infections with some unusual
		"organisms (e.g., Fusarium dimerium and Chryseobacterium gleum) were also seen in"
		our cohort. Children with X-linked CGD presented earlier and also had a greater
		number of infections as compared to autosomal recessive CGD. CONCLUSIONS: Various
		socioeconomic factors coupled with the lack of awareness and paucity of readily
		available diagnostic facilities for primary immunodeficiencies accounted for a
		late clinical presentation with severe infections and increased mortality (28.9%)
		"in our cohort. However, mortality was similar in X-linked and autosomal recessive"
		CGD as was the number of fungal infections. The incidence of infections and
		mortality was significantly lower after initiation of antibacterial and
		antifungal prophylaxis.

AB	-	The Fusarium species are one of the most common opportunistic fungal infections
		occurring in immunocompromised patients and are associated with high morbidity
		"and mortality. Common sites of infection include blood, skin, nasal passages,"
		"lungs, bone, and other visceral organs. There is a paucity of literature on"
		"Fusarium infections in the brain, and the true nature and extent of central"
		"nervous system involvement is not well described. To the authors' knowledge,"
		there have been no reported cases of Fusarium infection of the spine. The authors
		report the case of a man with acute myeloblastic leukemia and resultant
		"pancytopenia who presented with fungal sinusitis, upper- and lower-extremity"
		"weakness, and cardiopulmonary arrest. Imaging studies revealed a spinal cervical"
		intramedullary ring-enhancing lesion. Because of the progressive nature of his
		"symptoms, neurosurgical intervention involving a C2-3 laminectomy and drainage of"
		the lesion was performed. Intraoperative cultures and histopathology results were
		"positive for Fusarium species and, along with intraoperative findings, were"
		consistent with a fungus ball. The patient was placed on a regimen of intravenous
		"and intrathecal antifungal therapy. Unfortunately, his clinical condition"
		"declined postoperatively, and he ultimately died of disseminated infection."

		South Korea.
PG	-	211-218
LID	-	10.1111/myc.13544 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive fusariosis mainly affects immunocompromised patients
		including haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients and those with
		haematologic malignancy. There are limited studies on invasive fusariosis in the
		Asia-Pacific region. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical characteristics and
		outcomes of invasive and non-invasive fusariosis in South Korea.
		"PATIENTS/METHODS: From 2005 to 2020, patients with fusariosis who met the revised"
		European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer and the Mycoses Study
		"Group criteria for the definition of proven or probable invasive fusariosis, and"
		those with non-invasive fusariosis were retrospectively reviewed in a tertiary
		"medical centre in Seoul, South Korea. RESULTS: Overall, 26 and 75 patients had"
		"invasive and non-invasive fusariosis, respectively. Patients with invasive"
		"fusariosis commonly had haematologic malignancy (62%), were solid organ"
		"transplant recipients (23%), and had a history of immunosuppressant usage (81%)."
		"In non-invasive fusariosis, diabetes mellitus (27%) and solid cancer (20%) were"
		common underlying conditions. Disseminated fusariosis (54%) and invasive
		pulmonary disease (23%) were the most common clinical manifestations of invasive
		fusariosis; skin infection (48%) and keratitis (27%) were the most common
		manifestations of non-invasive fusariosis. Twenty-eight-day and in-hospital
		"mortalities were high in invasive fusariosis (40% and 52%, respectively). In"
		"multivariate analysis, invasive fusariosis (adjusted odds ratio, 9.6; 95%"
		confidence interval 1.3-70.8; p = .03) was an independent risk factor for 28-day
		mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with invasive fusariosis were frequently
		"immunocompromised, and more than half had disseminated fusariosis. Invasive"
		fusariosis was associated with poor prognosis.

TI	-	Characteristics and risk factors for mortality of invasive non-Aspergillus mould
		infections in patients with haematologic diseases: A single-centre 7-year cohort
		study.
PG	-	257-264
LID	-	10.1111/myc.13038 [doi]
AB	-	Since mould-active azole prophylaxis has become a standard approach for patients
		"with high-risk haematologic diseases, the epidemiology of invasive fungal"
		infections (IFIs) has shifted towards non-Aspergillus moulds. It was aimed to
		identify the epidemiology and characteristics of non-Aspergillus invasive mould
		infections (NAIMIs). Proven/probable NAIMIs developed in patients with
		haematologic diseases were reviewed from January 2011 to August 2018 at Catholic
		"Hematology hospital, Seoul, Korea. There were 689 patients with proven/probable"
		"invasive mould infections; of them, 46 (47 isolates) were diagnosed with NAIMIs."
		"Fungi of the Mucorales order (n = 27, 57.4%) were the most common causative"
		"fungi, followed by Fusarium (n = 9, 19.1%). Thirty-four patients (73.9%) had"
		"neutropenia upon diagnosis of NAIMIs, and 13 (28.3%) were allogeneic stem cell"
		"transplantation recipients. The most common site of NAIMIs was the lung (n = 27,"
		"58.7%), followed by disseminated infections (n = 8, 17.4%). There were 23.9%"
		"(n = 11) breakthrough IFIs, and 73.9% (n = 34) had co-existing bacterial or viral"
		"infections. The overall mortality at 6 and 12 weeks was 30.4% and 39.1%,"
		"respectively. Breakthrough IFIs (adjusted hazards ratio [aHR] = 1.99, 95% CI:"
		"1.3-4.41, P = .031) and surgical treatment (aHR = 0.09, 95% CI: 0.02-0.45,"
		P = .003) were independently associated with 6-week overall mortality. NAIMIs
		were not rare and occur as a complex form of infection often accompanied by
		breakthrough/mixed/concurrent IFIs and bacterial or viral infections. More active
		diagnostic efforts for NAIMIs are needed.

TI	-	The epidemiology of fusariosis in patients with haematological diseases. Gimema
		Infection Programme.
PG	-	272-6
AB	-	Fusariosis has been considered an emerging infection in patients with
		haematological malignancies. In a multicentre retrospective study on filamentous
		fungi infections in patients with haematological diseases over a period of 10
		"years in Italy, fusariosis was documented in six patients from two of the 14"
		centres with a 0.06% incidence in acute leukaemia. A literature search yielded
		177 cases of Fusarium infections in haematological diseases and acute leukaemia
		accounted for 71% of the underlying conditions. An increase from 0.5 to 3.8 cases
		per year was observed at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center of Houston in the
		"periods 1975-85 and 1986-95 respectively. Conversely, only 5.1 and 6.3 cases per"
		"year have been reported in the periods 1981-90 and 1991-96, respectively, from"
		the other centres in the world. Half of the cases have been observed in the USA.
		"In Europe, most of the cases have been observed in France and Italy. Invasive"
		"fusariosis is a rare complication in haematological diseases, as its overall"
		frequency does not seem to be significantly increased within the last 20 years.
		"However, its epidemiological distribution is not homogeneous and the possibility"
		of local clusters of infections by this deadly pathogen should be carefully
		considered.

		of the literature.
PG	-	204-212
LID	-	10.1111/myc.12590 [doi]
AB	-	"Recently, mycetoma was added to the World Health Organization's list of neglected"
		tropical disease priorities. Fusarium as a genus has been reported to cause
		"eumycetoma, but little is known about the species involved in this infection and"
		"their identification. In this study, molecular tools were applied to identify"
		Fusarium agents from human eumycetoma cases. The partial translation elongation
		factor 1-alpha (TEF-1α) gene was used as diagnostic parameter. Two additional
		"cases of eumycetoma, due to F. keratoplasticum and F. pseudensiforme,"
		"respectively, are presented. A systematic literature review was performed to"
		"assess general features, identification, treatment and outcome of eumycetoma"
		"infections due to Fusarium species. Of the 20 reviewed patients, the majority"
		"(75%) were male. Most agents belonged to the F. solani species complex, ie"
		"F. keratoplasticum, F. pseudensiforme, and an undescribed lineage of F. solani."
		"In addition, F. thapsinum, a member of Fusarium fujikuroi species complex was"
		"encountered. The main antifungal drugs used were itraconazole, ketoconazole and"
		"amphotericin B, but cure rates were low (15%). Partial response or relapse was"
		"observed in some cases, and a case ended in amputation. Clinical management of"
		eumycetoma due to Fusarium is complex and combination therapy might be required
		to increase cure rates.

TI	-	Necrotizing Skin and Soft Tissue Infection Due to Syncephalastrum Species and
		Fusarium solani Species Complex Following Open Tibia Fracture.
LID	-	10.3390/diagnostics12051163 [doi]
LID	-	1163
AB	-	Fungal necrotizing skin and soft tissue infection (NSSTI) represents a rare
		"clinical entity. An extremely rare case of NSSTI, following an open tibia"
		fracture in a 36-year-old male caused by both Syncephalastrum spp. and Fusarium
		solani species complex (SC) is presented. The infection was diagnosed through
		"direct microscopy, cultures and histology. The disease had a long course. The"
		"patient underwent a total of seven consecutive surgical debridements, while"
		proper and timely antifungal treatment was initiated and included liposomal
		amphotericin B and voriconazole. He gradually recovered and 4 years later he is
		completely functioning and healthy. Invasive fungal infections are
		well-documented causes of high morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised
		"individuals, whereas in immunocompetent hosts, trauma-related fungal infections"
		have also been reported. It is of note that Syncephalastrum spp. has very rarely
		"been identified to cause infection in immunocompromised or immunocompetent hosts,"
		whereas Fusarium spp. has rarely been involved in skin necrotic lesions in
		"non-immunocompromised individuals. A high suspicion index, especially in necrotic"
		"lesions in trauma patients, is pivotal for early diagnosis, which may lead to"
		lower mortality as well as lower amputation rates. Definite diagnosis through
		"microscopy, histology and/or cultures are of paramount importance, whereas PCR"
		testing may also be extremely useful.

LID	-	e87784
AB	-	Cross-reactivity of Fusarium species with serum galactomannan antigen (GMI) test
		has been observed. We sought to evaluate if GMI could help to early diagnose
		invasive fusariosis and to monitor treatment response. We reviewed the records of
		all patients with invasive fusariosis between 2008 and 2012 in three Brazilian
		hospitals. We selected patients who had at least 1 GMI test within 2 days before
		"or after the date of the first clinical manifestation of fusariosis, and analyzed"
		the temporal relationship between the first positive GMI test and the date of the
		"diagnosis of invasive fusariosis, and the kinetics of GMI in relation to"
		patients' response to treatment. We also selected 18 controls to determine the
		"sensitivity and specificity of the test. Among 18 patients, 15 (83%) had at least"
		"one positive GMI (median 4, range 1-15). The sensitivity and specificity of was"
		"83% and 67%, respectively. GMI was positive before the diagnosis of invasive"
		"fusariosis in 11 of the 15 cases (73%), at a median of 10 days (range 3-39), and"
		after the diagnosis in 4 cases. GMI became negative in 8 of the 15 patients; 3 of
		these 8 patients (37.5%) were alive 90 days after the diagnosis of fusariosis
		compared with 2 of 7 (29%) who did not normalize GMI (p = 1.0). GMI is frequently
		"positive in invasive fusariosis, and becomes positive before diagnosis in most"
		patients. These findings may have important implications for the choice of
		antifungal therapy in settings with high prevalence of invasive fusariosis.

TI	-	Seasonal trends of microbial keratitis in South India.
PG	-	1123-7
LID	-	10.1097/ICO.0b013e31825694d3 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: Previous studies suggest that fungal keratitis is more common in hot
		humid climates and that bacterial keratitis is independent of seasonal variation.
		This study analyzes seasonal trends in the incidence of fungal and bacterial
		keratitis at the Aravind Eye Hospital in southeast India. METHODS: Using
		"microbiology records from August 2006 to July 2009, retrospective analyses of"
		infectious keratitis were performed. Bacterial and fungal keratitis incidence
		data were analyzed for seasonal patterns. RESULTS: Among the 6967 infectious
		"keratitis cases, cultures were performed in 5221 (74.9%) cases; among them, 3028"
		"(58%) were positive. Of the culture-positive cases, 1908 (63%) and 1081 (35.7%)"
		"were of fungal and bacterial etiology, respectively. The predominant fungal"
		organism was Fusarium spp (42.3%) and the predominant bacterial organisms were
		"Streptococcus pneumoniae (35.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (24.3%), and Nocardia"
		spp (8.1%). Analyses revealed an uneven distribution of fungal keratitis
		throughout the year (P < 0.001) with peaks in July and January. No significant
		seasonal trend was observed for the combined bacterial keratitis group.
		CONCLUSIONS: A higher incidence of fungal keratitis occurs during the months
		"corresponding to the windy and harvest seasons, during which time infection from"
		vegetative corneal injury may be more likely. Robust screening efforts during
		these periods may mitigate visually debilitating sequelae from infectious
		keratitis.

TI	-	Epidemiological analysis of nail aspergillosis and non-dermatophyte moulds.
		Criteria for the involvement of Aspergillus in 102 cases of onychomycosis at
		"Montpellier University Hospital, France (1991-2019)."
PG	-	1546-1553
LID	-	10.1111/myc.13366 [doi]
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Moulds are often wrongly considered contaminants, not very sensitive"
		"to conventional antifungal treatments, but they may cause ungual hyphomycosis,"
		"particularly Aspergillus. Due to the lack of precise diagnostic criteria, their"
		real impact is underestimated. OBJECTIVES: Retrospective descriptive analysis of
		all ungual hyphomycosis cases diagnosed at Montpellier Hospital from 1991 to 2019
		to: (i) determine the incidence of onychomycosis by pseudo-dermatophytes and
		moulds; (ii) perform an epidemiological analysis of nail aspergillosis; and (iii)
		provide simple criteria for mould involvement in onychopathy. PATIENTS/METHODS:
		"Data concerning 4053 patients were collected: age, sex, onychomycosis location,"
		"direct examination results, species(s) identified and fungal co-infections."
		"Moreover, clinical data of patients with nail aspergillosis were analysed to"
		"identify potential contributing factors, and the classical criteria for mould"
		involvement in onychopathy were critically reviewed. RESULTS: A
		pseudo-dermatophyte or a mould was involved in nail colonisation in 17.25% of
		patients (men/women ratio: 0.70; mean age: 53.1 years). The identified
		"hyphomycetes belonged mainly to the genera Fusarium (45.68%), Scopulariopsis"
		(30.23%) and Aspergillus (16.94%). Analysis of the clinical reports of 102
		patients with ungual aspergillosis (men/women ratio: 0.67; mean age: 56.3 years)
		"identified cardiovascular (43.9%), endocrine (25.8%), cancer (19.7%) and skin"
		(18.2%) diseases as contributing factors. CONCLUSIONS: The adoption of simple and
		"reliable criteria (ie, characteristic filaments on direct microscopic examination"
		"after periodic acid-Schiff staining, growth at seeding points in culture) allows"
		determining the formal involvement of a mould in chronic onychopathies and
		avoiding possible side effects and costs of empirical or inappropriate and
		repetitive treatments.

		"Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia."
PG	-	148
LID	-	10.1186/s12886-016-0330-1 [doi]

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Fungal keratitis is an important cause of corneal blindness all over
		the world. Although there are several reports on fungal keratitis from developing
		"and developed countries, fungal keratitis in Ethiopia is poorly known. The aim of"
		this study was to determine the prevalence of fungal keratitis and spectrum of
		fungi implicated in causing the infection. METHODS: The present study was a
		single institutional cross-sectional study carried out in Minilik II Memorial
		"Hospital eye clinic, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia from September 2014 to August 2015."
		Corneal scraping was obtained under aseptic condition with sterile 21 gauge
		needle by an ophthalmologist from patients suspected of microbial keratitis. Each
		scraping was inoculated onto Sabouraud Dextrose Agar in C-shaped streaks and
		incubated at 25 °C aerobically for four weeks. Cultures of mycelia fungi were
		identified by examining macroscopic and microscopic characteristics of their
		colonies. Yeasts were identified by employing biochemical and assimilation test
		"procedures and using CHROMagar Candida culture. All data were coded, double"
		entered and analyzed using SPSS version 20. RESULT: Out of 153 cases of microbial
		"keratitis, fungi were recovered from 69 patients giving fungal keratitis"
		prevalence of 45.1. Patients from rural areas were significantly affected than
		patients in urban regions (P = 0.005). Age groups of 25-34 (P = 0.017) and 15-24
		years (P = 0.008) were significantly affected. Fungal keratitis was significantly
		"associated with farmers (P = 0.0001), daily laborers (P = 0.0001), unemployed"
		(P = 0001) and students (P = 0.004). Fungal keratitis was statistically
		"associated with trauma (P = 0.006), and diabetes (P = 0.024). Seventy six fungal"
		"isolates were recovered, of which molds accounted 63 (82.9 %) of the total"
		isolates. Fusarium and Aspergillus species were the two predominant molds
		accounting 27.6 and 25 % of the total isolates respectively. Yeast isolates
		accounted only 17.1 %. CONCLUSION: High prevalence of fungal keratitis recorded
		"in the present study, highlights the need for nationwide study on fungal"
		keratitis and precise identification of the causative fungi and institution of
		appropriate treatment strategy.

		and review of fungal keratitis.
PG	-	322-8
AB	-	"PURPOSE: To report and define the clinical presentation, hygienic practices,"
		"treatment regimens, and visual sequelae of contact lens wearers infected with"
		Fusarium keratitis in the New York City metropolitan area and to review the
		literature on Fusarium keratitis. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was
		conducted on three patients diagnosed with Fusarium keratitis by corneal fungal
		culture in the New York City metropolitan area from October 2005 to February
		2006. None of the patients had a history of recent ocular trauma before
		infection. RESULTS: All three patients used disposable soft contact lenses and
		ReNu with MoistureLoc 1 month before infection. All patients experienced a
		unilateral stabbing pain of the affected eye after removal of the contact lens.
		Patients had corneal ulcers ranging from 1 to 5 mm in diameter and were all
		initially treated with topical antibiotics and steroids for a period between 7
		"and 52 days. Antifungal treatment was eventually prescribed to all patients, with"
		topical natamycin 5% every hour being the most common. One patient required
		"corneal transplantation, and the other two patients recovered visual acuity"
		comparable to their baseline acuity. CONCLUSIONS: A delay in diagnosis and
		prolonged treatment delay of Fusarium keratitis is associated with significant
		comorbidity. Physicians must have a higher index of suspicion for fungal
		keratitis in contact lens wearers to facilitate in early diagnosis and treatment.

LID	-	10.1093/mmy/myw044 [doi]
AB	-	Moulds and arthroconidial yeasts are potential life-threatening agents of
		fungemia in immunocompromised patients. Fast and accurate identification (ID) of
		"these pathogens hastens initiation of targeted antifungal therapy, thereby"
		improving the patients' prognosis. We describe a new strategy that enabled the
		identification of moulds and arthroconidial yeasts directly from positive blood
		cultures by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS). Positive blood cultures (BCs) with
		Gram staining showing hyphae and/or arthroconidia were prospectively selected and
		submitted to an in-house protein extraction protocol. Mass spectra were obtained
		"by Vitek MS™ system, and identifications were carried out with in the research"
		use only (RUO) mode with an extended database (SARAMIS™ [v.4.12] plus in-house
		"database). Fusarium solani, Fusarium verticillioides, Exophiala dermatitidis,"
		"Saprochaete clavata, and Trichosporon asahii had correct species ID by MALDI-TOF"
		MS analysis of positive BCs. All cases were related to critically ill patients
		with high mortality fungemia and direct ID from positive BCs was helpful for
		rapid administration of targeted antifungal therapy.

AB	-	"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to compare the predisposing factors,"
		"clinical findings, treatment results, and prognosis for polymicrobial keratitis."
		"METHODS: In this retrospective comparative case study, we identified the cases of"
		polymicrobial keratitis from the microbiological records (n = 649) at Balcalı
		"Hospital, Çukurova University (Adana, Turkey; October 2010-2018). We included all"
		the cases of infectious keratitis with two different types of microbial agents
		"and grouped them as follows: group 1 (n = 25), bacterium-fungus coexistence;"
		"group 2 (n = 12), herpes simplex virus (HSV) or Acanthamoeba with bacterial"
		"infection; and group 3 (n = 7), HSV or Acanthamoeba with fungal infection. We"
		"compared the clinical and microbiological characteristics, and treatment outcomes"
		"among the groups. RESULTS: In our study, we found that 44 infectious keratitis"
		cases (6.7%) were of polymicrobial nature. The mean follow-up period was
		"11.4 ± 17.8 months. In total, 17 different bacteria along with 3 different fungi,"
		"HSV, and Acanthamoeba were isolated. The most common bacterium was Staphylococcus"
		epidermidis (25%). Most of the fungal pathogens were filamentous. Patients with
		initial treatment failure and requiring surgical intervention had larger
		"infiltrates (p = 0.023, p = 0.003, respectively) than other patients. Older age"
		was associated with delayed recovery and poor visual prognosis. CONCLUSIONS:
		"Bacterial-fungus coexistence is the most common combination among patients, but"
		other combinations should also be considered for suspected polymicrobial
		etiology. The corneal infiltrate size may be an important indicator of the course
		of disease and response to treatment. A closer and longer follow-up period should
		be planned for older patients.

TI	-	Post-traumatic fungal endophthalmitis--a prospective study.
PG	-	13-7
AB	-	"PURPOSE: To study the incidence, clinical presentation, and the response of"
		anti-fungals in cases of fungal endophthalmitis following open globe injury.
		METHODS: This is a prospective study of eight cases of post-traumatic fungal
		endophthalmitis among 110 patients who presented to us with open globe injury
		between August 2003 and January 2005. Patients with panophthalmitis were
		eviscerated and rest received intravitreal amphotericin B. Pars plana vitrectomy
		along with intravitreal miconazole was given in patients with inadequate response
		to intravitreal amphotericin. RESULTS: Two patients had panophthalmitis at the
		time of presentation and were eviscerated. Six different organisms were isolated
		from the culture of intraocular specimen of eight patients. The yield of vitreous
		aspirate was 87.5% and that of aqueous aspirate was 66.6%. Aspergillus sp. and
		Fusarium sp. were isolated in 62.5% of cases. Minimum inhibitory concentration of
		amphotericin B and miconazole was less than 3 microg/ml for all organisms except
		"for Paecilomyces lilacinus and Fusarium solani, respectively. In total, 37.5% of"
		patient had final visual acuity of 20/400 or better. CONCLUSIONS: Fungal
		endophthalmitis is a relatively rare complication of open globe injury. The final
		visual outcome after fungal endophthalmitis is dismal. Aspergillus fumigatus was
		found to be the most virulent organism. All organisms were found to be sensitive
		"to amphotericin B, except P. lilacinus, which was sensitive to miconazole."
		Repeated intravitreal injection may be required to control the infection. The
		virulence of the organism and the site of injury are the main determinants of
		final visual outcome.

AB	-	PURPOSE: To report the therapeutic efficacy of intracameral voriconazole
		injection in the treatment of fungal endophthalmitis resulting from keratitis.
		"DESIGN: Retrospective, single-institution, consecutive case series. METHODS:"
		Microbiologic and medical records were reviewed for patients with positive
		intraocular culture results or proven pathologic features for fungal organisms
		and clinically diagnosed fungal endophthalmitis resulting from keratitis. Ten
		eyes were treated with an intracameral injection of 100 microg voriconazole.
		"Clinical characteristics, treatment, and causative organisms were analyzed."
		RESULTS: Fusarium and Aspergillus were the most common causative organisms.
		Voriconazole was injected intracamerally from 1 to 8 times. Of the 7 patients who
		"received 5 or more repeat injections, 6 were caused by Fusarium and 1 by"
		Acremonium. In the remaining 3 patients who were administered 4 or fewer
		"voriconazole injections, the causative organisms were Aspergillus and Alternaria."
		CONCLUSIONS: Intracameral voriconazole injection may be an effective treatment
		for fungal endophthalmitis contiguously spreading from keratitis.

PG	-	792-798
LID	-	10.1002/ajh.25808 [doi]
AB	-	Invasive fungal infections (IFI) are a significant source of morbidity and
		mortality for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic
		syndromes (MDS). Given the heterogeneity of the population receiving
		"hypomethylating agents (HMA), it is difficult for clinicians to accurately assess"
		their patients' risk of infection. Literature on the incidence of IFI following
		HMA is limited to several studies of azacitidine. The primary objective of this
		retrospective study was to establish the incidence of IFI in HMA treated AML/MDS
		patients at a large U.S. comprehensive cancer center. Secondary objectives
		included comparing incidence of IFI among pre-specified subgroups to identify
		"potential risk factors for IFI. Two hundred three patients with AML, intermediate"
		to very high risk MDS or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia who received at least
		"two cycles of HMA were included. The incidence of IFI, as defined by the European"
		Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer / Invasive Fungal Infections
		"Cooperative Group criteria, was 9.6%, with 20 IFI diagnosed following HMA (three"
		"proven, four probable, 13 possible). Among the proven cases of IFI, molds"
		included Scedosporium and Fusarium spp. Eleven patients who developed IFIs were
		neutropenic upon initiating HMA. The majority (17/20) of infections occurred
		"during the first four cycles. Given this incidence, mold-active prophylaxis can"
		be considered in patients who are neutropenic at the start of therapy.

TI	-	Non-Candida fungal infections after bone marrow transplantation: risk factors and
		outcome.
PG	-	497-503
AB	-	"PURPOSE: To determine the incidence, risk factors, and outcome of non-Candida"
		fungal infections in a bone marrow transplant population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A
		"consecutive series of 1,186 patients who underwent bone marrow transplant at the"
		University of Minnesota Hospital between 1974 and 1989 were analyzed for the
		occurrence of a post-transplant non-Candida fungal infection. The risk factors
		"were analyzed with regard to clinical characteristics such as age, sex, primary"
		"disease process, type of transplant, recipient cytomegalovirus serostatus, time"
		"to engraftment, and the presence of graft-versus-host disease. RESULTS: In this"
		"population, 123 of 1,186 patients (10%) developed a non-Candida fungal infection"
		within 180 days of transplant. The majority of infections (85%) occurred in
		"allogeneic recipients, and 58% of infections were prior to white blood cell"
		"engraftment. The most common isolates were Aspergillus species (70%), Fusarium"
		"species (8%), and Alternaria species (5%). Although 47% of infections involved a"
		"single organ or site, 44% were disseminated and 9% were isolated fungemias. Only"
		17% of patients survived. Sixty-eight percent of deaths were related to the
		"fungal infection. In univariate analysis, allogeneic transplant, positive"
		"recipient cytomegalovirus serostatus, delayed engraftment, and recipient age of"
		greater than or equal to 18 years were identified as risk factors for non-Candida
		fungal infection. All of these factors except for recipient age were
		"independently significant in multivariate analysis. In allogeneic recipients,"
		"positive cytomegalovirus serostatus, delayed engraftment, and age of greater than"
		or equal to 18 years were each significantly associated with a greater risk of
		fungal infection; none of these factors were independently significant in the
		autologous recipients. CONCLUSION: Fungal infections remain a major cause of
		morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing bone marrow transplant. More
		"effective antifungal prophylaxis and therapy, earlier diagnosis, and transplant"
		regimens incurring a brief period of neutropenia may substantially reduce the
		incidence and clinical impact of these infections.

AB	-	"Despite increasing reports of life-threatening Fusarium infections, little is"
		"known about its pathogenesis and management. To evaluate the epidemiology,"
		"clinicopathologic features, and outcome of invasive fusariosis in patients with"
		"hematologic cancer, we conducted a retrospective study of invasive fusarial"
		infections in patients with hematologic malignancy treated at a referral cancer
		"center over a 10-year period (1986 to 1995), as well as a literature review."
		Forty patients with disseminated and three patients with invasive lung infection
		were included in the analysis. All patients were immunocompromised. The infection
		occurred in three patients postengraftment following bone marrow transplantation.
		"All patients were diagnosed antemortem. Thirteen patients responded to therapy,"
		but the infection relapsed in two of them. Response was associated with
		"granulocyte transfusions, amphotericin B lipid formulations (four patients each),"
		and an investigational triazole (two patients). Resolution of infection was only
		seen in patients who ultimately recovered from myelosuppression. Portal of entry
		"was the skin (33%), the sinopulmonary tree (30%), and unknown (37%). Fusarium"
		"causes serious morbidity and mortality, and may mimic aspergillosis. The"
		"infection seems to respond to newer therapeutic approaches, but only in patients"
		"with ultimate recovery from myelosuppression, and it may relapse if neutropenia"
		recurs.

AB	-	"In a retrospective study, we investigated 52 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded"
		(FFPE) samples from cats with histologically confirmed cutaneous and subcutaneous
		mycoses to determine if the pathogens could be identified by molecular methods.
		Aim of the study was to obtain a deep understanding of the spectrum of infectious
		"agents, which, as we hypothesized, was not available by histopathology alone."
		Detection of feline and fungal DNA was achieved in 92.3% and 94.2% of the
		"samples, respectively. Most of the subcutaneous infections in cats were caused by"
		"Alternaria spp. (63.5%), followed by Cryptococcus neoformans (7.7%), Histoplasma"
		"capsulatum (5.8%), Sporothrix spp. (3.8%), Aspergillus vitricola, Aureobasidium"
		"pullulans, Exophiala attenuata, Fusarium oxysporum, Lecythophora cateniformis,"
		"Microsporum canis, and Phialophora sp. (1.9% each). The results from molecular"
		identification indicate that correct identifications of the fungal pathogens by
		histology alone were rarely possible. The spectrum of fungal pathogens identified
		after DNA extraction from FFPE samples was much broader than that expected by
		classical histopathology. This was especially noted in alternariosis in that the
		micromorphological pattern in tissue was misleading and could be confused with
		"that of cryptococcosis. Due to different susceptibilities to antifungal agents,"
		"it is important to arrive at a definitive diagnosis, which might be possible by"
		"examination of the fungus recovered in culture and/or molecular methods, in"
		addition to the histopathologic techniques.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Mycotic keratitis is an important cause of corneal blindness world
		over including India. Geographical location and climate are known to influence
		the profile of fungal diseases. While there are several reports on mycotic
		"keratitis from southern India, comprehensive clinico-microbiological reports from"
		eastern India are few. The reported prevalence of mycotic keratitis are
		"36.7%,36.3%,25.6%,7.3% in southern, western, north- eastern and northern India"
		"respectively. This study reports the epidemiological characteristics,"
		microbiological diagnosis and treatment outcome of mycotic keratitis at a
		tertiary eye care center in eastern India. METHODS: A retrospective review of
		medical and microbiology records was done for all patients with laboratory proven
		"fungal keratitis. RESULTS: Between July 2006 and December 2009, 997 patients were"
		clinically diagnosed as microbial keratitis. While no organisms were found in
		"25.4% (253/997) corneal samples, 23.4% (233/997) were bacterial, 26.4% (264/997)"

		or without bacteria and 23.4% (233/997) were microsporidial with or without
		"bacteria. Two hundred fifteen of 264 (81.4%, 215/264) samples grew fungus in"
		culture while 49 corneal scrapings were positive for fungal elements only in
		direct microscopy. Clinical diagnosis of fungal keratitis was made in 186 of 264
		(70.5%) cases. The microscopic detection of fungal elements was achieved by 10%
		potassium hydroxide with 0.1% calcoflour white stain in 94.8%(238/251) cases.
		"Aspergillus species (27.9%, 60/215) and Fusarium species (23.2%, 50/215) were the"
		"major fungal isolates. Concomitant bacterial infection was seen in 45 (17.1%,"
		45/264) cases of mycotic keratitis. Clinical outcome of healed scar was achieved
		"in 94 (35.6%, 94/264) cases. Fifty two patients (19.7%, 52/264) required"
		"therapeutic PK, 9 (3.4%, 9/264) went for evisceration, 18.9% (50/264) received"

		(16/264) were unchanged and 16.3% (43/264) were lost to follow up. Poor prognosis
		"like PK (40/52, 75.9%, p < 0.001) and BCL (30/50, 60%, p < 0.001) was seen in"
		significantly larger number of patients with late presentation (> 10 days).
		CONCLUSIONS: The relative prevalence of mycotic keratitis in eastern India is
		"lower than southern, western and north-eastern India but higher than northern"
		"India, however, Aspergillus and Fusarium are the predominant genera associated"
		with fungal keratitis across India. The response to medical treatment is poor in
		patients with late presentation.

AB	-	Invasive fungal disease (IFD) shows distinct regional incidence patterns and
		epidemiological features depending on the geographic region. We conducted a
		prospective survey in eight centres in Brazil from May 2007 to July 2009. All
		haematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients and patients with acute myeloid
		leukaemia (AML) or myelodysplasia (MDS) were followed from admission until 1 year
		(HCT) or end of consolidation therapy (AML/MDS). The 12-month cumulative
		"incidence (CI) of proven or probable IFD was calculated, and curves were compared"
		using the Grey test. Among 237 AML/MDS patients and 700 HCT recipients (378
		"allogeneic, 322 autologous), the 1-year CI of IFD in AML/MDS, allogeneic HCT and"
		"autologous HCT was 18.7%, 11.3% and 1.9% (p <0.001), respectively. Fusariosis (23"
		"episodes), aspergillosis (20 episodes) and candidiasis (11 episodes) were the"
		"most frequent IFD. The 1-year CI of aspergillosis and fusariosis in AML/MDS,"
		"allogeneic HCT and autologous HCT were 13.4%, 2.3% and 0% (p <0.001), and 5.2%,"
		"3.8% and 0.6% (p 0.01), respectively. The 6-week probability of survival was 53%,"
		and was lower in cases of fusariosis (41%). We observed a high burden of IFD and
		a high incidence and mortality for fusariosis in this first multicentre
		epidemiological study of IFD in haematological patients in Brazil.

AB	-	The genus Fusarium is ubiquitous in the environment and has been emerging as an
		opportunistic human pathogen. We report the case of a 65-year-old man with a
		"history of neuroischemic, otherwise unamenable to revascularization, diabetic"
		"foot, who was admitted due to an infected deep foot ulcer. Despite conventional"
		"antibiotic and wound care treatment, no improvement was initially observed. A"
		"reappraisal of the diagnosis, with microbiological and histological analyses,"
		documented infection of the foot ulcer with Fusarium oxysporum. Clinical
		improvement was noted under prolonged oral voriconazole therapy. The present case
		broadens the differential diagnosis of diabetic foot infection. Subcutaneous
		"fusariosis should be considered in recalcitrant infected diabetic ulcers, as"
		early diagnosis and management may help prevent amputation and life-threatening
		disease.

PG	-	2263-7
LID	-	10.1016/j.ophtha.2010.03.048 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: Fungal keratitis is a serious ocular infection that is considered to
		be rare among contact lens wearers. The recent Fusarium keratitis outbreak raised
		questions regarding the background rate of Fusarium-related keratitis and other
		"fungal keratitis in this population. DESIGN: Retrospective, multicenter case"
		series. PARTICIPANTS: Six hundred ninety-five cases of fungal keratitis cases who
		presented to 1 of 10 tertiary medical centers from 2001 to 2007. METHODS: Ten
		tertiary care centers in the United States performed a retrospective review of
		culture-positive fungal keratitis cases at their centers between January 2001 and
		"December 2007. Cases were identified using microbiology, pathology, and/or"
		"confocal microscopy records. Information was collected on contact lens status,"
		"method of diagnosis, and organism(s) identified. The quarterly number of cases by"
		contact lens status was calculated and Poisson regression was used to evaluate
		presence of trends. The Johns Hopkins Medicine Institutional Review Board (IRB)
		and the IRBs at each participating center approved the research. MAIN OUTCOME
		MEASURES: Quarterly number of fungal keratitis cases and fungal species. RESULTS:
		We identified 695 fungal keratitis cases; 283 involved the use of contact lenses.
		The quarterly number of Fusarium cases increased among contact lens wearers
		"(CLWs) during the period that ReNu with MoistureLoc (Bausch & Lomb, Rochester,"
		"NY) was on the market, but returned to prior levels after withdrawal of the"
		product from the market. The quarterly frequency of other filamentous fungi cases
		showed a statistically significant increase among CLWs comparing October 2004
		through June 2006 with July 2006 through December 2007 with January 2001 through
		September 2004 (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The quarterly number of Fusarium fungal
		keratitis cases among CLWs returned to pre-Renu with Moistureloc levels after
		"removal of the product from the market. However, the number of other filamentous"
		"fungal keratitis cases, although small, seems to have increased among refractive"
		CLWs. Reasons for these apparent increases are unclear.

AB	-	"PURPOSE: To report the epidemiologic features, laboratory findings, and treatment"
		outcomes of patients with fungal keratitis (FK) during a busy farming period
		"(May, June, and September to November) in Heilongjiang Province, China. DESIGN:"
		"Retrospective, observational case series. METHODS: In total, 251 patients"
		"diagnosed with FK at the Eye Hospital, First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin"
		"Medical University, from 2017 to 2021 were identified. Medical records were"
		"retrospectively analyzed, and demographic features, risk factors, monthly"
		"distributions, clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, treatment"
		"strategies, and prognostic data were collected. RESULTS: The number of FK cases"
		in the busy farming period accounted for 74.1% (186/251) of the total. The mean
		patient age was 58.2±9.5 years. Males (66.7%) were more likely to develop FK than
		"females (33.3%), and plant-related trauma was the main cause in 80.1% (149/186)"
		of the cases. The most common causative fungal species was Fusarium (34.9%). In
		vivo confocal microscopy had the highest positivity rate for FK diagnosis
		"(94.6%). The depth of hypopyon, depth of hyphae or spores, and infiltrate width"
		were significantly positively correlated with delayed presentation. CONCLUSIONS:
		Patients with a longer time of presentation to the hospital were more likely to
		undergo surgery because of topical medical therapy failure. The most important
		measures for FK prevention are the use of eye protection during outdoor work and
		visiting the hospital for treatment as soon as possible after eye injury.

		Report of a Case and Review of Literature.
PG	-	277-288
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-020-00524-y [doi]
AB	-	Eumycetomas are chronic suppurative granulomas caused by fungi characterised by
		"invasive tumefactive lesions, sinuses and discharging grains. Herein, we describe"
		a case of pedal eumycetoma due to Fusarium solani sensu stricto in a person with
		diabetes mellitus. A 45-year-old gentleman presented with an insidious onset
		swelling over his right foot with nodules and discharging grains. He had received
		"itraconazole and anti-tuberculous therapy elsewhere, without response."
		Re-evaluation included a biopsy which confirmed eumycetoma and newly diagnosed
		"diabetes. Surgical excision followed by histopathological, microbiological and"
		"multigene sequencing analyses [translation elongation factor, calmodulin and"
		internal transcribed spacer region of rDNA] of the mould on culture were
		performed. Histopathology revealed septate fungal hyphae amidst a dense
		inflammatory infiltrate (Splendore-Hoeppli) reaction. Oral voriconazole was
		started and good glycemic control attained. Tissue growth sequences showed > 99%
		similarity with Fusarium solani sensu stricto. Antifungal susceptibility testing
		showed lowest MIC to voriconazole (0.5 mg/L). The patient showed excellent
		response to combined therapeutic modality with a near-complete resolution in size
		of lesion and obliteration of sinuses following 4 months of therapy and is
		planned for prolonged voriconazole therapy till complete radiological resolution.
		Diabetes predisposes to fungal infections of foot but eumycetomas are uncommon.
		Combined surgery and antifungals can improve morbidity and avoid amputations.

AB	-	To determine fungal species distribution of interdigital intertrigo among
		"seafarers in Dakar, Senegal, a cross-sectional study was carried out from May to"
		August 2017 among seafarers clinically diagnosed with interdigital intertrigo. A
		questionnaire was filled to each patient before sampling the affected folds and
		transporting to Aristide Le Dantec University Hospital where mycological analyses
		"were realized. Species identification by MALDI-TOF MS was performed in Marseille,"
		"France. In total, 169 men (21-66 years) were included. Few of them (3%) had a"
		high level of education and the duration of the mycosis exceed 10 years for 88%
		of patients. Direct microscopic examination (ME) was positive in 34.3%. Among
		"samples with positive ME, 58.6% had positive culture. An overall incidence of"
		30.2% was found. Patients with confirmed cases aged between 28 and 66 years.
		"Among them, those between 36-50 years were predominant (52.9%). Those with a high"
		"level of education were less representative (2%). For 52.1% of patients, the"
		"duration of the mycosis was superior to 10 years. Furthermore, 57% of cases were"
		significantly associated with other types of tinea pedis and/or onychomycosis
		(P=0.03). Culture was positive in 23.7% isolating 43 strains successfully
		identified at the species level by MALDI-TOF MS for 31 isolates: 20 Candida and
		11 dermatophytes. The rest was identified only at the genus level belonged to
		"Fusarium. In definitive, MALDI-TOF MS could be a useful tool for routine and fast"
		"identification of dermatophytes, yeasts and NDFF in clinical mycology"
		laboratories.

PG	-	1077-88
AB	-	Clinical data from 10 episodes of disseminated infection with Fusarium among
		eight recipients of bone marrow transplants and from 31 cases reported previously
		in the literature were analyzed in an effort to characterize the natural history
		of this rare infection and its response to therapy. The characteristic signs of
		"fusarial infection--disseminated skin nodules, fungemia, and multiple-organ"
		involvement--are results of its propensity for early spread. From a review of the
		"literature and our own experience, it appears that recovery of phagocytic"
		mechanisms (the primary immunologic defenses against Fusarium) in the form of
		rising neutrophil counts is mandatory for clinical resolution. Even after a graft
		"begins to function adequately, Fusarium may not be completely eradicated, as"
		evidenced by the high incidence of recurrence among patients with subsequent
		neutropenic episodes. Fusarium is highly resistant to conventional antifungal
		"drugs in vitro, but its progression may be slowed by intensive antifungal therapy"
		until the recovery of adequate neutrophil levels.

AB	-	Rapid identification of causative microorganisms of microbial keratitis (MK) and
		knowledge of the most common local pathogens are prerequisites for rational
		antimicrobial therapy. We retrospectively reviewed the characteristics of MK
		diagnosed at the IRCCS Arcispedale Santa Maria Nuova of Reggio Emilia (Italy) in
		"a 5-years period, where the Ophthalmologist Unit is a reference center for"
		"corneal infections. During the study period, 183 MK were evaluated through"
		"corneal scrapings cultures. The positivity rate was 54,1%. A total of 107"
		microorganisms have been isolated: Acanthamoeba species was the etiologic agent
		in 19 cases. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were more
		"frequently isolated in bacterial keratitis, while Fusarium spp., Candida"
		"albicans, and Alternaria alternata were predominant among the fungal isolates."
		Strict cooperation between ophthalmologists and clinical microbiologists is
		advisable to allow the best diagnostic approach for MK.

AB	-	PURPOSE: To investigate the quantity and severity of contact lens complications
		"referred into Hull Royal Infirmary Ophthalmic A&E, their impact on resources and"
		whether their management and treatment was appropriate. METHODS: A survey was
		conducted over a 7-month period at Hull Royal Infirmary Ophthalmic A&E Unit. In
		"this time 100 patients were enrolled, all completed a questionnaire including"
		"information about lens type and wearing schedule, and were photographed. All were"
		"examined, and where necessary treated by the Ophthalmic A&E doctor. RESULTS:"
		Contact lens complications accounted for 9.1% of the referrals into Ophthalmic
		"A&E, a total of 323 appointments. Microbial keratitis was the most common"
		"diagnosis (22%), and Klebsiella and Pseudomonas the most common pathogen"
		implicated. A case of Fusarium was also recorded. Optometrists/contact lens
		practitioners were the most common referral source (41%). Soft lens wearers were
		"most common (67%), followed by silicone hydrogel wearers (28%) and least common"
		were rigid gas permeable wearers (5%). Ten percent of the patients referred into
		the department were admitted. CONCLUSION: Education of the patient in their wear
		schedule and hygiene are still significant factors in their risk of developing
		contact lens complications. A closer working relationship needs to be fostered
		between Community Optometrists and Eye Departments to give the most appropriate
		management of contact lens related problems which would help alleviate undue
		burdens on Ophthalmic A&E.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To describe clinical and histologic findings in horses with iris
		abscesses. Design Retrospective medical records study. ANIMALS STUDIED: Medical
		records of horses that had iris abscesses at the University of Florida Veterinary
		"Medical Center, Peterson & Smith Equine Hospital, and Veterinary Eye Specialists"
		"of London, Ontario, from 2005 to 2008 were reviewed. PROCEDURE: Data collected"
		"from the medical records included signalment, clinical and histologic"
		"descriptions of ocular lesions, therapy, complications, and visual outcomes."
		"RESULTS: The medical records of two Quarterhorses, one pony, one warmblood, one"
		"Westphalian, and one Arab horse with unilateral iris abscesses were identified."
		Mild-to-severe clinical signs of iridocyclitis were present in all six eyes with
		iris abscesses. The eyes of two horses with iris abscesses were also associated
		"with deep stromal abscesses and responded to medical therapy alone in one case,"
		and medical therapy and corneal transplantation in the other. Iris abscesses in
		two horses were also associated with intralenticular invasion due to a
		"Cladosporium and a Fusarium-type fungus respectively, and resulted in"
		enucleations. Two horses with iris abscesses and no apparent lens involvement
		resolved with medical therapy in one case and surgical removal of the iris
		abscess and medical therapy in the other. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first clinical
		"report of iris abscesses in the horse, and the first histologic report of fungal"
		invasion of the horse lens.

TI	-	Microbiologic profile of the mycosic absess on a reference center in Tunisia.
PG	-	644-649
AB	-	AIM: Given the increase in cases of fungal keratitis in recent years due to the
		inadvertent use of large -spectrum antibiotics and corticosteroids on the one
		"hand and the emergence of contactology on the other hand, this study has was"
		carried out in order to better understand the microbiological profile of fungal
		"keratitis, particularly as a function of risk factors in a referral center in"
		Tunisia. METHODS: We report a retrospective study of 43 patients (45eyes)
		hospitalized for fungal corneal abscess between January 2007 and December 2017.
		All patients benefited from corneal sampling by scraping the cornea with direct
		"examination and culture. RESULTS: During the study period, 482 patients with"
		corneal abscess were treated at the Ophthalmology Department of the Hédi Raies A
		Institute in Tunis. 45 eyes of 43 consecutive patients had keratomycosis (9.3%).
		The direct examination was positive in 71.1% of the cases and the culture in
		73.3%. In 78.8% of the cases filaments were isolated: the fusarium being the most
		found species is in 39.4% of the patients particulary in cases of ocular trauma.
		Yeast species were more frequently found in surface pathology or local or general
		deficency. CONCLUSION:   It is important to guide the microbiological diagnosis
		"of mycotic keratitis according to the clinical context, particularly in the case"
		of negativity of the samples in order to establish a suitable treatment to
		"improve the prognosis of this pathology, which represents one of the most"
		difficult forms of infectious  keratitis to manage.

PG	-	267-71
AB	-	"PURPOSE: To review the trends, risk factors, causative organisms, treatment, and"
		outcomes of fungal keratitis at the authors' institution. METHODS: A
		retrospective review of the records of consecutive patients diagnosed with fungal
		keratitis at the authors' institution from January 1999 to June 2006. RESULTS:
		Eighty-four patients were diagnosed with fungal keratitis during this period. The
		"average age of the patients was 48 years, and 64% were male. Until 2004, trauma"
		"(51%) and contact lens use (40%) were the major risk factors. After 2005, contact"
		lens use (52%) surpassed trauma as the most common risk factor (29%). The
		percentage of fungal ulcers caused by nontherapeutic contact lenses increased
		from 21% between 1999 and 2001 to 32% between 2002 and 2004 and to 45% in 2005
		and 2006. Eighty-six percent of cultured organisms were filamentous. Fusarium
		"(41%) was the most commonly isolated genus, followed by Candida (14%), Curvularia"
		"(12%), and Aspergillus (12%). Visual acuity was worse than 20/200 in 56% of"
		patients at presentation. Final visual acuity was 20/40 or better in 70% of
		patients treated with medication alone and 16% of patients requiring therapeutic
		keratoplasty. Surgical intervention in the acute phase was necessary in 23% of
		patients. Seventy-four percent of medically treated patients had dual topical
		antifungal therapy. Natamycin 5% and amphotericin B 0.15% were the most commonly
		used drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Contact lenses are a major risk factor for fungal
		keratitis. The incidence of contact lens-related fungal keratitis was increasing
		even before the Fusarium outbreak in 2005 and 2006. Good visual outcomes can be
		achieved by aggressive dual topical antifungal therapy.

		cases.
PG	-	14840-52
AB	-	"Invasive fungal disease (IFD) has high mortality rate, especially in the growing"
		population of immunocompromised patients. In spite of introduction of novel
		"diagnostic approaches, the intravital recognition of IFD is challenging. Autopsy"
		studies remain a key tool for assessment of epidemiology of visceral mycoses. We
		aimed to determine species distribution and trends of IFD over the last 10 years
		in unselected autopsy series from a large university hospital. Forty-five cases
		"of visceral mycoses, confirmed by histopathology and panfungal PCR, were found in"
		587 consecutive autopsies. Major underlying diseases were diabetes mellitus
		"(20%), hematologic malignancies (15.6%) and systemic lupus erythematosus (15.6%)."
		There was a high risk for disseminated IFD in immunocompromised patients stayed
		in the hospital over 1 month with a fever longer than 3 weeks. The most common
		"fungi were Aspergillus spp. (58%), Candida spp. (16%), Mucorales (14%) and"
		Fusarium spp. (10%). We found significant increase in Aspergillus flavus (P =
		0.04) and Mucorales (P < 0.01) infections over the last 5 years. Concordance rate
		between histopathology and panfungal PCR was 89.5% to the genus level. All 6
		cases of fusariomycosis were misinterpreted as aspergillosis by histology alone.
		"The precise species identification, necessary for targeted antifungal treatment,"
		was rendered only by the molecular technique. Panfungal PCR showed high
		"performance on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens, providing important"
		epidemiological data in retrospective autopsy series. Rapid detection of fungi by
		panfungal PCR assay has high potential for intravital diagnostics of IFD in
		surgical and biopsy specimens.

AB	-	Background: A multistate fungal meningitis outbreak began in September 2012 that
		affected 751 individuals who received contaminated spinal injections across 20
		"states in the United States, which led to 64 deaths. In our previous study, we"
		examined 26 environmental swab samples collected from various locations of the
		manufacturing premises of the compounding company to determine the possible cause
		of this outbreak and identified 14 novel species of fungi. Objective: In this
		"follow-up study, a total of 198 environmental surveillance samples were collected"
		and analyzed to detect pathogenic fungal species from other compounding company
		premises located in three regions of the United States. Methods: DNA sequencing
		was performed at the large subunit ribosomal RNA (LSU rRNA) and internal
		transcribed spacer (ITS) regions on the 25 positive fungal isolates. Results:
		"Sequence analysis of the ITS1, the ITS2, and the LSU rRNA regions confirmed the"
		presence of the following fungal species in the samples analyzed: (1)
		Pestalotiopsis cocculi from the region I; (2) Epicoccum nigrum and Trichaptum
		biforme from the region I; (3) Nigrospora sphaerica and Fusarium sp. from the
		"region II; and (4) Curvularia sp., Fusarium sp., Penicillium sp., and Preussia"
		sp. from the region III. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the LSU and ITS
		regions are good genetic markers to perform fungal typing. Highlights: DNA
		sequencing technology can be used in the implementation of effective
		environmental monitoring programs of public health importance.

AB	-	"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: With the rising number of contact lens users, there"
		has been observed an increasing number of patients admitted to ophthalmology
		"wards with severe keratitis, including those of fungal etiology. One of the most"
		devastating specimens is Fusarium spp. If not diagnosed and treated from the
		"onset of the symptoms, it can lead to severe visual loss, or even blindness. CASE"
		REPORT: This a retrospective case report of a 36-year-old pregnant female
		"diagnosed with Fusarium keratitis, not responding to topical treatment. The"
		problem is discussed and includes the most relevant literature review. RESULTS:
		Primary therapeutic keratoplasty is prone to failure due to an ongoing
		"inflammation process in the eye, as happened in the described patient. Spread of"
		the infection to the vitreous body necessitated the procedure of penetrating
		"keratoplasty with lens removal, pars plana vitrectomy and silicone oil. After"
		"treatment, the inflammation resolved, and best corrected visual acuity at the 6"
		months follow-up was 0.5 (Snellen charts). CONCLUSIONS: There is currently no
		treatment for Fusarium keratitis that would offer similar results to those
		observed in bacterial infection treated early with antibiotics. As systemic
		"therapy with antifungal agents is not an option in pregnant women, they are even"
		"more of a challenge. Diagnosis is quite often delayed, leading to deeper"
		"infiltration of the cornea, sometimes with vitreous involvement. For such cases,"
		"a combined approach is proposed with vitrectomy, lens removal and penetrating"
		keratoplasty. Early surgical intervention may rescue some of the eyes
		non-responsive to topical and systemic treatment.

TI	-	In vivo confocal microscopy in fungal keratitis.
PG	-	588-91
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Fungal keratitis is a major blinding eye disease found throughout the
		"world, particularly in developing countries. Given the recent increase in"
		Fusarium keratitis infections in contact lens wearers owing to contact lens
		"solutions, a warning was recently issued by the Food and Drug Administration,"
		making it a public health concern in developed countries. OBJECTIVE: To show the
		advantages of in vivo confocal microscopy imaging using the Heidelberg Retina
		Tomograph II-Rostock Cornea Module (HRTII-RCM) in the early diagnosis of fungal
		keratitis. METHODS: HRTII-RCM confocal microscopy was performed on five patients
		presenting with fungal keratitis and on three donor corneas contaminated with
		"Fusarium solani, Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida albicans. RESULTS: Direct"
		microscopic evaluation of corneal smears and culture revealed the presence of F
		solani in four cases and C albicans in one case. HRTII-RCM examination of the
		infected patients and contaminated donor corneas revealed numerous high-contrast
		"elements resembling Fusarium, Aspergillus hyphae or Candida pseudofilaments in"
		"the anterior stroma. CONCLUSION: HRTII-RCM in vivo confocal microscopy is a new,"
		"non-invasive and rapid technique for the early diagnosis of fungal keratitis,"
		showing high-resolution images resembling fungal structures in the early phase of
		the disease.

AB	-	"Nontraditional human pathogenic fungi, including Fusarium, Paecilomyces, and"
		"Acremonium species, have been increasingly documented as agents of infection in"
		"immunocompromised patients and, occasionally, in normal hosts. Although"
		"definitive identification of these fungi requires culture, they often can be"
		identified provisionally in tissue sections by a combination of histologic
		"features, including hyaline septate hyphae and characteristic reproductive"
		structures known as phialides and phialoconidia. These morphologic
		"characteristics, although familiar to mycologists, are easily overlooked by"
		"histopathologists; as a result, Fusarium species and Paecilomyces lilacinus are"
		frequently misidentified in tissue sections as Aspergillus or Candida species. We
		"identified 19 culture-proved cases of infection with species of Fusarium,"
		"Paecilomyces, or Acremonium; retrospectively reviewed histologic specimens"
		"stained by routine hematoxylin and eosin, Gomori methenamine silver, and/or"
		periodic acid-Schiff stains; and delineated morphologic criteria that will help
		pathologists make a preliminary identification of these fungi by histopathology.
		Adventitious sporulation was found in 9 of 9 infections caused by Paecilomyces
		"species, 7 of 10 infections caused by Fusarium species, and in the single case of"
		infection caused by Acremonium strictum. Histologic recognition of these
		morphologies may help clinicians select appropriate initial antifungal treatment
		and manage the infection.

PG	-	43-48
AB	-	Fungal infections represent a serious complication for immunosuppressed patients
		resulting in an increased morbidity and mortality. A non-concurrent prospective
		study was performed to evaluate the factors associated to invasive fungal
		infection (IFI) in patients with hematological malignancies admitted to the
		"University Hospital in San Juan, Puerto Rico from January 1(st), 2011 through"
		"June 15(th), 2014. The medical records of 84 patients were evaluated. Fifty-nine"
		patients with IFI and twenty-five without IFI. The majority were men between 35
		to 55 years old. The main hematological diagnosis was acute myelogenous leukemia
		(AML) followed by acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Seventy-percent developed
		"IFI. The most common fungi were C. albicans followed by non-albicans species,"
		"Fusarium and, Aspergillus species, respectively. About 63% of the patients with"
		AML and 81% without AML had IFI. Those who received steroids were more likely to
		"develop IFI. After adjusting for AML and age, the odds of IFI among patients"
		using steroids were 3.33 higher than those not using steroids. Patients who were
		exposed to different antifungal medication had 72% lower odds to develop IFI.

LID	-	10.1111/aos.14789 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: Understanding the spectrum of ocular pathogens in a given geographic
		"region is important for devising appropriate practical treatment. Therefore, we"
		examined the pathogen spectrum and antibiotic resistance of microbial keratitis
		"in northeast China. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, we"
		reviewed the microbiology laboratory records of patients diagnosed with microbial
		"keratitis in a tertiary eye hospital in Harbin, northeast China, between 2017 and"
		"2019, and analysed the pathogen spectrum and antibiotic susceptibility. RESULTS:"
		"We collected 462 specimens, of which 282 exhibited positive cultures. Among these"
		"cultures, 257 were bacterial and 25 were fungal. Of the 257 bacterial isolates,"
		214 (83.27%) were gram positive whereas 43 (16.73%) were gram negative. The most
		prevalent gram-positive pathogen was coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CoNS;
		"58.37%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus; 20.62%) and Streptococcus"
		"pneumoniae (2.33%). Of the gram-negative bacterial isolates, 10 were Pseudomonas"
		aeruginosa (3.89%). The most frequently detected ocular pathogens from fungal
		isolates were Fusarium species (40%). We also found more culture-positive cases
		"of bacterial keratitis in summer. Overall, 16.98% S. aureus and 64.00% CoNS"
		isolates were methicillin resistant. These methicillin-resistant bacteria were
		"also more likely to be resistant to other antibiotics, with multidrug resistance"
		found in 77.78% methicillin-resistant S. aureus and 90.63% methicillin-resistant
		"CoNS. However, all gram-positive isolates were sensitive to vancomycin and"
		linezolid. CONCLUSION: Coagulase-negative staphylococcus are the most common
		ocular pathogens in northeast China. We also show the prevalence of methicillin
		resistance and concurrent multidrug resistance among staphylococcal isolates.
		Monitoring the patterns of antimicrobial resistance could help in the management
		selection.

TI	-	In vitro susceptibility patterns of fungi associated with keratomycosis in horses
		of the northeastern United States: 68 cases (1987-2006).
PG	-	1086-91
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To determine in vitro susceptibility patterns of fungi associated with
		keratomycosis in horses in the northeastern United States and compare those
		patterns with results of studies from other geographic regions. DESIGN:
		Retrospective case series. ANIMALS: 68 horses with keratomycosis. PROCEDURES:
		"Medical records of horses with a clinical diagnosis of keratomycosis, positive"
		"results of corneal fungal cultures, and susceptibility data were reviewed from"
		the years 1987 to 2006. Fungal identification and in vitro antifungal
		susceptibility test results were recorded. The percentage of susceptible isolates
		was compared among antifungals for all isolates together and for the most common
		genera individually. RESULTS: 74 fungal isolates from 68 horses that met
		"inclusion criteria were identified. Aspergillus, Candida, and Fusarium spp were"
		the most frequent isolates. Grouped isolates had the highest percentage of
		"susceptibility to nystatin (87.7%), natamycin (87.5%), and clotrimazole (80.6%)."
		Grouped isolates had the lowest percentage of susceptibility to fluconazole
		(15.8%) and miconazole (27.5%). Aspergillus spp (> or = 81.0%) were most
		"susceptible to nystatin, clotrimazole, itraconazole, and natamycin. Candida spp"
		"(100%) were most susceptible to ketaconazole, natamycin, and nystatin. Fusarium"
		spp (100%) were only consistently susceptible to natamycin. CONCLUSIONS AND
		"CLINICAL RELEVANCE: On the basis of in vitro susceptibility testing, nystatin,"
		"natamycin, or clotrimazole is recommended for initial topical treatment of"
		keratomycosis in horses from the northeastern United States. Contrary to results
		"of studies of ocular fungal isolates of horses from other regions, Candida spp"
		were identified more frequently and miconazole had lower in vitro efficacy in the
		present study.

AB	-	Fungal keratitis is responsible for a significant burden of blinding disease in
		the developing world. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the
		"etiological agents, predisposing factors and therapy of keratomycosis in our"
		region. METHODS: Retrospective study of 60 patients with clinically and cultured
		"confirmed fungi keratitis, who were attended at department of mycology in Sfax"
		(1995 to 2012). RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 47.2 years (sex ratio:
		"1.58). At least, one presumed predisposing factor was identified in 83.3% of"
		cases. Corneal traumatism was established as the most common predisposing factor
		(61.6%) with vegetative matter (42.4%). Patients had corneal ulcer in 40% or
		abscess in 47.6%. All cases were positive on direct microscopy and 93% of
		cultures were positive. Filamentous fungi form the major etiologic agents (83%):
		"Fusarium species (49% with F. solani [66%]), Aspergillus sp. (22%), Alternaria"
		"(5%), Scedosporium sp. (2%); and non-identified mold in (5%). Yeast were"
		identified in 17% of cases. Topical agents were used in 97% of cases:
		"ketoconazole 2%, amphotericin B (0.5%). Fluconazole per os was administrated for"
		"11% of cases, itraconazole (2 cases) and voriconazole (one case). Keratoplasty"
		was indicated for 27% of cases. The outcome was favorable in 16% of patients.
		"Among the patients, 71% had persistent corneal deposit sequelae. Four patients"
		lost the eyeball. CONCLUSION: Corneal traumatism was the principal risk factor
		for fungal keratitis in young and middle-aged farmers. Fusarium solani is the
		"predominant cause in Sfax. Early diagnosis, coupled with appropriate treatment,"
		is crucial for increasing the chance of complete recovery.

		recipients: data from a developing country.
PG	-	98-105
LID	-	10.1111/tid.12176 [doi]
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Bloodstream infections (BSIs) and central line infections remain
		among the major causes of morbidity and mortality in transplant recipients
		because of prolonged neutropenia and mucosal damage. The objective of this study
		was to determine the frequency and outcome of bacterial and fungal isolates from
		patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. MATERIALS AND
		METHODS: This study was conducted at the Aga Khan University and Hospital's bone
		marrow transplant unit. All patients who underwent an allogeneic stem cell
		transplant with matched sibling/parent donor were included. The study period
		ranged from April 2004 to December 2012. Transplantation was performed according
		to institutional protocols. All patients were admitted in single rooms with
		"positive pressure and high-efficiency particulate air filters. Ciprofloxacin,"
		"fluconazole, and valaciclovir were used for standard prophylaxis, which was"
		started at the time of conditioning. All blood cultures were obtained at clinical
		"suspicion of systemic infection, mainly documented as fever (temperature of"
		>38.5°C). BSIs and line infections were defined as isolation of bacterial or
		"fungal pathogen from at least one blood/central line culture. RESULTS: In total,"
		"101 of 108 patients developed febrile neutropenia. In the 101 patients, 245"
		documented febrile episodes occurred. There were 40 culture-positive episodes and
		"205 culture-negative episodes. Of these 40 culture-positive episodes, 22 patients"
		had bloodstream isolates and 18 had central line isolates. The median ± standard
		deviation time of febrile neutropenia was day 7 ± 2 days (range: day -3 to day
		+13). The most common bloodstream isolate was Escherichia coli (n = 9) followed
		by Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 5). One patient developed Fusarium infection.
		"In central line infections, S. epidermidis was the most common organism (n = 8)."
		"In 2 patients with central venous catheters, Candida albicans was the isolate."
		Transplant-related mortality from sepsis occurred in 9.2%. CONCLUSION: E.coli was
		"mainly responsible for BSI, while gram-positive organisms dominated"
		catheter-related febrile episodes. Transplant-related mortality due to sepsis was
		9%.

AB	-	Non-Aspergillus invasive mould infections (IMIs) are associated with devastating
		morbidity and mortality rates and are increasingly diagnosed in immunocompromised
		hosts. The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology and outcomes of
		"non-Aspergillus IMIs at a university hospital in San Diego, California, USA. A"
		retrospective chart review of the medical records of all patients with cultures
		growing non-Aspergillus moulds at the microbiology laboratory in the Center for
		"Academic Laboratory Medicine, Department of Pathology, University of California,"
		San Diego (UCSD) Health between mid-2014 and mid-2017 (3-year period) was
		"performed. A total of 23 cases of non-Aspergillus IMI were identified, including"
		"10 cases of mucormycosis, 8 cases of lomentosporiosis and 5 cases of fusariosis."
		"Antifungal susceptibility testing was performed for 14 isolates, and 10/11"
		Fusarium and Lomentospora isolates had minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs)
		of >16 µg/mL for voriconazole and/or posaconazole. Overall 180-day mortality was
		significantly lower among those who received combination antifungal therapy than
		among those who received single-agent therapy [3/13 (23%) vs. 9/10 (90%);
		"P = 0.003]. In conclusion, Lomentospora prolificans (35% of non-Aspergillus IMIs)"
		and Fusarium spp. (22%) accounted for high proportions of non-Aspergillus IMIs
		during the study period. Non-Aspergillus IMIs were detected in patients with
		"various underlying diseases and were associated with high mortality rates, which"
		was significantly lower in those who received antifungal combination therapy.

		"aeruginosa (n = 36; 33.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 29; 26.8%), and"
		Aspergillus spp. (n = 18; 16%). Other fungal infections were due to Fusarium
		"spp., Cryptococcus neoformans, and Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. Of the 31"
		"donors with positive BAL, 15 had S. aureus. There were 21 pretransplant colonized"
		recipients (43%) and 16 of them had suppurative underlying lung disease. P.
		aeruginosa was the most frequent colonizing organism (59% of pretransplant
		positive cultures). There were 11 episodes of bacteremia and lungs were the
		source in 5 cases. Sixteen deaths occurred and 6 (37.5%) were due to infection.
		Statistical analyses showed association between pretransplant colonizing
		microorganisms from suppurative lung disease patients and pneumonias after lung
		transplantation (RR = 4.76; P = .04; 95% CI = 1.02-22.10). No other analyzed
		factor was significant. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial and fungal infections are frequent
		and contribute to higher mortality in lung transplant recipients. P. aeruginosa
		is the most frequent agent of respiratory infections. This study did not observe
		any impact of donor lung organisms on pneumonia after lung transplantation.
		"Nevertheless, we demonstrated an association between pretransplant colonizing"
		microorganisms and early pneumonias in suppurative lung transplant recipients.

LID	-	255
AB	-	"Fungal keratitis is difficult to treat, especially Fusarium keratitis. In vitro"
		studies show that chlorhexidine could be an interesting option as monotherapy. We
		describe a case series of four patients (four eyes) with Fusarium keratitis at
		"Radboud University Medical Center (Nijmegen, the Netherlands). The patients were"
		treated with chlorhexidine 0.02% eye drops. The in vitro activity of eight
		antifungals and chlorhexidine was determined according to the European Committee
		on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) broth microdilution method. We
		also reviewed the literature on the use of chlorhexidine in the treatment of
		"fungal keratitis. Topical chlorhexidine was well tolerated, and all patients"
		showed complete resolution of the keratitis upon treatment with chlorhexidine. A
		PubMed search of the available literature was conducted (last search 8 March
		2020) and yielded two randomized clinical trials (natamycin versus chlorhexidine)
		and one case report addressing the treatment of fungal keratitis with
		chlorhexidine. Chlorhexidine was found to be safe with regard to toxicity and to
		be superior to natamycin in the clinical trials. Chlorhexidine showed in vitro
		"fungicidal activity against Fusarium and clinical effectiveness in our cases,"
		supporting further clinical evaluation. Advantages of chlorhexidine are its
		"topical application, its general availability, its low costs, its broad-spectrum"
		"activity, and its fungicidal mechanism of action at low concentrations."

TI	-	Fungal colonization and infection in Boston keratoprosthesis.
PG	-	15-Sep
AB	-	PURPOSE: To determine the incidence of and risk factors for fungal keratitis and
		endophthalmitis in patients with a Boston keratoprosthesis (KPro) and to
		determine whether surveillance cultures were helpful in predicting fungal
		infection. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed of 182 patients
		(202 eyes) who received a type 1 (through cornea) or type 2 (through cornea and
		"lid) KPro between March 1, 1990, and December 31, 2004, and who were followed for"
		"at least 1 month (range, 1 month to 13 years; mean, 2.84 years). There were 148"
		"eyes with type 1 and 54 eyes with type 2. Beginning in late 1999, many eyes were"
		"given a prophylactic topical regimen containing vancomycin, and many eyes with"
		type 1 KPro were given therapeutic contact lenses. Cases of fungal keratitis or
		"endophthalmitis were analyzed. To determine the fungal colonization rate, 70"
		surveillance cultures of the ocular or lid surface around the KPro optic were
		obtained of 36 uninfected KPro eyes (35 patients) at random time-points over 1
		year (August 2002 to July 2003). RESULTS: There were 4 definite and 1 probable
		"fungal infections in 6893 patient-months of follow-up, or 0.009 fungal infections"
		per patient-year. These included 3 cases of definite or probable Candida
		"endophthalmitis (C. parapsilosis, C. glabrata, and C. albicans) and 2 cases of"
		"mold keratitis (Alternaria, Fusarium). The rate was higher in eyes receiving a"
		vancomycin-containing topical prophylactic regimen than those with on a
		non-vancomycin regimen (5 cases/2774 person-months vs. 0 cases/4119
		"person-months; P = 0.011). In eyes with type 1 KPro, the rate was higher with"
		therapeutic contact lens wear than without (4/1682 vs. 0/3115 person-months; P =
		"0.015). Surveillance cultures did not predict fungal infection, and none of the 6"
		surveillance eyes colonized with fungi (all Candida) developed a fungal
		infection. The prevalence of fungal colonization in KPro eyes had not changed
		"since our 1996 surveillance study (11% vs. 10%, P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Fungal"
		infections in KPro eyes have appeared since we introduced broad-spectrum
		"antibiotic prophylaxis and therapeutic contact lenses 5 years ago, but the"
		infection rate remains very low in our mostly New England-based patient
		population. Cleaning or replacing the contact lens on a regular basis and
		prescribing a short course of topical amphotericin at the first visible signs of
		fungal colonization may prevent these infections.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Microbial keratitis is a serious ocular infection and a leading
		cause of morbidity and blindness worldwide. METHODS: A retrospective review of
		the charts of 30 patients (30 eyes) diagnosed with presumed or culture-proven
		fungal keratitis among 100 patients with infectious keratitis. All patients
		initially received hourly 0.5% Amphotericin B eye drops. Systemic antifungal
		"agents consisted mainly of oral Fluconazole. After treatment, a healing time of"
		less than 3 weeks from presentation was considered a good result. Mean follow up
		was 10.4 months. RESULTS: Risk factors for fungal keratitis included ocular
		trauma in 13 patients (43.3%). Stromal infiltration was seen in 100% of patients.
		Satellite lesions were noted in 6 eyes (20%) and an immune ring was noted in
		"3 cases (10%). The most commonly isolated agent was Fusarium in 9 eyes (50%),"
		"followed by Aspergillus in 6 eyes (33.3%), and Candida in 2 eyes (11.1%). At the"
		"end of follow up, final visual acuity varied from no light perception to 20/20."
		"The significant predictors were initial visual acuity, size of infiltrate at"
		"presentation, male gender and advanced age. CONCLUSION: The key element in the"
		diagnosis of mycotic keratitis is clinical suspicion on the part of the
		"ophthalmologist. However, because of the potential serious complications, it is"
		essential to identify the exact pathogen so as to initiate appropriate treatment
		in time and to thus improve the prognosis of this condition.

AB	-	The increasing prevalence of uncommon fungal species and higher antifungal
		resistance has turned antifungal susceptibility testing into an important
		"monitoring tool. In response, we evaluated the activity of isavuconazole against"
		"522 clinical mold isolates collected worldwide in 2017-2018, including 436"
		Aspergillus spp. isolates and 86 non-Aspergillus molds. The MIC values using
		Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute methods for isavuconazole versus
		Aspergillus ranged from 0.015 mg/L to >8 mg/L. Isavuconazole showed comparable
		"activity to itraconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole against A. fumigatus"
		species complex. Most of the Aspergillus spp. isolates tested (>90%) were wild
		type to all azoles and echinocandins. Eleven isolates were non-wild type to
		"isavuconazole and the other 3 azoles, and 10 of those isolates were from Europe."
		The azoles and echinocandins showed poor activity against Fusarium and
		Scedosporium spp. Isavuconazole exhibited excellent activity against most species
		"of Aspergillus and was comparable to itraconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole"
		against the less common molds.

AB	-	Fusarium species are ubiquitously present in environment and are well known as
		human pathogens with high mortality rate in immunocompromised patients. We report
		here two cases where immunocompromised patients developed fatal bloodstream
		infections by this organism. Isolates were further identified by ITS1 region
		sequencing which confirmed them as Fusarium solani. Antifungal susceptibility
		"testing was done following CLSI M38-A2 guidelines to amphotericin B, fluconazole,"
		"itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, caspofungin, and micafungin. Both"
		"patients had a fatal outcome and expired of septic shock. Therefore,"
		identification up to species level is of utmost importance as that helps in
		directing the management of the patient thereby leading to a favourable outcome.

PG	-	"1501-7, 1507.e1-2"
LID	-	10.1016/j.ophtha.2008.02.027 [doi]
AB	-	"OBJECTIVE: To report the fungal isolates, treatment strategies, and clinical"
		outcomes for a large series of patients with exogenous fungal endophthalmitis.
		"DESIGN: Retrospective, single institution, consecutive case series. PARTICIPANTS:"
		"All patients treated at Bascom Palmer Eye Institute between January 1, 1990, and"
		"June 30, 2006, for culture-proven exogenous fungal endophthalmitis. METHODS:"
		Microbiologic and medical records were reviewed for all patients with intraocular
		cultures positive for fungal organisms and clinically diagnosed exogenous
		"endophthalmitis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Fungal isolates, treatment strategies,"
		"visual acuity, and rate of enucleation. RESULTS: Culture-positive exogenous"
		"fungal endophthalmitis occurred in 41 eyes, including 18 cases (44%) associated"
		"with fungal keratitis, 10 cases (24%) occurring after penetrating ocular trauma,"
		and 13 cases (32%) after intraocular surgery. Filamentous fungi (molds) accounted
		"for 35 cases (85%), and Candida species (yeasts) accounted for 6 cases (15%)."
		"Although most keratitis cases were caused by Fusarium (13 of 18; 72%),"
		Aspergillus was the most common isolate in postoperative cases (5 of 13; 38%).
		Open-globe cases were caused by a broader spectrum of fungi. As initial
		"treatment, 30 (73%) patients received intraocular amphotericin B, but at least 3"
		antifungal agents were used in 24 (59%) cases. At least 1 pars plana vitrectomy
		"was performed in 25 (61%) eyes, and 29 (71%) eyes underwent 3 or more procedures,"
		including surgeries and intraocular injections. Although a final vision of 20/400
		"or better was achieved in 22 (54%) eyes, all but 1 of these were either in the"
		"keratitis (11 of 18) or the postoperative (10 of 13) groups. Conversely, although"
		"10 (24%) of 41 eyes were enucleated, 7 of these were among the open-globe"
		patients. CONCLUSIONS: This report highlights the differences between the
		clinical categories of exogenous fungal endophthalmitis. Although 85% of all
		"cases were caused by molds, most commonly Fusarium and Aspergillus, the most"
		common fungal genera varied by clinical category. Amphotericin B was the most
		"commonly used antifungal agent, but most cases were treated with at least 3"
		"different antifungal agents. Final visual outcomes were variable, with the"
		"open-globe-associated patients having the poorest outcomes. Overall, 44% of"
		patients achieved a final visual acuity of 20/80 or better.

PG	-	107-12
AB	-	Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against microbes related to indoor dampness
		problems have been used as potential biomarkers of fungal exposure in clinical
		investigations. There is limited information on their relation to asthma. We
		conducted a population-based incident case-control study to assess the risk of
		asthma in relation to specific IgG antibodies to eight dampness-related microbes:
		"Aspergillus fumigatus, A. versicolor, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Fusarium"
		"oxysporum, Sporobolomyces salmonicolor, Stachybotrys chartarum, Streptomyces"
		albus and Trichoderma citrinoviride. We recruited systematically all new cases of
		asthma during a 2.5-year study period and randomly selected controls from a
		source population of adults 21-63 years of age living in the Pirkanmaa Hospital
		"District, South Finland. The clinically diagnosed case series consisted of 521"
		adults with newly diagnosed asthma and the control series of 932 controls
		selected randomly from the source population. IgG antibodies were analysed with
		ELISA. An increased risk of developing asthma in adulthood was significantly
		"related to IgG antibodies to T. citrinoviride, but not to the other moulds. There"
		was no evidence of a dose-response relation between the IgG antibody level and
		the risk of asthma. T. citrinoviride may play a role in the aetiology of
		adult-onset asthma or serve as an indicator of other causal factors.

TI	-	Recent outbreaks of atypical contact lens-related keratitis: what have we
		learned?
PG	-	602-608.e2
LID	-	10.1016/j.ajo.2010.06.045 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: To examine the public health implications of 2 recent outbreaks of
		atypical contact lens-related infectious keratitis. DESIGN: Perspective based on
		the literature and authors' experience. RESULTS: The contact lens-related
		Fusarium and Acanthamoeba keratitis outbreaks were each detected by dramatic
		"rises seen in tertiary care centers in Singapore and the United States,"
		respectively. Case-control studies of both outbreaks were able to identify a
		strong association with the use of different contact lens disinfection solutions.
		"Their respective recalls resulted in a steep decline of Fusarium keratitis, but"
		not of Acanthamoeba keratitis. Early investigations into each solution
		association implicated components not directly related to their primary
		"disinfectant, but the true pathogenesis remains unknown. However, the number of"
		Acanthamoeba cases individually attributed to each of almost all available
		disinfection systems exceeds the previously understood total United States
		"incidence, suggesting other risk factors. Current standards do not require"
		"demonstration of anti-acanthamoebal activity. Yet, despite the inclusion of"
		"Fusarium in mandatory testing for solutions, current premarket testing was not"
		predictive of the outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: The 2 recent outbreaks of atypical
		contact lens-related keratitis have reinforced the value of tertiary care eye
		care centers in detecting early rises in rare infections and the power of
		"adaptable, well-designed epidemiologic investigations. Although Fusarium"
		keratitis has declined significantly with the recall of Renu with MoistureLoc
		"(Bausch & Lomb Inc.), the persistence of Acanthamoeba keratitis demands"
		"fundamental changes in contact lens hygiene practices, inclusion of Acanthamoeba"
		"as a test organism, and contact lens disinfectant test regimens for all contact"
		lens-related pathogens that are verifiably reflective of end user contact lens
		wear complications.

		Report and Review.
PG	-	184-8
LID	-	10.1007/s12070-012-0570-1 [doi]
AB	-	Perforations of nasal septum are fairly frequent with an incidence of about 0.9 %
		and may lead to morbidity than mortality. Common causes are trauma (iatrogenic
		"occasionally nose picking), malignancy, inflammations and infections such as"
		"tuberculosis, syphilis, Wegener's granulomatosis, sarcoidosis and fungal"
		infections. Paranasal fungal sinusitis is frequently encountered in clinical
		practice in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent individuals. Nasal septal
		perforations caused by species of Aspergillus and Fusarium have been documented.
		We report a case of nasal septal perforation in a 35-years-old immunocompetent
		"male patient due to Purpureocillium lilacinum, a soil and environmental fungus"
		"and an emerging pathogen, which is known to cause various infections in humans"
		with normal and deficient immune system. Fungal aetiology was diagnosed by
		histopathology and direct smear examination and confirmed by culture. Patient was
		"treated with voriconozole, following Antifungal susceptibility testing (AFST), to"
		which the patient is responding.

		"bacterial aetiology, 1,095 (34.4%) were fungal, 33 (1.04%) were Acanthamoeba, 76"
		"(2.39%) were both fungal and bacterial, and the remaining 936 (29.41%) were found"
		to be culture negative. The predominant bacterial and fungal pathogens isolated
		"were Streptococcus pneumoniae (35.95%) and Fusarium spp. (41.92%), respectively."
		Most of the patients (66.84%) with fungal keratitis were between 21 and 50 years
		"old, and 60.21% of the patients with bacterial keratitis were older than 50 (p <"
		0.0001) (95% CI: 5.19-7.19). A majority of patients (64.75%) with fungal
		keratitis were agricultural workers (p < 0.0001) [odds ratio (OR): 1.4; 95% CI:
		"1.19-1.61], whereas bacterial keratitis occurred more commonly (57.62%) in"
		nonagricultural workers (p < 0.0001) (OR: 2.88; 95% CI: 2.47-3.36). Corneal
		"injury was identified in 2,256 (70.88%) patients, and it accounted for 92.15% in"
		fungal keratitis (p < 0.0001) (OR: 7.7; 95% CI: 6.12-9.85) and 100% in
		Acanthamoeba keratitis. Injuries due to vegetative matter (61.28%) were
		identified as a significant cause for fungal keratitis (p < 0.0001) (OR: 23.6;
		95% CI: 19.07-29.3) and due to mud (84.85%) for Acanthamoeba keratitis (p <
		0.0001) (OR: 26.01; 95% CI: 3.3-6.7). Coexisting ocular diseases predisposing to
		bacterial keratitis accounted for 68.17% (p < 0.0001) (OR: 33.99; 95% CI:
		27.37-42.21). The incidence of fungal keratitis was higher between June and
		"September, and bacterial keratitis was less during this period. CONCLUSION: The"
		risk of agricultural predominance and vegetative corneal injury in fungal
		keratitis and associated ocular diseases in bacterial keratitis increase
		"susceptibility to corneal infection. A hot, windy climate makes fungal keratitis"
		"more frequent in tropical zones, whereas bacterial keratitis is independent of"
		seasonal variation and frequent in temperate zones. Microbial pathogens show
		"geographical variation in their prevalence. Thus, the spectrum of microbial"
		keratitis varies with geographical location influenced by the local climate and
		occupational risk factors.

TI	-	Disseminated Fusarium bloodstream infection in a child with acute myeloid
		leukemia: A case report.
PG	-	6049-6055
LID	-	10.12998/wjcc.v9.i21.6049 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Disseminated Fusarium is rare in healthy children. Children with
		"hematological tumors may have secondary fungal infections, including Fusarium"
		"infections, which are due to tumor bone marrow infiltration or prolonged bone"
		marrow suppression after chemotherapy. Because of the lack of typical clinical
		"manifestations and effective antifungal drugs, early diagnosis and treatment of"
		"the disease are difficult, and the prognosis is poor. CASE SUMMARY: The patient"
		in this case was a 13-year-old female child with rash and fever as the first
		symptoms. She had the characteristics of the four stages of skin that are typical
		of Fusarium infection. She was diagnosed with disseminated Fusarium infection
		through skin biopsy and blood culture and diagnosed with Fusarium solani
		infection based on the morphological characteristics of the blood culture. After
		"treatment with liposome amphotericin B combined with voriconazole, the child"
		recovered. CONCLUSION: This case highlights that for children with secondary
		"agranulocytosis after receiving chemotherapy for hematological malignancies, once"
		"typical abnormal skin damage is found, the possibility of Fusarium infection"
		"should be considered, and voriconazole alone or in combination with polyenes may"
		"be the most effective anti-Fusarium drugs. Amphotericin B, the traditional drug"
		"of disseminated Fusarium disease, has a high mortality rate, and it is not"
		recommended to use it alone. Adequate neutrophil counts are essential for the
		treatment of disseminated Fusarium bloodstream infection.

LID	-	S0165-5876(17)30219-7 [pii]
LID	-	10.1016/j.ijporl.2017.05.015 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: To investigate outcomes of pediatric patients at a single institution
		with invasive fungal rhinosinusitis (IFRS) and to determine variables that impact
		overall survival. METHODS: All pediatric patients at a large tertiary children's
		hospital diagnosed with IFRS confirmed by surgical pathology from 2009 to 2015
		"were retrospectively reviewed. Demographics, underlying diseases, symptoms,"
		"antifungal therapy, absolute neutrophil count (ANC), surgical management,and"
		outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: Seventeen patients were identified with IFRS
		with an average age of 8.7 years and 53% male. Hematologic malignancy was the
		most common (n = 13) underlying disease. The most common presenting symptoms were
		fever (82%) and congestion (41%). 15 patients had severe neutropenia (Absolute
		Neutrophil Count (ANC) < 500) within 2 weeks prior to diagnosis. The average ANC
		at time of diagnosis was 1420 cells/uL. 16 patients were treated with serial
		"nasal endoscopy and debridement, while 1 patient was treated with an open"
		approach. 16 received combination antifungals while 1 was treated with
		amphotericin monotherapy. The most common genus cultured was Fusarium (n = 6).
		"The average number of surgical interventions was 3.4, with the average interval"
		between interventions 6.2 days. 13 of 17 (76%) were cleared of IFRS. Overall
		survival at 6 months was 41%. CONCLUSION: Pediatric IFRS is a life-threatening
		disease that requires a coordinated surgical and medical approach. Despite a
		"relatively high local control rate, overall mortality remains disappointingly"
		"high, reflecting the disease's underlying pathogenesis - lack of host defense and"
		risk of disseminated fungal infection. Further investigation is necessary to
		"reveal optimal management with regards to antifungal therapy, surgery, and"
		utility of labs.

TI	-	Practical Diagnostic Approach to the Presence of Hyphae in Neuropathology
		Specimens With Three Illustrative Cases.
PG	-	98-104
LID	-	10.1093/ajcp/aqx144 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: Early and accurate diagnosis remains crucial in the therapeutic
		management of invasive central nervous system fungal infections. Different molds
		"have intrinsic resistance to antifungal agents; thus, morphologic differentiation"
		"is helpful to clinicians. METHODS: Using three examples, we present a guide on"
		how to approach neuropathology specimens where hyphae are identified on initial
		histologic examination. RESULTS: Hyphae can be classified into three basic
		"groups: hyaline pauciseptated, hyaline septated, and pigmented or dematiaceous."
		The hyaline pauciseptated group includes the order of the Mucorales (previously
		Zygomyces) and is frequent in patients with decompensated diabetes and severe
		neutropenia. Aspergillus species constitutes the most frequently isolated mold in
		"the hyaline septated group. However, other invasive hyaline septated molds"
		"include Fusarium species, which is frequently resistant to multiple antifungals,"
		"and Candida species Last, dematiaceous molds, although infrequent, can be found"
		"in neuropathology specimens, as happened during the outbreak of Exserohilum"
		associated with manufacturing practices in a compound pharmacy. CONCLUSIONS:
		Categorizing hyphae into the three groups described allows pathologists to
		provide information that is useful for infectious disease treatment with an
		inclusive differential diagnosis of diverse fungal genera that share the same
		morphological features.

TI	-	Mycotic keratitis in children: epidemiologic and microbiologic evaluation.
PG	-	295-9
AB	-	"PURPOSE: To evaluate the demographic features, clinical profile, and laboratory"
		diagnosis in cases of mycotic keratitis in children. METHODS: We retrospectively
		analyzed 211 cases of mycotic keratitis in children younger than 16 years over a
		5-year period in a tertiary eye center. Culture-proven cases of fungal keratitis
		"were reviewed. RESULTS: Trauma was the most common predisposing factor (55.3%),"
		"followed by associated systemic illness (11.2%), previous ocular surgery (9.8%),"
		and others. Corneal injury contaminated with vegetable matter was responsible for
		60.5% of traumatic cases. Aspergillus species were the most frequent isolates
		"(39.5%). Others included Fusarium (10.7%), Alternaria (10.2%), Curvularia (7.4%),"
		and Penicillium (7%). A seasonal variation in the incidence of mycotic keratitis
		revealed a peak incidence in the months of September and October. One hundred
		sixty-two children (76.7%) cooperated for examination and scraping under topical
		anesthesia with or without sedation. General anesthesia for scraping was required
		in 49 (23%) of 211 children for corneal scraping. Gram stains of corneal scraping
		"were positive for hyphal elements in 54.5% of cases, and potassium hydroxide"
		wet-mount preparation was positive in 90.2% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: This study
		highlights important risk factors and organisms responsible for mycotic keratitis
		in children.

PG	-	166-168
AB	-	We aim to highlight the key factors for a good outcome of fungal keratitis. We
		describe a case of contact lens-related Fusarium keratitis in a young girl. After
		identification of Fusarium spp under direct microscopic examination and in
		"culture, a prolonged treatment with topic natamycin 5% was started and"
		administered for five months with restitutio ad integrum of the eye. Prompt
		microbiological diagnosis and a specific and prolonged treatment are essential
		for correct management of Fusarium keratitis.

TI	-	Incidence and risk factors for invasive fungal infections in allogeneic BMT
		recipients.
PG	-	801-8
AB	-	In order to analyze the incidence and risk factors for invasive fungal infection
		"(IFI) after allogeneic BMT, 142 consecutive adult BMT recipients (131 sibling"
		"donors, 11 unrelated donors) transplanted in 1989-1993 were retrospectively"
		analyzed. There were 21 cases with definite or probable IFI (incidence 15%)
		"(Aspergillus, 15; Candida, four; Fusarium, one; Absidia, one). The median time to"
		the diagnosis of IFI was 136 days after BMT (range 6-466 days). Only 14% of the
		IFIs were found during the neutropenic period post-BMT. Of the pretransplant
		"characteristics, hematological disease (MDS vs other) (P = 0.001) and unrelated"
		donor (P = 0.01) were risk factors for IFI. Acute GVHD grade III-IV (P = 0.03)
		and extensive chronic GVHD (P = 0.0002) were also found to be significant risk
		factors. Only three patients with IFI (14%) became long-term survivors. Invasive
		"fungal infections tended to develop late after BMT, were usually caused by"
		"Aspergillus sp., and were strongly associated with GVHD and its treatment. Better"
		prophylaxis and treatment of IFI are needed. More effective prophylaxis for GVHD
		might decrease the risk of IFI after allogeneic BMT.

		report for black spotted stingray (Taeniura melanopsila) and a literature review.
PG	-	422-31
LID	-	10.1111/myc.12342 [doi]
AB	-	Fusarium species are environmental saprophytic fungi. Among the many Fusarium
		"species, members of the Fusarium solani species complex (FSSC) are the most"
		"prevalent and virulent in causing human and animal infections. In this study, we"
		describe the first case of fatal FSSC infection in a black spotted stingray and
		"three concomitant infections in scalloped hammerhead sharks. In the stingray,"
		cutaneous lesions were characterised by ulcers and haemorrhage of the ventral
		"pectoral fin, or 'ray', especially around the head; while cutaneous lesions in"
		"the sharks were characterised by ulcers, haemorrhage, as well as white and"
		purulent exudates at the cephalic canals of the cephalofoil and lateral line.
		Histological sections of the cutaneous lesions revealed slender (1-4 μm in
		"diameter), branching, septate fungal hyphae. Internal transcribed spacer region"
		and 28S nrDNA sequencing of the fungal isolates from the fish showed two isolates
		were F. keratoplasticum (FSSC 2) and the other two were FSSC 12. Environmental
		investigation revealed the FSSC strains isolated from water and biofilms in tanks
		that housed the elasmobranchs were also F. keratoplasticum and FSSC 12. Fusarium
		is associated with major infections in elasmobranchs and FSSC 12 is an emerging
		cause of infections in marine animals. DNA sequencing is so far the most reliable
		method for accurate identification of Fusarium species.

AB	-	"PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of the topical, systemic and targeted therapy"
		(TST) protocol in management of fungal keratitis. METHOD: All cases of
		treatment-naive smear- or culture-proven fungal keratitis presenting between June
		2013 and May 2017 were recruited. The TST protocol included initial treatment
		with topical natamycin 5% with addition of oral ketoconazole or voriconazole in
		"ulcers with size >5 mm, depth >50%, or impending perforation. Topical"
		voriconazole 1% was included in case of poor response at 7 to 10 days.
		Intrastromal or intracameral antifungal injections were administered in case of
		poor response to combination therapy. Penetrating keratoplasty was performed in
		case of poor response to any of the regimen. RESULTS: The study included 223
		cases of fungal keratitis with a mean age of 43.6 ± 15.3 years and a
		male-to-female ratio of 1.8:1. The mean area of the ulcer and infiltrate at
		"presentation was 25.52 ± 19 and 25.7 ± 14.4 mm, respectively. Corrected distance"
		visual acuity at presentation was 2.05 ± 0.43 logMAR that improved to 1.6 ± 0.4
		"logMAR at 3 months. Fusarium (42.2%) was the most common microorganism isolated,"
		"followed by Aspergillus (32.8%). The mean healing time was 41.5 ± 22.2 days, with"
		a final scar size of 14.6 ± 8.2 mm. The treatment success rate with the TST
		"protocol was 79.8%. Corneal perforation developed in 7% of cases (n = 15), and"
		keratoplasty was performed for 20.2% of cases (n = 45). CONCLUSIONS: The TST
		protocol provides a stepwise treatment algorithm for management of cases of
		fungal keratitis with varying severity.

PG	-	347-355
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-020-00436-x [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Patients with hematological malignancies and allogeneic hematopoietic
		stem-cell transplant recipients carry a high risk of rare (non-Aspergillus molds
		and non-Candida yeasts) invasive fungal infections (IFI). METHODS: We
		"retrospectively evaluated and described the patient profile, clinical"
		"manifestations, isolated species, treatment and outcome of patients with"
		hematological malignancies diagnosed with these rare IFIs during 15 years in a
		large single hemato-oncology center. RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients with
		hematological malignancies treated in our center had at least one positive
		culture or molecular identification of a rare fungus. Ninety-three isolates were
		considered the etiological agents of the infection. The most common underlying
		"hematological malignancy was acute myeloid leukemia, 36 patients (41.4%). Eighty"
		patients (91%) received chemotherapy less than 30 days prior to IFI diagnosis.
		The most frequent site of infection was the respiratory tract: 34 patients (39%)
		had pulmonary and 19 patients (22%) had a sinusal or nasopharyngeal infections.
		"Disseminated infection, defined as positive blood cultures or parallel infection"
		"in multiple organ systems, was documented in 20 patients (23%). The most common"
		fungal species were Fusarium (35%) and Zygomycetes (25%). Coinfection with more
		than one fungus was noted in 20 patients (23%). Forty-seven of 87 patients (54%)
		in this study died within 90 days of IFI diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Rare IFIs in
		patients with hematological malignancy become increasingly frequent. Early
		identification with traditional and molecular methods is important in management
		of these patients.

AB	-	The possibility of superficial foot mycoses to spread through contaminated mosque
		carpets between worshipers imposes a great health burden and is never addressed
		"in Riyadh, SA. We aimed to assess the prevalence of fungal infections, especially"
		"human dermatophytosis acquired from mosque carpets, in five different regions of"
		"Riyadh, Saudi Arabia and establish a means of contamination control. A"
		"cross-sectional study of 100 mosques in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, was conducted,"
		using a multistage random cluster sampling technique. The study included mosques
		that had an ablution area and regularly hosted five prayers a day. Sterile swabs
		"were used for sampling, and the samples were transported to the laboratory for"
		culture and analysis using a micro-scan system. A total of 199 (65%) samples
		"contained several fungal species. Rhodotorula (74%), Cladosporium (47%),"
		"Bipolaris (46.6%), other yeasts (43.7%), Alternaria (40%), dematiaceous molds"
		"(34%), Curvularia (32.4%), and Candida (31%) were the most frequently isolated"
		species. Species belonging to several other genera were also detected. This study
		revealed a relatively high prevalence of fungal organisms in mosque carpets in
		"Riyadh, suggesting the need for implementing new strategies and laws to increase"
		the level of hygiene awareness among worshipers and mosque caretakers to limit
		the spread of foot fungal infections.

PG	-	379-385
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-016-0089-1 [doi]
AB	-	We investigated the clinical and mycological characteristics of four cases of
		mycotic keratitis caused by Aspergillus flavus that occurred from July 2014 to
		"May 2015 at Çukurova University Hospital, Adana, Turkey. In a 10-month period, a"
		total of 64 corneal smear/scrapings were examined from patients with suspected
		"mycotic keratitis. Fungal cultures were positive in six of these patients,"
		"indicating a 9.4% incidence of mycotic keratitis in this region, including four"
		"cases of A. flavus and two cases of Fusarium spp. The predisposing factors,"
		"clinical presentation, and success of the therapeutic approaches were further"
		"evaluated. For all cases, topical voriconazole was the first choice of treatment."
		"Surgical procedures were required to control infection in 3 of the 4 cases,"
		including intrastromal voriconazole injection for two cases and keratoplasty for
		"one case. Predisposing factors included trauma (two cases, 50%), contact lens use"
		"(one case, 25%), and previous ocular surgery (one case, 25%). The clinical"
		"presentations also differed, including a well-limited ulcer (one case), an ulcer"
		"with an irregular feathery margin (one case), and ulcers with satellite lesions"
		(two cases). The mean duration between the time of presentation and definitive
		diagnosis by culture was 14 days (8-25 days). We observed that A. flavus
		keratitis can present with different underlying factors and clinical conditions.
		A combination of antifungal therapy and supportive surgical intervention may
		resolve infections caused by A. flavus in the cornea.

TI	-	Primary Gangrenous Cutaneous Mold Infections in a Patient With Cancer and
		Neutropenia.
PG	-	265-71
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Opportunistic fungal infections caused by Aspergillus and Candida
		"followed by infections with Fusarium, Rhizopus, Mucor, and Alternaria species are"
		an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with hematological
		"malignancies. Cutaneous mucormycosis infections are rare, and the incidence,"
		"outcomes, and factors associated with survival in the setting of hematological"
		malignancies are not clear. METHODS: A literature search was conducted for all
		cases of primary cutaneous mold infections in patients with hematological
		"malignancy, of which 50 cases were found. Our case of a patient with a"
		hematological malignancy who sustained a cat bite that in turn caused a primary
		"cutaneous mold infection is also included. RESULTS: In the 51 cases identified,"
		"66.7% were neutropenic upon presentation, and 54.9% were male with an average age"
		of 32 years. Aspergillus species (33.3%) was the most cited followed by Rhizopus
		species (19.6%). Overall mortality rate was 29.4% and was observed more
		frequently in patients with neutropenia (60.0%) and without surgical intervention
		(73.3%). Survival rate was higher (35.3%) for cases utilizing both antifungal and
		surgical intervention. The antifungal agent with the highest survival rate was
		amphotericin B and its formulations (58.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Neutropenia within
		hematological malignancies demonstrate a risk for developing severe cutaneous
		"fungal infections, of which primary cutaneous mucormycosis can carry significant"
		mortality. Combination antifungal therapy and surgical debridement appears to be
		associated with higher survival outcomes and warrants further investigation.

PG	-	49-53
LID	-	10.4103/ijo.IJO_500_18 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: To report the distribution and trends of types of organisms and
		antibiotic susceptibility of the bacterial isolates obtained from patients with
		microbial keratitis. METHODS: Microbiology records of culture-positive microbial
		keratitis that underwent a diagnostic corneal scraping and cultures were
		"reviewed. Fungal, bacterial, and parasitic culture results and antibiotic"
		susceptibility profile of bacteria were analyzed and comparisons were made
		between two halves of the study period (2007-2010 vs. 2011-2014). RESULTS: A
		total of 3981 corneal scrapings were processed during the 8-year study period.
		"Pathogen was recovered in culture in 1914 (48.1%) samples. Fungi, bacteria, and"
		"parasites constituted 38.7%, 60%, and 1.3% of the total isolates, respectively."
		"The common fungal isolates were Aspergillus spp. (224/868, 25.8%) and Fusarium"
		"spp. (200/868, 23.0%), while common Gram-positive bacteria were Streptococcus"
		"pneumoniae (217/1125, 19.3%) and Staphylococcus aureus (185/1125, 16.4%), and"
		"common Gram-negative bacteria was Pseudomonas spp. (99/219, 45.2%). There was no"
		significant difference in proportion of bacterial (P = 0.225) and fungal (P =
		0.421) keratitis between the first half and second half of the study period.
		There was a significant increase in proportion of Gram-positive isolates (P =
		0.015) [353/758 (46.6%) vs. 772/1482 (52.1%)] and decrease in proportion of
		Gram-negative organisms (P = 0.044) [88/758 (11.6%) vs. 131/1482 (8.8%)] in the
		recent years. In-vitro antibiotic susceptibility testing showed decrease in
		susceptibility to moxifloxacin for Pseudomonas spp. (P = 0.016) in recent years.
		CONCLUSION: Prevalence of fungal and bacterial keratitis has remained unchanged
		over the years. This study shows a significant increase in Gram-positive
		bacterial infection and decrease in Gram-negative bacterial infection of the
		cornea in the recent years.

		"stem cell transplant. Aspergillus spp. were the most common pathogens (69%),"
		"followed by mucormycetes (22%), Cryptococcus spp. (4%) and Fusarium spp. (2%)."
		The lung was the primary focus of fungal infection (48% of cases). The nervous
		"system biopsy was performed in 10% of IFI-CNS, and a sinus biopsy was performed"
		in 56% of IFI-PS (P = 0.03). The Galactomannan test on cerebrospinal fluid has
		"been performed in 42% of IFI-CNS (30/71), and it was positive in 67%. Eighty-four"
		pts received a first-line antifungal therapy with Amphotericine B in 58% of
		"cases, Voriconazole in 31% and both in 11%. Moreover, 58% of patients received 2"
		or more lines of therapy and 38% were treated with a combination of 2 or more
		antifungal drugs. The median duration of antifungal therapy was 60 days (range
		5-835). A surgical intervention was performed in 26% of cases but only 10% of
		IFI-CNS underwent neurosurgical intervention. The overall response rate to
		"antifungal therapy (complete or partial response) was 57%, and 1-year overall"
		survival was 32% without significant differences between IFI-CNS and IFI-PS. The
		overall mortality was 69% but the IFI attributable mortality was 33%. Mortality
		"of IFI-CNS/PS remains high but, compared to previous historical data, it seems to"
		be reduced probably due to the availability of newer antifungal drugs. The
		results arising from this large contemporary cohort of cases may allow a more
		effective diagnostic and therapeutic management of these very rare IFI
		complications in haematologic patients.

TI	-	Sphingolipids as biomarkers of fumonisin exposure and risk of esophageal squamous
		cell carcinoma in china.
PG	-	821-8
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: Ecologic studies of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) have
		reported an association with consumption of maize contaminated with Fusarium
		"verticillioides, which produce fungal toxins referred to as fumonisins."
		Fumonisins disrupt sphingolipid metabolism and serum sphingolipids have been
		proposed as biomarkers of fumonisin exposure. We conducted a prospective nested
		case-control study to examine the relationship between serum sphingolipids and
		ESCC incidence. METHODS: Cases and controls were selected from a large
		"prospective trial conducted in Linxian, People's Republic of China. Ninety-eight"
		ESCC cases were randomly selected from the 639 incident ESCC ascertained during
		the initial 5.25 years of follow-up: 185 controls were also randomly selected
		based on the distribution of cases among six age and sex strata. Concentrations
		of sphinganine and sphingosine were determined by high-performance liquid
		chromatography in serum collected at the study baseline. RESULTS: No significant
		"associations were found between serum sphingosine, sphinganine, or the"
		sphinganine/ sphingosine ratio and ESCC incidence in conditional and
		"unconditional logistic regression models with adjustment for age, sex, tobacco"
		use. and alcohol use. CONCLUSION: Our study is the first prospective study to
		"assess the relationship between sphingolipid levels, as biomarkers of fumonisin"
		"exposure, and cancer incidence. We found no significant association between"
		sphingolipid levels and risk of ESCC.

		Hospital Laboratory in Pakistan.
PG	-	241-244
LID	-	10.1093/jbcr/iraa148 [doi]
AB	-	Burn patients are at great risk of developing fungal wound infections. Fungi are
		frequently cultured from burn tissue specimens alone or in combination with
		"bacteria. However, the spectrum of fungi in burn patients from Pakistan has not"
		been reported previously. A retrospective laboratory-based study was conducted
		and data on all positive cultures from burn wounds were included. During the
		"study period, specimens were cultured on appropriate media and incubated for"
		anaerobic and aerobic growth. Clinical and demographic information recorded
		during clinical reporting was also collected. Seventy tissue cultures were
		"positive for microorganisms. Of these, 27 (39%) had growth of either filamentous"
		mold (17 cases) or Candida species (14 cases). Two cases had growth of both mold
		and yeast. Aspergillus flavus was the most common mold (9) followed by Fusarium
		species (3). Candida tropicalis was the most common yeast (7) followed by Candida
		"parapsilosis (4). There was concomitant bacterial growth in 19 cases,"
		"predominantly of Staphylococcus aureus (13), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8), and"
		other Gram-negative rods (6). Of the 35 patients in which treatment history was
		"available, 33 were receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. A high incidence of"
		fungal isolation was seen in this study. Their findings are consistent with the
		global increase in fungal infections in burn wounds. High index of suspicion by
		clinicians and revision of culture protocols in burn patients may be warranted
		for optimal patient management.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: To compare the postoperative complications and visual outcomes of
		big-bubble deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (BB-DALK) and penetrating
		keratoplasty (PK) for fungal keratitis (FK). METHODS: This retrospective study
		included 94 cases of BB-DALK for FK and 161 cases of PK for FK from a tertiary
		ophthalmology care centre. RESULTS: The most common FK pathogens were Fusarium
		"(n = 84, 32.9%) and Aspergillus (n = 67, 26.3%). The recurrence rates after"
		"BB-DALK and PK were 3.2 and 5%, respectively (p = 0.723). The follow-up duration"
		was 31.9 ± 15.8 months in the BB-DALK group and 33.9 ± 15.0 months in the PK
		group. The immune rejection rate was significantly lower in the BB-DALK group
		"than in the PK group (1.1 vs. 18.6%, p < 0.001), as was the incidence of"
		secondary glaucoma (p = 0.018). Endothelial cell density in the BB-DALK group
		"tended to be stable at postoperative month 6, whereas the PK group still"
		attenuated at a hyper-physiological rate. Postoperative best-corrected visual
		acuity (BCVA) significantly improved in both groups (p < 0.001). No significant
		"difference between-group was observed in BCVA, refractive cylinder, and spherical"
		equivalent postoperatively. CONCLUSION: Big-bubble DALK is a useful and safe
		alternative to PK for medically uncontrolled FK.

AB	-	"To describe the clinical features, management and outcomes in patients with"
		"fungal keratitis at the Sydney Eye Hospital, Australia, over a 9-year period to"
		guide appropriate initial therapy. A retrospective case review was conducted.
		Patients diagnosed with fungal keratitis from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2017
		were identified from hospital coding and pathology databases. Data were extracted
		from the medical records. A total of 55 episodes from 51 patients were included.
		"Mean age was 60 ± 20 years (range: 19-91 years), and 33 were male. The fungal"
		species was not identified in two patients. Predisposing factors included ocular
		"surface disease in 17 eyes (32%); corneal disease, 15 (28%); corneal trauma, 12"
		"(23%); and contact lens wear, 13 (24.5%). Fusarium spp. (15, 27%) and Candida"
		"parapsilosis (10, 18%) were the most common isolates. The median visual acuity at"
		presentation was 1.3 logMAR (range: 0 to 3) and after treatment 0.7 logMAR
		"(range: -0.02 to 3) (P = .008). Despite medical therapy, most commonly with"
		"natamycin and topical and oral voriconazole, surgical intervention was required"
		in 21 eyes (40%); including antifungal injections in 9 (16%); corneal
		"transplantation, 16 (30%); evisceration, 2 (4%); and enucleation, 1 (2%). A poor"
		visual outcome was recorded in 27 of 43 (63%) patients. Fungal keratitis remains
		a cause of significant ocular morbidity; the majority of patients face a poor
		"outcome despite intense medical and at times surgical treatment. In our setting,"
		fungal keratitis was more commonly associated with corneal or ocular surface
		disease.

PG	-	519-527
LID	-	10.1038/s41429-021-00431-4 [doi]
AB	-	Antifungal surveillance is an important tool to monitor the prevalence of
		uncommon fungal species and increasing antifungal resistance throughout the
		"world, but data comparing results across several different Asian countries are"
		"scarce. In this study, 372 invasive molds collected in the Asia-Western Pacific"
		region in 2011-2019 were susceptibility tested for mold-active triazoles
		"(isavuconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, and itraconazole). The collection"
		includes 318 Aspergillus spp. isolates and 53 non-Aspergillus molds. The MIC
		values using CLSI methods for isavuconazole versus Aspergillus fumigatus ranged
		"from 0.25 to 2 mg l(-1). Isavuconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, and"
		voriconazole acted similarly against A. fumigatus. The mold-active triazoles
		exhibited a wildtype phenotype to most of the Aspergillus spp. isolates tested
		"(>94%), but poor activity against Fusarium solani species complex and"
		Lomentospora prolificans. Voriconazole was most active against the Scedosporium
		"spp. and posaconazole was most active against the Mucorales. In summary,"
		isavuconazole displayed excellent activity against most species of Aspergillus
		and was comparable to other mold-active triazoles against non-Aspergillus molds.

PG	-	755-762
AB	-	"PURPOSE: To determine indications, therapeutic success, and corneal"
		transplantation techniques for advanced medically uncontrolled infectious
		"keratitis. DESIGN: Retrospective, interventional case series. METHODS: A review"
		of 92 consecutive patients (1991 to 2002) who underwent therapeutic keratoplasty
		for acute infectious keratitis performed at Singapore National Eye Centre.
		Causative organism(s) were identified and outcomes were evaluated in terms of
		"infectious cure (therapeutic success), graft clarity, and visual acuity. RESULTS:"
		Pseudomonas aeruginosa (58.7%) and Fusarium species (32.3%) were the predominant
		"organisms for bacterial and fungal keratitis, respectively. Keratoplasty types"
		included penetrating keratoplasty (PK; n = 80) and lamellar keratoplasty (n =
		"12). Mean graft diameter was 9.5 mm (range, 5.5 to 14 mm). Seventy-four patients"
		"(80.4%) achieved therapeutic success after one keratoplasty procedure, three"
		patients were cured after a second keratoplasty. Life-table survival analysis
		computed the one-year therapeutic survival for bacterial and fungal keratitis as
		"76.6% and 72.4%, respectively (P = .76). The Kaplan-Meier one-year survival rate"
		for PK optical clarity was 72%. Twenty-two patients underwent repeat keratoplasty
		"for various reasons (optical, n = 8; recurrent primary infection, n = 7;"
		"perforation or subsequent new infections, n = 7). Of the 15 patients for whom"
		"therapy failed, 11 had fungal keratitis. Infection recurrence time was four days"
		to one year. Most recurrences (n = 11) appeared within six weeks after surgery.
		"CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic keratoplasty may treat severe, refractory infectious"
		"keratitis effectively. High cure rates are achievable, although infection"
		recurrence despite prolonged treatment remains a significant problem in fungal
		keratitis.

AB	-	"PURPOSE: To report the spectrum of fungal keratitis at Wills Eye Hospital,"
		Philadelphia. METHODS: We reviewed the records of 24 cases of culture-positive
		fungal keratitis treated from January 1991 to March 1999 at Wills Eye Hospital.
		"Risk factors, fungal identification, antifungal treatment, and outcomes were"
		evaluated. RESULTS: The study included 24 eyes (24 patients). Fourteen patients
		"(58.3%) were female. The mean age was 59 years (range, 19-86 years). Predisposing"
		"factors included chronic ocular surface disease (41.7%), contact lens wear"
		"(29.2%), atopic disease (16.7%), topical steroid use (16.7%), and ocular trauma"
		(8.3%). Early identification of fungal elements was achieved by staining of
		corneal scrapings in 18 cases (75%). Half of the cases (12 eyes) had corneal
		"infections caused by yeast, and the other half by filamentous fungi. Candida"
		"albicans was the most commonly isolated organism (45.8%), followed by Fusarium sp"
		(25%). Natamycin and amphotericin B were the topical antifungals most frequently
		"used, while systemic treatment commonly used included fluconazole, ketoconazole,"
		or itraconazole. Six patients (25%) had penetrating keratoplasty during the acute
		"stage of infection. After a mean follow-up of nine months, 13 eyes (54.1%) had"
		the best corrected visual acuity 20/100 or better. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to
		"other studies from the northern United States, we found Fusarium sp the most"
		"commonly isolated filamentous fungus. In our series, C. albicans was the most"
		"frequent cause of fungal keratitis, and a past history of ocular trauma was"
		uncommon.

AB	-	Fungal infections are becoming increasingly recognized among burn patients.
		"Infection with Fusarium, a filamentous mold, is rarely encountered and mainly"
		seen in immunocompromised patients. High mortality and morbidity were reported
		with these virulent infections. We present a rare case of refractory septic shock
		from upper extremity fungal infection with Fusarium solani in a burn patient.
		Multiple operative debridements and below elbow amputation caused resolution of
		septic shock. Closure was achieved with a split thickness skin graft. Aggressive
		approach should be adopted in managing burn patients with Fusarium infection.
		Serial debridements and extremity amputation should be considered in attempts to
		improve survival.

TI	-	Risk factors for contact lens-related fusarium keratitis: a case-control study in
		Singapore.
PG	-	611-7
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the specific contact lens-related or other factors that
		may contribute to the outbreak of Fusarium keratitis. METHODS: A case-control
		study was conducted of Fusarium keratitis in contact lens users in Singapore from
		"March 1, 2005, to May 31, 2006, and included 61 patients with Fusarium keratitis"
		and 188 population-based and 179 hospital-based control subjects. Interviewers
		asked about contact lens solution use and other risk factors. RESULTS: Patients
		with Fusarium keratitis were more likely to use ReNu contact lens solutions
		"(Bausch & Lomb, Rochester, NY) 58 [95.1%] of 61 cases) than were either"
		population-based (62 [34.3%] of 181) or hospital-based (50 [30.1%] of 166)
		"control subjects. After controlling for age, sex, contact lens hygiene, and other"
		"factors, the use of ReNu with MoistureLoc significantly increased the risk of"
		"Fusarium keratitis (odds ratio, 99.3; 95% confidence interval, 18.4-535.4;"
		"P<.001), and the risk was 5 times higher compared with the risk with use of ReNu"
		"MultiPlus, a multipurpose solution (odds ratio, 21.5; 95% confidence interval,"
		4.0-115.5; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The use of ReNu contact lens solutions
		significantly increased the risk of contact lens-related Fusarium keratitis in
		Singapore. Our data support the recall of ReNu MultiPlus from the Singapore
		market and the need for further investigations into the role of ReNu MultiPlus in
		the development of Fusarium keratitis in other populations.

TI	-	Bacterial and fungal profile of corneal ulcers--a prospective study.
PG	-	273-7
AB	-	Corneal ulceration continues to be one of the most important causes of ocular
		"morbidity and blindness worldwide. Between April 1999 and May 2001, 80 patients"
		"with corneal ulceration were examined to find the causative microorganisms, the"
		"sensitivity pattern of bacterial isolates to antibiotics, the predisposing"
		factorsfor ulcerative keratitis and the comparison between culture and gram
		"staining results. Corneal ulceration was seen more in males than females,"
		predominantly in farmers (61.25%) and trauma was the commonest predisposing
		"factor, the agents being mainly organic agricultural materials. Of the 80 corneal"
		"ulcers, 32(40%) yielded pure bacterial growth while fungal growth was seen in"
		10(12.5%). Streptococcus pneumoniae was the commonest bacterium while Aspergillus
		fumigatus and Fusarium species were the commonest fungi isolated. Most of the
		bacterial isolates were sensitive to chloramphenicol and tetracycline followed by
		the quinolones. The overall sensitivity and specificity of Gram staining as
		compared to culture was 57.14% and 94.7% respectively.

PG	-	644074

AB	-	Fungal keratitis is a common disease in certain parts of the world and affects
		"several species, including equids, camelids, and homo sapiens, leading to"
		blindness or loss of the eye if the infection is not adequately controlled.
		Reports of clinical use of antifungals caspofungin and terbinafine are limited
		across both veterinary and human medical literature. The alpaca presented in this
		case demonstrates that deep keratomycosis can be caused by Scopulariopsis
		"brevicaulis and Fusarium verticillioides, two previously unreported fungi to"
		cause keratomycosis in camelids. This report demonstrates successful management
		with a combination of surgery and topical ophthalmic treatment with caspofungin
		"0.5% solution and terbinafine 1% dermatologic cream, after initially failing"
		treatment with topical voriconazole 1% solution. Combination therapy appears more
		"effective than monotherapy with some fungal organisms, and synergy between"
		antifungal agents is thought to play a role in the success of combination
		therapy. Surgery to remove the bulk of the fungal infection is especially helpful
		in cases that fail initial medical therapy.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Fusarium is a conditional pathogen that can cause invasive infection
		in patients with hematological diseases under immune function. METHODS: A case of
		recurrent and refractory Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic
		leukemia was treated with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
		after chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cells treatment. RESULTS: During
		"transplantation, disseminated Fusarium infection occurred, involving the skin,"
		"liver, spleen and central nervous system, and the patient eventually died."
		CONCLUSIONS: Early identification of Fusarium infection based on the
		characteristic rash and timely antifungal treatment can improve the cure rate.

AB	-	Immunocompromised patients are at high risk of developing serious disseminated
		"infections by opportunistic fungi (Aspergillus, Candida, and Fusarium spp), which"
		"frequently present as cutaneous lesions, sometimes as a first sign. Prolonged and"
		"deep neutropenia, immunodepressive treatments (systemic steroids and"
		chemotherapy) and severe T-cell immunodeficiency are the most important risk
		"factors. We report 2 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, who developed"
		multiple tender erythematous skin lesions on their legs and arms during
		chemotherapy treatment. Skin biopsies for histology and culture studies
		established the diagnosis of Fusarium infection. They received treatment with
		systemic antifungal and granulocyte colony-stimulting factor. The infection
		responded after recovering from neutropenia. Early diagnosis and treatment is
		"very important to improve the prognosis, because these infections in"
		immunodepressed hosts have a high mortality rate.

PG	-	387-93
LID	-	10.1007/s10792-014-9961-5 [doi]
AB	-	The aim of the study was to report the clinical and microbiological profiles of
		"Fusarium keratitis. In this single-centre, retrospective, non-comparative case"
		"series, 47 laboratory-confirmed cases of keratitis caused by Fusarium species"
		"treated at the L V Prasad Eye Institute, Bhubaneswar, India, between November"
		"2006 and October 2009, were reviewed. The analysis included predisposing factors,"
		"clinical characteristics, microbiological findings, treatment and outcome."
		Forty-seven samples of 47 patients were included in the study. The mean age of
		the 47 patients was 46 ± 17 years. Twelve eyes had a history of injury. Corneal
		scraping could not be done in one of the cases due to large perforation. Fungal
		"filaments were detected in corneal scraping in 41 cases, and in three cases"
		microconidia were observed in microscopy. Fusarium solani was the most common
		species (44.7 %). All three cases where microconidia were present in smear were
		identified as F. solani in culture. The mean time to positive culture was 2.4 ±
		1.5 days. Twenty-three patients underwent adjunctive surgical procedure. Visual
		acuity of <20/200 at presentation and final follow-up was noted in 80.9 and 51.4
		"% patients, respectively. One-half (23/47) of the patients had improvement in"
		visual acuity. Fusarium keratitis may present after trauma without any satellite
		"lesion, and the response to medical therapy is generally poor. Rapid diagnosis"
		can be made by smear examination of corneal scrapings in a majority of the cases
		and confirmed by culture within 2-3 days. Presence of microconidia in smear
		examination may be suggestive of F. solani.

PG	-	443-8
LID	-	10.1016/j.ijid.2007.12.018 [doi]
AB	-	"OBJECTIVES: Starting in mid-2005, an increase in fungal keratitis caused by"
		"Fusarium spp was observed among contact lens wearers in Hong Kong, Singapore, and"
		the USA. The objective of this study was to describe the outbreak and to
		determine any association with the use of Bausch & Lomb (B&L) ReNu contact lens
		solution. METHODS: We defined a case as a disposable contact lens user with
		ophthalmologist-diagnosed keratitis and a positive culture of Fusarium spp
		"reported to the Department of Health from January 1, 2005 to May 31, 2006. We"
		identified cases through inpatient discharge data and the electronic laboratory
		"databases of all public hospitals, and from physician reporting. Controls were"
		recruited from three outpatient clinics. Risk factors were collected using a
		standardized questionnaire and analyzed by univariate analysis and binary
		"logistic regression. RESULTS: From January 2005 through May 2006, we identified"
		33 cases of Fusarium keratitis. Most were in young adults (mean age 28 years) who
		"presented with eye pain (100%), redness (84%), photophobia (41%), and tearing"
		(34%). Twenty-four cases and 86 controls were recruited in the case-control
		"study. By logistic regression, B&L ReNu solution showed the strongest association"
		"with being a case (adjusted odds ratio 26.1, 95% confidence interval 3.0-225.3)"
		after adjusting for potential confounders. CONCLUSION: Using B&L ReNu contact
		lens solution was strongly associated with Fusarium keratitis among disposable
		contact lens users in Hong Kong. B&L ReNu with MoistureLoc was permanently
		withdrawn from the market globally in May 2006.

PG	-	43-46
LID	-	10.18869/acadpub.cmm.2.1.43 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Fusariosis is a fungal infection often involving the
		"skin. Various species can cause local, focally invasive, or disseminated"
		infections. The routes of entry for Fusarium species include the respiratory
		"tract, gastrointestinal tract, toe nails, trauma to the skin, and indwelling"
		"central venous catheter. CASE REPORT: Herein, we present the case of a"
		35-year-old woman presenting with interdigital intertrigo. The patient had no
		predisposing factors and she did not take any antifungal agents. Fusiform
		macroconidia were observed on the slide culture of the fungus. The etiological
		agent of the infection was identified as Fusarium oxysporum through sequencing of
		the translation elongation factor-1 alpha (TEF-1α) gene using the primers EF1 and
		EF2. CONCLUSION: Fusariosis commonly presents as a severe fungal infection in
		"immunocompromised patients. However, this infection may also occur in"
		immunocompetent patients. Although treatment with amphotericin B is a routine
		"antifungal therapy for fusariosis, many azoles such as cloterimazole can be used"
		topically with fewer side-effects.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Optimal management of eumycetoma, a severely debilitating chronic"
		"progressive fungal infection of skin, disseminating to bone and viscera, remains"
		"challenging. Especially, optimal antifungal treatment and duration are ill"
		defined. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted a monocentric retrospective
		study of 11 imported cases of eumycetoma treated by voriconazole or posaconazole
		for at least 6 months. Response to treatment was assessed through evolution of
		clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). (1→3) ß-D-glucan (BG) and positron
		emission tomography using [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose (PET/CT) results were also
		assessed. Identified species were Fusarium solani complex (n = 3); Madurella
		"mycetomatis, (n = 3), and Exophiala jeanselmei, (n = 1). Moreover, two"
		coelomycetes and one phaeohyphomycetes strains without species identification
		"were retrieved. Serum BG and PET/CT were abnormal in 7/8 and 6/6 patients tested,"
		respectively. Patients received last generation azoles for a mean duration of
		25.9±18 months. Complete response (major clinical and MRI improvement) was
		"observed in 5/11 patients, partial response (minor MRI improvement or stable MRI"
		"findings) in 5 and failure (MRI evidence of disease progression) in one, with a"
		73±39 [6-132] months mean follow-up. Relapse occurred in 2 patients after
		"treatment discontinuation. Optimal outcome was associated with fungal species,"
		"initiation of last generation triazole therapy (<65 months since first symptoms),"
		"negative serum BG and PET/CT normalization. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: MRI, PET/CT"
		and serum BG appear as promising tools to assess optimal time of antifungal
		treatment for eumycetoma.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Pediatric infectious endophthalmitis is a serious sight-threatening
		"disease for children. The purpose of this study was to investigate the etiology,"
		"microbiological spectrum, and visual outcomes of infectious endophthalmitis in"
		children at a single institution in China. METHODS: It is a retrospective study
		of the medical records of all patients under 14 years of age with histories of
		"infectious endophthalmitis, treated at a single institution from January 1, 2009"
		"to January 1, 2015. The clinical characteristics, etiology, microbiological"
		"spectrum, and management, as well as the visual outcomes, were analyzed. The"
		Kappa test and Chi-square test were used in the statistical evaluation. RESULTS:
		"A total of 271 children were identified, with a mean age of 5.61 ± 2.93 years"
		(range 5 months to 14 years). Ocular trauma (94.8%) and previous ocular surgery
		"(3.0%) were the most common etiologies. Overall, 147 (54.2%) cases had positive"
		"cultures, and 176 organisms were isolated from these patients. A single species"
		"was isolated in 120 (81.6%) cases, with multiple organisms in 27 (18.4%) cases,"
		and the most commonly identified organisms were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus
		"and Streptococcus species, comprising 29.5% and 26.8% of the isolates,"
		"respectively. Moreover, of 176 isolates, 142 (80.8%) were Gram-positive"
		"organisms, 23 (13.0%) were Gram-negative organisms, and 11 (6.2%) were fungi. The"
		"final visual outcomes were 20/200 or better in 66 (24.4%) eyes, counting fingers"
		"to 20/200 in 34 (12.5%), hand motions in 30 (11.1%), light perception in 33"
		"(12.2%), no light perception in 32 (11.8%), and 9 (3.3%) eyes were enucleated or"
		eviscerated. The visual outcomes were not available in 67 (24.7%) patients.
		CONCLUSIONS: Penetrating ocular trauma is the most frequent cause of pediatric
		endophthalmitis in China. Streptococcus and Staphylococcus species are the most
		commonly identified organisms in exogenous pediatric endophthalmitis whereas
		Fusarium species are commonly seen in endogenous endophthalmitis. In this
		"research, in spite of aggressive management with antibiotics and vitrectomy, the"
		visual prognosis was found to be generally poor.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Fungi of the genus Fusarium are primarily plant pathogens and
		saprobes that produce disseminated infections in immunologically deficient
		"humans. After aspergillosis, disseminated fusariosis is the second most common"
		cause of invasive infection by filamentous fungi in patients with hematologic
		malignancies or those undergoing transplants of hematopoietic progenitors. AIMS:
		Disseminated fusariosis (DF) is considered an extremely rare infection and has
		"reached a stable incidence rate, but its high mortality rate and the lack of an"
		optimal management protocol have raised increasing interest in this mycosis.
		METHODS: We present three cases of DF produced by Fusarium oxysporum species
		"complex, Fusarium solani species complex and the highly unusual Fusarium dimerum"
		in patients with advanced hematological malignancies diagnosed in our hospital
		between 2007 and 2011. The species level identification of the Fusarium isolates
		was established by sequencing their TEF1 gene. RESULTS: The isolates showed low
		"susceptibility to most of the antifungal agents analyzed, except that observed"
		"for F. dimerum to amphotericin B (AmB) and terbinafine, and F. oxysporum species"
		"complex to AmB. Interestingly, the strain of F. solani species complex exhibited"
		"high MIC values for AmB and voriconazole, notwithstanding these drugs were used"
		for treatment with good results. Other relevant aspects to be considered in the
		"treatment of DF are surgically cleaning foci of infection, withdrawing presumably"
		contaminated catheters and recovery from neutropenia. CONCLUSIONS: The prevention
		"of infection in colonized patients, the maintenance of a high level of diagnostic"
		"suspicion for early diagnosis, and the combined, vigorous and prolonged use of"
		L-AmB and voriconazole are essential to decrease the mortality rate of this
		devastating infection.

AB	-	PURPOSE: To describe a unique case of LASIK flap fungal keratitis confirmed by
		next generation sequencing. OBSERVATIONS: A 56-year-old female presented with
		refractory keratitis involving her LASIK flap 21 years after surgery. Confocal
		was positive for filamentous structures. The patient underwent immediate flap
		amputation followed by topical antifungal treatment. Corneal culture was positive
		for Acremonium sp. Metagenomic deep sequencing confirmed Acremonium as the
		primary source of infection and also identified Fusarium as a likely contributor
		of a mixed fungal infection. Sequencing also identified hay as the likely source
		of the infection. Treatment resulted in eradication of the infection. The
		patient's final best corrected visual acuity was 20/30 with rigid contact lens
		overrefraction. CONCLUSIONS: Metagenomic deep sequencing is a novel diagnostic
		tool that is increasingly being utilized for diagnosis of refractory keratitis.
		This case demonstrates the diagnostic potential of deep sequencing for
		identifying post-LASIK keratitis and reinforces the utility of LASIK flap
		amputation in the setting of tectonic flap instability due to keratolysis.
		IMPORTANCE: This case highlights several important clinical points for treating
		LASIK flap keratitis and highlights the emerging role metagenomic sequencing has
		in the diagnosis of infectious keratitis. This is first known case using next
		generation sequencing to diagnose a post-LASIK infectious keratitis.

TI	-	Efficacy and safety of amphotericin B lipid complex injection (ABLC) in
		solid-organ transplant recipients with invasive fungal infections.
PG	-	329-39
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Fungal infections following solid-organ transplantation are a major
		source of morbidity and mortality. This report describes the efficacy and safety
		of Amphotericin B Lipid Complex Injection (ABLC) in solid-organ transplant
		"recipients. METHODS: Three open-label, second-line treatment studies evaluated"
		"ABLC as a treatment for severe, life-threatening mycoses in patients who were"
		refractory to or intolerant to conventional antifungal (mostly amphotericin B
		[AmB]) therapy or had pre-existing renal disease. RESULTS: The 79 solid-organ
		"transplant recipients (25 heart, 20 liver, 17 kidney, 11 lung, 5 multiple, 1"
		pancreas) who received ABLC in these studies had the following fungal infections:
		aspergillosis (n = 39); candidiasis (n = 20); zygomycosis (n = 8); cryptococcosis
		"and histoplasmosis (n = 3 each); and blastomycosis, cladosporiosis, fusariosis,"
		"Bipolaris hawaiiensis, Dactylaria gallopava, and an unspecified fungal infection"
		(n = 1 each). The median duration of ABLC therapy was 28 d (1-178 d). The daily
		"dose ranged between 1.6 and 7.4 mg/kg (median, 4.6 mg/kg). The clinical response"
		rate for the patients who could be assessed was 58% (39/67). Clinical response
		"rates for heart, liver, kidney, and lung recipients were 59, 60, 67, and 40%,"
		"respectively; response rates for aspergillosis and candidiasis were 47 and 71%,"
		respectively. Forty-six of the 79 patients (58%) survived for more than 28 d
		after the last dose of ABLC. Mean baseline serum creatinine was 3.2 mg/dL; 64
		patients (81%) had stable (n = 37) or improved (n = 27) serum creatinine at the
		end of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: ABLC is safe and effective treatment for fungal
		infections in solid-organ transplant recipients. Its renal-sparing properties are
		particularly suited for this high-risk population for renal failure.

PG	-	258-62
AB	-	"PURPOSE: This study aimed to present two patients with delayed-onset, endogenous"
		fungal keratitis after treatment for fungal endophthalmitis after cataract
		surgery. METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed the clinical course of two
		"patients in whom deep stromal fungal keratitis developed 2 weeks and 3 months,"
		"respectively, after apparent successful aggressive therapy for fungal"
		"endophthalmitis. Before the onset of the keratitis, both patients underwent"
		"vitrectomies with intraocular injection of 7.5 to 10.0 mcg amphotericin B, as"
		well as treatment with systemic fluconazole and topical antifungal therapy. In
		"case 1, a pre-existing prosthetic intraocular lens and lens capsular bag were"
		"removed at the time of vitrectomy, whereas in case 2, the intraocular lens was"
		left in place and a posterior capsulectomy was performed. RESULTS: The keratitis
		"worsened in both patients, despite intensive systemic and topical antifungal"
		therapy. Both patients underwent therapeutic penetrating keratoplasties. In case
		"1, this resulted in successful resolution of the infection and no recurrences 3"
		months after the transplant. The corneal transplant was complicated by an
		expulsive choroidal hemorrhage in the other patient. Fusarium solani was cultured
		"from the initial vitrectomy specimen in patient 1, and although it was not"
		"cultured from the keratitis, septate hyphal elements were present on"
		histopathologic examination. The causative organism in case 2 was Acremonium
		"kiliense, which was cultured from both the original vitrectomy specimen and the"
		deep corneal stromal infiltrate. CONCLUSIONS: Fungal organisms may not be
		eradicated completely from eyes with endophthalmitis despite aggressive therapy
		and apparent initial successful treatment. These patients need to be monitored
		"for prolonged periods, and treatment should be reinitiated at the earliest sign"
		of recrudescence of infection.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Pediatric mycotic infections in the eye are uncommon. However,"
		ophthalmic infections by several fungal species have been described in
		immunocompetent subjects. Mycotic keratitis with or without conjunctivitis (MK)
		"may account for more than 50% of all cases, particularly in tropical and"
		sub-tropical areas. The leading mechanism is trauma. Treatment of MK is managed
		by medical (antifungal agents) and/or surgical means. This is the first case
		report of a patient with MK by Fusarium spp. successfully treated with
		"keratoplasty and intravenous voriconazole, along with topical natamycin. METHODS:"
		Keratoplasty was performed and cultures obtained. Both Blood and Sabouraud Agars
		"were used for cultures, and Lactophenol Cotton Blue Staining for microscopic"
		"observation. RESULTS: A healthy, 10 year-old female, from the sub-tropical area"
		"of Sinaloa, Mexico, was admitted at both the CODET Vision Institute and the"
		"General Hospital of Tijuana, Mexico. Seven days after a direct trauma of the"
		"right cornea, the patient complained of progressive blurred vision, burning"
		"sensation, and itchiness. Clinical examination showed severe"
		"keratoconjunctivitis, and a necrotic slough on the cornea. Fungal colonies grew,"
		"and microscopic visualization showed typical ovoid, sickle-cell shaped"
		macroconidia characteristics of Fusarium spp. The patient received intravenous
		voriconazole (200 mg every 12 h) and topical natamycin for 7 days prior and
		6 days after keratoplasty. Topical natamycin was continued for 3 weeks. At
		"1-month follow-up, the patient's outcome was significantly improved, with 90%"
		vision recovery. CONCLUSION: This is the first pediatric case report of severe MK
		"by Fusarium spp. successfully treated with combined intravenous voriconazole,"
		keratoplasty and topical natamycin.

PG	-	1406-11
LID	-	10.1097/ICO.0b013e3181da571b [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: To report trends in fungal keratitis from a single institution between
		1999 and 2008. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of the patients presenting to
		the cornea service with fungal keratitis from April 1999 to December 2008.
		RESULTS: Seventy-eight eyes of 76 patients were identified. The most common
		"predisposing factors included contact lens use (35.9%), trauma (21.8%), and"
		history of penetrating keratoplasty (15.4%). There was a significant increase in
		"the rate of contact lens-related Fusarium infections over time, which peaked in"
		2005 and 2006 (P = 0.021). Almost 40% of fungal keratitis cases [11 of 28 eyes
		"(39.3%)] were soft contact lens-related Fusarium infections in 2005 and 2006, and"
		this decreased to less than 10% [2 of 25 eyes (8%)] in 2007 and 2008. The odds of
		having a contact lens-related Fusarium infection in 2005-2006 compared with
		2007-2008 was 4.40 (95% confidence interval of 0.60-32.50) (P = 0.178). Despite
		"the decrease in contact lens-related Fusarium infections, the number of fungal"
		"infections remained elevated in 2007 (10 eyes) and 2008 (14 eyes), including"
		contact lens-related infections (3 in 2007 and 6 in 2008). CONCLUSIONS: A
		definite increase in the number of fungal keratitis cases began in 2004 and
		continued through 2006 during the Fusarium outbreak associated with ReNu with
		"MoistureLoc. Despite the decrease in contact lens-related Fusarium infections,"
		the overall number of fungal keratitis cases remained high through 2008. Fungal
		keratitis was more often associated with contact lens use than with trauma in
		this time.

TI	-	MICROMYCETES INFECTION IN PATIENTS WITH THERMAL TRAUMA.
PG	-	27-32
AB	-	GOAL: Determination of basic epidemiological parameters of burn patients with
		micromycetes infection. Identification of the most important micromycetes in burn
		patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Monocentre retrospective study enrolling all
		adult burn patients who were hospitalized between 2007 and 2015 and in whom
		micromycetes were isolated during hospitalization. ABSI index (Abbreviated Burn
		Severity Index) was used to evaluate severity of thermal trauma. Results were
		statistically analysed. RESULTS: There were 61 patients with thermal trauma
		"identified in total during the period of observation, and there were yeast or"
		fibrous fungi isolated. There were 37 males and 24 females (M:F ratio - 1.5:1) in
		this group. The average age of patients was 57.3 years (29 patients were aged up
		"to 60 years, 32 patients were over the age of 60 years, inclusive). 6 patients"
		died (lethality was 9.8%). The average extent of the burn area was 21.6% TBSA
		(median 14.0%). There were 90 strains of micromycetes cultured in total in these
		"patients (79 yeasts, 11 fibrous fungi). Micromycetes were isolated from burn area"
		"in 30 patients, from the lower airways in 19 patients, from the urogenital area"
		in 15 patients and from blood culture in 7 patients. Non-albicans Candida species
		were predominant among yeasts (60 strains); Candida albicans was isolated 16
		times in total. Aspergillus fumigatus (4 isolations) and Fusarium species (2
		isolations) were predominant species among fibrous fungi. CONCLUSION: We
		successfully identified the basic epidemiological parameters in burn patients
		"with micromycetes infection, similarly to the most important yeasts and fibrous"
		fungi causing infection in these patients.

AB	-	Members of the Fusarium solani species complex (FSSC) are causing the majority of
		the fusariosis in humans. Disseminated fusariosis has a high mortality and is
		"predominantly observed in patients with leukemia. Here, we present the case of a"
		"fatal infection by a Fusarium strain with a degenerated phenotype, in a patient"
		with acute lymphatic leukemia. Multiple nasal and skin biopsies as well as blood
		"cultures yielded fungal growth, while in direct and histopathological examination"
		of biopsy material septate hyphae were visible. Initial colonies were white with
		"slimy masses with microconidia reminiscent of Fusarium/Acremonium, but with"
		conidiospore production directly on the hyphae. Multi-locus sequence typing
		discerned a pionnotal-morphologically degenerated-colony of the recently
		recognized F. petroliphilum as etiological agent. The culture returned to a
		typical F. solani species complex morphology only after several weeks of growth
		in culture. Antifungal susceptibility tests indicate amphotericin B as best drug
		for this FSSC member rather than any of the azoles or echinocandins.

AB	-	Within last 25 years we have observed 20 cases of fungal meningitis and/or
		cerebral abscesses. Commonest etiologic agens was Candida spp. (C. albicans 9 of
		20). Molds were responsible for 4 cases of brain abscess. Mortality was 50% what
		seems to be very high. Extremely high mortality is caused by delayed onset of
		"therapy, severe underlying disease and multiresistant fungal organisms such as"
		"Mucorales, Fusarium solani and Aureobasidium."

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Fusarium spp are ubiquitous fungi recognized as opportunistic
		"agents of human infections, and can produce severe infections in burn patients."
		The literature on Fusarium spp infections in pediatric burn patients is scarce.
		OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical and epidemiological features as well as
		outcome of Fusarium spp infections in pediatric burn patients. PATIENTS AND
		"METHODS: Retrospective, descriptive study of Fusarium spp infections in a"
		specialized intensive care burn unit. RESULTS: In 15 patients Fusarium spp
		infections were diagnosed. Median age was 48 months. Direct fire injury was
		observed in ten patients. The median affected burn surface area was 45%. Twelve
		patients had a full thickness burn. Fourteen patients had a Garces Index ≥3.
		Fungal infection developed at a median of 11 days after burn injury. Fungi were
		isolated from burn wound in 14 patients and from the bone in one patient.
		Amphotericin B was the drug of choice for treatment followed by voriconazole.
		Median time of treatment completion was 23 days. One patient (7%) died of fungal
		infection-related causes. CONCLUSION: In our series Fusarium spp was an uncommon
		pathogen in severely burnt patients. The burn wound was the most common site of
		infection and mortality was low.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk factors for primary implant exposure after
		"enucleation and evisceration in infected eyes. DESIGN: Retrospective, comparative"
		case series. PARTICIPANTS: Patients who underwent enucleation or evisceration for
		infected eyes. METHODS: Records of patients who underwent enucleation or
		evisceration for infected eyes with placement of solid sphere implants were
		"reviewed. Preoperative white blood cell (WBC) count, microbiologic laboratory"
		"results, clinical features, medical treatment, and surgical methods were recorded"
		to evaluate the risk for implant exposure. RESULTS: Eighty-five infected eyes
		were collected. The mean age was 70.1 years. The positive culture rate was 69.4%.
		"In 42 patients with endophthalmitis or panophthalmitis, the most common"
		microorganisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 6 cases (20.7%) and Klebsiella
		"pneumoniae in 7 cases (24.1%). In 50 patients with keratitis or scleritis, the"
		most common microorganisms were P. aeruginosa in 14 eyes (46.7%) and Fusarium in
		4 eyes (13.3%). There was a 12.9% exposure rate for the 85 patients. Preoperative
		WBC count was significantly higher in patients with implant exposure compared
		with those without exposure (p = 0.04). Preoperative WBC count more than 9500
		cells/L had significantly higher exposure (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative
		elevated WBC count was associated with higher risk for implant exposure. Primary
		implantation after enucleation or evisceration may be less safe in infected eyes
		with high preoperative WBC count.

LID	-	10.1136/bcr-2016-215401 [doi]
LID	-	bcr2016215401
AB	-	Mycotic keratitis is an ocular infective process derived from any fungal species
		"capable of corneal invasion. Despite its rarity in developed countries, its"
		challenging and elusive diagnosis may result in keratoplasty or enucleation
		following failed medical management. Filamentous fungi such as Fusarium are often
		implicated in mycotic keratitis. Bearing greater morbidity than its bacterial
		"counterpart, mycotic keratitis requires early clinical suspicion and initiation"
		of antifungal therapy to prevent devastating consequences. We describe a case of
		multidrug-resistant mycotic keratitis in a 46-year-old man who continued to
		"decline despite maximal therapy and therapeutic keratoplasty. Finally,"
		enucleation was performed as a means of source control preventing dissemination
		of a likely untreatable fungal infection into the orbit. Multidrug-resistant
		"Fusarium is rare, and may progress to endophthalmitis. We discuss potential"
		management options which may enhance diagnosis and outcome in this condition.

TI	-	Recent pattern of contact lens-related keratitis in Hong Kong.
PG	-	284-7
AB	-	PURPOSE: To describe the changing pattern of clinical features and microbiology
		of contact lens-associated microbial keratitis in Hong Kong. METHODS: This is a
		retrospective observational case series of patients diagnosed with contact
		lens-associated microbial keratitis between July 2004 and April 2005 and between
		July 2005 and April 2006. Patients who wore contact lenses solely for the
		correction of refractive error and who were seen at Queen Mary Hospital were
		"included in the study. The clinical characteristics, microbiology, and visual"
		outcomes were compared. RESULTS: There were 14 cases between July 2004 and April
		2005. Most cases had an axial lesion (eight) or paraxial lesions (four). Corneal
		"scrapings were positive in seven (50%) patients, among whom six showed"
		Pseudomonas aeruginosa and one showed Serratia marcescens as the pathogens.
		Contact lens storage cases yielded polymicrobial growth in two cases. For the
		"more recent cohort, Fusarium species had been identified as the dominant"
		"pathogen, and most (60%) contact lens storage cases showed polymicrobial growth."
		CONCLUSIONS: There has been an increased number of cases of contact
		lens-associated fungal keratitis recently. Fusarium species and polymicrobial
		growth are becoming more dominant.

		"agents isolated and identified were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus"
		"pneumoniae, Aspergillus flavus, A. niger, Fusarium oxysporum, and Lasiodiplodia"
		theobromae. In vitro the fungi showed sensitivity in decreasing order to
		"flucytosine, nystatin, amphotericin B and econazole. Due to the out-patient"
		"status of the patients, their in-vivo response to treatment was not assessable."

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Mycotic keratitis by moulds (MKM) is an important cause for corneal
		blindness and usually carries an unfavorable prognosis. AIMS: This study
		describes the risk factors and demographic and microbiological features of all
		MKM cases in Santa Lucía Ophthalmology Hospital during a period of 6 years.
		METHODS: A prospective study was performed for all MKM cases diagnosed between
		"October 2007 and September 2013. RESULTS: Among 157 diagnosed cases, direct"
		microscopic examination and culture were positive in 97 and 96% of the cases
		respectively. MKM represents 17% of all microbiologically confirmed corneal
		abscesses. No significant differences were detected in annual MKM frequencies
		"across the study period, suggesting that MKM incidence remains constant over"
		time. A male-to-female ratio was observed (2.8:1); the most affected age groups
		ranged from 31 to 40 years old (males) and 61-70 years old (females). The most
		frequent predisposing factor was trauma (40%) followed by the use of contact
		"lenses (9%), herpetic abscesses (5%) and diabetes (4%). The predominant genera"
		"were Fusarium (66%), Aspergillus (10%), Curvularia (6%) and Alternaria (4%). The"
		most frequent agent was Fusarium solani species complex (52%). More than
		"two-thirds of the cases were produced by only 3 species or complexes. However, at"
		least 29 different species were detected in the remaining cases. This is the
		first report of Pholiota sp. as causative agent of human MKM. CONCLUSIONS:
		Argentina lacks extensive epidemiological and clinical data on MKM. This six-year
		study performed in Argentina is a first step leading to a better understanding of
		MKM epidemiology in our country.

TI	-	Tectonic corneal lamellar grafting for severe scleral melting after pterygium
		surgery.
PG	-	1126-36
AB	-	PURPOSE: To describe the technique and review the indications and success of
		tectonic corneal lamellar grafting for the management of severe scleral melts
		"after pterygium surgery. DESIGN: Retrospective, noncomparative, interventional"
		case series. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty cases of severe scleral necrosis after
		pterygium surgery (1993-1999). INTERVENTION: Tectonic corneal lamellar grafting.
		Surgery involved (1) removal of all devitalized or infected scleral tissue
		"surrounding the melt; (2) use of lamellar or full-thickness donor corneal tissue,"
		fashioned to fit the scleral defect exactly or a 0.25-mm diameter larger; and (3)
		placement of a pedicled or free conjunctival flap over the corneal lamellar
		"graft. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Eradication of progressive scleral necrosis,"
		"preservation of globe integrity, eradication of infection, and preoperative and"
		postoperative visual acuity. RESULTS: Sixteen (80%) of 20 cases developed severe
		scleral necrosis that required tectonic surgery after bare sclera pterygium
		excision with mitomycin C or beta-irradiation. Surgery was also therapeutic to
		eradicate progressive infection in 6 cases of infective scleritis that did not
		respond to maximal medical treatment. Scleral melting presented 1 month to 20
		"years after initial pterygium surgery in healthy, immune-competent adults."
		"Therapeutic and tectonic success was achieved in 19 cases (95%); in 1 case,"
		recurrence of fusarium fungal infection led to severe graft necrosis and
		"intraocular spread. Among the cases of infectious scleritis, three eyes required"
		repeat lamellar grafting to successfully eradicate infection. CONCLUSIONS:
		"Tectonic and therapeutic lamellar keratoplasty, combined with aggressive"
		"antibiotic therapy, preserved globe integrity and eradicated infection in cases"
		of severe scleral melting after pterygium surgery.

LID	-	10.1055/a-1268-9168 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: To report the clinical effect of oral voriconazole only as a
		treatment for fungal keratitis. HISTORY AND SIGNS: Three patients (1 female and 2
		"males) with culture-proven fungal keratitis (1 Mucoraceae, 1 Aspergillus, 1"
		Fusarium) were included in this study. The patients were treated with oral
		voriconazole 200 mg twice daily to observe the clinical response in the treatment
		of fungal keratitis. THERAPY AND OUTCOME: The mean age of the patients was
		51 years and the average treatment duration was 6 weeks. The corneal inflammation
		in these three patients was eliminated by oral voriconazole only. CONCLUSIONS:
		This is the first reported case of oral voriconazole only as a treatment for
		fungal keratitis. We found that oral voriconazole has a significant clinical
		effect on the treatment of fungal keratitis.

TI	-	Infections caused by filamentous fungi in patients with hematologic malignancies.
		A report of 391 cases by GIMEMA Infection Program.
PG	-	862-70
AB	-	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical characteristics of patients
		with hematologic malignancies developing a filamentous fungi infection (FFI) and
		to define the prognostic factors for their outcome. DESIGN AND METHODS: A
		"retrospective study, conducted on patients admitted to 14 Hematology divisions of"
		"tertiary care or university hospitals, participating in the GIMEMA Infection"
		"Program, over a ten-year period (1988-1997). The study included patients with"
		hematological malignancies and a histologically and/or microbiologically proven
		"or probable FFI. RESULTS: We included 391 patients (male/female: 262/129, median"
		"age 49 years) with hematologic malignancies (225 acute myeloid leukemia, 67 acute"
		"lymphocytic leukemia, 30 chronic myeloid leukemia, 22 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 12"
		"myelodysplastic syndrome, 10 aplastic anemia, 7 Hodgkin's disease, 8 chronic"
		"lymphocytic leukemia, 5 multiple myeloma, and 5 hairy cell leukemia) who"
		developed a proven FFI. Eighty percent of the patients had been neutropenic for
		"an average of 14 days before the infection, and 71% had an absolute neutrophil"
		count lower than 0.5 x 10(9)/L at the time of FFI diagnosis. The primary sites of
		"infection were: lungs (85%), nose and paranasal sinus (10%), and other sites"
		"(5%). The diagnosis was made while still alive in 310 patients (79%), and at"
		autopsy in the remaining 81 patients (21%). Chest X-ray was diagnostic in 77% of
		"patients with pulmonary FFI, while computed tomography (CT) scan of the thorax"
		was positive in 95% of cases. A significant diagnostic advantage for CT scan was
		observed in 145 patients who had both a chest X-ray and CT scan. Aspergillus was
		"identified as the cause of FFI in 296 patients, Mucorales in 45 patients,"
		"Fusarium in 6 patients and other filamentous fungi species in 4 patients, while"
		in a further 40 patients no agent was identifiable. The overall mortality rate
		"three months after the diagnosis of FFI was 74%, and fungal infection had been"
		the cause of death in 51% of patients. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our
		retrospective study shows that FFI still remains a life-threatening complication
		"in neutropenic patients. Despite appropriate treatment, half of the patients die"
		due to this complication. The use of glucocorticoids and recovery from
		neutropenia are the most important prognostic factors. Mucorales infections are
		associated with a significantly poorer prognosis than those due to Aspergillus
		spp.

TI	-	Contact lens-associated fusarium keratitis in Switzerland.
PG	-	418-21
LID	-	10.1055/s-2008-1027357 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Fusarium has been an exceptionally rare cause of infectious
		keratitis. A recent outbreak of Fusarium keratitis in contact lens wearers in
		North America and Asia has been associated with the multipurpose disinfection
		solution ReNu with MoistureLoc (Bausch&Lomb). We report a series of Fusarium
		keratitis in Swiss contact lens wearers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A multicentre
		retrospective case review of patients with corneal ulceration and a positive
		microbiological identification of Fusarium species was undertaken. RESULTS:
		"Between September 2005 and August 2007, six cases of Fusarium keratitis were"
		identified. Patients were 39 to 63 years of age. All patients were using
		disposable soft contact lenses for at least two years. Four patients used daily
		wear disposable lenses. Two patients were wearing 1-monthly disposable lenses and
		"used ReNu with MoistureLoc solution. Due to multiresistant Fusarium, enucleation"
		was required in two cases and an emergency keratoplasty was performed in three
		cases. An optical keratoplasty was undertaken in one case that developed corneal
		scarring. Final visual acuity in patients with preserved eyes ranged from light
		perception to 8 / 20. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to ReNu with MoistureLoc is not the
		"only risk factor for Fusarium keratitis. In addition to antifungal therapy, an"
		early keratoplasty with excision of the infected tissue seems mandatory to
		improve prognosis.

TI	-	Disseminated Fusarium infection originating from paronychia in a neutropenic
		patient: a case report and review of the literature.
PG	-	191-4
AB	-	"Fusarium is a saprophytic organism that is widely found distributed in soil,"
		"subterranean and aerial plants, plant debris, and other organic substrates. It"
		"can cause local tissue infections in immunocompetent patients, such as"
		"onychomycosis, bone and joint infections, or sinusitis. The incidence of"
		disseminated disease has notably increased since the initial cases of
		"disseminated Fusarium were described, particularly affecting immunocompromised"
		patients with hematologic malignancies. We report a 39-year-old man hospitalized
		with newly diagnosed acute myelocytic leukemia who developed disseminated
		Fusarium infection originating from toenail paronychia in the setting of
		neutropenia. Pathologic diagnosis of Fusarium is difficult because the septate
		"hyphae of Fusarium are difficult to distinguish from Aspergillus, which has a"
		more favorable outcome. Cultures of potential sources of infection as well as
		tissue cultures are essential in identifying the organism and initiating early
		aggressive therapy.

TI	-	Epidemiology and outcome of mould infections in hematopoietic stem cell
		transplant recipients.
PG	-	909-17
AB	-	Reports have focused on the emergence of moulds as pathogens in recipients of
		hematopoietic stem cell transplants. To review the incidence of and risks for
		"mould infections, we examined the records of 5589 patients who underwent"
		hematopoietic stem cell transplantation at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research
		"Center (Seattle) from 1985 through 1999. After 1992, the incidence of invasive"
		aspergillosis increased in allograft recipients and remained high through the
		"1990s. Infections with non-fumigatus Aspergillus species, Fusarium species, and"
		"Zygomycetes increased during the late 1990s, especially in patients who received"
		multiple transplants. Although infection caused by Scedosporium species was
		"common in patients who had neutropenia, infection caused by Zygomycetes typically"
		"occurred later after transplantation, when patients had graft-versus-host"
		disease. The overall 1-year survival rate was equally poor (similar20%) for all
		patients with mould infections. The results of the present study demonstrate the
		"changing epidemiology of mould infections, emphasizing the increasing importance"
		of amphotericin B--resistant organisms and the differences in risks and outcome
		of infection with different filamentous fungi.

		"a tree branch. At patient admittance, slit lamp biomicroscopy revealed an"
		"exuberant chemosis, an inferior corneal ulcer with an associated inflammatory"
		"infiltrate, a central corneal abscess, bullous keratopathy and posterior"
		synechiae. Corneal scrapes were obtained for identification of bacteria and
		"fungi, and the patient started antibiotic treatment on empirical basis. Few days"
		"later, the situation worsened with the development of hypopyon. By that time,"
		Fusarium was identified in cultures obtained from corneal scrapes and the patient
		started topical amphotericin B 0.15 %. Upon the morphological identification of
		"the Fusarium as a FDSC, and since there was no clinical improvement, the"
		treatment with amphotericin B was suspended and the patient started voriconazole
		"10 mg/ml, eye drops, hourly and voriconazole 200 mg iv, every 12 h for 1 month."
		"The hypopyon resolved and the inflammatory infiltrate improved, but the abscess"
		persisted at the last follow-up visit. The molecular identification revealed that
		the FDSC was a F. penzigii.

LID	-	10.3947/ic.2018.0717 [doi]
AB	-	"Fusarium species, which are commonly found in soil, water, and organic"
		"substrates, can cause serious infections especially in immunocompromised"
		"patients. Fusarium infection is notoriously difficult to treat, because of their"
		inherently high minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to most antifungal
		agents. There have been limited data on invasive fusariosis in Korea. We
		"identified 57 patients with culture-proven fusariosis at Samsung Medical Center,"
		"Seoul, Korea, from September 2003 through January 2017. Invasive fusariosis was"
		defined as any case with at least one positive blood culture or with concurrent
		involvement of 2 or more non-contiguous sites. Superficial infections such as
		keratitis and onychomycosis were excluded. We reported 14 cases of invasive
		fusariosis categorized according to the European Organization for Research and
		"Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group criteria, of which 6 cases were fusarium"
		"fungemia. Hematologic malignancies (7/14, 50%), solid organ transplantation"
		"(2/14, 14.2%), or immunosuppressive therapy (2/14, 14.2%), were the predominant"
		"underlying conditions. The overall mortality rate was 37%, however, that of"
		disseminated fusariosis was up to 83%. Antifungal treatment with voriconazole or
		"liposomal amphotericin B was commonly administered. In this report, we described"
		the clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of invasive fusariosis in
		"Korea. Given the high mortality in disseminated cases, invasive fusariosis is"
		becoming a therapeutic challenge to clinicians treating immunocompromised
		patients.

TI	-	Spectrum of fungal keratitis in north China.
PG	-	1943-8
AB	-	"PURPOSE: To report the epidemiological features, laboratory findings, and"
		treatment outcomes in patients with fungal keratitis in north China. DESIGN:
		Retrospective hospital-based study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 654 patients
		diagnosed with fungal keratitis at the Shandong Eye Institute from January 1999
		to December 2004. METHODS: The medical records of 654 inpatients (654 eyes) with
		"fungal keratitis were reviewed retrospectively for demographic features, risk"
		"factors, seasonal variation, clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, and"
		"treatment strategy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient history, ocular examination"
		"findings by slit-lamp biomicroscopy, laboratory findings from direct smear"
		"examination and fungal culture, and treatment protocol. RESULTS: Fungal keratitis"
		constituted 61.9% of cases of severe infective keratitis among the inpatients at
		the Shandong Eye Institute during the 6 years. Males (60.6%) were more likely to
		be affected by fungal keratitis than females (39.4%). Almost one third of the
		"patients (203) were middle aged (41-50 years old). Corneal trauma (51.4%),"
		"especially injury from plants (25.7% in all patients), was the most commonly"
		associated risk factor. The incidence of fungal keratitis was higher in harvest
		"seasons, including summer and autumn. An increasing tendency of incidence was"
		noted in more recent years. Direct microscopic examination of the corneal
		scraping samples stained with potassium hydroxide showed positivity in 88.7% of
		the eyes. The fungal isolates were of Fusarium species in 437 eyes (73.3%) and
		Aspergillus species in 72 eyes (12.1%). Surgical interventions were performed in
		"604 eyes (92.4%), including therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty in 399 eyes"
		(66.0%) and therapeutic lamellar keratoplasty (LK) in 177 eyes (29.3%). Globe
		integrity was preserved in 626 eyes (95.7%). CONCLUSIONS: With Fusarium species
		"being the most commonly isolated pathogens, fungal keratitis is the leading cause"
		of severe infective corneal ulcers in north China. Direct microscopic examination
		"with potassium hydroxide wet mounts proves to be a rapid, simple, inexpensive"
		diagnostic means. Corneal transplantation continues to be the most effective
		"approach for the treatment of severe fungal keratitis. Early surgery, especially"
		"LK, can be considered if aggressive topical therapy does not achieve early"
		disease control.

TI	-	Oral antifungal therapy for Fusarium-associated chronic rhinosinusitis.
PG	-	45-50
LID	-	10.1002/alr.20086 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Fusarium is commonly reported as an organism found in
		fungus-associated chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) yet it is known to be resistant to
		commonly used antifungal therapies. The goals of this work are to report the
		incidence of Fusarium-associated CRS in fungal cultures and to describe the
		treatment experience with oral antifungal agent aimed at this problem. METHODS:
		Patients with sinus cultures obtained from 2005 through 2008 were retrospectively
		identified and their medical records were evaluated. Cultures were obtained in
		patients with recalcitrant rhinosinusitis when purulent discharge was observed.
		Patient response to the therapy was measured upon the basis of self reported
		symptom improvements and endoscopic examination. RESULTS: In this 4-year period
		"2,570 outpatient fungal cultures were obtained and 194 (7.5%) were positive for"
		Fusarium. These 194 positive cultures appeared in 94 individuals. Thirty-four
		tested positive multiple times. Twenty-three (24.5%) had severe recalcitrant CRS
		poorly responsive to standard therapies warranting antifungal therapy aimed at
		"Fusarium. Fifteen individuals were treated with voriconazole, 5 with"
		"posaconazole, and 3 with both at separate times. Endoscopic evidence of initial"
		improvement on therapy was evident in 16 of 23 patients (69.6%). Of 18 patients
		"who could comment on their experience with the antifungal treatments, nearly 90%"
		of them reported substantial improvement with the therapy. Nine (9/23; 39.1%)
		were forced to discontinue oral antifungal therapy due to untoward effects.
		CONCLUSION: Fusarium appears in 7.55% of outpatient cultures of CRS. Of the
		"patients testing positive for Fusarium, 25% received oral antifungal therapy. A"
		positive response was seen in 16 of 23 (69.6%) while receiving other standard
		therapies. Since Fusarium is not routinely sensitive to commonly used antifungal
		"agents, it warrants special attention."

AB	-	Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients may suffer increased morbidity and mortality
		"through colonisation, allergy and invasive infection from fungi. The black yeast,"
		Exophiala dermatitidis (synonym Wangiella dermatitidis) has been found with
		"increasing frequency in sputum specimens of CF patients, with reported isolation"
		"rates ranging from 1.1 to 15.7%. At present, no diagnostic PCR exists to aid with"

		species-specific PCR-based assay was developed for the detection of E.
		"dermatitidis, based on employment of rDNA operons and interspacer (ITS) regions"
		"between these rDNA operons. Two novel primers, (designated ExdF & ExdR) were"
		designed in silico with the aid of computer-aided alignment software and with the
		"alignment of multiple species of Exophiala, as well as with other commonly"
		"described yeasts and filamentous fungi within CF sputum, including Candida,"
		"Aspergillus and Scedosporium. An amplicon of approximately 455 bp was generated,"
		spanning the partial ITS1 region - the complete 5.8S rDNA region - partial ITS2
		"region, employing ExdF (forward primer [16-mer], 5'-CCG CCT ATT CAG GTC C-3' and"
		"ExdR (reverse primer [16-mer], 5'-TCT CTC CCA CTC CCG C-3', was employed and"

		"gave an amplification product of the expected size, whilst none of the other"
		fungi were amplifiable. Subsequent employment of this primer pair detected this
		yeast from mycological cultures from 2/50 (4%) adult CF patients. These two
		patients were the only patients who were previously shown to have a cultural
		history of E. dermatitidis from their sputum. E. dermatitidis is a slow-growing
		"fungus, which usually takes up to two weeks to culture in the microbiology"
		"laboratory and therefore is slow to detect conventionally, with the risk of"
		bacterial overgrowth from common co-habiting pan- and multiresistant bacterial
		"pathogens from sputum, namely Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia"
		"complex organisms, hence this species-specific PCR assay may help detect this"
		"organism from CF sputum more specifically and rapidly. Overall, employment of"
		"this novel assay may help in the understanding of the occurrence, aetiology and"
		"epidemiology of E. dermatitidis, as an emerging fungal agent in patients with CF."

		consolidation therapy. Surgical debridement was undertaken and liposomal
		amphotericin was given as definitive therapy for a total of six weeks followed by

		"improvement. High clinical suspicion, prompt surgical intervention, rapid"
		"diagnosis, and timely initiation of appropriate antifungal therapy are crucial"
		for a favorable outcome in this relatively uncommon life-threatening infection.

LID	-	10.1016/j.jcpa.2019.10.002 [doi]
AB	-	Pulmonary mycosis secondary to enterocolitis is an uncommon diagnosis in equine
		"medicine, but is thought to result from mucosal compromise and translocation of"
		enteric fungi. The aetiological agent associated with translocation is often
		identified based on fungal culture or hyphal features in histological sections.
		"In order to understand better the aetiological agents involved, six horses"
		diagnosed with Salmonella enteritis and concurrent pulmonary mycosis were
		identified retrospectively through a database search of veterinary teaching
		hospital records. Samples from these cases were subjected to polymerase chain
		reaction and sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS-2) located
		between the 5.8S and 28S rRNA genes to identify the aetiological agent involved.
		"Sequencing identified Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus, Fusarium spp.,"
		Cladosporium spp. and Curvularia spp. A single case had a dual infection with
		Fusarium spp. and A. fumigatus.

PG	-	1905-10
LID	-	10.1167/iovs.09-3737 [doi]
AB	-	Purpose. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is increasingly important for the rapid
		"detection of fungal keratitis. However, techniques of specimen collection and DNA"
		extraction before PCR may interfere with test sensitivity. The purpose of this
		study was to investigate the use of DNA-stabilizing FTA filter paper (Indicating
		"FTA filter paper; Whatman International, Ltd., Maidstone, UK) for specimen"
		"collection without DNA extraction in a single-step, nonnested PCR for fungal"
		keratitis. Methods. Specimens were collected from ocular surfaces with FTA filter
		"discs, which automatically lyse collected cells and stabilize nucleic acids."
		Filter discs were directly used in single-step PCR reactions to detect fungal
		"DNA. Test sensitivity was evaluated with serial dilutions of Candida albicans,"
		"Fusarium oxysporum, and Aspergillus fumigatus cultures. Test specificity was"
		"analyzed by comparing 196 and 155 healthy individuals from Switzerland and Egypt,"
		"respectively, with 15 patients with a diagnosis of microbial keratitis. Results."
		"PCR with filter discs detected 3 C. albicans, 25 F. oxysporum, and 125 A."
		"fumigatus organisms. In healthy volunteers, fungal PCR was positive in 1.0% and"
		"8.4% of eyes from Switzerland and Egypt, respectively. Fungal PCR remained"
		"negative in 10 cases of culture-proven bacterial keratitis, became positive in 4"
		"cases of fungal keratitis, but missed 1 case of culture-proven A. fumigatus"
		keratitis. Conclusions. FTA filter paper for specimen collection together with
		direct PCR is a promising method of detecting fungal keratitis. The analytical
		"sensitivity is high without the need for a semi-nested or nested second PCR, the"
		"clinical specificity is 91.7% to 99.0%, and the method is rapid and inexpensive."

AB	-	Routine identification of fungal pathogens from positive blood cultures by
		"culture-based methods can be time-consuming, delaying treatment with appropriate"
		antifungal agents. The GenMark Dx ePlex investigational use only blood culture
		identification fungal pathogen panel (BCID-FP) rapidly detects 15 fungal targets
		simultaneously in blood culture samples positive for fungi by Gram staining. We
		aimed to determine the performance of the BCID-FP in a multicenter clinical
		study. Blood culture samples collected at 10 United States sites and tested with
		BCID-FP at 4 sites were compared to the standard-of-care microbiological and
		"biochemical techniques, fluorescence in situ hybridization using peptide nucleic"
		acid probes (PNA-FISH) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of
		flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Discrepant results were analyzed by
		bi-directional PCR/sequencing of residual blood culture samples. A total of 866
		"clinical samples, 120 retrospectively and 21 prospectively collected, along with"
		725 contrived samples were evaluated. Sensitivity and specificity of detection of
		"Candida species (C. albicans, C. auris, C. dubliniensis, C. famata, C. glabrata,"
		"C. guilliermondii, C. kefyr, C. krusei, C. lusitaniae, C. parapsilosis, and C."
		"tropicalis) ranged from 97.1 to 100% and 99.8 to 100%, respectively. For the"
		"other organism targets, sensitivity and specificity were as follows: 100% each"
		"for Cryptococcus neoformans and C. gattii, 98.6% and 100% for Fusarium spp., and"
		"96.2% and 99.9% for Rhodotorula spp., respectively. In 4 of the 141 clinical"
		"samples, the BCID-FP panel correctly identified an additional Candida species,"
		undetected by standard-of-care methods. The BCID-FP panel offers a faster
		turnaround time for identification of fungal pathogens in positive blood cultures
		"that may allow for earlier antifungal interventions and includes C. auris, a"
		highly multidrug-resistant fungus.

TI	-	Prevalence of fungal corneal ulcers in northern India.
PG	-	207-9
AB	-	Fungal corneal ulcer is common in India due to the tropical climate and a large
		"agrarian population that is at risk. Various factors such as trauma, the"
		injudicious use of topical antibiotics and corticosteroids are involved. Many of
		the age and sex-related risk factors also play a minor role. This 6-year study
		from Northern India revealed that fungi were detected in 61 (8.4%) out of 730
		patients investigated. Direct microscopy was positive in 51 (7%) and culture in
		53 (7.3%) patients. Aspergillus spp. were the most common causative agents
		"accounting for 25 (40.1%) of the isolates, followed by Fusarium sp. with ten"
		"(16.4%), Curvularia sp. with five (8.2%), Candida albicans with five (8.2%),"
		"Acremonium sp. with four (6.6%), Paecilomyces sp. with three (4.9%), Penicillium"
		"sp. with two (3.3%), Alternaria sp. with two (3.3%), Fonsecaea pedrosoi var."
		"cladosporium with two isolates (3.3%) and Pseudallescheria boydii, Drechslera sp."
		and Aureobasidium pullulans with one isolate (1.6%) each. The prevalence of
		fungal ulcers in males was three times higher than in females. The affected
		individuals had a rural background and were in the 51-60 year age group.

PG	-	125-9
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-015-9936-8 [doi]
AB	-	Neutropenic patients are at risk of the development of hyalohyphomycosis and
		mucormycosis. Correct identification is essential for the initiation of the
		"specific treatment, but concomitant mold infections are rarely reported. We"
		report one unprecedented case of concomitant mucormycosis and fusariosis in a
		neutropenic patient with acute myeloid leukemia. The patient developed
		rhino-orbital infection by Rhizopus arrhizus and disseminated infection by
		"Fusarium solani. The first culture from a sinus biopsy grew Rhizopus, which was"
		consistent with the histopathology report of mucormycosis. A second sinus biopsy
		collected later during the patient's clinical deterioration was reported as
		"hyalohyphomycosis, and the culture yielded F. solani. Due to the discordant"
		"reports, the second biopsy was reviewed and two hyphae types suggestive of both"
		hyalohyphomycetes and mucormycetes were found. The dual mold infection was
		confirmed by PCR assays from paraffinized tissue sections. Increased awareness of
		the existence of dual mold infections in at-risk patients is necessary. PCR
		methods in tissue sections may increase the diagnosis of dual mold infections. In
		"case of sequential biopsies showing discrepant results, mixed infections have to"
		be suspected.

TI	-	Ocular fungal isolates and antifungal susceptibility in northern China.
PG	-	131-133
AB	-	PURPOSE: To analyze the distribution characteristics of ocular fungal isolates
		and antifungal susceptibility in vitro. DESIGN: A retrospective case-series
		descriptive study. METHODS: Two thousand one hundred and seventy-nine specimens
		collected from Tongren Hospital during 2001 to 2004 were identified at the
		"Beijing Institute of Ophthalmology. Fungal culture-positive rate, antifungal"
		"susceptibility in vitro, and genus distribution of positive cultures were"
		"analyzed retrospectively. For the fungal culture-positive samples, the gender and"
		"age of the patients, the location of ocular involvement, and the season of the"
		onset of mycotic ocular diseases were studied. The fungal positive isolates were
		"subjected to antifungal susceptibility testing. RESULTS: Out of 2,179 specimens,"
		681 specimens were positive cultures. The culture-positive rate was 31.25%. Out
		"of 681 specimens of positive cultures, 591 specimens were from the cornea, 29"
		"from the aqueous humor, 22 from the conjunctiva, 22 from the vitreous body, one"
		"from the lacrimal sac, and 16 from the other sites. Fusarium species was the most"
		"common pathogen identified in 394 (57.86% of positive cultures), followed by"
		Aspergillus species in 116 (17.03% of positive cultures). Out of 681 positive
		"cultures, the sensitivity in vitro to natamycin, terbinafine, itraconazole, and"
		"fluconazole were 608/681 (89.28%), 467/681 (68.58%), 260/681 (38.18%), and"
		"101/681 (14.83%), respectively. Three hundred and sixty-eight (93.4%) of Fusarium"
		"species were sensitive to natamycin, 107 (92.2%) of Aspergillus species were"
		sensitive to itraconazole. CONCLUSIONS: Fusarium species was the predominant
		"pathogen, which resulted in mycotic ocular diseases in northern China, followed"
		"by Aspergillus species. Most of the Fusarium species were sensitive to natamycin,"
		and most of the Aspergillus species were sensitive to itraconazole.

AB	-	Invasive aspergillosis continues to be a significant cause of morbidity and
		mortality in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients. A reliable and early
		"diagnostic method is needed to improve survival. In this study, four methods"
		"direct microscopy, culture, nested PCR on internal transcribed spacer region, and"
		TaqMan real-time PCR targeted β-tubulin gene were examined for the detection of
		Aspergillus fumigatus and A. flavus in sixty-four bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)
		fluids that were obtained from SOT recipients. Direct examination with 20 % KOH
		(potassium hydroxide) and culture on mycological media were also performed. Of
		"the 64 samples, seven (10.9 %) were positive in direct examination (five with"
		"septate hyphae and two with aseptate hyphae), and 15 (23 %) had positive culture"
		"including five A. flavus, four A. niger, two Penicillium spp., two Rhizopus spp.,"
		one Fusarium spp. and one mixed A. flavus/A. niger. Twenty five (39 %) samples
		had positive nested PCR with A. flavus and 6 (9.4 %) with A. fumigatus-specific
		primers. Only eight (12.5 %) had positive real-time PCR for A. flavus and nine
		(14 %) for A. fumigatus. The incidence of aspergillosis in these patients
		"included proven invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) in two (3 %), probable IPA"
		"in 14 (22 %), possible IPA in 38 (59 %), and not IPA in 10 (16 %). A. flavus was"
		the most common cause of pulmonary aspergillosis (PA) in the study. The results
		suggest that because nested PCR is too sensitive it may increase the number of
		false-positive results and is not recommended for BAL samples for diagnosis of
		PA. Although further studies with significant number of proved positive/negative
		"standard BAL samples are necessary for better evaluation, the novel multiplex"
		real-time PCR developed in the study could be promising as a valid diagnostic
		method for IPA.

PG	-	151-3
AB	-	PURPOSE: To describe nine patients with fungal keratitis refractory to standard
		antifungal therapy whose condition was managed with voriconazole. DESIGN:
		Retrospective case series. METHODS: Chart review of patients with fungal
		keratitis who were treated with topical and oral voriconazole. RESULTS: Nine
		patients were treated. Two patients were contact lens wearers who used
		multipurpose cleaning solutions. Corneal isolates found were Fusarium (three
		"patients), Candida albicans (three patients), Alternaria (one patient),"
		"Scopulariopsis (one patient), and Scedosporium apiospermum (one patient). Nine"
		"patients were treated with topical voriconazole, and eight patients were treated"
		with oral voriconazole. Patients were treated topically for four to 16 weeks
		"(mean, 10 weeks) and orally for five to 17 weeks (mean, 10 weeks). One patient"
		was lost to follow-up. Two patients discontinued the topical voriconazole after
		"one day and four weeks, respectively, because of ocular burning. Of the seven"
		"patients who were treated with topical therapy and followed, five conditions"
		"healed. CONCLUSION: Voriconazole is a new, promising therapy for fungal keratitis"
		that is refractory to standard antifungal treatments.

AB	-	Opportunistic infections cause a significant morbidity and mortality in
		immunocompromised patients. We describe the case of a patient with skin
		fusariosis and a probable cerebral toxoplasmosis after UCB stem cell
		transplantation for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Fusarium species (spp)
		"infections are difficult to treat. To date, there has been no consensus on the"
		treatment of fusariosis and the management of its side effects. Given the
		"negative pretransplant Toxoplasma serology in this case, identifying the origin"
		of the Toxoplasma infection was challenging. All usual transmission routes were
		screened for and ruled out. The patient's positive outcome was not consistent
		with that of the literature reporting 60% mortality due to each infection.

TI	-	Treatment of fungal keratitis by penetrating keratoplasty.
PG	-	1070-4
AB	-	AIM: To study the use of penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) for the treatment of
		severe fungal keratitis that could not be cured by antifungal medication.
		METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 108 cases of severe fungal keratitis in
		which PKP was performed served as the basis for this study. Fungal keratitis was
		diagnosed by KOH staining of corneal scrapings or by confocal microscopic imaging
		of the cornea. All patients received a combination of topical and oral antifungal
		medicines without steroids as the first course of therapy. Patients whose corneal
		infection was not cured or in whom the infection progressed during antifungal
		"treatment were given a PKP. After surgery, the patients continued to receive"
		antifungal therapy with gradual tapering of the dose over a 1-2 month period.
		Cyclosporine was used to prevent graft rejection beginning 2 weeks after PKP.
		Topical steroid only was administered to the patient whose donor graft was over
		8.5 mm and with a heavy iris inflammation 2 weeks after PKP. The surgical
		specimens were used for microbiological evaluation and examined
		histopathologically. The patients were followed for 6-24 months after PKP. Graft
		"rejection, clarity of the graft, visual acuity, and surgical complications were"
		recorded. RESULTS: Corneal grafts in 86 eyes (79.6%) remained clear during follow
		up. There was no recurrence of fungal infection and the visual acuity ranged from
		40/200 to 20/20. Complications in some patients included recurrent fungal
		"infection in eight eyes (7.4%), corneal graft rejection in 32 eyes (29.6%),"
		"secondary glaucoma in two eyes (1.9%), and five eyes (4.6%) developed cataracts."
		98 of 108 of the recipient corneas had PAS positive fungal hyphae in tissue
		"sections; 97 of 108 were culture positive for various fungi, including Fusarium"
		"(63), Aspergillus (14), Candida (9), Penicillium (4), and seven cases in which"
		septate hyphae were seen but identification of the organism was not conclusive.
		CONCLUSIONS: PKP is an effective treatment for fungal keratitis that does not
		respond to antifungal medication. Early surgical intervention before the disease
		becomes advanced is recommended. It is critical that the surgical procedure
		remove the infected tissue in its entirety in order to effect a cure.

		1998-2009.
PG	-	331-7
LID	-	10.1016/j.jinf.2010.01.010 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Fusarium species cause severe infections in patients with hematologic
		malignancies. Few data are available concerning the outcome of fusariosis in the
		era of the expanding antifungal armamentarium. METHODS: We retrospectively
		identified patients with hematologic malignancy and positive cultures for
		Fusarium species at the MDACC (1998-2009). The diagnosis of proven or probable
		fusariosis was made according to modified EORTC/MSG criteria. RESULTS: Forty-four
		cases (75% proven) were identified over study period. Most (71%) patients had
		uncontrolled hematological malignancy and 21 patients (47%) received
		hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (85% allogeneic). Most patients (82%)
		were neutropenic at diagnosis (75% < 100/mm(3)). Patients had overlapping
		"clinical syndromes: sinus 27%, pulmonary 75%, skin 68%, fungemia 36% and"
		"disseminated infection 70%. Bacterial (54%), fungal (36%) and viral (27%)"
		co-infections were common. Most patients (84%) received combination therapy
		(typically a lipid formulation of amphotericin B and a triazole) with a mean
		duration of 28 days. Mortality at 12 weeks was 66%; 50% of deaths were
		attributable to Fusarium. Factors associated with increased likelihood of death
		"at 12 weeks, included albumin <3.5 mg/dL, fungemia, and ICU admission; neutrophil"
		recovery and fusariosis limited to skin were associated with improved survival (P
		< 0.05). Fungemia with Fusarium spp (OR 15.9; 1.1-231; P = 0.042) was the only
		risk factor independently associated with 12-week mortality with only 1/17 (6%)
		"of patients still alive at 12 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Fusariosis, although uncommon,"
		continues to have poor prognosis in neutropenic leukemic patients who present
		with fungemia.

		review.
PG	-	391-3
AB	-	A case of fungal sinusitis caused by Paecilomyces lilacinus that was unresponsive
		to amphotericin B and involved a patient with acute myeloid leukemia is
		described. Histologic examination of sinus tissue and periorbital bone
		"demonstrated invasion by a fungus with septate hyphae, which was identified in"
		culture as P. lilacinus. The isolate was resistant to amphotericin B but
		susceptible to itraconazole. The patient responded clinically when itraconazole
		was added to the treatment regimen. Invasive aspergilar infections are frequently
		"diagnosed by histology. Other fungi such as Fusarium, Pseudallescheria, and"
		Paecilomyces species also produce hyphae in tissue and can be confused with
		"Aspergillus species. However, these pathogens may be resistant to amphotericin B."
		Since alternative therapy is now available for infections with some of the
		"amphotericin B-resistant fungi, such as P. lilacinus, every effort should be made"
		to recover the fungal pathogen so that effective treatment can be administered.

TI	-	Severe corneoscleral infection. A complication of beta irradiation scleral
		necrosis following pterygium excision.
PG	-	947-51
AB	-	"OBJECTIVE: To assess the precipitating factors, clinical course, and treatment of"
		11 cases of severe intraocular infections of radionecrosis after pterygium
		excision in an attempt to minimize the devastating ocular sequelae. DESIGN AND
		SETTING: From the database of cases of radionecrosis at Royal Perth (Australia)
		"Hospital and Lions Eye Institute, Perth, we identified 11 cases of severe"
		intraocular infection complicating radionecrosis. We reviewed the case notes and
		the available radiotherapy records (n = 8). PATIENTS: Eleven patients admitted
		during an 8-year period. RESULTS: Mean (+/- SD) dose of radiotherapy was 22.7 +/-
		"1.0 Gy and mean latency period, 14.45 +/- 2.5 years. Among the six proven"
		"bacterial cases, Pseudomonas was identified in four, Staphylococcus aureus in"
		"one, and Streptococcus pneumoniae was involved in one bilateral case. Among the"
		"four fungal cases, Petriellidium boydii was indicated in two, and Fusarium and"
		Scedosporium inflatum in one each. The condition may remain undiagnosed for some
		"time and mimic a posterior scleritis, serous retinal detachment, or pseudotumor."
		INTERVENTIONS: Early débridement and culture; close microbiological assistance;
		and systemic antimicrobials for a prolonged period. Perforation or incipient
		perforation necessitated penetrating keratoplasties in seven patients and
		repeated keratoplasties in three. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The use of radiotherapy
		following pterygium excision should be limited and only low doses used. Ulcer
		beds and calcific plaques at sites of radionecrosis should not be directly
		covered without first performing adequate sterilization. Removal of plaques may
		precipitate sepsis; ulcer beds and plaques harbor infective agents. CONCLUSION:
		Severe radionecrosis may expose a patient to a lifelong risk of intraocular
		sepsis and profound visual morbidity. Conjunctival autografting is a safer method
		to reduce recurrence rate after pterygium excision.

		prophylaxis: a 4-year study.
PG	-	O952-9
LID	-	10.1111/1469-0691.12688 [doi]
AB	-	Posaconazole (PSC) is currently recommended as primary prophylaxis in neutropenic
		patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and in allogenic haematopoietic stem
		cell transplantation (AHSCT) recipients with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).
		Studies focusing on breakthrough invasive fungal disease (IFD) upon PSC
		prophylaxis show disparate results. In order to evaluate the incidence of IFD in
		"patients on PSC prophylaxis and identify IFD risk factors, we carried out a"
		retrospective study of all consecutive patients on PP from January 2007 to
		December 2010 in our hospital. Breakthrough IFDs were identified from the
		"database of the central pharmacy and the French administrative database (PMSI),"
		registering final medical diagnoses of hospitalized patients. Medical data were
		"reviewed to study proven or probable IFD, according to EORTC/MSG definition. PSC"
		plasma concentrations (PPC) were also retrieved. Poisson models were used for
		statistical analysis. Two hundred and seventy-nine patients received PSC
		prophylaxis for a median duration of 1.4 months (range 0.2-17.9). Proven (n=6) or
		probable (n=3) IFDs were diagnosed in nine cases (3.2%). IFD incidence rate per
		"100 person-month was 1.65 (95% CI, 0.79-2.97). IFDs were candidaemia (Candida"
		"glabrata, n=2), pulmonary invasive aspergillosis (n=3), disseminated fusariosis"
		"(n=2) and pulmonary mucormycosis (n=2). Seven deaths were reported, directly"
		related to IFD in three patients (33.3%). First dosage of PPC under 0.3 mg/L was
		"the single significant risk factor for IFD (RR, 7.77; 95% CI, 1.30-46.5; p"
		0.025). Breakthrough IFD in patients receiving PSC prophylaxis is rare but
		associated with a poor outcome. Low PSC plasma concentrations are associated with
		an increased risk of IFD.

TI	-	Fusarium peritonitis in a child on peritoneal dialysis: case report and review of
		the literature.
PG	-	52-7
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To review various aspects of the management of peritonitis due to
		"Fusarium, a soil mold which infrequently causes infections in humans. DATA"
		SOURCES: A case of Fusarium peritonitis in a child on chronic peritoneal dialysis
		(PD) is presented. The child developed Fusarium peritonitis 2 weeks after an
		"episode of bacterial peritonitis. His Tenckhoff catheter was removed, and he was"
		maintained on hemodialysis while receiving intravenous amphotericin. Following 2
		"weeks of treatment with amphotericin, he was successfully returned to PD. A"
		literature review of all previously reported cases of Fusarium peritonitis was
		then conducted to determine features common to infections caused by Fusarium.
		Emphasis was also placed on unique characteristics of the organism that may
		"affect patient management, as well as patient characteristics that may increase"
		the risk for infection by Fusarium. RESULTS: Fusarium may cause infection in
		"immunosuppressed individuals, such as cancer patients or patients on chronic PD."
		The organism has a propensity to attach to foreign bodies such as intravascular
		"and intraperitoneal catheters. Therefore, successful treatment of infections"
		caused by Fusarium may require catheter removal in addition to systemic
		antifungal therapy. CONCLUSIONS: This report presents the first known case of
		Fusarium peritonitis in a child. In view of the difficulties posed by this
		"unusual organism, optimal therapy of Fusarium peritonitis should consist of"
		immediate catheter removal and treatment with systemic antifungal drugs.

TI	-	Intradermal positivity after negative prick testing for inhalants.
PG	-	232-5
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: Examine the incidence of positive intradermal tests after a negative
		skin prick test for 24 inhalant antigens. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective
		study. Charts from patients who underwent modified quantitative testing (MQT)
		over a 3-year period were reviewed. Patients were initially tested with
		Multi-Test II. Subjects with negative wheals to a specific allergen were then
		tested with a 1:500 weight:volume intradermal injection of that allergen.
		RESULTS: One hundred thirty-three patients underwent MQT for 24 antigens.
		Allergens with the highest incidence of positive intradermal wheals after
		negative prick testing were Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and Dermatophagoides
		farinae at 26.67%. Allergens with elevated incidence of positive intradermals
		"included fusarium, cockroach, cocklebur, rough marsh elder, and ragweed, all with"
		incidences of 16% to 19%. CONCLUSION: Positive intradermal responses after
		negative prick testing occur commonly. Future study is needed to determine the
		generalizability and clinical significance of these findings. EBM RATING: C-4.

AB	-	"INTRODUCTION: There are more than 300,000 extractors using the babaçu coconut as"
		"a source of income in the States of Maranhão, Pará, Tocantins and Piauí, and this"
		activity is associated with fungal infections. The objective of this study was to
		"examine the occurrence of emergent fungi in the conjunctiva, nails and surface"
		"and subcutaneous injuries of female coconut breakers in Esperantinópolis,"
		"Maranhão. Additionally, soil samples and palm structures were collected. METHODS:"
		The obtained samples were cultured in Petri dishes containing
		potato-dextrose-agar and chloramphenicol. The etiological agent was confirmed by
		"a direct mycological exam and growth in culture. RESULTS: In total, 150 domiciles"
		"were visited, and samples were collected from 80 patients. From the ground, the"
		most frequently isolated fungus was Aspergillus niger (53. 8%). the most
		frequently detected fungus in babaçu coconut was Aspergillus niger (66.7%).
		Conjunctival fungal growth occurred in 76.3% of the women. The ocular fungal
		"microbiota consisted of filamentous fungi (80.6%), and yeasts were present in"
		19.4% of cases. Onychomycosis was diagnosed in 44% (11/25) of the women.
		"CONCLUSIONS: The identification of the genera Neosartorya, Rhizopus and"
		Curvularia in onychomycoses shows that emergent filamentous fungi can be
		"isolated. Aspergillus sp., Penicillium sp. and Scedosporium sp. were the"
		"predominant genera found in the babaçu coconut. From ocular conjunctiva, Candida"
		"spp. were the most prevalent species isolated, and Fusarium sp. was present only"
		in one woman. The nearly permanent exposure of coconut breakers to the external
		environment and to the soil is most likely the reason for the existence of a
		"mycotic flora and fungal infections, varying according to the individual's"
		practices and occupation.

PG	-	470-7
LID	-	10.1111/myc.12344 [doi]
AB	-	Invasive mould infection (IMI) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality
		"in immunocompromised patients. However, Swedish epidemiology data are lacking."
		The aim of this study was to investigate the epidemiology and outcome of IMI.
		"Cases of proven/probable IMI at Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, from"
		"2005 to 2009, were included. A total of 100 patients with 104 episodes of IMI"
		were enrolled. Identified isolates included 101 mould isolates. The majority of
		"the isolates were Aspergillus spp. (74.3%), followed by Mucorales spp. (13.9%),"
		"Fusarium spp. (4.9%) and other mould spp. (6.9%). In 13% of the episodes, more"
		than one mould caused the IMI. The lung was most often affected (88.5%). The most
		frequent underlying disease was haematological malignancies (70%). Following
		"diagnosis, 83.7% initially received antifungal monotherapy, 9.6% received"
		combination therapy and 6.7% no treatment. The overall 90-day and 1-year overall
		survival was 49% and 46% respectively. Survival at 90 days post diagnosis was
		"71.4% in the solid tumour cohort, 62.5% in patients with solid organ transplants,"
		43.5% in haematological malignancy (HMs) and 37% in those undergoing allogeneic
		haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Overall survival was poor in the
		"studied cohort, but is variable among different host categories, with particular"
		opportunities for improvement in patients with underlying HMs and allogeneic
		HSCT.

PG	-	62-5
AB	-	Described here is an unusual case of disseminated Cylindrocarpon lichenicola
		(Fusarium lichenicola) infection originating from a toenail lesion of a
		neutropenic woman with cellulitis of the foot and underlying acute leukaemia. A
		"computed tomography scan of the chest showed multiple, ill-defined, nodular"
		infiltrates with alveolar consolidation. The fungus was isolated from both the
		nail and the skin of the infected toe. Susceptibility testing revealed low
		minimum inhibitory concentrations for amphotericin B (0.78 micro g/ml) and
		voriconazole (1.56 micro g/ml) and high minimum inhibitory concentrations (>100
		"micro g/ml) for fluconazole, ketoconazole and itraconazole. The infection"
		resolved after treatment with a total dose of 1 g of amphotericin B followed by
		oral itraconazole and bone marrow regeneration.

AB	-	Fusarium species are the second leading cause of disseminated mold infections in
		immunocompromised patients. The high mortality caused by such infections is
		attributed to the high resistance of Fusarium species to current antifungal
		agents. We report the first case of disseminated fusariosis after the use of
		"alemtuzumab, an anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody, in a patient who presented with"
		striking cutaneous and oral cavity lesions. Case reports of combination
		antifungal therapy for disseminated fusariosis in immunocompromised patients were
		"reviewed. Among 19 published cases in the last 10 years plus this patient, the"
		patients in 14 cases (70%) responded positively to combination antifungal
		therapy. A clinical response was achieved in seven cases before resolution of
		neutropenia.

PG	-	81-86
AB	-	"Nowadays, free flap reconstruction in devastating lower limb trauma is a standard"
		procedure in reconstructive surgery. The greatest factor directly affecting limb
		"salvage is still the risk of infectious complications, whether local or systemic."
		Fungal wound infections are not among the most common infection complications in
		"surgery, but their low incidence is compensated for by their fulminant and"
		"serious course, as well as severe local tissue destruction and strong"
		angio-invasive potential together with the possibility of dissemination. In this
		"case study, we present an example of a devastating lower leg injury, solved using"
		"latissimus free flap reconstruction, with subsequent difficult and prolonged"
		"healing, due to an invasive filamentous fungi infection. In the final part of the"
		"article, we focus briefly on the occurrence of similar cases in the literature."

AB	-	Incidence of fungal sinusitis due to the genus Fusarium has increased during the
		last two decades. We report a case of fungus ball sinusitis with multiple sinuses
		involvement in an Iranian 21-year-old woman. The patient was diagnosed as having
		a fungus ball-type sinusitis in computed tomography scan. The sinus biopsy
		revealed fungal structures on histopathological and direct microscopic
		examinations and a Fusarium species arose in culture. Partial sequencing of the
		translation elongation factor 1-alpha identified the isolate as F. proliferatum.
		Removal of all lesions by endoscopic surgery resulted in a favorable outcome. To
		"the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of F. proliferatum-associated"
		fungus ball which involved multi-sinus and highlights the efficiency of molecular
		methods for discrimination of fungal agents involved.

		results in high mortality. We provide the first full case report on successful
		treatment of a disseminated Fusarium infection in an infant. The 6-month-old
		"infant, whose family raised livestock, had infantile leukemia. During the"
		"neutropenic period after intensive chemotherapy, vomiting, diarrhea, fever,"
		"subcutaneous nodes, and coughing appeared. Pneumonia was diagnosed, and Fusarium"
		moniliforme was isolated from blood culture. A central venous catheter was
		removed. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and amphotericin B
		"(AMPH-B) (total dose, 65 mg/kg) were administered continuously for 8 weeks. The"
		infection was resolved according to improvement of clinical and laboratory
		"findings, and intensive chemotherapy was restarted for the leukemia. Cord blood"
		stem cell transplantation from an unrelated donor was performed. The Fusarium
		"infection did not recur, but after transplantation, leukemia relapsed. Treatment"
		"of neutrophils using G-CSF, AMPH-B, and local treatment induced resolution of the"
		disseminated Fusarium infection in this immunocompromised host with malignancy.
		We suggest caution for patients living in an environment conducive to the
		development of Fusarium infection because of the particular risk of infection.

TI	-	Serum Inflammatory Cytokine Markers of Invasive Fungal Infection in Previously
		Immunocompetent Battle Casualties.
PG	-	526-32
LID	-	10.1089/sur.2013.124 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive fungal infection (IFI) is described increasingly in
		individuals experiencing high-energy military trauma. Hallmarks of successful
		treatment involve aggressive surgical debridement and early initiation of
		"systemic antimicrobial therapy. Currently, intravenous anti-fungal therapy"
		commences based on appearance of wounds and patient's clinical course. Whereas
		some clinical protocols exist to predict which critically injured patients should
		"receive anti-fungal therapies, there are no established serum markers associated"
		with IFI. Our hypothesis is that serum inflammatory cytokines exist that can
		assist in identifying individuals at risk for IFI. METHODS: This is a
		retrospective case control study at a single institution. Nine patients with IFI
		"(Saksenaea vasiformis, Fusarium sp., Graphium sp., Scedosporium sp., Aspergillus"
		"sp., Mucor sp., and Alternaria sp.) after battlefield trauma were matched to nine"
		individuals with similar injury patterns whose laboratory results were negative
		for IFI. The combination of serum inflammatory cytokines from the first and
		second debridements was examined with multiplex platform proteomic analysis. We
		defined statistical significance as a two-tailed α<0.05 after adjusting for
		multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate method. This model was
		refined further with correlation-based filter selection and the area under the
		curve of the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) was tested. RESULTS: Both
		groups had similar Injury Severity Scores (ISS) (mean±standard deviation [SD])
		"(26.8±15.5 vs. 29.2±16.8, p=0.766). Elevated RANTES (regulated on activation,"
		"normal T cell expressed and secreted) alone (10,492.8±4,450.1 vs."
		"5,333.3±4,162.2, p=0.006) correlated with IFI. Also, the combination of"
		"persistent elevations in RANTES, interleukin (IL)-2R, and IL-15 was a robust"
		model for predicting IFI with the AUROC being 0.9. CONCLUSIONS: Elevation in
		"serum cytokines, particularly RANTES, correlated with IFI in this small group of"
		patients. This demonstrates the potential of future rapid serum testing for early
		initiation and guidance of anti-fungal therapies.

PG	-	51-3
AB	-	A 67-year-old female presented with a 20-year-old lesion involving the right ear
		and preauricular area mimicking tuberculous lupus. Fusarium oxysporum infection
		was confirmed by biopsy studies and cultures. The biopsy specimen showed an
		unusually extensive dermal invasion with fungal hyphae. This is an uncommon
		clinical presentation for Fusarium infection in a healthy patient. When referred
		"to us, the patient had received antifungal therapy with itraconazole without any"
		benefit. Improvement was obtained with fluconazole therapy. The spectrum of
		"cutaneous involvement related to Fusarium spp. includes toxic reactions,"
		"colonization, superficial indolent infection, deep cutaneous or subcutaneous"
		infections and disseminated infection.

		Brazil.
PG	-	498-503
AB	-	"PURPOSE: To study risk factors, microbiological characteristics, and clinical"
		course of nonviral infectious keratitis diagnosed in a referral service of
		ophthalmology. METHODS: A total of 65 charts of patients with microbial keratitis
		were retrospectively reviewed at the Clinical Hospital of Federal University of
		"Uberlandia, Brazil, from July 2001 through August 2004. All cases were submitted"
		"to microbiological tests and treated according to local protocol. Risk factors,"
		"clinical course, therapeutic keratoplasty, and visual outcomes were analyzed."
		RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 45.9 years (2-83 years) and male to female
		ratio 2.6:1. Symptoms at presentation ranged from 1-3 days in 16 patients out of
		"65 (24.61%), 4-7 days in 19 cases (19/65; 29.23%), and more than 7 days in 27"
		"patients (27/65; 41.53%). The major risk factor was trauma (28/65; 40%),"
		predominantly by organic material. A total of 32 eyes out of 65 (49.23%) were
		"culture positive. Fungi were the most common isolates (18/32; 56.25%), being"
		"headed by Fusarium sp. (11/65; 16.92%), and the most common bacteria was"
		Streptococcus pneumoniae (7/65; 10.77%). Final visual acuity was equal to or
		"better than 20/60 in 20 patients out of 65 (30.77%), between 20/60 and 20/400 in"
		"7 patients (7/65; 10.77%), and worse than 20/400 in 35 patients out of 65"
		"(53.85%). A total of 48 eyes out of 65 (73.84%) presented corneal scar, 12 eyes"
		"(12/65; 18.46%) needed therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty, and 2 eyes (2/65;"
		3.08%) were eviscerated. CONCLUSIONS: The high incidence of fungal keratitis in
		"the studied population shows their vulnerability to such infections, which may"
		result in devastating visual outcomes.

AB	-	"Fusarium spp. are pathogens plants, animals and humans, isolated from soil,"
		plants and water systems. They are distributed worldwide and include
		"saprotrophic, biotrophic‑pathogenic or endophytic fungi, or producers of"

PG	-	1205-9
AB	-	PURPOSE: To report the clinical features and management outcomes of a cluster of
		Fusarium keratitis in patients that used the Bausch & Lomb ReNu MostureLoc
		contact lens solution. METHODS: Retrospective case series. RESULTS: In a 1-year
		"period starting from June 2005, we treated 12 patients with unilateral Fusarium"
		keratitis in our tertiary care center. All patients were contact lens users that
		used ReNu MostureLoc contact lens solution and had no other specific predisposing
		conditions. Microbiological examination yielded growth of Fusarium spp. in 7
		patients from corneal scrapings at presentation and from 3 patients in subsequent
		"corneal specimens. For 2 other patients, fungi were not detected from corneal"
		"scrapings, but Fusarium spp. were isolated from their contact lenses. The"
		infections were treated with topical natamycin and amphotericin B eye drops and
		with systemic itraconazole in 8 patients. The infection resolved with medical
		"treatment in 8 eyes, a conjunctival flap in 1 eye, and a therapeutic corneal"
		graft in 1 eye. Two eyes required tectonic corneal grafts for perforation. Two of
		the 3 corneal grafts failed because of graft rejection. Final visual acuities
		ranged from count fingers to 1.0. CONCLUSIONS: This cluster of Fusarium keratitis
		seems to be related to the use of the ReNu MoistureLoc contact lens solution. The
		"cure rate with medical therapy was 66%. However, corneal scarring limited visual"
		recovery. This episode highlights the need for clinical vigilance when dealing
		with corneal infiltrates in contact lens users.

		rhinitis patients.
PG	-	194-200
AB	-	Allergic rhinitis is the single most common chronic allergic disease affecting an
		"estimated four million people in Malaysia. House dust mites, grass pollens and"
		fungal spores play has been identified to play a major role in the pathogenesis
		"of allergic rhinitis. However, sensitization to pollen and spores in Malaysia is"
		not well documented. On the basis of the results of an aerobiological survey of
		"the common mold spores and pollens in the Klang Valley, twelve local extracts of"
		molds and two local extracts of grass pollens were prepared by the Institute for
		Medical Research for this study. The study evaluated the prevalence of skin prick
		test (SPT) reactivity to the extracts of those airborne molds and pollens in
		allergic rhinitis patients in the Klang Valley. A total of 85 allergic rhinitis
		"patients were recruited. All molds and grass pollens extracts tested, elicited"
		"positive response to SPT. Among the molds extracts, Fusarium was observed to have"
		"the highest prevalence of SPT reactivity (23.5%), followed by Aspergillus flavum"
		"(21.2%), Dreselera orysae (18.8%), Alternaria sp (17.6%), Curvularis eragrostidis"
		"(17.6%), Penicillium oxa (16.5%), Pestolotriopsis gtuepini (16.5%), Rhizopphus"
		"arrhi (16.5%), Aspergilluls nigus (15.3%). Penicillium choy (12.9%), Aspergillus"
		"fumigatus (11.8%), and Cladosporium sp (4.7%). In the grass pollen, the SPT"
		"reactivity to Ischaemum and Enilia is 14.1% and 5.9% respectively. However, the"
		"prevalence of SPT reactivity was not influenced by the age, sex, ethnicity,"
		symptomatology and concurrent allergic condition. We have documented the
		prevalence of skin prick test reactivity to common molds and grass pollens in the
		"Klang valley, which is comparable to the neighboring countries. Its prevalence in"
		our allergic rhinitis patients suggests that it has a role in pathogenesis of
		allergic diseases. A larger representative sample involving multi-centric centers
		in Malaysia should be encouraged in the near future.

PG	-	843-850
AB	-	"To assess the prevalence of fungal keratitis, we conducted a retrospective study"
		over 7 years (2005 through 2011) at a tertiary care center in North India. Effort
		"has been made to analyze the disease burden, spectrum of agents and treatment"
		history. The findings were compared with an earlier study at the same center for
		any change in the epidemiology of the disease. Microbiology records were screened
		"at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh,"
		"India, to identify fungal keratitis cases, and available clinical records of"
		"those cases were analyzed. Of 2459 clinically suspected fungal keratitis cases,"
		765 (31 %) cases were direct microscopy confirmed. Of these microscopy-confirmed
		"cases, fungi were isolated in 393 (51.4 %), with Aspergillus spp. ranked top"
		"(n = 187, 47.6 %), followed by melanized fungi (n = 86, 21.9 %) and Fusarium spp."
		"(n = 64, 16 %). A male predominance of 78.7 % was noted with a peak in the"
		incidence of fungal keratitis during post-monsoon season (September to November).
		A delay in diagnosis was significantly associated (p < 0.001) with keratitis
		"cases due to melanized fungi. In comparison with an earlier study, higher"
		isolation of melanized fungi was noted with a widening of the spectrum of agents
		"identified. Thus, fungal keratitis due to Aspergillus spp. remains a serious"
		ocular illness among the active male population in North India with relative rise
		of keratitis due to melanized fungi. The spectrum of agents causing fungal
		keratitis has broadened with many rare fungi that are implicated.

PG	-	128-132
AB	-	"PURPOSE: Invasive mycosis caused by the Aspergillus, Fusarium, and Mucor can be"
		"fetal, especially in the immunocompromised patients with central nervous system"
		"(CNS) involvement. Here we present a case of CNS Fusarium infection, and this is"
		the first reported case of Fusarium brain abscess in Taiwan. CASE REPORT: A
		65-year-old woman presented with fever and conscious disturbance for 3 days.
		"Neurological examination showed stupor consciousness, neck stiffness, multiple"
		"cranial nerves palsy, and bilateral Babinski signs. Magnetic resonance imaging"
		"showed multifocal lesions involving medulla oblongata, pons, bilateral cerebral"
		"peduncles, and bilateral cerebellar peduncles. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) study"
		"revealed neutrophil predominant pleocytosis, but both blood and CSF culture were"
		negative. We treated patient with ceftriaxone and vancomycin initially as empiric
		"therapy for suspected bacterial meningoencephalitis. However, chronic sinusitis"
		with fungal ball and brain abscess were later found. Despite antifungal treatment
		"and surgical intervention, patient expired 3 months after admission. Fungal"
		culture of the brain abscess disclosed Fusarium species 2 weeks after her death.
		CONCLUSION: CNS Fusarium infection should be considered when an immunocompromised
		"patient presenting with fever, conscious change, cranial nerve palsies, and"
		"angioinvasion suggested by brain imaging. To properly manage the disease, early"
		effective antifungal therapy and neurosurgical intervention are important.

		standard onychomycosis treatments with oral terbinafine and itraconazole.
		"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the use of terbinafine and itraconazole, which are"
		"highly effective in fighting Trichophyton onychomycoses, could be a cause of the"
		high incidence of Fusarium nail infections. METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction
		methods were used to detect both Fusarium spp. and Trichophyton spp. in nails of
		patients who had either received treatment previously or not. RESULTS: No
		significant microbiological differences were found between treated and untreated
		"patients. In 24 of 79 cases (30%), Fusarium spp. was detected in samples of"
		patients having had no previous antifungal therapy and when Trichophyton spp.
		grew in culture. CONCLUSION: Oral terbinafine and itraconazole treatments do not
		appear to favor the establishment of Fusarium spp. in onychomycosis.

AB	-	"PURPOSE: To study the demographic details, risk factors, microbiological profile,"
		and clinical outcomes of pediatric infectious keratitis cases in North India.
		METHODS: This retrospective case series included review of medical records of
		pediatric patients (0-16 years) diagnosed with infectious keratitis in a tertiary
		care center of North India during December 2011 to January 2017 was done.
		"Demographic details, predisposing factors, microbiological investigations, and"
		"clinical outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: In this time period, 104 eyes of 104"
		children had a diagnosis of infectious keratitis. Culture was obtained for all
		104 eyes and was positive in eighty eight eyes (84.2%). The most common causative
		"factor was trauma, seen in 77 eyes (74%). Bacteria was the most common agent"
		isolated in culture (54.2%) followed by fungi (40.8%) and acanthamoeba (2.1%).
		Successful healing of the keratitis with appropriate medical treatment occurred
		"in 84 (80.7%) eyes, while 13 (12.5%) eyes required therapeutic keratoplasty. Of"
		"the 80 eyes with documentation of both preliminary and final visual acuity,"
		"improvement of two lines was seen in 35 eyes (43.7%), stayed the same in and"
		worsened in 17 eyes (21%). Mean time to resolution of infection on medical
		"treatment for bacteria was 23.65 ± 4.78 days, fungi 32 ± 5.19 days, and"
		acanthamoeba 53.67 ± 4.78 days. CONCLUSION: Gram positive organism is the most
		common etiological agent of keratitis in children in our study population which
		is in contrast to pediatric infective keratitis study conducted by Aruljyothi et
		"al. in South India (2011--2013). Though less in number than bacterial keratitis,"
		fungus also remains an important causative agent. Along with early diagnosis and
		"immediate medical intervention, it is important to identify regional profile of"
		organisms and risk factors for good visual and anatomical outcome.

		(74.3%) eyes. Fungi was the most common infectious agent isolated in culture
		(54.2%) followed by bacteria (40.8%) and acanthamoeba (2.1%). Successful healing
		"of the keratitis with appropriate medical therapy occurred in 223 (92.9%) eyes,"
		while 17 (7.1%) eyes required therapeutic keratoplasty. Of the 151 patients with
		"preliminary and final visual acuity, vision improved by 2 lines in 68 eyes (45%),"
		stayed the same in 75 eyes (49.6%) and worsened in 8 eyes (5.3%). CONCLUSIONS:
		"Contrary to previous reports, fungi are the most common aetiological organism in"
		the causation of infectious keratitis in children in our study population.
		Fusarium was the most common fungal species isolated. These data are similar to
		the data obtained from adult patients with infectious keratitis in this region.
		While microbiological investigations are important to initiate appropriate
		"antimicrobial therapy, the findings from our study need to be kept in mind,"
		especially while initiating empirical therapy in this population.

AB	-	Fusariosis is a critical infectious complication that can develop in
		"immunocompromised hosts, mainly under conditions of prolonged neutropenia, and is"
		often disseminated and associated with a high mortality rate. Disseminated
		fusariosis developing during the course of hematopoietic stem cell
		"transplantation (HSCT) is a critical condition, and there have been few reports"
		"of successful treatment of cases complicated with fusariosis before HSCT. Here,"
		we present a case of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with the development of fungal
		endophthalmitis during chemotherapy. Vitrectomy was performed and Fusarium solani
		infection was confirmed by vitreal culture. The infection was also disseminated
		"to the lung, triceps, and spleen. The splenic lesions disappeared with the"
		"administration of antifungal agents, and residual lesions in the lung and triceps"
		"were surgically resected. After two courses of consolidation chemotherapy, the"
		patient received cord blood transplantation (CBT) twice because of graft failure
		in the first transplantation. Antifungal agents were administered continuously
		during chemotherapy and transplantation. Although Fusarium sinusitis developed
		"after neutrophil engraftment, it was well controlled by surgical resection."
		"Thereafter, the patient has been well without recurrence of fusariosis for more"
		than 2 years since transplantation. A combination of continuous administration of
		antifungal agents and vigorous surgical intervention may be important for
		management of disseminated fusariosis in the setting of HSCT.

AB	-	PURPOSE: To report clinical outcomes of rose bengal photodynamic antimicrobial
		"therapy (RB-PDAT) as an adjunct treatment for severe, progressive infectious"
		keratitis. DESIGN: Consecutive interventional case series. METHODS: Patients with
		progressive infectious keratitis unresponsive to standard medical therapy
		underwent RB-PDAT at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute from January 2016 through
		March 2018. RB-PDAT was performed by applying a solution of rose bengal (0.1% or
		0.2% RB in balanced salt solution) to the de-epithelialized cornea for
		"30 minutes, followed by irradiation with a 6 mW/cm(2) custom-made green LED"
		source for 15 minutes (5.4 J/cm(2)). RESULTS: The current study included 18
		patients (7 male and 11 female) ranging from 17 to 83 years old. Acanthamoeba was
		"the most frequent microbe (10/17; 59%), followed by Fusarium spp. (4/17; 24%),"
		"Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2/17; 12%), and Curvularia spp. (1/17; 6%); 1 patient had"
		no confirmed microbiologic diagnosis. Main clinical risk factor for keratitis
		included contact lens wear (79%). The average area of epithelial defect prior to
		first RB-PDAT was 32 ± 27 mm(2) and average stromal depth hyperreflectivity
		measured with anterior segment optical coherence tomography was 269 ± 75 μm.
		Successful RB-PDAT (avoidance of therapeutic keratoplasty) was achieved in 72% of
		"the cases, with an average time to clinical resolution (decreased pain and"
		inflammation with re-epithelialization and infiltrate resolution) of 46.9 ±
		26.4 days after RB-PDAT. Time of follow-up after RB-PDAT was 13.3 ± 5.7 months.
		"CONCLUSION: RB-PDAT can be considered as an adjunct therapy for cases of severe,"
		progressive infectious keratitis before performing a therapeutic keratoplasty.

PG	-	92-5

AB	-	CASE HISTORY: A sub-adult female olive ridley sea turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea)
		"was found floating off the coast of Gran Canaria, Canary Islands, Spain. CLINICAL"
		"AND PATHOLOGICAL FINDINGS: The turtle was lethargic and weak, and died one day"
		after it was found. Necropsy was performed and selected samples of lung and liver
		were routinely processed for histopathological and immunohistological studies.
		"Grossly, round, ulcerative lesions were observed on the rear flippers. The liver,"
		"spleen, coelomic wall, gastric serosa, lungs and urinary bladder were covered by"
		"various amounts of fibrin and small granulomas. Histopathologically, a severe"
		"fibrinous and granulomatous polyserositis (liver, spleen, stomach, urinary"
		"bladder, coelomic wall), severe fibrinous pleuritis and severe multifocal"
		granulomatous pneumonia were diagnosed. Numerous fungal hyphae were observed
		associated with the lesions. Specific monoclonal and heterologously absorbed
		polyclonal antibodies served as the primary reagents for identification of
		"aspergillosis, candidiasis, fusariosis, geotricosis, dermatophytosis,"
		"scedosporiosis, and zygomycosis. All hyphae were identified as Trichophyton spp.,"
		because a strong and uniform reactivity was obtained only with an heterologously
		absorbed polyclonal antibody raised against somatic antigens of Trichophyton spp.
		DIAGNOSIS: Systemic mycosis caused by Trichophyton spp. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: There
		are no known previous reports of Trichophyton spp. causing skin disease or
		systemic mycotic infection in sea turtles. The usefulness of immunohistochemistry
		for identifying fungi in sea turtles is reinforced.

TI	-	Soft-tissue fungal infections: surgical management of 12 immunocompromised
		patients.
PG	-	1391-9
AB	-	Isolated fungal soft-tissue infections are uncommon but may cause severe
		morbidity or mortality among transplant recipients and other immunosuppressed
		patients. Twelve immunocompromised patients illustrating three patterns of
		infection were treated recently at the Duke University Medical Center. These
		"groups comprised (I) locally aggressive infections, (II) indolent infections, and"
		(III) cutaneous manifestations of systemic infection. Patient diagnoses included
		"organ transplant, leukemia, prematurity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"
		and rheumatoid arthritis. Time from immunosuppression to biopsy ranged from 5.5
		"to 31 weeks. Organisms included Aspergillus, Rhizopus, Fusarium, Paecilomyces,"
		"Exophiala, and Curvularia. Patients presented with necrotic ulcerations or"
		nodules. Surgical treatment ranged from radical debridement to excisional biopsy
		to none. Antifungal chemotherapy also was employed in some cases. The mortality
		"rate was 33 percent, two patients dying without evidence of fungal infection. Six"
		of the eight survivors cleared their infections. Necrotic skin lesions with
		"surrounding erythema in this population call for prompt examination, biopsy, and"
		culture. Group I lesions mandate radical excision with rapid intraoperative
		microscopic control and systemic antifungal medication. Group II requires
		surgical control with or without antifungal therapy. Group III requires systemic
		"antifungal therapy for metastatic infection. In our opinion, treatment of fungal"
		soft-tissue infection should be tailored to infection type and requires a team
		approach of surgeon and expert infectious disease consultation.

		"whereas for better visualization of fruiting structures, the microculture"
		"technique was performed on slides. To evaluate the susceptibility profile, the"
		broth microdilution test recommended by CLSI was performed. Thirty-five isolates
		"were identified: Aspergillus flavus (12), Aspergillus fumigatus (11), Aspergillus"
		"niger (1), Aspergillus terreus (2), Penicillium spp. (7), and Fusarium spp. (2)"
		in the hospitals evaluated. All isolates had a minimum inhibitory concentration
		(MIC) more than 128 μg/ml for fluconazole; 0.5 to 4.0 μg/ml for amphotericin B
		"(hospital 1), and all isolates from haospital 2 had MIC ≥2.0 μg/ml. In hospital"
		"1, MIC for posaconazole ranged from 0.25 μg/ml to ≥32 μg/ml, and hospital 2"
		ranged from 0.5 to 1.0 μg/ml. The monitoring and evaluation of air quality and
		surfaces are essential measures for prevention and control of hospital
		"infections, as these microorganisms are becoming increasingly resistant to"
		"antimicrobial agents, thus making treatment difficult, especially in"
		immunocompromised individuals.

AB	-	PURPOSE: To report the use of anterior segment optical coherence tomography for
		characterization of late-onset tunnel fungal infections with endophthalmitis
		after cataract surgery. METHODS: Case reports. RESULTS: A 77-year-old female
		(case 1) and a 76-year-old male (case 2) who received cataract surgery 15 and 1
		"year before their initial visits, respectively, were treated with topical"
		"steroids based on a diagnosis of uveitis, because they showed growing white"
		lesions on the upper iris and beneath the cataract scleral wound. Irrigation of
		the anterior chambers and removal of the white lesions were performed in each
		"case, and microbiological tests were positive for fungi (case 1, a positive"
		"culture of Fusarium sp.; case 2, a filamentous fungus present in a direct smear)"
		in the white lesions. Both cases were diagnosed as late-onset fungal
		endophthalmitis after cataract surgery and were treated with topical and systemic
		"antifungal agents. However, the white lesions reappeared, and the inflammation in"
		the anterior chambers worsened. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography
		showed the spread of the white lesions into the scleral incisions from cataract
		surgery. Deroofing of the tunnel and sclerocorneal patch grafts were performed in
		"both cases to treat the fungal tunnel infections. After these treatments,"
		inflammation of both corneas and anterior chambers subsided. CONCLUSIONS:
		Anterior segment optical coherence tomography can be used to identify late-onset
		fungal tunnel infections with endophthalmitis after cataract surgery.

		fungal diseases in patients with haematologic disorders.
PG	-	331-9
LID	-	10.1111/ejh.12078 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: Invasive fungal diseases (IFDs) are life-threatening events in
		"patients with haematologic disorders, and the spectrum of the aetiological"
		pathogens continues to expand. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical utility
		of a panfungal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the management of IFDs
		in such patients. METHODS: We prospectively analysed 273 consecutive blood
		samples from 64 risk episodes in 51 patients with haematologic disorders at high
		risk for IFD who were treated at our hospital between April 2007 and October
		2010. RESULTS: PCR-positive results were obtained in 18 of 64 risk episodes
		"(35.3%). IFD was documented in 14 episodes (21.9%, 9 probable IFDs and 5 possible"
		IFDs) according to the revised criteria of the European Organization for Research
		and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group. PCR was positive in all of these 14
		"episodes, and in 4 of the 50 episodes with no IFD category. Sensitivity,"
		"specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of our"
		"assay were 100%, 92%, 78% and 100% respectively. A considerable number of fungi"
		(44.4%) that are less common than Aspergillus and Candida species were positive
		"by PCR. Molecular diagnoses of Cunninghamella species, Aspergillus ustus,"
		"Fusarium species, Scedosporium apiospermum, Rhodotorula species and Rhizopus"
		species were beneficial in selecting suitable treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Our
		panfungal PCR approach allows for the highly sensitive and specific detection and
		"identification of a wide spectrum of fungal pathogens, which provides"
		"indispensable information for managing IFDs, especially refractory or"
		breakthrough IFDs during antifungal therapy in high-risk patients with
		haematologic disorders.

TI	-	Stem cell transplantation post invasive fungal infection is a feasible task.
PG	-	11-Jun
AB	-	"Between March 1997 and January 2002, 18 consecutive patients (18-47 years) with"
		hematological malignancies and previous proven invasive fungal infection
		"underwent stem cell transplantation (SCT) (10 matched sibling allograft, 6"
		"autograft, and 2 haploidentical). All patients had full myeloablative"
		"conditioning. The fungal pathogens diagnosed were Aspergillus (14), Fusarium (2),"
		"Mucor (1), Exserohilum (1), and Candida (1), involving the lungs (15), sinuses"
		"(5), and liver (1). All patients were treated pre- and during transplant with"
		systemic antifungal therapy. Eleven out of 18 (61%) patients survived the
		transplant. Only 1 of 5 patients who transplanted with an active fungal infection
		"accompanied with active leukemia survived the transplant, compared with 10/13"
		(84%) survivals in patients who had no clinical and radiological signs of
		infection or active leukemia (P < 0.025). None of the autografted patients has
		"died, compared with 7/12 allografted patients, of whom 5 underwent transplant"
		with active hematological/active fungal disease. In only 3 patients was the cause
		of death reactivation of previous fungal infection. Both active fungal infection
		and active leukemia place patients at a very high risk for procedure-related
		"mortality. Pre-transplant therapy of fungal infection, aiming to achieve a"
		"clinically undetectable state of infection, followed by an antifungal treatment"
		during transplant may allow the SCT with no fungal reactivation in selected
		patients.

AB	-	Fusarium is a filamentous fungus commonly found in the environment and is the
		major cause of fungal keratitis. We report a case of keratomycosis caused by
		Fusarium solani in a patient using disposable soft contact lenses. A delay in
		diagnosis led to the initiation of an empirical antifungal treatment with the
		subsequent deterioration of the patient's clinical condition. The use of the
		real-time quantitative PCR assay confirmed keratitis from F. solani providing a
		result in <48 h and therefore giving the possibility of quickly starting targeted
		antifungal therapy. The patient had an improvement in eye condition after the
		diagnosis of keratitis by F. solani and the rapid change to targeted antifungal
		"treatment. For the rapid identification of corneal fungal pathogens, we believe"
		that PCR may be added for the diagnosis of mycotic keratitis pending the
		isolation in culture that is necessary for in vitro susceptibility testing.

TI	-	An outbreak of early-onset endophthalmitis caused by Fusarium species following
		cataract surgery.
PG	-	988-95
LID	-	10.3109/02713680903254822 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: This study aimed to report an outbreak of early-onset endophthalmitis
		caused by Fusarium species following cataract surgery. METHODS: The study was
		designed retrospectively to review microbiologic and medical records of eight
		cases of endophthalmitis caused by Fusarium species after cataract surgery
		performed in the same operating room and on the same date by different surgeons
		"at Beyoğlu Eye Training and Research Hospital in Istanbul, Turkey. Seven patients"
		had phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation surgery. Intracapsular
		cataract extraction was performed in one patient. The common feature of these
		surgeries was the use of intracameral injections of cefuroxime (1 mg in 0.1-ml
		"balanced salt solution-BSS) solutions, which were preoperatively prepared from"
		the same BSS bottle. RESULTS: The duration between cataract surgery and the
		diagnosis of endophthalmitis was four days. Aqueous and vitreous specimens
		obtained from the patients grew fungus colonies that were identified according to
		their morphologic features and considered to be Fusarium solani. All patients
		underwent multiple vitrectomies with silicone oil injections. Patients were given
		local and systemic antifungal agents (amphotericin B and voriconazole). One
		patient with corneal involvement underwent evisceration despite a variety of
		treatments. One patient with unregulated diabetes was prephthisic without
		recurrence of infection. The final visual acuity of patients was between light
		perception and 20/100. CONCLUSION: Fusarium should be considered in the
		differential diagnosis of early-onset endophthalmitis after cataract surgery. An
		aggressive treatment with local and systemic antifungal agents and multiple
		vitrectomies with silicone oil injection is helpful in the management of
		postoperative early-onset Fusarium endophthalmitis. In the prevention of such
		"outbreaks, it is important to use solutions prepared differently for each"
		patient.

AB	-	We report a case of keratitis due to Fusarium langsethiae in a 56-year-old man.
		"The patient presented with pain and tearing of 10 days duration in the right eye,"
		"which had sustained a paddy stalk injury. On examination, a hypopyon corneal"
		ulcer was noted in the right eye. Multiple scrapings were obtained from the
		affected part of the cornea. A lactophenol cotton blue wet mount and a
		Gram-stained smear of scrapings were made. Scrapings were also inoculated on
		"various culture media, including Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA). A fungal etiology"
		was sought by conventional microbiological techniques and polymerase chain
		reaction. In vitro susceptibility testing was performed by an agar dilution
		"method. Direct microscopy of corneal scrapings revealed septate hyphae, leading"
		"to initiation of intensive topical therapy with natamycin (5 %). However, the"
		"keratitis progressed, necessitating therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty. White,"
		"powdery-like colonies, with abundant aerial mycelium, were recovered on SDA from"
		corneal scrape material. Based on macroscopic and microscopic morphological
		"features, the isolated fungus was initially identified as a Fusarium species."
		Sequence analysis of the 28S rRNA region of the fungal genome led to a specific
		identification of F. langsethiae. Antifungal susceptibility testing results
		"suggested that the strain isolated was susceptible to voriconazole, ketoconazole,"
		"and itraconazole. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of keratitis"
		due to F. langsethiae; attention is drawn to the unique characteristics of the
		"fungal isolate, difficulties in identification and non-responsiveness to medical"
		therapy.

AB	-	Paecilomyces variotii is a ubiquitous environmental saprophyte with worldwide
		"distribution. Commonly found in soil and decomposing organic material [1, 2], P."
		variotii can also be isolated from drinking water [3] and indoor and outdoor air
		"[4-6]. In immunocompetent hosts, P. variotii has been reported as a cause of"
		"locally invasive disease including prosthetic valve endocarditis [7, 8],"
		"endophthalmitis [9, 10], rhinosinusitis [11, 12], and dialysis-associated"

		"reported in immunocompromised patients, including those with chronic"
		"granulomatous disease [15], solid malignancy [16], acute leukemia [17], lymphoma"
		"[18], multiple myeloma [19], and after stem cell transplant for myelodysplasia"
		"[20]. In 1 case series examining invasive infections by non-Aspergillus molds, P."
		"variotii was the most common cause after Fusarium spp. [21]. Here, we present the"
		case of an immunocompetent patient with extensive intravascular infection
		involving prosthetic material. We describe successful induction therapy with
		combination antifungals and extended suppression with posaconazole with clinical
		quiescence and eventual normalization of serum fungal biomarkers.

AB	-	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Corneal ulcers can result in severe visual impairment in
		children. The recent trends of paediatric microbial ulcerative keratitis in the
		"USA are unknown. The purpose of this study is to report the risk factors,"
		microbiological profile and treatment outcomes of paediatric microbial keratitis
		in South Florida. METHODS: A university-based tertiary eye care centre
		retrospective case series between 1992 and 2015. Medical records of 107
		paediatric patients (age <18 years) with the diagnosis of microbial ulcerative
		"keratitis were analysed. Patient demographics, culture data, microbial"
		"susceptibility, management trends and patient outcomes were collected. RESULTS:"
		Mean age of patients was 13±4.6 years (range 0.2-17 years). The most common
		"associated risk factor was contact lens wear (77.6%), followed by ocular trauma"
		(8.4%). Systemic factors were present in 4.7% of cases. Cultures were taken from
		89 patients. A total of 74 organisms were isolated from the 52 corneal scrapings
		"with growth, yielding a 58.4% positivity rate. Seventeen microbial species were"
		"identified, with a predominance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (46.2%), followed by"
		Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (19.2%) and Fusarium (13.5%). Combined fortified
		antibiotics were the most common treatment (51.4%). Mean follow-up time was
		40.6±91.6 weeks (range: 0.3-480 weeks). The mean visual acuity improved from
		20/160 to 20/50 (p<0.0001). No therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty was needed.
		"CONCLUSIONS: In this study, contact lens wear was the most frequent risk factor"
		in infectious keratitis in children. P. aeruginosa was the most common
		microorganism present in our setting. The majority of the cases responded well to
		medical management.

TI	-	Association between sensitization to Aureobasidium pullulans (Pullularia sp) and
		severity of asthma.
PG	-	153-6
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Recent data indicate that fungi may contribute to increased severity
		of asthma. OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of allergy to 15 mold
		allergens among patients hospitalized because of exacerbation of asthma and to
		evaluate the relationship between the severity of the disease and allergy to
		particular molds. METHODS: Skin prick tests with standard aeroallergens of
		"airborne allergens, including grass, tree, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus,"
		"Dermatophagoides farinae, feather, and cat and dog fur, and a panel of mold"
		"allergens, including Alternaria, Cladosporium, Aspergillus, Penicillium,"
		"Trichothecium, Chaetomium globosum, Epicoccum, Epidermophyton, Helminthosporium,"
		"Aureobasidium pullulans, Rhizopus nigricans, Fusarium, Mucor, Merulius lacrymans,"
		"and yeast mix, were performed in 105 asthmatic patients and 30 controls. RESULTS:"
		Positive skin prick test results were found in 98% of asthmatic patients and 66%
		of controls. Sensitivity to A pullulans was significantly associated with more
		"severe asthma (odds ratio, 1.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-1.75; P = .006)."
		Sensitization to Helminthosporium was associated with an increased number of
		asthma exacerbations that required hospitalization (17% vs 38%; chi2 test P =
		.03). CONCLUSION: Sensitization to A pullulans is a risk factor for severe
		asthma. Sensitization to Helminthosporium may be related to asthma exacerbation
		that requires hospitalization.

TI	-	"Epidemiology, molecular mycology, and environmental sources of Fusarium infection"
		in patients with cancer.
PG	-	532-7
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the epidemiology and environmental sources of Fusarium
		infections in patients with cancer. DESIGN: Retrospective case-control study
		conducted following surveillance environmental cultures and DNA analysis of
		"isolated organisms. SETTING: A tertiary-care, university cancer center. METHODS:"
		"In 1996 and 1997, environmental cultures were performed on air samples and water"
		systems. A retrospective chart review was performed for 70 patients with cancer
		identified with fusariosis between 1987 and 1997. Patients with fusariosis were
		compared with 49 uninfected control patients who occupied hospital rooms with
		positive environmental cultures for Fusarium. With the use of random
		"amplification of polymorphic DNA, organisms isolated from infected patients were"
		compared with environmental organisms. RESULTS: Most of the patients with
		"Fusarium (40, 57%) were infected on or within 3 days of admission, indicating"
		community rather than nosocomial acquisition. Patients were comparable in terms
		of underlying immunocompromised status to 49 uninfected control patients.
		"However, the duration from admission to infection in the patients with fusariosis"
		tended to be shorter than the duration from admission to discharge in the exposed
		control patients (P = .06). Water cultured from the hospital tanks and from sinks
		and water fountains was negative for Fusarium. With the use of polymerase chain
		"reaction, environmental isolates did not match clinical ones. Quantitative air"
		sampling showed that the quantitative outdoor Fusarium levels were eightfold
		"higher than the indoor levels. During the rainy summer season, outdoor air"
		"concentrations of Fusarium were at their highest, coinciding with the peak"
		incidence of fusariosis at our center. CONCLUSION: The most likely source of
		"fusariosis was the external environment rather than nosocomial sources, such as"
		water.

TI	-	Successful treatment of resistant ocular fusariosis with posaconazole
		(SCH-56592).
PG	-	222-227
AB	-	PURPOSE: To describe the successful treatment with systemic posaconazole of a
		series of Fusarium ocular infections refractory to other antifungal agents.
		"DESIGN: Retrospective, interventional case series. METHODS: We identified three"
		patients from three different centers who received diagnoses of Fusarium
		keratitis and who received systemic posaconazole after their infections failed to
		respond to maximal tolerated medical and surgical therapy. All patients received
		"multiple systemic, intracameral, and topical antifungal agents, which were"
		ineffective in controlling their infection. RESULTS: Two patients were contact
		lens wearers. Two patients developed endophthalmitis. The infections of all three
		patients failed to respond to systemic and/or topical voriconazole treatment. One
		"patient could not tolerate systemic voriconazole, and another experienced no"
		marked improvement. The third discontinued treatment for both reasons. All
		patients were treated with oral posaconazole and experienced rapid reduction of
		"intraocular inflammation and pain, as well as resolution of the infection without"
		additional intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Deep Fusarium keratitis is difficult to
		"treat and carries a high risk of progression to endophthalmitis. Posaconazole,"
		which exhibits excellent tissue penetration and demonstrates efficacy in the
		"treatment of systemic Fusarium infection, was successful in treating three cases"
		of pan-resistant keratitis and/or endophthalmitis.

PG	-	1623-30
LID	-	10.1007/s10096-014-2111-1 [doi]
AB	-	"In order to better understand the epidemiology of fusariosis in Europe, a survey"
		collecting information on the clinical characteristics of the patients infected
		by Fusarium as well as on the infecting isolates was launched. A total of 76
		cases of invasive fusariosis occurring from January 2007 to June 2012 were
		collected and Fusarium isolates were identified by sequencing the translation
		"elongation factor 1α (TEF) gene. Also, antifungal susceptibility was tested by"
		broth microdilution according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial
		Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) and the Etest. Disseminated disease was
		considered proven in 46 cases and probable in 17 cases. Localised infection was
		"seen in 13 cases. Gibberella fujikuroi species complex (SC), including Fusarium"
		"verticillioides and F. proliferatum, and F. solani SC were the most frequent"
		"aetiology of disseminated and localised infections, respectively. The crude"
		"mortality rate was 46 %, the highest associated with F. solani SC (67 %) and F."
		proliferatum (62.5 %). A wide range of antifungal susceptibilities was observed.
		"Amphotericin B was the most potent antifungal in vitro, and itraconazole the"
		least effective. The azoles exhibited lower minimum inhibitory concentrations
		"(MICs) against F. verticillioides strains, with posaconazole having a slightly"
		"better performance, while F. solani SC isolates were resistant to all three"
		azoles tested. The essential agreement between the Etest and the EUCAST method
		"was 100 % for itraconazole and voriconazole, and 96 % for amphotericin B and"
		"posaconazole. In conclusion, we confirm that fusariosis is a rare but severe"
		"event in Europe, that G. fujikuroi SC is the predominant cause of deep infections"
		and that different species have different antifungal in vitro susceptibility
		patterns.

TI	-	A foodborne disease outbreak due to the consumption of moldy sorghum and maize
		containing fumonisin mycotoxins.
PG	-	249-55
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Unseasonal rains beginning in 1995 damaged the maize and sorghum
		crops harvested in a few villages of the Deccan plateau in India. Human
		consumption of those grains resulted in a foodborne disease outbreak
		"characterized by abdominal pain, borborygmi and diarrhea. METHODS: A rapid"
		epidemiological survey was conducted in the affected villages and a detailed
		house to house survey in selected villages. RESULTS: People in 27 out of 50
		villages surveyed were affected and disease was seen only in households and
		subjects consuming the rain damaged moldy sorghum or maize. The disease was self
		limiting. Diarrhea was reproduced in day old cockerels fed contaminated grains
		from affected households. All 20 sorghum and 12 maize samples collected from
		affected households had Fusarium sp. as the dominant mycoflora and contained
		"fumonisin B1 in the range of 0.14-7.8 mg/kg and 0.25-64.7 mg/kg, respectively. In"
		"contrast, samples collected from unaffected households had fumonisin B1 in low"
		"levels ranging from 0.07-0.36 mg/kg and 0.05-0.24 mg/kg, respectively."
		CONCLUSION: The higher water activity in the grains left in the field following
		harvest led to the production of high levels of fumonisin B1 and consumption of
		such grains by humans resulted in the disease.

		"dermatology referral centre in Bogota, Colombia."
PG	-	284-93
LID	-	10.1111/myc.12157 [doi]
AB	-	Worldwide prevalence of non-dermatophyte mould onychomycosis has increased in
		"recent years; however, available information on the topic is confusing and"
		"oftentimes contradictory, probably due to the small number of reported cases. The"
		"aim of this study was to determine and describe the aetiological agents, as well"
		as the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of non-dermatophyte mould
		"onychomycosis in a dermatology referral centre in Bogota, Colombia. A"
		cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted between January 2001 and December
		2011 among patients who attend the National Institute of Dermatology with a
		confirmed diagnosis of onychomycosis by non-dermatophytes moulds. There were 317
		confirmed cases of non-dermatophyte mould onychomycosis in 196 women and 121 men
		whose average age was 43 years. Twenty-seven per cent of them had a history of
		systemic disease. The habit of walking and showering barefoot was the major
		infection-related factor. Distal and lateral subungual presentation was the most
		common pattern of clinical presentation. The most frequent non-dermatophyte mould
		was Neoscytalidium dimidiatum followed by Fusarium spp. No relationship was
		observed with predisposing factors previously reported in the literature.
		Clinical features found in this population are indistinguishable from
		onychomycosis caused by dermatophytes. High prevalence of N. dimidiatum found
		here was in contrast to a large number of studies where other types of moulds
		predominate.

TI	-	Evaluation of agent and host factors in progression of mycotic keratitis: A
		histologic and microbiologic study of 167 corneal buttons.
PG	-	1538-46
AB	-	PURPOSE: To evaluate the host and agent factors in the progression of mycotic
		keratitis through the microbiologic evaluation and histologic study of human
		corneal buttons obtained at the time of therapeutic keratoplasty. DESIGN:
		Retrospective noncomparative consecutive case series. MATERIALS: One hundred
		sixty-seven corneal buttons from 148 patients of microbiologically diagnosed and
		treated cases of mycotic keratitis who underwent therapeutic keratoplasty between
		"January 1995 and May 1998. METHODS: Therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty, review"
		"of microbiologic results, histopathologic and microbiologic evaluation of the"
		corneal buttons of mycotic keratitis MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Histologic evaluation
		"of the buttons for morphologic changes, degree and distribution of inflammatory"
		"cells, presence or absence of fungal filaments, and their degree and distribution"
		within the corneal buttons. RESULTS: The diagnosis of fungal infection was made
		"on corneal scrapings in 36 cases; whereas in 131 (78%), the fungus was grown in"
		"cultures and identified as Aspergillus in 55 (42%), Fusarium in 42 (32%),"
		"unidentified hyaline fungi in 22 (17%), dematiaceous (unidentified) in 4 (3%),"
		and others in 8 (6%). The mean interval between diagnosis and keratoplasty was 19
		"(+/-40) days. From the keratoplasty specimen, the fungus was identified at"
		histologic examination in 127 of 167 (76%) buttons and grown by culture
		techniques in 76 of 115 (66%) buttons. The fungal species identified in the
		corneal button were Fusarium in 30 (39%); Aspergillus in 25 (33%); unidentified
		"hyaline in 19 (25%), and others in 2 (3%). Fungus-positive corneal buttons had"
		"early surgery (mean, 15 days) compared with fungus-negative (39 days) corneal"
		"buttons (P = 0.0005), with 93% fungus positivity in the buttons removed within 2"
		"weeks and 42% after 2 months. In the fungus-positive buttons, there was an"
		"inverse correlation between the degree, distribution of inflammatory cells, and"
		"fungal filaments (r = -0.255, P = 0.024; r = -0.199, P = 0.027), respectively."
		"The factors necessitating an early keratoplasty were heavy fungal load, deeper"
		"penetration of fungus, and possibly insufficient inflammation to combat"
		infection. A granulomatous reaction was noted in the posterior stroma and around
		"the fragmented Descemet's membrane in 23 buttons (13.8%), independent of fungal"
		species. Inflammation was unaffected by elimination of fungus and increasing
		interval between diagnosis and treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid progression of
		mycotic keratitis in the early phases is by agent factors such as heavy load and
		"deeper penetration of the fungus, insufficient inflammatory response, and"
		possibly relative ineffectiveness of antifungal agents. Progression in the later
		phase of mycotic keratitis need not necessarily be agent mediated; it could be
		"either host-modulated, species-related, or drug resistance, thereby suggesting"
		that ideal treatment regimens should include sensitivity-based antifungal therapy
		aided by in vivo monitoring of fungal filaments.

AB	-	"PURPOSE: In previous studies of fungal keratitis (FK) from temperate countries,"
		"yeasts were the predominant isolates, with ocular surface disease (OSD) being the"
		leading risk factor. Since the 2005-2006 outbreak of contact lens (CL)-associated
		"Fusarium keratitis, there may have been a rise in CL-associated filamentary FK in"
		the United Kingdom. This retrospective case series investigated the patterns of
		FK from 2007 to 2014. We compared these to 1994-2006 data from the same hospital.
		DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. METHODS: All cases of FK presenting to
		Moorfields Eye Hospital between 2007 and 2014 were identified. The definition of
		FK was either a fungal organism isolated by culture or fungal structures
		"identified by light microscopy (LM) of scrape material, histopathology, or"
		in vivo corneal confocal microscopy (IVCM). Main outcome measure was cases of FK
		per year. RESULTS: A total of 112 patients had confirmed FK. Median age was 47.2
		"years. Between 2007 and 2014, there was an increase in annual numbers of FK"
		"(Poisson regression, P = .0001). FK was confirmed using various modalities: 79"
		"(70.5%) by positive culture, 16 (14.3%) by LM, and 61 (54.5%) by IVCM."
		"Seventy-eight patients (69.6%) were diagnosed with filamentary fungus alone, 28"
		"(25%) with yeast alone, and 6 (5.4%) with mixed filamentary and yeast infections."
		This represents an increase in the proportion of filamentary fungal infections
		from the pre-2007 data. Filamentary fungal and yeast infections were associated
		"with CL use and OSD, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The number of FK cases has"
		increased. This increase is due to CL-associated filamentary FK. Clinicians
		"should be aware of these changes, which warrant epidemiologic investigations to"
		identify modifiable risk factors.

TI	-	An outbreak of Fusarium keratitis associated with contact lens use in the
		northeastern United States.
PG	-	1187-94
AB	-	PURPOSE: To report an outbreak of Fusarium keratitis in contact lens (CL) wearers
		"in the northeastern United States. METHODS: Over a 41-month period, all cases"
		with culture-proven corneal ulceration secondary to Fusarium at 2 tertiary care
		eye centers were identified through the microbiology departments of each
		"institution, and a retrospective review of charts was performed. Statistical"
		analyses were performed to evaluate a possible association of Fusarium keratitis
		with specific CL and CL solution brands. RESULTS: Fifteen cases of Fusarium
		keratitis were reported at the 2 tertiary centers between July 2005 and May 2006
		(16.4 cases/yr) compared with 6 cases over the previous 30 months from January
		"2003 to June 2005 (2.4 cases/yr). All 15 of the more recent cases were CL users,"
		and none had a history of trauma. All 15 patients claimed use of ReNu brand
		contact lens solution when they developed keratitis. Twelve (80.0%) of 15
		patients were Acuvue soft contact lens users. Ten (66.7%) of 15 patients used tap
		water to rinse their contact lens cases. Six (40.0%) of 15 cases have thus far
		required corneal transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of corneal
		ulceration secondary to Fusarium has increased sevenfold over the reported
		11-month period at 2 tertiary eye care centers in the northeastern United States
		compared with the previous 30 months. There seems to be an association between
		the recent outbreak of Fusarium keratitis among CL users and the use of ReNu
		contact lens solution. Medical treatment of Fusarium keratitis may be
		"ineffective, and emergent penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) may be required in some"
		patients. CL users and their physicians should reconsider the risks of CL use and
		discuss proper lens care techniques.

		centre: a 10-year retrospective review.
PG	-	621-6
AB	-	This study reviewed retrospectively the clinical characteristics of 28 cancer
		patients with fungal osteoarticular infections (FOAIs) between 1995 and 2005.
		Most patients (26; 93%) had haematological malignancies (19 had leukaemia); half
		(14) were allogeneic stem-cell transplant recipients. Twelve patients (43%) had
		severe neutropenia (< or = 100/mm3) with a mean duration of 65 days (range 10-500
		"days), and ten (36%) patients had received a significant dose of corticosteroids."
		"Most (19; 68%) FOAIs were caused by contiguous extension, while nine (32%) were"
		"associated with haematogenous spread. Pain, joint instability and local drainage"
		"were seen in 28 (100%), six (21%), and seven (25%) patients, respectively."
		Sixteen (57%) patients had symptoms for < 1 month. The sinuses (ten; 36%) and the
		vertebral spine (six; 21%) were the most common sites involved. Moulds were the
		predominant pathogens: Aspergillus fumigatus (two); non-fumigatus Aspergillus
		spp. (eight); non-specified Aspergillus spp. (three); Fusarium spp. (six);
		Zygomycetes (five); Scedosporium apiospermum (two); and Exserohilum sp. (one).
		Candida was the causative pathogen in four cases (including two cases of mixed
		"FOAIs). Arthritis and post-operative FOAIs were both uncommon manifestations,"
		occurring in two patients each. All patients received systemic antifungal therapy
		"(combinations in 20 cases), and 19 cases underwent adjunctive surgery. The crude"
		mortality rates (at 12 weeks) were 44% (9/20) in the patients who underwent
		surgery and antifungal therapy vs. 33% (2/6) in patients who received antifungal
		"therapy alone (p not significant). FOAI is a rare, yet severe, manifestation of"
		"localised or systemic mycoses, caused predominantly by moulds, and is seen"
		typically in patients with haematological malignancies.

AB	-	"Of late, fungal infections are increasingly being recognized in diabetic"
		patients. Here we present a case of polymicrobial fungal empyema due
		to Trichosporon species and Fusarium species developed after community-acquired
		pneumonia in a diabetic patient. Trichosporon species are basidiomycetous yeast
		and Fusarium species are soil saprophytes with a worldwide distribution. Fungal
		empyema cases are rare and are mostly caused
		by Aspergillus and Candida species. Polymicrobial fungal empyema
		with Trichosporon species and Fusarium species has not been reported previously.
		Our patient was successfully treated with antifungal therapy. This case
		highlights that fungal empyema should be considered in diabetic patients
		especially if they are not responding to antibiotics.

AB	-	"Fusarium is a ubiquitous hyalohyphomycete isolated from food, widespread in the"
		"environment (plants, soil) and present at all latitudes. Fusarium oxysporum and"
		"Fusarium solani are the most frequent pathogenic species, followed by F."

		disseminated or localized. Localized forms include cutaneous and subcutaneous
		"infection, onychomycosis, endophtalmitis, otitis, sinusitis, arthritis,"
		"osteomyelitis, and brain abscess. Disseminated forms are those in which two or"
		more noncontiguous sites may be involved. These latter are observed in patients
		"with severe neutropenia. Wounds, digital ulcers, onychomycosis, and paronychia"
		are the typical cutaneous portal of entry. We report a case of primary localized
		cutaneous infection due to Fusarium in a 29-year-old woman presenting with a
		"nodular lesion, partially ulcerated, asymptomatic on the first finger of the left"
		"hand, appeared 4 months earlier. Histological examination showed spongiosis and"
		"acanthosis in the stratum corneum, ulceration and inflammation with prevalently"
		mononucleate cells and septate and branched fungal structures in the epidermis
		and in dermis. The fungus was identified as Fusarium oxysporum by culture of
		biopsy fragments on Sabouraud dextrose agar with chloramphenicol. The culture was
		"deposited in the culture collection of the mycology section of IHEM, Brussels"
		(IHEM21984 col no. 125). The patient had normal immune status and was
		successfully treated with surgical excision. Recovery was confirmed at follow-up

AB	-	PURPOSE: To report a difficult-to-identify case of keratitis due to Fusarium
		"solani, diagnosed with the help of exhaustive gene analysis. CASE: A 47-year-old"
		woman attended our hospital with a refractory corneal ulcer associated with
		contact lens wear in her left eye that had appeared two weeks earlier. On her
		"initial visit, slit lamp examination revealed a small double-ringed irregular"
		"hyphate ulcer in the center of the cornea, which had no epithelial defect,"
		suggesting fungal infection. Microscopic visualization and culture of corneal
		"scrapings were performed repeatedly, but the results were negative. Despite"
		"intensive antifungal treatment, infiltration of the cornea worsened and"
		therapeutic keratoplasty was performed. Specimens from a corneal button were
		microbiologically and histologically negative for microorganisms. During
		"irrigation of the anterior chamber with amphotericin B, aspirated corneal"
		infiltrations were submitted for culture and metagenomic analysis. Genes
		"belonging to F. solani were identified by metagenomic analysis, and an isolate"
		presumed to be a Fusarium species was cultured. Genotypic identification of the
		"isolates confirmed F. solani. CONCLUSION: The detection of microorganisms,"
		"especially fungi, can be extremely difficult. In difficult-to-culture cases,"
		metagenomic analysis seems to be a promising technique for the identification of
		microbial pathogens.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive mold infections are a well-known and life-threatening
		condition after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). While
		"Aspergillus species are recognized as predominant pathogens, Fusarium species"
		should also be considered due to their broad environmental distribution and the
		"expected poor outcome of invasive fusariosis. Particularly, splenic rupture as a"
		complication of disseminated disease has not been reported yet. CASE
		"PRESENTATION: Two weeks after allogeneic HSCT for severe aplastic anemia, a"
		"16-year-old boy presented with painful, erythematous skin nodules affecting the"
		"entire integument. As disseminated mycosis was considered, treatment with"
		liposomal amphotericin B and voriconazole (VCZ) was initiated. Invasive
		fusariosis was diagnosed after histological and previously unpublished polymerase
		chain reaction-based examination of skin biopsies. Microbiological tests revealed
		Fusarium solani species. Despite stable neutrophil engraftment and uninterrupted
		"treatment with VCZ, he developed mold disease-associated splenic rupture with"
		hypovolemic shock and fungal endocarditis. The latter induced a cardiac thrombus
		and subsequent embolic cerebral infarctions with unilateral hemiparesis.
		"Following cardiac surgery, the patient did not regain consciousness because of"
		"diffuse cerebral ischemia, and he died on day +92 after HSCT. CONCLUSION:"
		Invasive fusariosis in immunocompromised patients is a life-threatening
		condition. Despite antimycotic treatment adapted to antifungal susceptibility
		"testing, the patient reported here developed uncommon manifestations such as"
		splenic rupture and fungal endocarditis.

TI	-	Allergenic fungi spore records (15 years) and sensitization in patients with
		respiratory allergy in Thessaloniki-Greece.
PG	-	225-31
AB	-	BACKGROUND: The prevalence of respiratory allergy to fungi spores (FS) is not
		precisely known but is estimated at 20-30% of atopic patients. There are no
		"aerobiological records, necessary for respiratory allergy diagnosis and"
		"treatment, in Thessaloniki and generally in Greece. AIM: Creation of a database"
		on FS circulation and investigation of skin sensitivity (SS) of asthmatics by
		using skin prick tests (SPT). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Daily records and
		"identification of 15 airborne FS species were conducted, using a Burkard trap"
		"during 1987-2001. SS to 5 most common FS extracts was investigated, by using SPT"
		"in a total of 1311 asthmatics with atopy, submitted to the Out-Patient Clinic of"
		"Asthma (Pulmonary Dept, Aristotle Univ, Thessaloniki) in 1990-2001. RESULTS: The"
		"FS recorded in the 15-year period were as follows: Cladosporium spp. (72.2%),"
		"Alternaria spp. (9.8%), Ustilago spp. (8.1%), Ascospores (2.7%), Agrocybe spp."
		"(1.5%), Helminthosporium spp. (1.4%), Leptosphaeria spp (1.2%), Agrogybe spp."
		"(1.1%), whereas the species Botrytis, Stemphylium, Pleospora, Nigrospora,"
		"Epicoccum. Fusarium, Torula and Phoma presented concentrations <1%. The highest"
		numbers of airborne FS were recorded during summer. Positive skin reaction to FS
		was observed in 421 (32%) patients of the 1311 asthmatics. Positive skin reaction
		"to Altemaria species was observed in 177 patients (13.5%), in 98 (7.4%) to"
		"Cladosporium, 65 (5%) to Aspergillus, 45 (3.4%) to Fusarium and 36 (2.7%) to"
		Rhizopus. FS sensitivity is much more frequent in younger men. CONCLUSIONS: For
		"the first time in Thessaloniki-Greece, 15 allergenic FS species circulation has"
		been recorded for the last 15 years. SS was more frequently detected for the
		"species of Alternaria, Cladosporium and Aspergillus."

		"(Fusarium proliferatum, Nemania primolutea, Daldinia eschsholtzii) showed"
		antibacterial activities as determined by the disk diffusion assay against ESKAPE
		bacterial pathogens. Fusarium proliferatum gave the most active fungal extract
		with zone of inhibition values of 15 mm and 19 mm against E. faecalis and S.
		"aureus, respectively. Further chromatographic purification of the F. proliferatum"
		ethyl acetate extract led to the isolation and identification of
		"bis(2-ethylhexyl)terephthalate (1), acetyl tributyl citrate (2), and fusarubin"
		(3). Acetyl tributyl citrate (2) exhibited moderate antibacterial activity
		"against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus."

		"Fusarium in 210 (37.6%) and Aspergillus species in 170 cases (30.4%),"
		respectively. Trauma was the most common predisposing factor (47.7%). Fifty-three
		"eyes (61.3%) had the classical clinical picture of yellow-white, dry raised"
		infiltrate with feathery hyphate edges at initial examination. The characteristic
		macroscopic pigmentation was seen in only 24 eyes (27.27%). Septate branching
		"fungal filaments were identified in 78 smears (88.63%) on light microscopy, of"
		which 5 (5.7%) also showed the presence of bacteria. Curvularia species dominated
		the spectrum (22.7%). Treatment was started in 48 eyes with topical antifungal
		"agents, whereas 37 received both oral and topical antifungal agents. Outcome data"
		"were available for 68 cases. Forty-nine (72%) responded to medical therapy,"
		whereas 13 eyes required therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty and 6 eyes had to
		be eviscerated. CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest series of keratitis caused by
		dematiaceous fungi reported to date. It clearly brings out the clinical
		importance of this group of corneal infections.

AB	-	Fusarium keratomycosis is a destructive eye infection that is difficult to treat
		"and produces a poor outcome, which can affect healthy patients. Keratomycoses are"
		"rare and can be underdiagnosed, thus, direct microscopic examination and culture"
		are essential for an early specific diagnosis and must be taken into
		consideration to establish the most effective treatment and avoid severe
		"complications. Herein, we present a case of a healthy patient, who was diagnosed"
		with Fusarium solani keratitis. He developed a corneal infection without an
		"obvious history of trauma, and any comorbidity but with a history of contact with"
		"juice of herbs during an indigenous healing practice, which was the most likely"
		cause for the development of the fungal infection. He was treated with
		"intrastromal voriconazole and systemic itraconazole, with a good clinical course,"
		however with sequelae of decreased visual acuity.

PG	-	195-8
LID	-	10.1136/bjophthalmol-2014-305412 [doi]
AB	-	AIM: To evaluate the outcomes of treating deep recalcitrant fungal keratitis with
		intrastromal voriconazole injection. METHODS: Twenty-five patients with culture
		"proven fungal keratitis, not responding to a combination of topical 5% natamycin"
		and 1% voriconazole were treated with intrastromal voriconazole (50 µg/0.1 mL)
		injected in five divided doses around the infiltrate to form a depot of the drug
		around the circumference of the lesion. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was
		52.52±12.21 years and mean time to presentation was 17.12±13.75 days from the
		"onset of symptoms. The mean area of the infiltrate was 30.41±17.2 mm(2), hypopyon"
		was present in 88% and all cases had infiltrates that extended beyond the
		mid-stromal level. Intrastromal voriconazole helped to resolve the infection in
		18 (72%) patients and about 15% of these needed more than one injection. Smaller
		ulcers responded better to treatment. Fusarium spp were responsible for six of
		the seven cases that failed treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Targeted delivery of
		voriconazole by intrastromal injection (50 µg/0.1 mL) is a safe and effective way
		"to treat deep recalcitrant fungal keratitis, though some may need repeated"
		injections. Fusarium keratitis may show suboptimal response but this needs
		further study.

AB	-	We describe a 57-year-old woman suffering from acute erythroblastic leukaemia.
		"After the first course of high-dose Ara-C containing consolidation therapy, the"
		patient developed multiple skin lesions on the left foot. A skin biopsy revealed
		a Fusarium infection. The lesions regressed under therapy with caspofungin and
		voriconazole. Leukaemia relapsed after 1 year and an allogeneic stem cell
		transplantation was performed for consolidation of leukaemia in second remission.
		"Again, the patient developed macular skin lesions located on the trunk and the"
		"extremities with central pallor. Clinical examination showed fever,"
		tachyarrhythmia and a systolic murmur. Fusarium spp. was cultured from blood
		"samples. An antimycotic therapy with amphotericin B, voriconazole and"
		posaconazole failed completely. The patient died in a septic shock with
		"consecutive multiple organ failure. The autopsy (SN 1/06, Institute of Pathology,"
		University of Greifswald) revealed a disseminated infiltration with Fusarium
		"solani including myocardial, endocardial and aortal infection. The involvement of"
		the cardiovascular system is uncommon in fusariosis and has not been described so
		far. This case confirms other reports describing the high mortality of fusariosis
		after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. A rapid diagnosis and antimycotics
		with higher activity against Fusarium spp. are necessary for successful therapy
		of this severe mould infection in the immunocompromised host.

TI	-	The spectrum of Fusarium infection in immunocompromised patients with
		haematological malignancies and in non-immunocompromised patients: a single
		institution experience over 10 years.
PG	-	544-8
AB	-	Fusarium is a newly emerging fungal pathogen associated with significant
		morbidity and mortality in the immunocompromised host. We have reviewed our
		hospital's experience with Fusarium between 1985 and 1995. Fusarium species were
		"isolated from 22 specimens, representing 11 patients. Cases were not clustered by"
		time period. The median age of the patients was 36.5 years (range 17-69 years).
		"The sources of the organism were 12 skin lesions from eight patients, seven blood"
		"cultures from two patients and one specimen each from a Hickman catheter tip,"
		nail clippings and a bronchoalveolar lavage. Seven of the patients had
		chemotherapy-induced neutropenia when the Fusarium was isolated. Five of them
		developed invasive fusarosis during acute leukaemia induction treatment. They
		"remained neutropenic, and none survived. The other two patients recovered from"
		neutropenia and were treated successfully for this infection. The remaining four
		patients were not neutropenic or immunocompromised. Three grew Fusarium from skin
		or nail clippings and one from bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL). There was no
		evidence of invasive disease in any of the four. None of them received antifungal
		"therapy, and they were all alive at last follow-up. We conclude that Fusarium is"
		"a newly emerging infection in neutropenic patients. A high index of suspicion,"
		"especially for skin lesions, will help in early diagnosis before systemic and"
		visceral dissemination. Excision of the initial focus of infection and antifungal
		"therapy, aided by speedy neutrophil recovery, are likely to protect patients"
		"threatened with these fatal infections. Fusarium isolated from non-neutropenic,"
		non-immunosuppressed patients is not significant and does not merit systemic
		antifungal treatment.

		contact-lens disinfection.
PG	-	361-7
AB	-	Microbial keratitis has been studied in Hong Kong as a representative
		sub-tropical climate of south China. An 18-month investigation in 1997/98 of 223
		cases of ulcerative keratitis (presumed microbial) was conducted in the 2 million
		population of Shatin and Kowloon at the Prince of Wales and Hong Kong Eye
		Hospitals respectively with comprehensive microbiology. A case-control study was
		pursued at the same time between 45 contact-lens wearers (CLW) developing
		"microbial keratitis and 135 lens-wearing volunteers matched for age, sex,"
		educational status and visual acuity. Home water supplies were sampled for
		Acanthamoeba. Previous ocular surface disease and trauma (preventable by wearing
		goggles for grinding) were common predisposing causes while cosmetic wear of
		contact lenses was responsible for 26% of cases overall. Pseudomonas aeruginosa
		"was the commonest bacterium isolated, from both CLW and non-CLW, with infection"
		being acquired within the community. These 28 pseudomonads remained fully
		"sensitive to the third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides and quinolone"
		"antibiotics, which is very encouraging. Fungi were isolated, predominantly"
		"Fusarium sp., but less commonly than expected. A fungal/bacterial ratio was"
		"obtained of 1/17, while in comparison, the expected ratio for a tropical climate"
		ranges from 1/5 (Singapore) to 1/2 (South India). Acanthamoeba was the second
		commonest microbe isolated from keratitis of CLW. The domestic water environment
		of 8% of homes of both patients and controls wearing contact lenses was colonized
		"with Acanthamoeba. Lack of hygiene, use of tap water for storing lenses, failure"
		to air-dry lens-storage cases or use of one-step hydrogen peroxide disinfectant
		were identified as risk factors for keratitis in CLW. The study results commend
		use of multipurpose solutions by CLW in Hong Kong to achieve the lowest expected
		rates of infection.

TI	-	Mycological profile of infectious Keratitis from Delhi.
PG	-	159-64
AB	-	BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Corneal blindness is a major health problem worldwide and
		infectious keratitis is one of the predominant causes. The incidence of fungal
		keratitis has increased over the last few years. Though a few studies have been
		"carried out on mycotic keratitis from north and other parts of India, there are"
		"none from Delhi. Keeping this in mind, this study was conducted to evaluate the"
		frequency of positive fungal cultures in infectious keratitis and of the various
		fungal species identified as aetiologic agents in patients attending a tertiary
		care hospital in East Delhi. METHODS: Corneal scrapings from 346 patients of
		corneal ulcer with suspected fungal aetiology were subjected to direct
		"examination by 10 per cent KOH mount, Gram stain and culture. The results were"
		examined retrospectively and analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 346 patients of corneal
		"ulcer investigated, in 77 (22.25%) cases fungal aetiology was identified. Males"
		were more commonly affected and were mostly in the age group of 31-40 yr. It was
		seen that trauma was the most common predisposing factor especially in the
		agriculturists and the farmers. Aspergillus flavus was the most common fungus
		"isolated in 31.16 per cent cases, followed by A. fumigatus (16.88%) and Fusarium"
		spp. (7.79%). Yeasts were also isolated in 21.62 per cent cases. Both yeasts and
		mycelial fungi were isolated in 6.5 per cent of cases. INTERPRETATION &
		"CONCLUSION: Because of serious consequences of infectious keratitis, it is"
		important to know the exact aetiology of corneal ulcer to institute appropriate
		therapy in time. Laboratory confirmation should be undertaken and fungal
		infection should be ruled out before prescribing corticosteroids and
		antibacterial antibiotics.

TI	-	Disseminated Fusarium infection with brain abscesses in a lung transplant
		recipient.
PG	-	417-21
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To detail a case of disseminated Fusarium infection in an
		immunocompromised adult. Fusarium sp. infections are an important cause of fungal
		keratitis in immunocompetent patients and a recent outbreak related to use of a
		specific type of contact lens solution made national and international newspaper
		headlines. While reports of disseminated infection in immunosuppressed patients
		"have appeared over the last 30 years, few have emphasized the neuropathological"
		aspects of this emerging pathogen. PATIENT AND METHODS: Woman with pulmonary
		sarcoidosis necessitating bilateral lung transplants 4 months prior to her demise
		who was soon readmitted with viral pneumonia. She developed targetoid skin
		lesions of her face and thigh; she succumbed before biopsy could be performed.
		"RESULTS: Autopsy revealed systemic organ infection involving lungs,"
		"gastrointestinal tract mucosa, bilateral kidneys, and skin. Foci of acute"
		"cerebritis showed vessels occluded by hyphal, septate fungi. Fungal culture"
		"remains the gold standard for diagnosis, and culture grew Fusarium. CONCLUSION:"
		Fusarium is resistant to standard antifungal therapies; the increasing use of
		antifungal medications - as either treatment or prophylaxis - may shift more
		infections toward unusual species such as Fusarium.

TI	-	Systemic Fusariosis: A Rare Complication in Children with Acute Lymphoblastic
		Leukemia.
LID	-	10.3390/jof6040212 [doi]
LID	-	212
AB	-	Fusarium species are ubiquitous pathogens causing opportunistic infections in
		immunocompromised patients. Clinical presentation depends on a host's immunity
		and can be localized or disseminated. Since there are few reports of disseminated
		"fusariosis in children, we described an unusual case of Fusarium solani infection"
		in a 9-year-old child with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This patient
		presented a deep wound in the elbow at diagnosis. During the induction phase of
		"chemotherapy, he developed multiple skin lesions and severe pneumonia; Fusarium"
		solani was cultured from the skin lesions. He was treated with a high dose of
		"liposomal amphotericin B, followed by voriconazole. Starting from this peculiar"
		"case, we collected all patients with acute leukemia affected by Fusarium"
		"infection, treated in the pediatric Onco-Hematology Division of Padua University"
		Hospital during the last 20 years. We identified another six cases: all these
		patients were affected by acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and five of them presented
		a relapsed/refractory disease. Two out of seven patients died because of
		"infection; five patients recovered from infection, but three out of seven died"
		because of leukemia. Skin lesions in immunocompromised patients should rise the
		"suspicion of disseminated fusariosis. Furthermore, considering the emergence of"
		"filamentous fungi in immunocompromised patients, we all should be aware of"
		"Fusarium infection, reminding us that the diagnosis is important to cure the"
		infection.

		three-year study.
PG	-	315-21
AB	-	PURPOSE: To study the epidemiological characteristics and laboratory diagnosis of
		fungal keratitis seen at a tertiary eye care referral centre in South India.
		METHODS: A retrospective review of all culture-proven fungal keratitis seen over
		"a 3-year period, September 1999 through August 2002. RESULTS: Fungal aetiology"
		were confirmed in 1095 (34.4%) of 3183 corneal ulcers. The predominant fungal
		species isolated was Fusarium spp (471; 42.82%) followed by Aspergillus spp (286;
		26%). Males (712; 65.08%) were more often affected (P<0.0001). A large proportion
		of the patients (732; 66.85%) were in the younger age group (21 to 50 years). A
		"majority (879; 80.27%) came from rural areas (P<0.0001), and most patients (709;"
		64.75%) were farmers (P<0.0001). Ocular trauma (1009; 92.15%) was a highly
		significant risk factor (P<0.0001) and vegetative injuries (671; 61.28%) were
		identified as a significant cause for fungal keratitis (P<0.0001). 172 (15.71%)
		patients had concurrent diabetes mellitus. The sensitivity of 10% potassium
		hydroxide (KOH) wet mount preparation was higher (99.23%) than Gram-stained smear
		(88.73%) (P<0.0001). Incidence of fungal keratitis was higher between June and
		September. CONCLUSION: Agricultural activity and related ocular trauma were
		principal causes of mycotic keratitis. A potassium hydroxide (KOH) wet mount
		"preparation is a simple, and sensitive, method for diagnosis"

PG	-	179-84
AB	-	PURPOSE: A retrospective statistical analysis of the Fusarium keratitis epidemic
		of 2004-2006 was performed. METHODS: Poisson and binomial probability
		distributions were performed in conjunction with statistical data reported from
		Singapore's Fusarium keratitis outbreak in order to identify the earliest
		theoretical point in time that this outbreak and its cause could have been
		"recognized. RESULTS: The outbreak in Singapore could, theoretically, have been"
		"recognized after only three months (three cases), P = 0.0067. The cause of the"
		"Singapore outbreak could, theoretically, have been determined after only four"
		"months (five cases), P = 0.0024. CONCLUSIONS: The worldwide Fusarium keratitis"
		"epidemic of 2004-2006 could, theoretically, have been recognized much earlier by"
		the application of basic statistical methods to the outbreak in Singapore. The
		lessons learned from this analysis may help prevent future epidemics.

TI	-	Infectious keratitis at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital: a 12-year
		retrospective study of 391 cases.
PG	-	S217-30
AB	-	A retrospective study of 391 severe infectious keratitis admitted to King
		Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital from January 1988 to December 2000 were analyzed.
		Most patients came from the central part of Thailand. There were 2 bimodal peak
		incidence distributions which fell in the age group 21-30 and 51-60 years of age.
		The most common predisposing to corneal ulceration was trauma from several
		"materials, including leaves, branches, dust and stone, which accounted for 47.82"
		per cent. Culture results were collected 74.68 per cent (292/391). The data
		"showed negative culture results of 52.74 per cent (154/292), positive results"
		"occurred in 47.26 per cent (138/292); including bacteria 32.53 per cent (95/292),"
		"fungus 11.64 per cent (34/292), virus 2.05 per cent (6/292) and mixed organism"
		1.02 per cent (3/292). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common bacteria
		isolated; 47 per cent. The second most common was Streptococcus pneumoniae which
		accounted for 9 per cent. Fusarium spp was the most common fungus found (34.29%);
		Aspergillus and Curvularia spp were the next (20.0% each). Herpes simplex was the
		most common virus isolated; 83.3 per cent. The treatment of infectious keratitis
		included application of topical/intraocular injection of antimicrobial agent and
		"surgery, which accounted for 184 cases. Penetrating keratoplasty was the most"
		"common surgery performed, 34.24 per cent (63/184), followed by evisceration and"
		enucleation accounted for 25 per cent (46/184).

		reduced-intensity conditioning allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant.
PG	-	1705-10
LID	-	10.3109/10428194.2010.500433 [doi]
AB	-	Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a major cause of morbidity in patients with
		"hematological malignancies, and a major impediment to the success of allogeneic"
		stem cell transplant (allo-SCT). The aim of this single-center retrospective
		study was to determine the impact of pre-transplant IA on the outcome of allo-SCT
		after reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC). Twenty-eight cases of proven or
		probable IA were diagnosed prior to RIC allo-SCT at the Paoli-Calmettes Institute
		Cancer Center between January 2000 and January 2008. These cases were identified
		among 360 patients undergoing allo-SCT. IA was defined according to EORTC
		"criteria. Patients had predominantly (82%) acute myeloid leukemia, were diagnosed"
		"with IA at a median of 8 months (range, 1-16) pre-transplant, and received"
		"antifungal therapy for a median of 5 months (range, 1-13). IA therapy included:"
		voriconazole (71%); single-agent itraconazole (14%); and a combination of agents
		(14%). Secondary prophylaxis against aspergillosis was maintained during
		"conditioning and post-transplant in 89% of patients. After transplant, only three"
		patients (11%) had reactivation of their IA and one patient developed
		disseminated fusariosis. The latter four patients experienced severe acute GVHD
		treated with high-dose corticosteroids. None of these patients died of IA.
		"Eighteen patients (64%) are still alive, with a median follow-up of 23.5 months"
		"(range, 12.6-48.5). Overall survival at 2 years was 59% (95% CI, 43-83%). These"
		data suggest that patients with adequately controlled IA can tolerate RIC
		allo-SCT without significant post-transplant complications.

AB	-	PURPOSE: Acanthamoeba and fungal keratitis are rare ocular infections. We report
		cases of combined Fusarium and Acanthamoeba keratitis and the clinical course of
		medical treatment. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of patients treated
		"for culture-proven Acanthamoeba keratitis at a referral centre, during 2001-2006."
		RESULTS: Eleven consecutive patients were treated for culture-proven Acanthamoeba
		"keratitis during the 5 years, two of whom had combined fungal infections. A"
		29-year-old man presented with ground-glass corneal oedema and epitheliopathy
		"caused by contact lens use. The other patient, a 7-year-old girl, had eye trauma"
		that led to a feathery corneal infiltrate. Both cases were treated with topical
		"0.02% polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB), 0.1% propamidine, 1% clotrimazole and"
		5% natamycin. Therapeutic keratoplasty was not required in either case.
		"CONCLUSIONS: Timely identification of the pathogen, with repeated culture and"
		"smear if necessary, as well as adequate dosage to prevent recurrence is highly"
		recommended in order to preclude the need for therapeutic penetrating
		keratoplasty.

		infection.
PG	-	315-9
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive infection by Fusarium sp. is associated with high mortality
		"in patients with hematologic cancer. Yet to the authors' knowledge, little is"
		known regarding predictors of adverse outcome. METHODS: The authors conducted a
		retrospective review of the records of patients with hematologic carcinoma and
		invasive fusariosis who were treated at one institution in the U.S. and at 11
		centers in Brazil. RESULTS: The records of 84 patients were evaluated.
		Neutropenia was present in 83% and 33 patients had undergone stem cell
		transplantation. Only 18 patients (21%) were alive 90 days after the diagnosis of
		fusariosis. Multivariate predictors of poor outcome were persistent neutropenia
		"(hazard ratio [HR] of 5.43; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 2.64-11.11) and use"
		"of corticosteroids (HR of 2.18; 95% CI, 1.98-3.96). The actuarial survival rate"
		of patients without any of these factors was 67% compared with 30% for patients
		who recovered from neutropenia but were receiving corticosteroids and 4% for
		patients with persistent neutropenia only. None of the patients with both risk
		factors survived (P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Measures to reduce the duration of
		"neutropenia, as well as the judicious use of corticosteroids, may reduce the high"
		mortality rate of fusariosis in patients with hematologic cancer.

PG	-	103-7
LID	-	10.1007/s10792-008-9290-7 [doi]
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Fusarium keratitis is a severe corneal infection that is usually
		"seen in tropical and subtropical countries after a corneal trauma. In 2005-2006,"
		"an epidemic of Fusarium keratitis, occurring predominantly among contact lens"
		"wearers, was observed in several countries. CASE REPORT: We describe the clinical"
		course of a Fusarium keratitis which failed to respond to systemic and local
		"voriconazole treatment, and experienced a progression to a severe keratitis with"
		"endophthalmitis, requiring early therapeutic keratoplasty (""à chaud""). After 8"
		"months of follow up, the vision recovered to 20/50. DISCUSSION: After the"
		"2005-2006 worldwide epidemics, case-control studies pointed out that a new lens"
		"care solution, ReNu with MoistureLoc (Bausch & Lomb), was likely responsible of"
		numerous cases. Complementary studies underlined that this infection mostly
		"concerned non-compliant patients, i.e., those reusing the solution several times,"
		since this results in a decrease of the antifungal activity due to the uptake of
		the biguanides into the lens. CONCLUSION: Fusarium endophtalmitis can result in a
		devastating disease with a poor visual outcome. An initial antifungal dual
		"therapy may control the infection. In case of failure, an early keratoplasty may"
		"be mandatory. For contact lens wearers, education on sanitary good practice is"
		necessary to avoid new epidemics in the future.

		Fusarium Infection After a Modified Multi-Visceral Transplant.
PG	-	512-8
LID	-	10.12659/AOT.892209 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND Fusarium spp. infections have become an emerging and lethal threat to
		"the immunocompromised patient population, especially those with neutropenia."
		Recently there have been increased reports in solid organ transplant recipients.
		Presentation is commonly as soft tissue infections several months
		"post-transplant. With high morbidity and mortality, efficacious antifungal"
		therapy is essential. This remains challenging with limited data and no
		established clinical breakpoints defined. CASE REPORT We report on a modified
		multi-visceral transplant patient that developed a Fusarium infection only 7
		"weeks post-transplant in the native hard palate and esophagus, without any soft"
		"tissue lesions, which persisted despite aggressive combination treatment with"
		amphotericin B lipid complex and voriconazole. CONCLUSIONS Fusarium spp.
		infection in solid organ transplant is a significant challenge without clear
		"diagnostic clinical indicators of infection, or specific time of onset, in"
		addition to possible emergence of a more aggressive drug-resistant strain.

PG	-	159-63
LID	-	10.3341/kjo.2009.23.3.159 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: Postoperative endophthalmitis is a dreaded outcome of any intraocular
		surgery. Fungal endophthalmitis is a particularly severe complication that poses
		a significant threat of blindness. We experienced seven consecutive cases of
		postoperative fungal endophthalmitis stemming from a single local clinic in which
		extensive early intervention resulted in favorable final visual acuity. METHODS:
		The present study is retrospective observational case series of fungal
		"endophthalmitis. The initial case, as diagnosed by fungal culture, resulted in"
		"blindness. In the ensuing eight months, seven consecutive cases were referred to"
		our institution. All were presumed to be fungal endophthalmitis as the cases
		possessed similar inflammatory findings to the preceding case and occurred in the
		same environment. Extensive surgical and antifungal treatment was immediately
		"administered, including complete vitrectomy with removal of the intraocular lens"
		and lens capsule and Amphotericin B injections. RESULTS: Retinal infiltration was
		identified in three cases and the lesion site was photocoagulated with an
		endolaser. All cases were confirmed fungal endophthalmitis by culture (4 cases:
		"Candida parapsilosis, one case each: Fusarium, Acremonium, Candida tropicalis)"
		and five cases required secondary intraocular lens implantation. Final corrected
		visual acuity ranged from 20/20 to 40/200 by the Snellen chart. CONCLUSIONS:
		Early extensive surgical intervention and antifungal agent administration may
		result in favorable visual outcomes in patients with fungal endophthalmitis
		following cataract surgery.

TI	-	"Non-dermatophytic molds as agents of onychomycosis in Izmir, Turkey - a"
		prospective study.
PG	-	125-8
AB	-	The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of causative
		"non-dermatophytic filamentous fungi in onychomycosis. Totally 1,222 (1,222 x 3 ="
		"3,666) samples of nail scrapings from 1,146 patients (from 76 patients two"
		specimens: both from finger- and toe-nails) with prediagnosis of onychomycosis
		"sent to the Mycology Laboratory from the Clinic of Dermatology, Ege University"
		"Hospital, Izmir, Turkey, July 2001-December 2003, were prospectively studied with"
		conventional mycological procedures. The set criteria for the diagnosis of
		onychomycosis due to non-dermatophytic molds were: (1) Observation of fungal
		"elements in 15% KOH-preparations made from nail scrapings, (2) growth of the same"
		mold in all three consecutive cultures of the specimens taken three times from
		"the same patient with one-week intervals, (3) no growth of a dermatophyte or"
		yeast in three consecutive cultures. As agents of onychomycosis molds were
		"detected in 33 (9%), dermatophytes in 175 (48%), yeasts in 150 (41%), and mixed"
		"(two different fungi) in 8 (2%) patients. In cases of mold onychomycosis, 11"
		(33%) had finger-nail and 22 (67%) toe-nail infection; 25 (76%) were female and 8
		(24%) male; and 27 (82%) were above 40 years of age. The agents of mold
		"onychomycosis, in order of frequency, were Aspergillus niger (7), Acremonium spp."
		"(6), Fusarium spp. (6), Ulocladium spp. (4), sterile mycelia (2), Alternaria sp."
		"(1), Aspergillus flavus (1), Aspergillus fumigatus (1), Aspergillus terreus (1),"
		"Cladosporium sp. (1), Paecilomyces spp. (1), Scopulariopsis sp. (1) and"
		"Trichoderma sp. (1). In conclusion, this study showed that non-dermatophytic"
		molds were responsible for nearly 10% of onychomycoses cases attending the
		"dermatology outpatient clinic of a university hospital in Izmir, Turkey. Since"
		"molds are common contaminants in the laboratory, cultures from consecutively"
		taken nail scrapings should be made and carefully evaluated in order to diagnose
		"a ""mold onychomycosis""."

PG	-	1013-7

AB	-	PURPOSE: The Poisson distribution can be used to model discrete events that occur
		"infrequently in time, and it was applied, retrospectively, to recently reported"
		clusters of Fusarium keratitis. METHODS: This distribution was utilized with data
		reported from 6 geographically diverse ophthalmic centers during the worldwide
		"Fusarium keratitis epidemic of 2004-2006. The expected numbers of cases,"
		"determined from published historical data, were compared with the observed and"
		probabilities were calculated. The Poisson probabilities were also used to
		determine the numbers of cases in each cluster required to reach statistical
		significance. RESULTS: The probabilities that the numbers of cases observed in
		"the various clusters were a chance variation from the expected, and not due to an"
		"outbreak, were between 3.83 x 10(-5) and 4.72 x 10(-47). The recognition of the"
		first 2 or 3 cases in each cluster was sufficient to establish that an outbreak
		was present. CONCLUSIONS: Because these probabilities are all much less than
		"0.05, multiple Fusarium keratitis outbreaks have thus been documented. Future use"
		"of the Poisson distribution may serve as an ""early warning system"" that a new,"
		"potentially modifiable, factor may be operating to increase the occurrence of a"
		disease above its historic baseline endemic rate.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Fusariosis is an emergent opportunistic hyalohyphomycosis produced by
		fungi belonging to the genus Fusarium. These molds are capable of producing
		"life-threatening diseases in immunocompromised hosts, especially in those"
		"suffering from leukemia. It has also been described in immunocompetent patients,"
		where it usually causes non-invasive localized lesions. Fusariosis in
		immunocompromised individuals has a high morbidity and mortality mainly because
		of the low sensitivity of these fungi to the antifungal drugs available. CASE
		REPORT: We describe here the case of a patient with acute mieloblastic leukemia
		who developed fusariosis by a species of the Fusarium dimerum species complex.
		The early diagnosis was made on the basis of microscopic observation of samples
		"from cutaneous lesions, and voriconazole treatment was prescribed. A subsequent"
		complete study of the fungal isolate by culture and molecular methods allowed the
		"identification of F. dimerum, a species rarely described as a human pathogen. The"
		sensitivity of the strain was tested using the Sensititre YeastOne(®) commercial
		"system, which showed sensitivity to voriconazole and posaconazole, as well as to"
		amphotericin B. The patient died after 7 days at hospital due to an hemodynamic
		failure. CONCLUSIONS: Complete identification of new isolates of Fusarium and
		their antifungal susceptibility patterns is of high interest to improve our
		knowledge about the epidemiology of the disease and how to best manage patients.

AB	-	Keratomycosis or mycotic keratitis is recognized as one of the major causes of
		ophthalmic morbidity worldwide. The most common organisms linked to keratomycosis
		"include Candida spp., Fusarium spp., and Aspergillus spp. However, varieties of"
		saprobic fungi have been reported as causative agents of keratomycosis. Amongst
		these are members of the genus Colletotrichum. Herein we present the first
		"reported case of C. chlorophyti infection in a post-corneal transplant patient,"
		suggesting an increasing role for Colletotrichum species as emerging human
		"pathogens, particularly in the transplant population."

PG	-	163-7
LID	-	10.1002/dc.21613 [doi]
AB	-	"Infection due to Coccidioides spp., a dimorphic fungal pathogen, usually presents"
		"as a chronic pulmonary disease, occasionally with pulmonary nodules. On cytology,"
		large spherules filled with endospores are typically seen. We report an unusual
		case of coccidioidomycosis in a 39-year-old female from an area nonendemic for
		Coccidioides and without other known risk factors for infection. Fine-needle
		"aspiration of the patient's cavitary lung lesion revealed Coccidioides spp.,"
		"which demonstrated atypical delicate septate hyphal forms and chains of conidia,"
		with none of the large spherules typical of Coccidioides spp. Atypical hyphal and
		"other forms of Coccidioides spp. have been reported in several studies, primarily"
		"from biopsy or tissue resection specimens. However, this is the first case to our"
		knowledge that the organism has presented solely as conidial and atypical hyphal
		forms in an aspirated specimen. Pathologists who are unfamiliar with this
		atypical hyphal formation may misdiagnose the organism as several different
		"fungi, including Aspergillus spp. or Fusarium spp. It is important to"
		"differentiate among fungi, as antifungal treatments may vary. Cytologists should"
		be aware of the diverse morphologies demonstrated by Coccidioides spp. and
		"include this organism in their differential diagnosis, even in patients seemingly"
		devoid of pertinent risk factors.

TI	-	Great toenail onychomycosis caused by Syncephalastrum racemosum.
PG	-	7
AB	-	Nondermatophyte molds are fungi found in soil and decaying plant debris and are
		generally considered to be uncommon or secondary pathogens of diseased nails.
		Prevalence rates of onychomycoses caused by nondermatophyte molds range between
		1.45 percent and 17.60 percent. The most common nondermatophyte molds associated
		"with nail disease are Scopulariopsis, Scytalidium, Fusarium, Aspergillus and"
		"Onychocola canadensis. Syncephalastrum racemosum, a nondermatophyte mold, belongs"
		to the class Zygomycetae. Only one well-documented case of human disease
		attributed to this organism has been described. We describe a 45-year-old man
		with culture proven toenail onychomycosis due to Syncephalstrum racemosum.

TI	-	How immunocompromised are short bowel patients receiving home parenteral
		nutrition? Apropos a case of disseminated Fusarium oxysporum sepsis.
PG	-	717-20
LID	-	10.1177/0148607109346321 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Catheter-related sepsis is the most frequent complication in patients
		receiving home parenteral nutrition (HPN) for short bowel syndrome (SBS). A
		"low-grade systemic inflammatory state and an altered mucosal immune response, as"
		well as diminished intestinal barrier function have been characterized in these
		patients. The possibility of systemic immunocompromise has only recently been
		suggested. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 45-year-old female with traumatic SBS was admitted
		for possible catheter-related sepsis. She was asplenic and had insulin-dependent
		diabetes mellitus as a result of a pancreatic resection. A large skin ulceration
		"was present on her left calf, which appeared unusual for a disseminated bacterial"
		infection. Chest x-ray and computed tomography scan revealed multiple subpleural
		pulmonary infiltrates consistent with bacterial or fungal dissemination. Blood
		cultures from the port system and from the peripheral blood grew Staphylococcus
		"haemolyticus and Fusarium oxysporum. The port system was removed, and"
		"flucloxacillin and voriconazole were given for 33 and 35 days, respectively."
		Clinical signs of disseminated sepsis resolved slowly. Bone marrow biopsy ruled
		out primary hematologic disease. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Catheter-related sepsis in
		patients on HPN is usually caused by Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria or
		by Candida species. Identification of molds in blood cultures strongly suggests
		"Fusarium species, which should be treated appropriately with voriconazole or"
		amphotericin B. (2) HPN and SBS aggravated by asplenism and diabetes mellitus can
		cause severe immunocompromise. (3) Fusaria have a strong tendency to persist or
		"reappear after bone marrow transplantation, which is therefore relatively"
		contraindicated in these patients.

		"Region of West Bengal, eastern India."
PG	-	29-36
LID	-	10.3126/nepjoph.v4i1.5847 [doi]
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Corneal ulcers are the second most-common cause of preventable
		blindness after cataract in tropical developing countries. Fungal corneal ulcers
		constitute 30 to 62 % of the total microbial culture-positive corneal ulcers.
		"OBJECTIVE: To study the epidemiological characteristics, risk factors and"
		"laboratory diagnosis of fungal corneal ulcer in the Sundarban Region, West"
		"Bengal, eastern India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of 399"
		"culture-positive, fungal corneal ulcers out of a total 928 corneal ulcer patients"
		"attending a tertiary care hospital in Kolkata,eastern India, over a period of"
		four years from February 2007 to January 2011. RESULTS: Males (246; 61.65 %) were
		more commonly affected than females (P less than .0001).The affected people were
		mostly (342; 85.71 %) residing in the rural areas (P less than .0001). 196
		patients (49.12 %) were involved in agricultural activities (P less than .0001).
		"The younger people of, 21 - 50 years of age, were particularly prone to this"
		disease (269; 67.41 %). Corneal trauma (354; 88.72 %) was the commonest risk
		factor (P less than .0001) and 261 patients (61.41 %) had a history of trauma
		with vegetative matter (P less than .0001). The use of topical corticosteroids
		was implicated in 65 (16.29 %) cases. The incidence of the disease was highest in
		"the monsoon season, between June to September (192; 48.12 %). The aspergillus spp"
		"was the most common fungal growth (151; 37.84 %), followed by an Fusarium spp"
		(81; 20.3 %). CONCLUSION: The fungal corneal ulcers are an important cause of
		ocular morbidity in people residing in the Sundarban Region. The identification
		of the etiology and the predisposing factors of corneal ulcers in this region are
		important for the prevention and early treatment of the disease.

		resulting in a litany of chronic overlapping toxicities.
PG	-	747-753
LID	-	10.1177/1078155218762624 [doi]
AB	-	Voriconazole is a triazole antifungal with activity against a number of yeast and
		"mold species including Candida, Aspergillosis, Fusarium, and Coccidioides."
		"Invasive fungal infections are associated with high morbidity and mortality,"
		"prolonged treatment courses, and occasionally lifelong suppressive therapy."
		Voriconazole therapy can result in a number of acute toxicities that clinicians
		"are frequently aware of including hepatotoxicity, visual disturbances, and"
		"hallucinations; however, there is limited experience with extended durations of"
		voriconazole therapy. We describe the case of a 62-year-old man who developed
		Coccidioides meningitis as a result of prolonged neutropenia from treatment for
		chronic lymphocytic leukemia. He was initially treated with a number of different
		"antifungal agents including voriconazole, liposomal amphotericin B, fluconazole,"
		"and itraconazole; however, he developed acute toxicity due to those agents. He"
		"was successfully re-challenged with voriconazole, and maintained therapeutic"
		serum concentrations throughout treatment. As a result of prolonged voriconazole
		"exposure of over 14 years, he has suffered a number of toxicities, most"
		"significantly including actinic keratosis, squamous cell carcinoma, and skeletal"
		"fluorosis. To our knowledge, this is the longest continuous use of voriconazole"
		therapy currently in the literature.

AB	-	Fungal infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients during
		chemotherapeutic treatments and malignant hematologic disease. We present a case
		of a double fungal infection with disseminated Acremonium strictum (A. strictum)
		and pulmonary Aspergillus fumigatus (A. fumigatus) and its rapid clinical course.
		A 17-year-old boy with prolonged neutropenia developed a disseminated fungal

PG	-	941-7
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical presentation and course of patients who
		developed keratitis due to Fusarium while wearing nontherapeutic soft contact
		"lenses. METHODS: A retrospective review of microbiologic records from January 1,"
		"2004, through April 15, 2006, was performed, identifying all patients with"
		corneal ulceration and a culture positive for Fusarium species. Medical records
		"of 34 patients were reviewed for clinical characteristics, treatment regimens,"
		and microbiologic features. RESULTS: The most common antimicrobial medications
		administered prior to Fusarium diagnosis were antibacterials in 31 of 34
		patients. No distinct preponderance of any one brand of either contact lens or
		solution was identified. The microbiologic corneal cultures found Fusarium
		"oxysporum in 20 cases, Fusarium solani in 3 cases, Fusarium species not further"
		"identifiable in 10 cases, and no growth in 1 case. Patients with a delayed onset"
		of treatment had a tendency for prolonged treatment until cure. CONCLUSIONS:
		Fusarium has previously been an unusual organism in the etiology of infectious
		keratitis in the setting of nontherapeutic soft contact lens wear. A delay in
		proper diagnosis and intervention may contribute to a prolonged treatment course.
		The microbial spectrum of contact lens-related keratitis may be evolving with
		higher participation of Fusarium species compared with prior reports.

TI	-	Systemic ketoconazole treatment for Fusarium leg ulcers.
PG	-	511-2
AB	-	Fusarium oxysporum was isolated from a large foot ulcer in an otherwise healthy
		"69-year-old man. Although tissue invasion could not be proven histologically,"
		systemic antifungal treatment was administered with satisfactory response.
		Fusarium species are common soil-inhabiting organisms and plant pathogens. In
		"humans, Fusarium is considered an opportunistic agent in skin ulcers,"
		"interdigital spaces, and burned skin, but can also cause mycotic keratitis,"
		"onychomycosis, and rarely deep-seated or disseminated infections, especially in"
		an immunocompromised host. The distinction between skin infection and saprophytic
		"growth, as well as optimal treatment regimens for the two types of infection,"
		have not been clearly defined. We describe a case of leg ulcers caused by
		Fusarium oxysporum in a 69-year-old man treated successfully with oral
		"ketoconazole. ""Silent"" immunologic disturbances were found in this apparently"
		healthy patient. The case illustrates a relatively benign infection caused by
		Fusarium that responded to systemic antifungal drug treatment.

AB	-	PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of rose bengal PDAT for the management of a
		patient with multidrug-resistant Fusarium keratoplasticum keratitis unresponsive
		to standard clinical treatment. METHODS: This case report presents a clinical
		case of F. keratoplasticum keratitis not responsive to standard medical care. In
		vitro studies from patients culture isolated responded to rose bengal PDAT.
		Patient received two treatments with rose bengal 0.1% and exposure to green light
		with a total energy of 2.7 J/cm. RESULTS: In vitro results demonstrated the
		efficacy of rose bengal PDAT a multidrug-resistant F. keratoplasticum species.
		There was complete fungal inhibition in our irradiation zone on the agar plates.
		"In the clinical case, the patient was successfully treated with 2 sessions of"
		"rose bengal PDAT, and at 8-month follow-up, there was neither recurrence of"
		infection nor adverse effects to report. CONCLUSIONS: Rose bengal PDAT is a novel
		treatment that may be considered in cases of aggressive infectious keratitis.
		Further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms of PDAT in vivo.

TI	-	Allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis caused by Fusarium vasinfectum.
PG	-	1379-81
AB	-	We present a case of allergic bronchopulmonary fusariosis (ABPF). This is the
		first case of allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis (ABPM) caused by Fusarium
		vasinfectum reported in the medical literature. The patient presented with a
		history and radiographic picture highly suggestive of allergic bronchopulmonary
		"aspergillosis (ABPA), yet with negative ABPA serology results. The demonstration"
		"of a positive skin test and precipitins against F. vasinfectum, elevated serum"
		"IgG and IgE antibodies against F. vasinfectum, and a decline in total serum IgE"
		with treatment clearly establish the diagnosis of ABPF. The diagnosis of ABPM
		caused by organisms other than Aspergillus represents an important consideration
		in patients who appear clinically to have ABPA but whose serology results do not
		"confirm this diagnosis. As in ABPA, early diagnosis and appropriate therapy may"
		be necessary in order to prevent progressive lung disease.

TI	-	Organism isolation in corneal ulcer: utility of different techniques.
PG	-	14-9
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Various techniques are available for isolation of microorganism in
		"cases of microbial keratitis including conventional methods of scraping,"
		re-scraping inoculation in different media and corneal biopsy. METHODS: This was
		a cross sectional descriptive study conducted from February 2002 to July 2003. A
		total of 161 eyes of corneal ulcers were evaluated with scraping inoculation.
		Re-scraping and corneal biopsy were performed in those cases which did not grow
		any organism in the first scraping or which did not respond to initial treatment.
		RESULTS: Microorganisms were isolated in 116 patients (72.04%) after first
		"scraping. S pneumoniae was seen in 50(42%), Fusarium in 21(18%) and Aspergillus"
		in 16(14%) cases. Re-scraping was done in 22 culture negative and non improving
		"cases of which 14 (63.63%) showed isolation of organisms. After re-scraping,"
		Fusarium and Aspergillus were isolated in four patients each (18% each) followed
		"by S. pneumoniae in 3 (14%), S. aureus in 2 (9%), and Penicillium in 1(5%) case."
		Corneal biopsy was done in 10 cases with isolation of microbial agents in 7 (70%)
		"with Aspergillus and S. aureus in three each, and S. epidermidis in 1(10%)."
		"CONCLUSIONS: Apart from conventional scraping, other isolation techniques should"
		be considered in the treatment of non-responding and culture negative cases of
		"corneal ulcers. Compared to bacteria, fungi are difficult to isolate in the first"
		scraping and requires more frequent repeat scraping and corneal biopsy.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Filamentous fungi are ubiquitous in plants, water, and soil. The"
		predominant fungi that infect the human cornea include Fusarium and Aspergillus
		"species. The onset of fungal endophthalmitis is indolent, and typically takes"
		weeks to months to develop after corneal infection. We report a case of Fusarium
		infection complicating rheumatic keratitis that acutely progressed to
		endophthalmitis during intravenous tocilizumab therapy. CASE PRESENTATION: A
		65-year-old female patient was referred to our department due to pain and
		decreased vision in her left eye. Slit-lamp examination showed a white focus on
		"the upper peripheral cornea, hypopyon, anterior chamber fibrin formation, marked"
		"ciliary hyperemia, and whole corneal epithelial defects. As the corneal scraping"
		smear was positive for filamentous fungi and Fusarium species were detected by
		"aqueous humor polymerase chain reaction, anti-fungal therapy was started."
		"Although the initial response to anti-fungal therapy was good, we observed"
		"corneal infiltration, worsening hypopyon, and vitreous opacity after tocilizumab"
		infusion. Given that the infection continued to progress despite conservative
		"therapy, we performed penetrating keratoplasty combined with vitrectomy. After"
		"removal of the white focus beneath the intraocular lens, a temporary corneal"
		"prosthesis was mounted and the dense vitreous opacity was removed. Finally, a"
		"frozen donor graft was sutured in place. The corneal infiltration, hypopyon, and"
		vitreous opacity all disappeared after the operation. CONCLUSION: The rapid
		progression of Fusarium keratitis to endophthalmitis in a patient who was
		receiving a regular infusion of tocilizumab demonstrates that ocular condition
		should be closely monitored during systemic tocilizumab administration due to
		increased risk of infection.

TI	-	Evaluation of Fusarium solani hyphae and conidia susceptibility to amphotericin B
		and itraconazole: study of a clinical case.
PG	-	291-6
AB	-	Fusarium species are hyaline moulds belonging to the hyalohyphomycosis group that
		are usually found in the soil and plants. This organism has emerged as a cause of
		disseminated invasive disease. The correlation between in vitro value and
		clinical efficacy is low and many patients remain unresponsive to treatment
		despite in vitro susceptibility. We determined growth control for Fusarium solani
		using the BioCell-Tracer system that measures the growth rate of a single fungal
		"hypha, and the effect of different concentrations of amphotericin B and"
		itraconazole. The MIC for these two drugs was also determined by a broth
		"microdilution technique, using RPMI 1640. Different MICs for amphotericin B were"
		obtained by the two different methods. This paper describes a case of infection
		"due to Fusarium solani in an allogeneic bone marrow transplanted patient, the"
		"microbiological diagnostic, antifungal susceptibility tests for conidia and hypha"
		and clinical correlation.

PG	-	308-12
LID	-	10.1080/09546630801974912 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: The aims of our study were to ascertain the proportion of Fusarium
		"onychomycosis among patients with suspected onychomycosis, to record clinical"
		features and to assess the efficacy of itraconazole pulse therapy in treatment.
		METHODS: Six patients with positive isolates of Fusarium sp were treated in an
		"open, prospective manner with itraconazole: two pulses for fingernails and three"
		pulses for toenails. Significant growth of Fusarium sp was considered when both
		microscopy of direct mounts in KOH and culture were positive for mold. Efficacy
		parameters were mycological cure and clinical cure. Mycological cure was negative
		direct microscopy (KOH) and culture. Clinical cure was complete absence of signs
		of onychomycosis. RESULTS: Prevalence of Fusarium onychomycosis was 6.25%
		(8/128). Three women and three men were studied. All had bilateral big toenails
		involved which were of the distal and lateral onychomycosis. Three of them had
		associated fingernail onychomycosis with periungual inflammation. All our
		"patients were immunocompetent. At month 12 from the start of treatment,"
		mycological cure was 100% while only three out of five patients showed normal
		nail growth and clinical cure. There were no significant clinical or laboratory
		adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: Our data reconfirmed that Fusarium nail infections
		are difficult to eradicate. Since the therapeutic reservoir in toenails is 11
		"months, these patients should be followed up for a total of 12 months before"
		coming to the final conclusion.

AB	-	Fungal rhinosinusitis is being recognized and reported with increasing frequency
		over the last two decades worldwide. Intracranial extension is the most dreaded
		complication of fungal sinusitis with high mortality rates. We report a case of
		"chronic rhinosinusitis in a 55-year-old diabetic male, caused by Fusarium"
		species. The patient was diagnosed as a case of chronic left maxillary sinusitis
		with cavernous sinus thrombosis. The sinus lavage showed fungal elements on
		direct microscopic examination and culture revealed growth of Fusarium species
		within 4 days of incubation. Conservative therapy with IV amphotericin B resulted
		in favorable outcome of the patient. This is an extremely rare case where
		cavernous sinus thrombosis occurred as a complication secondary to Fusarium
		species rhinosinusitis.

LID	-	10.1159/000277762 [doi]
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Dermatophytes are the main cause of onychomycoses, but various"
		non-dermatophyte filamentous fungi are often isolated from abnormal nails.
		OBJECTIVE: Our aim was the in situ identification of the fungal infectious agent
		in 8 cases of onychomycoses which could not be cured after systemic terbinafine
		"and itraconazole treatment. METHODS: Fungal DNA was extracted from nail samples,"
		and infectious fungi were identified by restriction fragment length polymorphism
		(RFLP) of amplified fungal ribosomal DNA using a previously described PCR/RFLP
		assay. RESULTS: PCR/RFLP identification of fungi in nails allows the
		"identification of the infectious agent: Fusarium sp., Acremonium sp. and"
		"Aspergillus sp. were found as a sole infectious agent in 5, 2 and 1 cases,"
		respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Fusarium spp. and other non-dermatophyte filamentous
		fungi are especially difficult to cure in onychomycoses utilising standard
		treatment with terbinafine and itraconazole. PCR fungal identification helps
		demonstrate the presence of moulds in order to prescribe alternative antifungal
		treatments.

		acute myeloid leukaemia relapsed after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
		transplantation: a case report and literature review.

LID	-	S1130-1406(12)00060-5 [pii]
LID	-	10.1016/j.riam.2012.05.003 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Fusarium species are among the leading fungal pathogens to cause
		invasive mould infections in patients with hematopoietic malignancy. The Fusarium
		"species most frequently involved in human infections are Fusarium solani,"
		"Fusarium oxysporum and Fusarium verticillioides. However, identification is a"
		cumbersome and time-consuming task. Fusarium is resistant in vitro to many of the
		antifungal agents and the management of fusariosis is not well defined.
		OBJECTIVES: To emphasise the difficulty of identifying Fusarium spp. by
		conventional methods and the need of new rapid molecular tests to achieve earlier
		diagnosis and appropriate therapy. METHODS: A disseminated Fusarium infection due
		to F. verticillioides was documented in a neutropenic refractory patient with
		"acute myeloid leukaemia, relapsed after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell"
		transplantation. RESULTS: The patient died despite liposomal amphotericin B and
		"voriconazole combination and ""in vitro"" susceptibility of agents employed."
		Morphological and molecular identification of F. verticillioides was obtained
		only after the death of the patient. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the poor
		outcome of an invasive fungal disease caused by Fusarium in aplastic patients.
		Identification of members of Fusarium genus remains restricted to selected
		laboratories and should be introduced into routine mycological diagnostics. In
		"immunocompromised patients, diagnosis of fusariosis is directly related to prompt"
		diagnosis and to patient's status. Current diagnosis methods and therapeutic
		options are discussed.

AB	-	Subcutaneous mycoses are a group of fungal infections of dermis and subcutaneous
		"tissue which consist of sporotrichosis, chromoblastomycosis, phaeohyphomycosis,"
		"hyalohyphomycosis, mycetoma, subcutaneous zygomycosis, rhinosporidiosis,"
		lobomycosis and disseminated penicilliosis. A total of 46 consecutive patients

		know the prevalence of subcutaneous mycoses in this eastern part of Assam. Direct
		"microscopy in 10 and 40 % KOH, histopathological examination of biopsied tissue,"
		colony characteristics on Sabourauds dextrose agar media both at 25 and 37 °C and
		detailed morphology of each fungus on lactophenol cotton blue mount were the

		"% (n = 15) cases. Out of 15 positive cases of subcutaneous mycoses,"
		"chromoblastomycosis was detected in six cases (n = 40 %), hyalohyphomycosis in"
		"three cases (n = 20 %), and lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis, disseminated"
		"penicilliosis and mycetoma in two cases each (n = 13.3 % each). In this study,"
		seven different species of fungus were found to be responsible for five different
		"clinical types of subcutaneous mycosis. Cladosporium cladosporioides, Bipolaris"
		"spicifera and Curvularia lunata were responsible for chromoblastomycosis,"
		"Fusarium oxysporum and Aspergillus terreus for hyalohyphomycosis, C. lunata for"
		"mycetoma, Sporothrix schenckii for lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis and Penicillium"
		marneffei for disseminated penicilliosis. C. cladosporioides and C. lunata were
		the commonest black fungi causing subcutaneous mycosis in this sub-Himalayan
		"belt. Rare species C. cladosporioides, B. spicifera and C. lunata were found to"
		be causing chromoblastomycosis in this study.

AB	-	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Fusarium species is an opportunistic mold that causes
		disseminated infections in immunocompromised patients. Given the high mortality
		"rate of this infection, it is important to make a definite diagnosis when"
		"encountering suspected cases. CASE REPORT: Herein, we presented a 35-year-old man"
		diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia with a prolonged febrile neutropenic period
		"and ecthyma gangrenosum-like lesions, along with fungemia and disseminated"
		"fusariosis. The patient died despite receiving combination therapy, perhaps due"
		to the nonrecovery of neutrophil. CONCLUSION: Ecthyma gangrenosum-like lesions
		"due to disseminated fusariosis might be easily misdiagnosed. Consequently, more"
		attention should be paid to the cutaneous lesions in immunocompromised patients.

PG	-	292-5
LID	-	10.1097/MPH.0b013e31819b9d01 [doi]
AB	-	A 9-year-old girl was managed according to the COPRALL 04 protocol for treatment
		of a relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Owing to a previous case of
		"disseminated fusariosis, posaconazole was started 5 days before initiation of"
		"chemotherapy. Six days after the last dose of vincristine, the child reported"
		"symptoms of severe peripheral neuropathy, abdominal cramps, and constipation."
		"After this, she developed fluctuations in her level of consciousness and"
		"seizures. After cessation of therapy with posaconazole, a complete resolution of"
		the above occurred within 7 days. This case illustrates the possibility of
		vincristine toxicity exacerbated by coadministration of posaconazole. As
		"posaconazole is an inhibitor of the isoenzyme CYP3A4, interactions with drugs"
		"that are metabolized via this pathway, such as vincristine, can be anticipated."
		"Another possibility is that, like itraconazole, posaconazole may also inhibit"
		P-glycoprotein-mediated vincristine efflux. Although case reports of
		neurotoxicity owing to possible interaction between itraconazole and vincristine
		"exist in the literature, only 1 case report relating to the possible interaction"
		between posaconazole and vincristine exists. Clinicians should be made aware of
		this possible drug-drug interaction.

PG	-	e44-7
AB	-	Fungi are an important and common cause of cutaneous infections affecting solid
		organ transplant recipients. These infections can represent a primary site of
		"infection with the potential for dissemination, or a manifestation of metastatic"
		infection. The high morbidity and mortality associated with these infections
		"necessitates urgent therapy with antifungal drugs; however, the interaction"
		between these drugs and immunosuppressive therapies can be a major limitation
		because of drug toxicity. A case of soft tissue infection of the toe caused by
		Fusarium chlamydosporum and Candida guilliermondii in a liver transplant patient
		"on sirolimus, who was successfully treated with the new antifungal agent"
		"posaconazole, is described. The pharmacokinetic interactions of sirolimus and the"
		"new triazoles, and their impact on treatment choices are briefly discussed."

		therapy is unclear. We retrospectively analyzed 534 hematologic patients treated
		"with echinocandin (caspofungin, N = 55; micafungin, N = 306; anidulafungin,"
		"N = 173). Four proven IFDs were found, caused by Candida parapsilosis (N = 2), C."
		"parapsilosis and Candida glabrata (N = 1), and Fusarium species (N = 1). Four"
		"cases of possible IFDs were observed, all showing pulmonary infection. One case"
		showed features suggestive of hepatosplenic candidiasis. Six of these eight cases
		had previously received the purine analog clofarabine. Breakthrough IFD during
		"echinocandin treatment occurred infrequently (1.5 %), caused predominantly by"
		Candida species. Clofarabine usage was an important risk factor.

AB	-	We report a patient with fungal keratitis caused by a multiresistant Fusarium
		solani in a tertiary care hospital located in southern Brazil. A 55-year-old man
		with a history of ocular trauma presented with keratitis in left eye. The patient
		has a complicated clinical course and failed to respond to local and systemic
		"antifungal treatment, and required eye enucleation. Despite multiple topical,"
		"intraocular and systemic antifungal treatments, hyphal infiltration persisted in"
		the corneal transplant causing continuous recurrences. The cultures of corneal
		biopsy scrapings were positive for Fusarium spp. The organism was identified to
		species level by multi-locus sequencing for translation elongation factor 1 alpha
		"(EF-1α), and RNA polymerase II subunit (RPB2). In vitro antifungal susceptibility"
		"testing of the isolate by the broth microdilution method, according to CLSI"
		"M38-A2, disclosed susceptibility to natamycin and resistance to amphotericin B,"
		"voriconazole, itraconazole and fluconazole. Considering previous unsuccessful"
		"antifungal treatments due to multiple drug resistance, the eye was enucleated."
		Our case report illustrates that management of fungal keratitis remains a
		therapeutic challenge. Optimal treatment for F. solani infection has not yet been
		established and should include susceptibility testing for different antifungal
		agents.

AB	-	The application of plant growth-promoting (PGP) bacterium in agriculture is
		"expanding rapidly in recent years. With the development of microbial technology,"
		new bacterial species effective in promoting plant growth have been identified.
		"In this study, a PGP bacterium was isolated from marine sediments of the Yellow"
		Sea in China. The confrontation culture test and pot experiments showed that
		strain YH-07(T) inhibited the growth of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (a
		"plant pathogenic fungus), benefiting plant growth and reducing disease incidence"
		"of tomato wilt. We used polyphasic approaches including phenotypic,"
		chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic information to determine its taxonomic status. In
		"addition to profiling general features of the YH-07(T) genome, we identified"
		genes related to PGP traits and genes involved in environmental stress tolerance.
		"Metabolic assays showed that strain YH-07(T) could produce siderophores,"
		"solubilize phosphate, resist to salinity, and grow well within a wide range of"
		"temperature and pH, which is a promising PGP bacterium for future agricultural"
		applications. These results provide evidence that strain YH-07(T) is a novel
		"species of the genus Erythrobacter, for which the name Erythrobacter aureus sp."
		nov. is proposed. The type strain is YH-07(T) (= CGMCC 1.16784(T) = DSM
		107319(T)).

AB	-	PURPOSE: To report the case of an immunocompetent adult presenting with
		endogenous Fusarium endophthalmitis. OBSERVATIONS: A woman in her thirties
		presented with symptoms and signs of a unilateral anterior uveitis. After initial
		"improvement with topical corticosteroids, she continued to develop a panuveitis"
		with an associated drop in vision to counting fingers. A vitreous biopsy
		confirmed Fusarium solani by 18S rRNA fungal gene detection and PCR sequencing.
		"Despite treatment with pars plana vitrectomy, intravitreal amphotericin B and"
		systemic voriconazole her visual outcome was poor. Detailed review of her
		antecedent history revealed the route of acquisition to be a thorn prick to the
		hand two weeks prior to presentation. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPORTANCE: This patient's
		endophthalmitis most likely resulted from cutaneous inoculation of Fusarium
		solani with subsequent hematogenous spread. Endogenous Fusarium endophthalmitis
		is well recognized in the immunocompromised but is very rarely seen in the
		immunocompetent. This case highlights the importance of thorough history-taking
		and consideration of fungal endophthalmitis in the differential diagnosis of a
		treatment-refractory uveitis.

PG	-	103-8
AB	-	Seventy-two patients with haematological malignancies were treated
		prophylactically with itraconazole during remission induction therapy. The
		"incidence of proven fungal infections was 18%, of which 12.5% were fatal."
		"Aspergillus, Torulopsis and Candida proved to be major invasive pathogens. Plasma"
		levels of itraconazole were monitored for all patients. The occurrence of fungal
		infection is significantly greater in the group where no therapeutic plasma
		levels were obtained during at least two weeks. There is a clear need to obtain
		quick information on itraconazole plasma levels in order to adapt dosage during
		prophylactic treatment in immunocompromised patients. The influence of
		itraconazole on liver function tests could not be separated from concomitant
		cytostatic or antibiotic treatment. No jaundice directly related to itraconazole
		could be found. During itraconazole prophylaxis a shift from classic pathogens
		"such as Aspergillus and Candida, to Fusarium, Torulopsis and Mucor, may be seen."

TI	-	Skin Microvascular Thrombosis in Fusarium Infection in Two Early Biopsied Cases.
PG	-	76-81
AB	-	Fusarium species cause rare and severe infections. Their incidence is increasing
		in immunocompromised patients but they are also observed in healthy hosts.
		Because of the rapid dissemination of infection and the frequent resistance of
		"Fusarium species to antifungal drugs, histopathologic evidence of hyphae is very"
		helpful to obtain the diagnosis rapidly. We report the clinical and pathological
		features of two patients with initial cutaneous lesions. Cutaneous early biopsies
		showed microvessel involvement with hyphae and thrombosis. Fusarium infection was
		confirmed by skin culture. Hyphae within a microvessel thrombus in the skin were
		highly suggestive of disseminated fungal infection. These pathological features
		enabled to establish an early diagnosis and to start efficient antifungal
		"treatment. In early cutaneous biopsies of immunocompromised patients, the"
		presence of cutaneous vessel thrombosis can suggest a fungal infection and may
		help to start specific therapy without delay for these life-threatening
		infections.

		molecular identification and susceptibility patterns.
PG	-	233-7
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-012-9542-y [doi]
AB	-	Fungal keratitis is a rare but sight-threatening infection of the cornea that may
		be caused by several fungal pathogens. A delay in diagnosis and inadequate
		treatment may even lead to loss of the affected eye. Fungal keratitis is often
		misdiagnosed as bacterial keratitis because isolation and identification of the
		"fungal pathogen is difficult and requires experience, and fungal growth in"
		"culture requires time. In this report, a 14-year-old boy with recalcitrant"
		"Fusarium solani keratitis, unresponsive to initial therapy, is presented. CLSI"
		M38-A2 in vitro antifungal susceptibility tests demonstrated that only
		"amphotericin B (0.5 μg/ml) had potent activity against F. solani; however,"
		"fluconazole (>64 μg/ml), itraconazole (>16 μg/ml), voriconazole (8 μg/ml), and"
		"posaconazole (>16 μg/ml) had high minimum inhibitory concentrations. In addition,"
		caspofungin (>16 μg/ml) and anidulafungin (>16 μg/ml) exhibited high minimum
		"effective concentrations. Repeated intrastromal voriconazole injections, topical"
		"voriconazole, and caspofungin combined with systemic antifungal agents improved"
		of the corneal lesion with a significant increase in visual acuity. Intrastromal
		voriconazole injection may be used as an adjunctive treatment method for
		recalcitrant fungal keratitis with no prominent complications. The intrastromal
		"route could be an effective route of administration of antifungal agents,"
		"especially for F. solani keratitis, as in this case. A combination of various"
		antifungal agents administered by different routes prevented loss of the eye.

TI	-	Clinical triad with multi-biopsy histopathology as a reliable diagnostic marker
		of mycetomas: a retrospective review from a tertiary care center.
PG	-	88-96
LID	-	10.1111/ijd.16384 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Mycetoma is a neglected tropical infectious disease which runs a
		prolonged and protracted course. Microbiological confirmation is diagnostic yet
		unreliable due to poor sensitivity and variable availability of culture
		facilities in resource poor settings. METHODS: A retrospective review was
		"performed on electronic records (histopathology, microbiology, and radiology) of"
		all patients who underwent skin biopsies with mycetoma as one of the clinical
		differential diagnoses from year 2016 to 2020. RESULTS: Out of 73 patients
		"biopsied with a differential of mycetoma, 42 fit the clinical triad of"
		"swelling-sinuses-granules. After clinical, microbiological, pathological, and"
		"radiological correlation, 31 cases were of eumycetoma and seven were of"
		actinomycetoma. Mean patient age was 37.58 ± 13.8 years with a male to female
		ratio 2.45 : 1 and mean disease duration of 11.31 ± 10.9 years. Histopathological
		findings revealed fungal hyphae in 18 cases and gram-positive bacteria in six
		cases. Fungal culture was positive in 13 cases with the three commonest organisms
		"being Madurella mycetomatis in five cases, Fusarium and Aspergillus nidulans in"
		"two cases each. X-ray changes of soft tissue, bones, and joints were seen in 25"
		"cases, and ""dot-in-circle"" sign was seen in eight of nine MRIs. CONCLUSION:"
		"Eumycetoma was more common than actinomycetoma in our setup, ratio being"
		"4.43 : 1. A clinical triad of swelling, multiple sinuses and grainy discharge"
		with any one diagnostic support (histopathology/radiology) is sufficient to make
		a definitive diagnosis of mycetoma in the absence of microbiological
		identification.

		imagery and specific Mucorales qPCR which was treated with liposomal amphotericin
		"B and posaconazole. Twenty days later, a blood culture was positive for Fusarium"
		"solani, and disseminated cutaneous lesions appeared. The antifungal treatment was"

PG	-	738-41
AB	-	A case of Fusarium solani osteomyelitis is reported in a previously healthy adult
		male who received multiple injuries during an automobile accident. Combined
		histologic and mycologic data proved it to be a case of hyalohyphomycosis
		"resulting from Fusarium. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first"
		reported case of osteomyelitis resulting from F. solani. A concurrent case of
		saprophytic wound colonization by the same organism is reported in another
		patient in the same ward who had sustained similar injuries. Evidence suggests
		that this represents nosocomial spread from the first case.

TI	-	Diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis by a commercial real-time PCR assay for
		Aspergillus DNA in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from high-risk patients
		compared to a galactomannan enzyme immunoassay.
PG	-	4273-8
LID	-	10.1128/JCM.05026-11 [doi]
AB	-	Culture-independent molecular techniques such as real-time PCRs offer the
		"potential for early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA), thereby reducing"
		the disease-associated mortality rate. PCR-based testing is presently excluded
		from disease-defining consensus criteria due to lack of standardization and
		clinical validation. A single-center prospective study was conducted to
		investigate the performance of the commercially available MycAssay Aspergillus
		"test for detecting Aspergillus DNA in patients with suspicion of IA. To this end,"
		a total of 158 bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid specimens that were
		consecutively collected from hematology (n = 68) and intensive care unit (n = 90)
		patients were examined. Sixteen of 17 (94.1%) specimens from patients with
		"proven/probable IA were MycAssay positive, and 15 of these 16 patients were also"
		"positive by an ""in-house"" PCR assay. A total of 139 of 141 (98.6%) specimens from"
		patients without proven/probable IA were MycAssay negative. Fifteen of 16 (94.1%)
		MycAssay-positive patients were also positive for BAL fluid galactomannan (GM) at
		"an index cutoff of ≥1.0 (index range, 1.1 to 8.3), as were 3 patients without IA"
		"but with pulmonary fusariosis. Interestingly, in seven of the PCR-positive BAL"
		"specimens that tested culture positive for Aspergillus species, cycle threshold"
		values were earlier than those of specimens with a culture-negative result. In
		"conclusion, the MycAssay Aspergillus PCR appears to be a sensitive and specific"
		"molecular test for the diagnosis of IA, and its performance is comparable to that"
		"of the GM assay. However, more large studies are necessary to firmly establish"
		its clinical utility in high-risk settings.

		Home Environment: A Case Report.
PG	-	150-3
LID	-	10.1159/000377631 [doi]
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is a rare, non-IgE-mediated"
		inflammatory lung disease caused by inhalational exposure to various antigens
		"found in occupational, avocational and home environments. The prognosis is"
		"favorable with early detection and prompt removal of the causative agent, and"
		fatalities are unusual. We present a fatal case of HP caused by chronic exposure
		to Fusarium vasinfectum mold in the home. CASE REPORT: A 37-year-old white male
		"presented with a 6-month history of progressively worsening dyspnea, cough,"
		"weight loss and fatigue associated with the self-renovation of his water-damaged,"
		"mold-infested mobile home. Evaluation included a physical examination (hypoxia,"
		"inspiratory crackles and expiratory rhonchi), baseline pulmonary function testing"
		"(mixed obstructive/restrictive pattern), chest computed tomography"
		"(bronchiectasis, fibrosis and diffuse interstitial involvement), bronchoalveolar"
		"lavage (macrophages 20%, lymphocytes 28% and neutrophils 52%) and transbronchial"
		biopsy (interstitial fibrosis and chronic inflammatory infiltrate). Mold culture
		from the home grew out F. vasinfectum. An Ouchterlony double diffusion technique
		documented high antibody titer to F. vasinfectum. Despite aggressive intravenous
		"corticosteroid treatment, the patient's lung function declined to the extent that"
		"he could not be removed from ventilator support following an open lung biopsy,"
		eventually resulting in death. CONCLUSION: This is the first reported case of
		fatal HP related to an acute exacerbation of a chronic form of HP following
		"continuous and intense exposure to F. vasinfectum. Although uncommon, a high"
		index of suspicion for HP is necessary in patients with progressive respiratory
		symptoms and known environmental antigen exposure. With early detection and
		"prompt removal of the causative antigen, HP prognosis is generally favorable, but"
		can progress to fatal disease with continued exposure.

TI	-	Effect of voriconazole on a corneal abscess caused by fusarium.
PG	-	762-4
AB	-	PURPOSE: To describe a case of corneal abscess caused by Fusarium solani that did
		not respond to common antifungal agents. METHOD: Case report. RESULTS: Twenty
		"days after accidental contact with vegetation, a 56-year-old man presented with a"
		corneal abscess. Corneal ulceration developed and a perforating keratoplasty was
		"performed. After a microbiological examination, the diagnosis of F. solani"
		infection was made. Systemic and topical amphotericin B and fluconazole were
		"prescribed, with no results. A new abscess formed on the transplanted graft and a"
		wound leak developed. We administered topical and systemic voriconazole. No
		side-effects were observed. The choroidal detachment and the surgical transplant
		recovered completely in 20 days. A vascular leukoma developed at the site of the
		"transplanted corneal abscess. CONCLUSION: From a functional point of view,"
		another corneal transplant will be necessary. Voriconazole was effective in
		treating a severe keratomycosis caused by F. solani that was resistant to other
		topical and systemic antifungal agents.

AB	-	To report an outbreak of Fusarium solani endophthalmitis after uneventful
		cataract surgeries performed on the same day in the same operating room. Nine
		patients underwent phacoemulsification at 4th Clinic of Beyoglu Eye Training and
		Research Hospital in Istanbul. Cefuroxime axetyl was injected intracamerally from
		the same vial to all patients at the end of surgery. All patients developed acute
		"postoperative endophthalmitis. Presentation, cultural studies, treatment,"
		clinical responses and risk factors were evaluated. Cultural and DNA sequence
		findings revealed F. solani. Antifungal therapy was begun and pars plana
		"vitrectomy, intraocular lens and capsule extraction were performed. Corneal"
		involvement was correlated with old age and systemic disease. Fusarium solani
		should be considered in acute postoperative endophthalmitis. This infection can
		be controlled with early and aggressive combined antifungal and surgical
		treatment. The patients with corneal involvement had poor prognosis. It is
		important to use solutions prepared separately for each patient.

AB	-	Pulmonary mycosis is seen infrequently in our country. It is more common in the
		immunocompromised. The infections caused by less known species like Fusarium have
		been found to be increasing in incidence in other parts of the world. We hereby
		"report its occurrence in a 79-year-old, non-immunocompromised female who"
		presented with pyrexia of unknown origin. Her Alanine Phosphatase (ALP) and
		Lactate Dehydrogenase (LHD) levels were raised. CT scan showed interstitial
		thickening in subpleural aspect of lungs and multiple enlarged lymph nodes in
		mediastinum. Liver showed multiple hypodense lesions. Metastasis was suspected
		for which Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) of liver was done which showed
		foci of regenerative hepatocytes with desmoplastic stromal tissue fragments and
		negative for tumour. Her Alpha Fetoprotein (AFP) was normal. The bronchial tree
		"cytology showed endobronchial cells, dust-laden macrophages and chronic"
		inflammatory cells along with fungi on Pap smear studies. This was confirmed by
		culture that grew Fusarium species. after one week of incubation. The acutely
		branching septate hyphae of Fusarium species are identical to those of
		Aspergillus species. In a patient who has a disseminated infection with a septate
		"fungus, growth in culture is important to identify the specific organism and"
		"subsequently treatment with appropriate antifungals. In cases like ours, where"
		"the infection simulates malignancy, it is even more important to make the correct"
		diagnosis to give the appropriate treatment.

AB	-	Fusarium is a saprophytic and opportunistic pathogen that can cause local tissue

TI	-	Fungal infections in marrow transplant recipients under antifungal prophylaxis
		with fluconazole.
PG	-	789-98
AB	-	Fungal infection is one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality
		in bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients. The growing incidence of these
		"infections is related to several factors including prolonged granulocytopenia,"
		"use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, conditioning regimens, and use of"
		immunosuppression to avoid graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). In the present
		"series, we report five cases of invasive mold infections documented among 64 BMT"
		recipients undergoing fluconazole antifungal prophylaxis: 1) A strain of
		Scedosporium prolificans was isolated from a skin lesion that developed on day
		+72 after BMT in a chronic myeloid leukemic patient. 2) Invasive pulmonary
		aspergillosis (Aspergillus fumigatus) was diagnosed on day +29 in a patient with
		a long period of hospitalization before being transplanted for severe aplastic
		anemia. 3) A tumoral lung lesion due to Rhizopus arrhizus (zygomycosis) was
		observed in a transplanted patient who presented severe chronic GvHD. 4) A
		"tumoral lesion due to Aspergillus spp involving the 7th, 8th and 9th right ribs"
		and local soft tissue was diagnosed in a BMT patient on day +110. 5) A patient
		with a history of Ph1-positive acute lymphocytic leukemia exhibited a cerebral
		lesion on day +477 after receiving a BMT during an episode of severe chronic
		"GvHD. At that time, blood and spinal fluid cultures yielded Fusarium sp."
		Opportunistic infections due to fungi other than Candida spp are becoming a major
		problem among BMT patients receiving systemic antifungal prophylaxis with
		fluconazole.

PG	-	107-14
AB	-	A retrospective study was conducted in France to investigate Fusarium infections
		which are now recognized as emerging opportunistic infections. The clinical and
		mycological findings for 31 cases diagnosed between 1984 and 1993 by members of
		the French Groupe d'Etudes des Mycoses Opportunistes were analysed. All suffered
		"from haematological disease, most often acute leucaemia (n = 19). Twenty-two had"
		received cytostatic chemotherapy and ten had undergone bone marrow
		transplantation. Prolonged aplasia and pancytopenia were present in 18 and 11
		"patients, respectively. Skin (61%) and blood (42%) were the sites most frequently"
		"involved. Fusarium solani (n = 7), Fusarium oxysporum (n = 7), Fusarium"
		verticilloides (n = 7) were the species most frequently isolated. Nine antifungal
		"treatments were used, associated with colony-stimulating factors in five cases."
		None was unambiguously superior to all the others. The overall mortality was
		51.6% with a specific mortality > or = 25.8%. The disseminated form of the
		infection was associated with poor prognosis (P < 0.02) whereas improving
		granulocyte count improved prognosis (P < 0.001). More aggressive cytostatic
		regimens used for patients with haematological malignancies have favoured the
		emergence of Fusarium infections. As prognosis is closely correlated with
		"neutrophil recovery, the promising results obtained with the use of"
		colony-stimulating factors should be further evaluated.

		and review of the literature.
PG	-	e241-5
LID	-	10.1055/s-0034-1387182 [doi]
AB	-	Introduction Fusarium spp is an omnipresent fungal species that may lead to fatal
		infections in immunocompromised populations. Spontaneous intracranial infection
		by Fusarium spp in immunocompetent individuals is exceedingly rare. Case
		Report An immunocompetent 33-year-old Hispanic woman presented with persistent
		headaches and was found to have a contrast-enhancing mass in the left petrous
		apex and prepontine cistern. She underwent a subsequent craniotomy for biopsy and
		partial resection that revealed a Fusarium abscess. She had a left transient
		partial oculomotor palsy following the operation that resolved over the next few
		weeks. She was treated with long-term intravenous antifungal therapy and remained
		at her neurologic baseline 18 months following the intervention. Discussion To
		"our knowledge, this is the first reported case of Fusarium spp brain abscess in"
		an immunocompetent patient. Treatment options include surgical intervention and
		various antifungal medications. Conclusion This case demonstrates the rare
		"potential of intracranial Fusarium infection in the immunocompetent host, as well"
		as its successful treatment with surgical aspiration and antifungal therapy.

TI	-	Fatal disseminated fusarium infection in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in
		complete remission.
PG	-	488-90
AB	-	Fusarium species are increasingly recognised as serious pathogens in the
		immunocompromised. The outcome in the context of persistent severe neutropenia
		"has been almost universally fatal. However, there have been several case reports"
		of successful treatment if neutrophil recovery can be achieved. This report
		presents the case of a fatality that occurred despite neutrophil recovery. A 67
		year old man developed disseminated fusariosis during the neutropenic phase of
		induction chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Fusarium dimerum was
		isolated from blood cultures. This species is highly unusual and very few case
		reports exist in the literature. An initial response to amphotericin treatment
		"coincided with neutrophil recovery but a subsequent relapse occurred, despite"
		"adequate neutrophil counts, which proved fatal. It is postulated that reseeding"
		"of the blood from an occult site, namely the right vitreum in this case, led to"
		this secondary relapse despite achieving complete leukaemic remission.

AB	-	Invasive fusariosis has a high mortality and is predominantly observed in
		"patients with leukemia. We report the first case of a novel species of Fusarium,"
		"Fusarium riograndense sp. nov, isolated from a lesion in the nasal cavity lesion"
		of a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The etiological agent was
		"identified by Multilocus Sequencing Typing (MLST), including RPB2, TEF-1α, and"
		"ITS-LSU sequences, the gold standard technique to identify new species of"
		Fusarium. MLST and phenotypic data strongly supported its inclusion in the
		F. solani species complex (FSSC). The new species produced a red pigment in the
		Sabouraud Dextrose Agar similar to other members of the complex. The
		macroconiodia developed from phialides on multibranched conidiophores which merge
		to form effuse sporodochia with a basal foot-cell instead of papilla in basal
		"cell shape. The microconidia were ellipsoidal, 0-1-septated, produced from long"
		monophialides. Chlamydospores were produced singly or in pairs. Amphotericin B
		"(MIC 1μg/mL) was the most active drug, followed by voriconazole (MIC 8μg/mL). The"
		patient was successfully treated with voriconazole. Our findings indicate another
		lineage within FSSC capable causing of invasive human infection.

AB	-	The incidence of invasive fungal infection is increasing especially in the field
		"of transplantation, affecting as many as 50% of bone marrow transplant (BMT)"
		patients with neutropenia and 5-20% of solid-organ transplant (SOT) recipients.
		Fusarium species are soil saprophytes and plant pathogens. They may cause
		superficial mycoses or important opportunistic infections in patients with bone
		"marrow suppression and neutropenia, they have been rarely described in solid"
		"organ recipients, and up to now there have been no reports of such infection in"
		isolated liver transplanted patients. We describe a case of disseminated Fusarium
		solani infection with hepatic localization in a liver transplanted patient that
		resolved with the administration of amphotericin B. Our observation confirms that
		Fusarium spp. are emerging pathogens that may most frequently affect not only BMT
		"patients and patients with hematological malignancies, but also SOT patients."
		"They may cause both localized and disseminated infection. In conclusion, Fusarium"
		spp. etiology should be considered in the context of infectious diseases
		following liver transplantation.

TI	-	Etiological analysis on ocular fungal infection in the period of 1989 - 2000.
PG	-	598-600
AB	-	BACKGROUND: This study was to review the distribution and shifting trend of
		fungal of culture specimens isolated from eyes of patients at the Beijing
		"Institute of Ophthalmology, Tongren Hospital, Beijing, China. METHODS: The fungal"
		"culture-positive rate, the distribution and change of isolates of 2609 specimens"
		collected in a 12-year period (1989 - 2000) were retrospectively analyzed.
		"RESULTS: In 775 positive cultures, 707 specimens (91.2%) were from the cornea, 22"
		"(2.8%) from the conjunctiva, 15 (1.9%) from the anterior chamber, 9 (1.2%) from"
		"the vitreous body, 3 (0.4%) from the lacrimal sac, and 19 (2.5%) from other parts"
		of the eye. The average culture-positive rate was 29.7%. The ratio of the
		positive cultures in the first half year (from January to June) to those in the
		second half (from July to December) was 1:2.1. The main genus cultured was
		"Fusarium sp (58.7%), followed by Aspergirum sp (16.8%). The percentage of"
		"Fusarium sp was increased from 53.6% (1989 - 1994) to 60.2% (1995 - 2000),"
		whereas the percentage of Aspergirum sp was decreased from 22.3% (1989 - 1994) to
		15.1% (1995 - 2000). CONCLUSIONS: Fusaruim sp is one of the most predominant
		pathogens of ocular fungal infection in northern China and its incidence tends to
		"increase, but that of Aspergirum sp to decrease. It is very important to"
		recognize the distribution and shifting trend of pathogenic fungi in the
		"diagnosis, prevention and treatment of fungal keratitis."

TI	-	A unique case of Cryptococcus laurentii keratitis spread by a rigid gas permeable
		contact lens in a patient with onychomycosis.
PG	-	115-8
AB	-	PURPOSE: We report the first case of fungal keratitis caused by Cryptococcus
		"laurentii, a nonneoformans species. METHODS: A case of C. laurentii keratitis in"
		"a diabetic, gas permeable contact lens wearer was diagnosed after microbiologic"
		evaluation of the corneal button after emergent keratoplasty. The excised cornea
		was also culture positive for Staphylococcus aureus and Fusarium solani. The
		medical history was significant for onychomycosis of the right great toe 2 months
		previously. Cultures of the toenail and of the contact lens case were also
		positive for C. laurentii and F. solani. RESULTS: An initial penetrating
		keratoplasty with histopathologically clear margins was unsuccessful in
		preventing intraocular spread of the fungal infection. Despite a repeat
		"limbus-to-limbus therapeutic keratoplasty, pars plana vitrectomy, multiple"
		"anterior chamber washouts, intravitreal antifungal injections, and systemic"
		"antifungal treatment, the eye was ultimately lost due to ongoing inflammation,"
		"ocular hypotony, and a total retinal detachment. Histopathologic examination of"
		the enucleated eye demonstrated filamentous fungi but no yeast forms.
		"CONCLUSIONS: C. laurentii, a nonneoformans species, should be included in the"
		differential diagnosis of fungal keratitis. This unique case also demonstrates
		"the importance of a thorough clinical history and proper contact lens hygiene,"
		particularly in a diabetic patient.

TI	-	Invasive infection with Fusarium chlamydosporum in a patient with aplastic
		anemia.
PG	-	1772-6
AB	-	We report the first case of invasive disease caused by Fusarium chlamydosporum.
		The patient had aplastic anemia with prolonged neutropenia and was treated with
		"immunosuppressive therapy. While she was receiving empirical amphotericin B, a"
		dark crusted lesion developed on her nasal turbinate. Histologic analysis
		revealed invasive hyaline hyphae and some darkly pigmented structures that
		resembled conidia of dematiaceous molds. Only after the mold was grown in culture
		"were characteristic colonial morphology, phialides, conidia, and chlamydospores"
		"evident, thus permitting the identification of F. chlamydosporum. This case"
		illustrates the ever-increasing spectrum of pathogenic Fusarium spp. in
		immunocompromised patients and emphasizes the potential pitfalls in histologic
		"diagnosis, which may have important treatment implications."

TI	-	Fungal infections in neutropenic patients. A 8-year prospective study.
PG	-	397-406
AB	-	In this paper we report a eight-year prospective study designed to further
		"characterize incidence, epidemiology, specific syndromes, treatment and prognosis"
		associated with fungal infections in neutropenic patients. During the study
		period 30 fungal infections were diagnosed in 30 patients among 313 episodes of
		"fever and neutropenia (10%). There were 15 cases of candidiasis, 5 pulmonary"
		"aspergillosis, 3 sinusitis by Aspergillus fumigatus, 5 infections by Fusarium"
		"sp., one infection by Trichosporon sp., and one infection due to Rhodotorula"
		rubra. Blood cultures were positive in 18 cases (60%). The predisposing factors
		for fungal infection in multivariate analysis were the presence of central venous
		"catheter (p < 0.001), longer duration of profound (< 100/mm3) neutropenia (p <"
		"0.001), the use of corticosteroids (p < 0.001), gram-positive bacteremia (p ="
		0.002) and younger age (p = 0.03). In multivariate analysis only recovery of the
		neutropenia (p < 0.001) was associated with good prognosis whereas the diagnosis
		of infection by Fusarium sp. (p = 0.006) was strongly associated with a poor
		outcome. The death rate was 43%. There was no statistically significant
		difference in the death rate between patients who did receive (52%) or did not
		"receive (50%) antifungal treatment. Identifying patients at risk, specific"
		syndromes and prognostic factors may help to reduce the high mortality associated
		with disseminated fungal infections in neutropenic patients.

PG	-	614-7
AB	-	"PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the clinical profile, microbial spectrum,"
		"management modalities, and visual outcome in cases of corneal superinfection that"
		occurred after an epidemic of acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis. METHOD: A
		retrospective analysis of 14 eyes of 13 patients who were referred to a tertiary
		eye-care center with corneal ulceration after an episode of acute hemorrhagic
		"conjunctivitis was undertaken. The parameters analyzed were age, sex, prior use"
		"of topical medications, predisposing factors, ulcer characteristics, organisms"
		"isolated, success of medical therapy and surgery, and visual outcome. RESULTS: A"
		definite history of topical corticosteroid use to treat acute hemorrhagic
		conjunctivitis was elicited in 12 (86%) eyes. Cultures were positive in 86%
		"(12/14) eyes. Organisms isolated were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (three eyes, 25%),"
		"Fusarium species (three eyes, 25%), Aspergillus species (two eyes, 16%), and"
		"Staphylococcus aureus (two eyes, 16%). Mixed infection occurred in two patients."
		"After discontinuation of topical corticosteroids, all patients received"
		antimicrobial therapy. The keratitis resolved in seven eyes. Therapeutic
		penetrating keratoplasty was required in five eyes. Two patients were lost to
		follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Corneal superinfection may occur after acute hemorrhagic
		conjunctivitis. Use of topical corticosteroids to treat acute hemorrhagic
		conjunctivitis may predispose an already compromised cornea to develop microbial
		keratitis and such a practice should be discouraged.

TI	-	Intravenous itraconazole for prophylaxis of systemic fungal infections in
		patients with acute myelogenous leukemia and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome
		undergoing induction chemotherapy.
PG	-	568-73
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Systemic fungal infections remain the leading cause of mortality in
		patients with newly diagnosed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and high-risk
		myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The objective of the current study was to
		determine whether intravenous itraconazole (i.v. ITRA) reduced the incidence of
		"probable/proven fungal infections in this group of patients, and compare the"
		results with those of a historic control group treated with fluconazole plus
		itraconazole capsules (F+I). METHODS: Patients with AML and high-risk MDS who
		underwent induction chemotherapy received 200 mg of i.v. itraconazole over 60
		minutes every 12 hours during the first 2 days followed by 200 mg given i.v. once
		"daily. RESULTS: One hundred patients were enrolled, 96 of whom were evaluable."
		Approximately 48% of the patients in the group of patients treated with i.v. ITRA
		as well as in the F+I group completed prophylaxis. Nine patients (9%) in the
		study group developed either proven/probable fungal infections (Candida glabrata
		"in 5 patients, C. tropicalis in 1 patient, C krusei in 1 patient, and Fusarium in"
		2 patients) compared with 3 patients (4%) with proven fungal infection in the
		historic control group (C. tropicalis in 1 patient and Aspergillus in 2
		patients). There were no significant differences noted between the two groups
		with regard to the percentage of patients who developed proven/probable or
		possible fungal infection as well as with regard to survival. These results also
		were obtained after adjusting for relevant prognostic factors (creatinine and
		bilirubin). The most common toxicity encountered with the use of i.v. ITRA was
		NCI Grade 3-4 hyperbilirubinemia (6%). CONCLUSIONS: Despite its theoretic
		"advantages, the authors found no evidence that i.v. ITRA is superior to"
		"itraconazole capsules, at least when the latter is combined with fluconazole."

		granulomatous disease.
PG	-	e107-8
AB	-	Disseminated Fusarium infection is a rare disease that is usually limited to
		immunocompromised patients. It more commonly occurs in patients with acute
		leukemia and prolonged neutropenia. We report a case of chronic Fusarium
		infection in an adult patient with undiagnosed chronic granulomatous disease
		"(CGD), a primary immunodeficiency disorder in which phagocytic cells are"
		defective in generating superoxide anion and its metabolites. The case is
		important because the patient had no manifestations of CGD until she was almost
		"60 years old and because this is, to our knowledge, the first reported case of"
		Fusarium infection in a patient with CGD.

PG	-	Doc03
LID	-	10.3205/oc000092 [doi]
LID	-	Doc03
AB	-	Background: Fusarium spp. are leading fungal pathogenes in contact lens
		associated keratitis and may evoke endophthalmitis. Since Fusarium spp. are
		"highly resistant to antifungal drugs, globe integrity is threatened. Case: A"
		woman developed fungal anterior chamber involvement after contact lens associated
		corneal ulcer formation. She presented with a painful eye with hypopyon and a
		mass presumably of fungal origin growing on the iris and anterior lens capsule. A
		biopsy confirmed Fusarium solani. Only multiple lavages of the anterior segment
		with Amphotericin B achieved convalescence. Conclusion: In the initial stage of
		"contact lens associated keratitis, it is often hard to differentiate between"
		"etiology. However, keratitis which are treatment resistant to antibacterials are"
		"suspicious for fungal origin. For proper treatment, identification of pathogen is"
		crucial. Due to poor tissue penetration of the lipophilic anti-fungal agents and
		"slow fungal replication rate, multiple lavages of the anterior chamber are often"
		required to handle fungal infections.

AB	-	Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a primary immunodeficiency disease
		characterized by recurrent life-threatening bacterial and fungal infections with
		granuloma formation. Species of the genus Fusarium are opportunistic
		environmental microorganisms that are rarely pathogenic in humans. We report here
		the first case of X-linked CGD complicated with epidural abscess caused by
		Fusarium falciforme infection. The abscesses extended along the dura mater for >7
		years and finally resulted in fatal meningitis and cervical myelitis. Early
		"intervention with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation should be considered,"
		"especially in patients with severe CGD, before the development of serious"
		infectious complication.

TI	-	Fumonisin B1 contamination of maize and experimental acute fumonisin toxicosis in
		pigs.
PG	-	171-81
AB	-	The fumonisin B1 content of 69 visibly mouldy and 23 mould-free maize samples
		grown in Hungary in 1993-1995 was determined by high-performance liquid
		chromatography (HPLC). Fumonisin B1 was found to occur in 70-73% of the mouldy
		samples. The mycotoxin level increased from year to year: the highest fumonisin
		B1 concentration was 75.1 mg/kg. The samples that were mould-free on visual
		inspection showed a much lower prevalence of fumonisin B1 contamination (30%) and
		"contained fumonisin B1 in markedly lower concentrations (average, 1.52 mg/kg;"
		"maximum concentration, 5.1 mg/kg). Using the Fusarium moniliforme strain"
		"designated 14/A, isolated from the sample that had the highest mycotoxin"
		"concentrations, fumonisin B1 toxin was produced on maize by an internationally"
		"accepted procedure. Subsequently, two weaned piglets were fed a diet containing"
		330 mg fumonisin B1 per kg of feed. The experimental animals developed
		"hydrothorax and pulmonary oedema, and died in 5-6 days. The clinical symptoms and"
		pathological lesions were consistent with those of porcine pulmonary oedema (PPE)
		"diagnosed in the USA in 1989-1990, as well as with those of a disease entity that"
		had already been described in Hungary in the 1950s as the so-called fattening or
		unique pulmonary oedema of pigs but considered to be of unknown aetiology. The
		"results of the feeding trial confirm that this pig disease, which has occurred in"
		"Hungary for a long time, is caused by the mycotoxin fumonisin B1."

PG	-	1484-8
AB	-	Fungal endophthalmitis is a destructive intraocular infection resulting in poor
		visual prognosis. Endophthalmitis due to Fusarium spp has the worst visual
		prognosis. We report a case of a 58-year-old female patient who underwent
		cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantation in the right eye and
		presented two months after the surgery with fungal endophthalmitis. The aqueous
		humor culture grew Fusarium dimerum. The patient was treated with intravitreal
		and oral voriconazole and topical prednisolone. The patient experienced one
		"episode of recurrence following by remarkable improvement. To our knowledge, this"
		is the first reported case of Fusarium dimerum endophthalmitis.

		complex.
PG	-	853-6
AB	-	PURPOSE: The authors report the first case of Fusarium solani keratitis that
		progressed to fungal endophthalmitis and was successfully treated with
		amphotericin B lipid complex (ABLC). METHOD: The case of a 34-year-old
		immunocompetent woman who developed a contact lens-related F. solani keratitis
		requiring emergency penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) was analyzed. The
		immunocompetent patient developed fungal endophthalmitis (anterior chamber tap
		positive for F. solani three months after PKP) and was eventually treated with
		"ABLC. RESULTS: Systemic amphotericin B (total, 0.42 g) and ketoconazole in"
		addition to topical natamycin and amphotericin did not prove to be effective in
		"eradicating the mycosis in the anterior chamber. Under ABLC treatment (total,"
		"8.79 g), the anterior chamber inflammation resolved completely. No recurrence was"
		observed during an 11-month follow-up after treatment was discontinued.
		CONCLUSION: ABLC proved to be effective in treating F. solani endophthalmitis. It
		"is an important addition to the ophthalmic armamentarium, and appeared to be a"
		better therapeutic agent than standard amphotericin B in this patient.

		retrospective study.
PG	-	127-30
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: The epidemiology of fungal keratitis varies geographically, but"
		"commonly occurs in warm, tropical climates. To determine the microbial and"
		"clinical characteristics of this disease in Singapore, we conducted a 5-year"
		hospital-based retrospective study. METHODS: A retrospective review of
		culture-positive fungal keratitis at the Singapore National Eye Center and
		"Singapore General Hospital, from January 1991 to December 1995. RESULTS:"
		Twenty-nine consecutive cases of culture-positive fungal keratitis were seen over
		the study period. The mean age of the cases was 41 years and 23 were males.
		"Amongst the varied occupations, 9 were construction workers. The most common"
		cultured organisms were Fusarium sp. (52%) and Aspergillus flavus (17%). More
		"than half had a history of ocular trauma prior to the development of keratitis,"
		"while a quarter had antecedent topical corticosteroid therapy. In contrast, only"
		"2 patients were contact-lens wearers. Despite medical therapy, 10 patients"
		"eventually required therapeutic penetrating keratoplasties; of these, 6 were"
		caused by Fusarium species. CONCLUSION: Fusarium is the commonest cultured
		organism in fungal keratitis in Singapore and is associated with significant
		ocular morbidity.

PG	-	562-5
AB	-	"During the 3 years from 1989 to 1991, we evaluated the etiology of septic shock"
		cases and infection-associated mortality. A total number of 38 patients was
		"included in the study, according to the criteria for septic shock (SS),"
		"(Intensive Care Medicine Society, 1989). In 1989, P. aeruginosa and"
		"Enterobacteriaceae among the pathogens prevailed. In 1990 and 1991, S. aureus,"
		"enterococci and fungi were most frequent. From 8 patients with SS in 1990, the"
		shock was due to Candida albicans in 1 and to mucoraceae in 3 patients. In 10
		"patients examined in 1991, 8 cases of SS were due to Candida albicans,"
		"Aspergillus niger, Fusarium solani and Acremonium strictum. The decrease of the"
		incidence of shocks and increase of fungal etiology were found to be associated
		"with the use of quinolones in prophylaxis and cephalosporines, aminoglycosides"
		and vancomycine in empiric therapy in febrile neutropenic patients.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: To report a case of disseminated fusariosis with endogenous
		endophthalmitis in a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
		Transfusion-associated immune modulation secondary to platelet transfusion could
		play an important role in the pathophysiology of this case. CASE PRESENTATION: A
		9 year-old male with acute lymphoblastic leukemia complicated by pancytopenia and
		disseminated Intravascular coagulation was given platelet transfusion. He
		developed disseminated fusariosis and was referred to the ophthalmology team for
		right endogenous endophthalmitis. The infection was controlled with aggressive
		systemic and intravitreal antifungals. CONCLUSION: Patients with acute
		lymphoblastic leukemia are predisposed to endogenous fungal endophthalmitis.
		Transfusion-associated immune modulation may further increase host susceptibility
		to such opportunistic infections.

PG	-	939-44
LID	-	10.1007/s10156-012-0389-4 [doi]
AB	-	We report two cases of Fusarium keratomycosis in which molecular analysis was
		used to identify two rare causative Fusarium species. A 65-year-old woman was
		"diagnosed with Fusarium keratomycosis caused by F. equiseti, confirmed by"
		sequencing the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and morphological
		characteristics. She was initially treated with topical corticosteroid but the
		"keratitis did not improve. Even after aggressive antifungal treatment, there was"
		"a severe reduction of vision. In the end, the eye perforated. Our second case was"
		a 75-year-old man who had diabetes mellitus. He developed keratitis after his
		cornea was injured by corn stalks. The ITS region identified the causative
		"organism as F. verticillioides. Unlike the first case, he had good visual"
		recovery after early antifungal therapy. Our findings demonstrate that both ITS
		and morphological characteristics can be used to identify the exact Fusarium
		species causing Fusarium keratomycosis. This allowed us to determine the
		sensitivity of these species to antifungal drugs that can be used to treat
		patients with these species of Fusarium.

		"factors were plants in ward (75%), prior therapy with broad spectrum antibiotics"
		"(70%), catheter insertion (70%), acute leukemia (65%) and neutropenia (60%)."
		"Before death, a definitive diagnosis was made in 40%, and a presumptive diagnosis"

		confirmed in all cases (100% of patients). Aspergillosis was the most common
		"invasive fungal disease (55%), followed by mucormycosis (15%), fusariosis (15%),"
		"and acremoniosis (10%). Of 20 patients, 8 (40%) were cured or improved after"
		"antifungal therapy with amphotericin B, ambisome and/or itraconazole; 8/20 (40%)"
		died of fungal infection and 4/20 (20%) of underlying disease with fungal
		infection. Even though the diagnosis was made and antifungal therapy started
		"before death in 15/ 20 (75%), invasive mold infection had a 60% overall mortality"
		in patients with malignant disease.

PG	-	79
LID	-	10.1186/s12879-016-1382-9 [doi]
LID	-	79
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Fusarium species are ubiquitous environmental fungi that occasionally
		provoke serious invasive infections in immunocompromised hosts. Among Fusarium
		"species, Fusarium ramigenum, belonging to the Fusarium fujikuroi species complex,"
		has thus far never been found to cause human infections. Here we describe the
		first case of invasive fusariosis caused by Fusarium ramigenum in a human and
		also identify immunological deficiencies that most likely contributed to
		invasiveness. CASE PRESENTATION: A 32-year-old Caucasian male with a seemingly
		insignificant medical history of mild respiratory illness during the preceding
		"two years, developed invasive pulmonary fusariosis. Detailed immunological"
		"assessment revealed the presence of common variable immunodeficiency, complicated"
		by a severe impairment of the capacity of T-cells to produce both
		gamma-interferon and interleukin-17. In-depth microbiological assessment
		identified the novel human opportunistic pathogen Fusarium ramigenum as cause of
		the infection. CONCLUSION: This report demonstrated that an opportunistic
		invasive fungal infection may indicate an underlying cellular immune impairment
		of the host. The unexpected invasive infection with Fusarium ramigenum in this
		case unmasked a complex combined humoral and cellular immunological deficiency.

AB	-	PURPOSE: To describe a combination of treatment modalities used for the
		successful eradication of Fusarium endophthalmitis. DESIGN: Interventional case
		series. PARTICIPANTS: Three consecutive patients with keratitis-associated
		Fusarium endophthalmitis. METHODS: After failure of traditional management
		"options, a combination of intravitreal and long-term, high-dose systemic"
		"voriconazole, topical antifungal medications, and surgical intervention, with"
		"penetrating keratoplasty, lensectomy, and endoscopic-guided pars plana"
		"vitrectomy, was administered to each patient. RESULTS: All three cases achieved"
		"full resolution of the infection, with a final Snellen visual acuity score of"
		"20/50 to 20/70. CONCLUSIONS: An aggressive combination of therapeutic modalities,"
		"including the removal of subiris abscesses, might be needed for the successful"
		resolution of Fusarium endophthalmitis.

PG	-	151-3
AB	-	"A case of Fusarium arthritis is reported. Fusarium, a mold ubiquitous in soil and"
		on plants commonly causes keratomycosis and infects burns. Recent reports
		demonstrate that Fusarium may produce serious visceral infection in compromised
		"hosts. Disseminated infection has been universally fatal. In contrast, our case"
		and several others with localized visceral infection were cured by intravenous
		"amphotericin B and drainage. Although Fusarium grows readily on mycologic media,"
		blood and other cultures have usually been negative in disseminated infection.
		Physicians should be aware of this uncommon but potentially lethal pathogen
		because deep fungal infections may first appear as arthritis.

PG	-	6987896
LID	-	10.1155/2017/6987896 [doi]
LID	-	6987896
AB	-	The purpose of this article is to describe the use of simultaneous noncentered
		photoactivated chromophore for keratitis-corneal collagen cross-linking
		(PACK-CXL) combined with penetrating keratoplasty in the treatment of a severe
		marginal Fusarium spp. keratitis case with imminent corneal perforation. It is a
		"retrospective case report study; it was performed by collecting clinical data,"
		"images, video, and postoperative evaluations. The clinical control of the"
		"infection was accomplished, despite difficulties in obtaining antifungal"
		medications due to the patient's extremely poor socioeconomic status and
		essentially nonexistent health insurance. We can conclude that combining
		simultaneous decentered PACK-CXL with centered penetrating keratoplasty appears
		to be a safe and effective way of treating patients with fungal marginal
		"keratitis with corneal perforation, in which regular penetrating keratoplasty"
		"alone would leave fungal elements in the receptor corneal tissue, which would"
		predispose to infection of the graft.

TI	-	Fusarium fingernail infection responsive to fluconazole intermittent therapy.
PG	-	352-4
AB	-	A case of fingernail infection by Fusarium is presented. This nondermatophytic
		"mold is an infrequent cause of onychomycosis, more typically involving the great"
		toenail. Characteristic histologic features including the presence of hyphae and
		chlamydoconia are helpful in rapid diagnosis and selection of appropriate
		antifungal therapy. Although Fusarium has shown resistance to most antifungal
		"medications in vitro, intermittent therapy with fluconazole led to improvement in"
		this patient.

PG	-	41-4
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To screen cervical smears for early detection of precancerous and
		cancerous lesions of the uterine cervix in a hospital-based cancer screening
		program. STUDY DESIGN: Cervical smears were collected from women attending the
		"gynecology outdoors of various Delhi hospitals. The smears were wet fixed,"
		processed for Papanicolaou staining and screened cytologically. RESULTS: A total
		"of 130,000 satisfactory smears were screened. Benign cellular changes were found"
		"in 48%. Of these, 6.9% had evidence of specific infections, while the remainder"
		"showed nonspecific, reactive changes due to inflammation/repair. In two cases,"
		"unusual, large, crescentic, septate structures were identified. These were"
		labelled macroconidia of Fusarium species on the basis of their unique
		microscopic morphology. The diagnosis was confirmed on fungal culture in one
		case. The patient responded well to antifungal therapy. CONCLUSION: Cytology is a
		useful tool for identification of unusual fungi with characteristic microscopic
		morphology. A prompt cytodiagnosis in these cases can assist clinicians with
		management.

		Identified with DNA Sequencing in a Kidney Transplant Recipient in Brazil.
PG	-	397-401
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-015-9929-7 [doi]
AB	-	Fungal peritonitis is a rare serious complication most commonly observed in
		"immunocompromised patients under peritoneal dialysis. Nevertheless, this clinical"
		condition is more difficult to treat than bacterial peritonitis. Bacterial
		peritonitis followed by the use of antibiotics is the main risk factor for
		"developing fungal peritonitis. Candida spp. are more frequently isolated, and the"
		isolation of filamentous fungi is only occasional. Here we describe a case of
		Fusarium solani species complex peritonitis associated with bacterial peritonitis
		in a female kidney transplant recipient with previous history of nephrotic
		syndrome. The patient has had Enterobacter sp. endocarditis and was hypertensive
		and diabetic. Two sequential isolates of F. solani were recovered from cultures
		and identified with different molecular techniques. She was successfully treated
		with 50 mg daily amphotericin B for 4 weeks.

AB	-	Disseminated infections caused by members of the Fusarium fujikuroi species
		"complex (FFSC) occur regularly in immunocompromised patients. Here, we present"
		"the first human case caused by FFSC-member Fusarium andiyazi. Fever, respiratory"

		sequence typing. The sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region did not
		"resolve the closely related members of the FFSC, but additional data on partial"
		sequence of transcription elongation factor 1 alpha subunit did. A detailed
		"morphological study confirmed the identification of F. andiyazi, which had"

TI	-	Resolution of disseminated fusariosis in a child with acute leukemia treated with
		combined antifungal therapy: a case report.
PG	-	40
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Fusarium spp. is being isolated with increasing frequency as a
		pathogen in oncohematologic patients. Caspofungin and amphotericin B have been
		reported to have synergistic activity against Fusarium spp. CASE PRESENTATION: We
		herein report a case of disseminated fusariosis diagnosed by chest CT scan and
		positive blood cultures to Fusarium spp. Because the patient's clinical condition
		"deteriorated, CRP levels increased, and blood cultures continued to yield"
		"Fusarium spp. despite liposomal amphotericin B monotherapy up to 5 mg/kg daily,"
		treatment with caspofungin was added. Within 2 weeks of onset of combined
		"antifungal therapy, the chest CT scan demonstrated a progressive resolution of"
		"the pulmonary lesions. Upon discontinuation of intravenous antifungals, the"
		"patient received suppressive therapy with oral voriconazole. Three months later,"
		a chest CT scan showed no abnormalities. Twenty-five months after discontinuation
		"of all antifungal therapy, the patient remains in complete remission of her"
		neoplastic disease with no signs of clinical activity of the Fusarium infection.
		CONCLUSION: This is the first description of successful treatment of disseminated
		fusariosis in a pediatric patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia with
		caspofungin and amphotericin B followed by oral suppressive therapy with
		voriconazole.

PG	-	115-9
AB	-	We report a case of Fusarium solani keratitis which highlights the difficulties
		often associated with management of fungal corneal infections. This case
		demonstrates several unusual and interesting features: the occurrence of deep
		"fungal pathology after superficial injury, the difficulties encountered in"
		"attempting to isolate and identify the causative organism, and the protracted"
		course taken by an organism often noted to be rapidly destructive. These features
		"necessitated an individual approach to therapy, employing unconventional medical"
		and surgical techniques to achieve a satisfactory outcome.

AB	-	A retrospective study of bacteremia in children with neutropenic fever admitted
		to a medical center in Taiwan from Jan. 1994 to Dec. 1995 was performed. There
		"were in total 273 episodes of neutropenic fever during this period, but only 79"
		pathogens were isolated from blood specimens in 70 episodes. Klebsiella
		"pneumoniae (27.8%), E. coli (10.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.1%) and"
		Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.6%) were the most common pathogens. All the isolates of
		S. aureus were methicillin sensitive. About half of K. pneumoniae (10/22) was
		"multiple-drug resistant. There were seven infection-related mortality cases,"
		"three due to multiple-drug resistant K. pneumoniae, one due to S. aureus, one"
		alpha-hemolytic streptococcus and two fungemia (Cryptococcus neoformans and
		Fusarium sp.). Vancomycin is not necessary in initial empiric therapy of
		"neutropenic fever, while cefazolin or oxacillin may be included in cases with"
		"central venous access device. Antibiotics to cover intestinal flora, especially"
		"K. pneumoniae, are paramount in our hospital."

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Ecthyma gangrenosum (EG) manifests as a skin lesion affecting
		patients suffering extreme neutropenia and is commonly associated with
		Pseudomonas aeruginosa in immunocompromised patients. Leukocyte adhesion
		deficiency I (LAD I) which count among primary immunodeficiency syndromes of the
		"innate immunity, is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized in its severe"
		"phenotype by a complete defect in CD18 expression on neutrophils, delayed cord"
		"separation, chronic skin ulcers mainly due to recurrent bacterial and fungal"
		"infections, leucocytosis with high numbers of circulating neutrophils and an"
		accumulation of abnormally low number of neutrophils at sites of infection. CASE
		PRESENTATION: We report at our knowledge the first case of a child affected by
		"LAD-1, who experienced during her disease course a multi-bacterial and fungal EG"
		lesion caused by fusarium solani. Despite targeted antibiotics and anti-fungi
		"therapy, the lesion extended for as long as 18 months and only massive"
		granulocytes pockets transfusions in association with G-CSF had the capacity to
		cure this lesion. CONCLUSION: We propose that granulocytes pockets transfusions
		will be beneficial to heal EG especially in severely immunocompromised patients.

PG	-	10-May
AB	-	Fusarium moniliforme was demonstrated to be the etiologic agent in an Italian
		"case of eumycotic mycetoma. The fungus produced white granules, which measured 80"
		X 133 by 212 X 478 microns. Their edges were entire or lobed and were surrounded
		by an eosinophilic homogeneous material. The hyphae comprising the granules were
		"not embedded in cement. The etiologic agent, first considered to be an Acremonium"
		"species, was restudied and identified as F. moniliforme on the basis that it not"
		"only produced chains of microconidia but also curved, multi-septate macroconidia"
		typical of the genus Fusarium.

		series of four cases from North India.
PG	-	705-709
LID	-	10.1111/myc.12518 [doi]
AB	-	The two most common filamentous fungi causing mycotic keratitis are Aspergillus
		and Fusarium spp. Around 70 Fusarium spp. are involved in causing human
		"infections. In this study, four cases of keratitis in sugarcane farmers in India"
		"are being reported, caused by the sugar cane pathogen Fusarium sacchari, a"
		species of the Fusarium fujikuroi species complex. Fusarial keratitis was
		established by potassium hydroxide/Calcofluor white wet mounts and fungal culture
		of corneal scrapings on conventional media. Final identification was done by
		"genetic sequencing at CBS-KNAW, Utrecht, The Netherlands. The antifungal"
		susceptibility testing was done using broth microdilution method as per CLSI
		document M38-A2. Four cases of F. sacchari keratitis were identified. Three of
		"them had trauma with sugarcane leaves, whereas one sugarcane farmer reported"
		trauma by vegetative matter. The morphological similarities among various
		Fusarium species warrant use of molecular methods for identification of cryptic
		species. A wide distribution of sugarcane farming could be the possible
		explanation for emergence of F. sacchari keratitis in India.

PG	-	770-7
AB	-	Tracheoesophageal vocal prostheses (TVP) in laryngectomized patients commonly
		"deteriorate due to overgrowth by yeasts, particularly Candida species. We"
		describe the first case of colonization of such devices by a member of the
		Fusarium solani species complex in a patient with a history of glottal carcinoma.
		"Three isolates, from three prostheses, were found morphologically consistent with"
		the traditional picture of F. solani. Ribosomal sequence analysis showed that the
		"isolates belonged to a distinct, as yet apparently unnamed phylogenetic species"
		"within the F. solani species complex. This species, one of two distinct genetic"
		types (genotype 2) traditionally considered part of the plant-pathogenic subtaxon
		"Fusarium solani f. sp. radicicola, has not previously been identified as an agent"
		"of human or animal disease, although it is closely related to a known etiologic"
		"agent of mycetoma, an Acremonium-like species recently renamed Fusarium"
		falciforme. Sequence and multisatellite M13 polymorphism analysis revealed no
		distinctions among the case isolates. Production of cyclosporine was detected for
		all three case isolates.

PG	-	394-7
AB	-	A case of disseminated infection with Fusarium oxysporum following chemotherapy
		of acute myelogenous leukemia is reported. Antifungal treatment was successful
		with a 13-day course of oral terbinafine 250 mg t.i.d. in combination with
		amphotericin B deoxycholate 1.0-1.5 mg/kg qd and subsequently intravenous
		liposomal amphotericin B 5 mg/kg qd. Preceding monotherapy with amphotericin B
		deoxycholate 1.0-1.5 mg/kg qd had not stopped the progression of infection. The
		combination therapy described here represents a novel approach to the treatment
		of Fusarium spp. in the immunocompromised host in whom Fusarium spp. are known to
		cause disseminated infection with high mortality.

TI	-	Unsuccessful therapy of combined mycotic infection in a severely burned patient:
		a case study.
PG	-	83-4
AB	-	Patients with burn trauma are always in danger of contracting an infection.
		"Although invasive mycotic infections are not as frequent as bacterial infections,"
		high mortality and in many cases difficult diagnostics pose a serious threat not
		only for neutropenic patients. In more extensive burns the status is further
		complicated by specifically compromised immunity. The most frequent species of
		micromycetes isolated in burn patients are Candida spp. and Aspergillus spp.
		Zygomycetes represents a relatively uncommon isolation worldwide (up to 2% of all
		fungi. We present a case study of a young patient with 82% TBSA (total body
		"surface area) burns, where we isolated simultaneously 3 different types of"
		"micromycetes (Aspergillus fumigatus, Fusarium sp., Absidia sp.). Mycotic"
		"infection is understood primarily as a complication in neutropenic patients and,"
		"after prophylactic antibiotic and antimycotic administration, in extensive burn"
		trauma patients. The case ended with the death of the patient due to severe
		sepsis caused by the multiresistant strain Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI	-	Plantar hyperkeratosis due to Fusarium verticillioides in a patient with
		malignancy.
PG	-	175-8
AB	-	We report the case of an 82-year-old man with hyperkeratosis of the right sole
		caused by a Fusarium verticillioides infection mimicking verrucous tuberculosis;
		"the infection was confirmed by direct potassium hydroxide microscopy, biopsy and"
		cultures. The biopsy specimen showed an unusually deep invasion of fungal
		elements into the epidermis. This is an uncommon presentation in a localized
		"cutaneous infection by Fusarium but in this case, repeated local injuries were"
		the portal of entry initiating the process. Clinical patterns of cutaneous
		fusarium infections in general are also discussed.

PG	-	367-74
AB	-	Over a 10-y period (1989-99) we prospectively evaluated all patients with
		"fungaemia among 16,555 admissions (21,004 blood cultures) at a national cancer"
		referral institution in the Slovak Republic. A prospective protocol was completed

		"clinical characteristics, potential risk factors and outcome. The most frequently"
		"isolated organism was C. albicans, in 75 patients (52.9%), followed by"
		non-albicans Candida spp. in 45 patients (32.1%). Non-Candida spp. yeasts
		represented 16 episodes in 16 patients (11.4%). Moulds caused 4 episodes in 4
		patients (3.6% of all fungaemias) and all were caused by Fusarium spp. Mucositis
		"(p = 0.025), > or = 3 positive blood cultures (p = 0.02), acute leukaemia (p ="
		"0.00001), neutropenia (p = 0.0015), quinolone prophylaxis (p < 0.000005) and"
		breakthrough fungaemia (p = 0.004) during prophylaxis with fluconazole (p = 0.03)
		and itraconazole (p = 0.005) were significantly more associated with non-Candida
		"than C. albicans spp. Furthermore, attributable mortality was higher in the"
		"subgroup of non-Candida than C. albicans spp. (50.0 vs. 18.7%, p < 0.02). The"
		only independent risk factor for inferior outcome was antifungal therapy of < 10
		"d duration (odds ratio 2.1, 95% confidence interval, p < 0.001). Aetiology,"
		neutropenia and mucositis were not independent risk factors for higher mortality
		"in multivariate analysis; however, they were risk factors for inferior outcome in"
		univariate analysis (p < 0.05-0.005).

		transplant that was clinically and histologically indistinguishable from
		"disseminated Aspergillus, Fusarium or zygomycosis infection. Distinguishing the"

		report.
PG	-	4-Nov
AB	-	Eumycetoma is a mycotic disease caused by saprophytic soil fungi that are usually
		inoculated through minor injuries. A case of mycetoma in a Brazilian farmer aged
		71 years is reported. This patient presented erythema and edema on the dorsal
		surface of the left hand with multiple crusted and cicatricial lesions. No
		macroscopic grains were observed. The histopathological findings showed grains
		consisted of numerous hyphae which stained well with Gomori-Grocott method. This
		material obtained by cutaneous biopsy was submitted to culture on Sabouraud's
		medium and the colonies were identified as Fusarium solani. The radiological
		studies revealed bone osteolytic lesions and the ultrasound showed pseudocysts
		and fistulae at the site of this infection. The patient was treated with oral
		ketoconazole with a good clinical response.

TI	-	Field outbreaks of hyperoestrogenism (vulvo-vaginitis) in pigs consuming maize
		infected by Fusarium graminearum and contaminated with zearalenone.
PG	-	163-6
AB	-	During the spring and summer of 1979 field outbreaks of porcine hyperoestrogenism
		characterized by swelling and reddening of the vulva and teats in prepubertal
		gilts and enlargement of the mammae in young males occurred in the mistbelt of
		"the Natal Midlands. On a farm in the Ixopo district, pigs were fed a mixed ratio"
		containing home-grown yellow maize stored on the cob in a crib and all the young
		pigs with a mass of 25-85 kg (=a total of 350) were affected. Maize ears from the
		crib had a high percentage (91%) of kernels infected by Fusarium graminearum and
		"contained 10 mg/kg of zearalenone. The mixed ration contained 0,95 mg/kg"
		zearalenone. After dilution of the contaminated maize with good quality white
		"maize, a dramatic decrease in both the incidence and severity of clinical signs"
		"occurred within 3-4 days. On a farm in the Winterton district, approximately 80%"
		of the growing pigs with a mass of more than 40 kg fed a mixed ration containing
		shelled yellow maize from the silo of the local Agricultural Co-operative were
		affected. The incidence as well as the severity of the swelling of the vulvas
		"and/or treats were lower than on the farm at Ixopo, thus indicating a lower level"
		of oestrogen intake. A sample of maize from the silo delivered to this farm
		"contained only 0,06 mg/kg zearalenone while the mixed ration did not contain"
		chemically detectable levels of zearalenone. This is the first published record
		of field outbreaks of porcine hyperoestrogenism associated with the ingestion of
		F. graminearum infected maize contaminated with zearalenone in the Republic of
		South Africa.

TI	-	Impaired semen quality of AI bulls fed with moldy hay: a case report.
PG	-	1497-502
AB	-	The daily quality control of semen at a Finnish artificial insemination (AI) bull
		station is based on subjective motility and sperm morphology of young bulls
		entering the semen collection program. Semen quality dropped suddenly in autumn
		"1998. During 5 consecutive months, the number of rejected ejaculates and"
		"discarded frozen semen batches due to poor motility increased, and the number of"
		"all forms of abnormal spermatozoa increased. However, for the accepted"
		"ejaculates, a 60 day nonretum rate was normal. The summer of 1998 in Finland was"
		"rainy, and the hay used in the AI station was visibly moldy. Immunoassay and gas"
		chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) detected Fusarium mycotoxins HT-2 and
		"T-2, but no zearalenone in the hay. Occurrence of mycotoxins such as T-2 and HT-2"
		"in the moldy hay coincided with, and may have been responsible for the impaired"
		semen quality in AI bulls. This case report will draw the attention to the
		possible hazards when feeding moldy hay.

PG	-	860-2
AB	-	PURPOSE: To report a case of Fusarium species invasion of a methafilcon matrix
		soft contact lens in a first-time lens wearer. RESULTS: The authors describe the
		history and ocular examination of a 19-year-old woman with large fungal deposits
		on her contact lens. Culture of the contact lens grew Fusarium species. On
		"histologic examination, fungal filaments were seen on both surfaces of the"
		contact lens as well as invading the lens matrix. The fungal morphology changed
		"as the fungus penetrated the contact lens. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is"
		the first documented case of fungal invasion of a methafilcon matrix lens and the
		second histologically documented case of Fusarium invasion of a contact lens.

TI	-	Disseminated Fusarium infections in patients following bone marrow

PG	-	653-8
AB	-	Intensive immunosuppressive therapy and broad spectrum antibiotics predispose
		cancer patients to opportunistic fungal infections. Fusarium has rarely been
		"reported as a pathogen in immunocompromised patients, but is almost uniformly"
		fatal. Only six cases of disseminated Fusarium infection have been described in
		patients following bone marrow transplantation (BMT). We report here two
		additional cases. Fusarium infection initially presented with pyomyositis in one
		patient and with embolic skin lesions in another following T cell-depleted BMT.
		Both patients died with active Fusarium infection despite an extensive course of
		"amphotericin B, rifampicin and granulocyte transfusions. From this experience and"
		"from a review of the literature, Fusarium infections appear to be increasing in"
		prevalence as significant pathogens in immunocompromised hosts and are resistant
		to many conventional forms of therapy.

PG	-	5
AB	-	Fusarium is a filamentous fungus found naturally in the soil and as a contaminant
		"of plumbing systems. In immunocompetent patients, Fusarium causes localized"
		"infection, most commonly onychomycosis. Fusarium tends to be resistant to"
		"commonly used antifungal medications. In immunocompromised patients, this"
		antifungal resistance is of particular concern because localized infection
		quickly becomes disseminated disease with high mortality rates. Disseminated
		fusariosis presents with skin lesions more often than any other systemic fungal
		infection. We present a case of fusariosis in an 11-year-old neutropenic patient
		with acute lymphoblastic leukemia whose only symptom of the fungal infection
		"consisted of painful, indurated nodules and plaques on her legs. The diagnosis"
		and treatment of this invasive fungal infection is also discussed.

TI	-	Fungal keratitis in a daily disposable soft contact lens wearer.
PG	-	111-2
AB	-	PURPOSE: To report the first case of fungal keratitis in a patient wearing daily
		disposable soft contact lenses. METHODS: Case Report. A 20-year-old white female
		in good health developed a corneal ulcer in her lefteye associated with daily
		disposable soft contact lens wear. There was no history of trauma to the left
		"eye, and she denied overnight wear. Corneal scrapings were taken, and the patient"
		was started on intensive tobramycin 14 mg/mL and cefazolin 50 mg/mL topical
		"therapy for suspected bacterial keratitis. After 3 days of antibacterial therapy,"
		the ulcer worsened. The cultures were negative as were the Gram stain and
		Gomori's methenamine silver stain. Initial cultures and stains were then repeated
		with the addition of a culture for herpes simplex virus. The developing clinical
		picture was suspicious for fungal keratitis. The patient was then started on
		"intensive vancomycin 2%, natamycin 5%, and continued on fortified tobramycin."
		"Three days after the second corneal scrapings were performed, a positive fungal"
		culture was obtained for Fusarium sp. Vancomycin and tobramycin were then
		discontinued and amphotericin B 0.15% was added to natamycin 5% with the
		continuation of intensive topical therapy. RESULTS: The patient's keratitis was
		successfully treated with intensive double antifungal therapy. CONCLUSIONS:
		Infectious keratitis in daily disposable soft contact lens wear is an unusual

		patient.
PG	-	177-86
AB	-	A 61-year-old male with leukemia manifested multiple cutaneous nodules on his
		"whole body surface, subcutaneous nodules on his arms and a tongue tumor. Septate"
		hyphae were observed microscopically in scrapings from the surfaces of the
		cutaneous lesions. Fusarium solani and F. anthophilum were isolated from
		scrapings from the several skin lesions. Histological examination revealed the
		presence of numerous septate hyphae in the lumina of vessels in the dermis. The
		fungal elements in the cutaneous tissues were suggested to be Fusarium by an
		immunoperoxidase method using a genus-specific anti-Fusarium antibody. Although
		no evidence of fungal infection was found in other organs by clinical
		"examinations, F. solani and/or F. anthophilum were considered to have undergone"
		"hematogenous dissemination, because of the presence of thrombi containing"
		abundant fungal elements in the skin lesion. The present case is a case of
		"disseminated cutaneous Fusarium infection, in which fungal elements in skin"
		"tissue sections were immunohistochemically regarded as Fusarium, though fungus"
		cultures from biopsied specimens were negative.

PG	-	435-7
AB	-	Imaging findings from a single case of disseminated infection with Fusarium are
		presented. This common fungus has been reported as a rare pathogen to the
		immunocompromised. Disseminated foci were identified on a Tc-99m HMPAO labeled
		"WBC study. Two foci were localized to the proximal tibia using MRI. In this case,"
		"imaging was more sensitive to the extent of disease than physical examination,"
		and it also provided a more precise estimate of disease progression than clinical
		evaluation alone. Imaging offers potential to track regression and to identify
		early recurrence. This is especially valuable because infection with Fusarium
		tends to be indolent.

LID	-	10.2147/OPTH.S23293 [doi]
AB	-	The authors describe a case of keratomycosis that appeared after the exeresis of
		a pterygium. A 48-year-old patient had been referred with a red right eye
		associated with an abscess of the cornea along the ablation zone of the
		pterygium. The surgery had been performed a month beforehand. The abscess was 6
		mm high and 4 mm wide. The authors instigated a treatment that included
		amphotericin B (0.25%) after noticing a clinical aspect evoking a fungal
		"keratitis and finding several septate filaments on direct examination. On day 10,"
		"a Fusarium dimerum was isolated on Sabouraud agar. After 15 days of treatment,"
		the result was favorable and the size of the ulceration as well as the size of
		the abscess had progressively decreased. The antifungal treatment was
		definitively stopped at 14 weeks. Infectious-related complications of the
		pterygium surgery are rare and are essentially caused by bacterial agents.
		Secondary infections by fungus are rare. There have been two previous cases
		reported: one that appeared 15 years after radiotherapy and another that appeared
		"at 3 weeks post surgery, consecutive to the use of mitomycin C. To the authors'"
		"knowledge, this is the first case of a keratomycosis due to F. dimerum reported"
		that complicated the exeresis of a pterygium without the use of an adjuvant
		"antihealing treatment. Pterygium surgery is a common procedure; nevertheless,"
		ophthalmologists need to be aware of the existence of potential infectious
		complications.

AB	-	Fungal infections due to Fusarium species are mostly present in immunocompromised
		and patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. We report a case of lower
		extremity skin infection caused by Fusarium species in a 61-year-old woman
		diagnosed with sickle cell disease. Single skin ulceration caused by Fusarium
		"species can result from fungal inoculation into damaged tissue, so any condition"
		that damages the skin can be considered as a risk factor for inoculation.
		Long-standing sickle cell disease may develop vaso-occlusion in the skin that can
		produce lower extremity ulcers and myofascial syndromes. The mechanism is not
		"completely characterized, but compromised blood flow, endothelial dysfunction,"
		"thrombosis, inflammation, and delayed healing are thought to contribute to"
		locally compromised tissue that may eventually lead to opportunistic infection
		such as in our case. Other factors contribute to the pathophysiology of lower
		"extremity ulcers such as diabetes mellitus, with the resulting peripheral"
		"vascular ischemia causing poor circulation to the lower extremity, and peripheral"
		"neuropathy, which can make patients with diabetes unaware of minor trauma leading"
		to the development of skin infections.

PG	-	321-4
AB	-	We report a case of fatal central nervous system infection with Scedosporium
		apiospermum (Pseudallescheria boydii) in a heart transplant recipient. This
		ubiquitous fungus is known to cause mycetoma and localized infections in patients
		with otherwise normal conditions. Disseminated infections occur rarely and are
		seen primarily in patients who are receiving immunosuppressive medications or who
		have neutropenia. Often life-threatening when infection is disseminated and
		"involves the central nervous system, this diagnosis is difficult to make rapidly"
		"because S. apiospermum (P. boydii) mimics Aspergillus spp. and Fusarium spp.,"
		"both clinically and histopathologically. Imidazoles such as miconazole, but not"
		"amphotericin B, are considered the therapeutic compounds of choice. Improved"
		diagnostic and treatment options are needed to optimize management of infections
		with S. apiospermum (P. boydii).

		adjuvant therapy.
PG	-	omaa032
LID	-	10.1093/omcr/omaa032 [doi]
LID	-	omaa032
AB	-	Fungal keratitis is an ocular infection that has no standardized treatment. The
		"etiological agents most frequently reported in the literature are Fusarium spp.,"
		"Aspergillus spp., Alternaria spp. and Curvularia spp., related to injuries and"
		Candida albicans related to contact lens wear. Here we present a case of
		bilateral fungal keratitis of a few days of evolution with insufficient response
		to antifungal pharmacological treatment and with early application of
		cross-linking in both eyes as an adjuvant therapy. A review of the current status
		of cross-linking for the treatment of corneal infections is presented.

		Response to Fluconazole.
PG	-	307-310
LID	-	10.4103/idoj.IDOJ_289_18 [doi]
AB	-	Hyalohyphomycosis are opportunistic fungal infections caused by fungi with
		colorless septate hyphae. Fusarium is a hyalohyphomycetes which can cause
		localized or disseminated infections depending on host immunity. Our patient had
		an infectious lesion over the coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) scar which
		was not responding to antibacterial treatment. Further investigations revealed it
		to be localized cutaneous Fusarium infection. The patient was treated with
		fluconazole 3 mg/kg/day for 3 weeks and responded very well without any
		"recurrence during the next 3 months follow-up. Thus, this case highlights the"
		effectiveness of fluconazole in uncommon fungal infection.

TI	-	Co-infection of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and cutaneous Fusarium infection
		in a patient with pyoderma gangrenosum.
PG	-	199-203
AB	-	We report an unusual case of co-infection of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis
		(IPA) and fusarial skin infection in a patient with classic pyoderma gangrenosum
		"with unknown causes, which were previously controlled with oral prednisolone,"
		cyclosporine. The diagnosis was made on direct microscopy and culture of
		"endobronchial washing, bronchoalveolar lavage and skin lesion biopsy. The"
		"treatment failed, and the patient expired 12 days following hospitalization. This"
		report highlights the rarity of coexistence of IPA and a chronic fusarial skin
		infection and thereby reinforcing the physician's attention toward the
		possibility of invasive fungal infection in the immunosuppressed patients.

		Clinical worsening despite hourly topical 5% natamycin drops prompted a repeat
		corneal scraping and microbiological evaluation. RESULTS: The causative fungi for
		the initial keratitis were Fusarium and Aspergillus species. All the five
		specimens obtained from repeat scrapings revealed Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The
		cultures obtained from the natamycin eye drops being used by the patients also
		"grew pseudomonas. On further evaluation, the source of contamination of the"
		"natamycin containers was obscure but speculated to be nosocomial, being within"
		the hospital or the pharmacy. All patients had a poor visual outcome with one
		"requiring evisceration because of panophthalmitis, whereas three underwent"
		therapeutic keratoplasty. CONCLUSIONS: A high index of suspicion is recommended
		in all cases of worsening fungal keratitis to identify secondary contamination of
		antifungal agents with nosocomial infections.

AB	-	The introduction of the prophylactic use of antifungal drugs caused the increased
		"occurrence of invasive fungal infections due to previously rare molds, such as"
		"fusariosis, after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. We herein"
		report the case of a patient with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who developed
		fungemia due to Fusarium solani during liposormal amphotericin B on day 25 after
		cord blood transplantation (CBT). Because Fusarium species might differ in
		"virulence and drug susceptibility, the sequencing of the internal transcribed"
		spacer region of the ribosomal RNA gene accurately identified Fusarium solani to
		be the cause of fungemia at the species level. This case highlights Fusarium
		solani as the cause of fungemia in a patient under liposormal amphotericin B
		treatment after CBT.

TI	-	Successful treatment of antifungal- and cryotherapy-resistant subcutaneous
		hyalohyphomycosis in an immunocompetent case with topical 5% imiquimod cream.
PG	-	521-6
AB	-	Hyalohyphomycosis is an unusual opportunistic mycotic infection where the tissue
		"morphology of the causative organism is mycelial. Etiological agents, which are"
		"not responsible for the otherwise-named infections like aspergillosis, are the"
		"species of non-dematiaceous hyaline hyphomycetes including Penicillium,"
		"Paecilomyces, Acremonium (formerly known Cephalosporium), Beauveria, Fusarium,"
		and Scopulariopsis. Several cases of Acremonium infection have been described in
		immunocompromised patients; however it can cause invasive disease in an
		immunocompetent person very rarely. Optimum therapy of Acremonium infection is
		unclear because of the limited number of reported cases and conflicting results
		"of therapies. Imiquimod, an imidazoquinoline with potent antiviral, antitumor and"
		"immunoregulatory properties, is currently approved for the topical treatment of"
		external anogenital warts and actinic keratosis. Imiquimod has also been found to
		"be effective for other virus-associated dermatologic lesions, including common"
		"and flat warts, molluscum contagiosum, and herpes simplex virus type-2 as well as"
		"for some cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis. We report herein, for the first time,"
		a case of unusually recalcitrant hyalohyphomycosis of the face due to Acremonium
		strictum successfully treated with topical 5% imiquimod in an immunocompetent
		"patient, who had failed to respond to various antifungals, including"
		"itraconazole, and cryotherapy."

AB	-	PURPOSE: To heighten awareness of occult fungal scleritis. METHOD: Case report
		and review of the literature. RESULTS: A 73-year-old woman with diabetes mellitus
		was diagnosed for 3 months with immune-mediated scleritis and subsequently
		"treated with corticosteroids. On referral, the patient had a scleral nodule with"
		contiguous corneal infiltrate and hypopyon. Culture grew Fusarium species not
		further classified. The infection could not be controlled with antifungal
		"therapy, and the eye was removed. No exogenous or endogenous source for the"
		infection could be identified by clinical history or examination. CONCLUSION:
		"Fungal scleritis can develop in persons without a history of foreign body injury,"
		"minor trauma, or evidence of endogenous fungemia. A high index of suspicion for"
		infectious scleritis must be maintained in persons with presumed immune-mediated
		"scleritis who fail to respond to conventional therapy, particularly if they"
		present with decreased visual acuity.

TI	-	Detection of fungal hyphae using smartphone and pocket magnifier: going cellular.
PG	-	355-7
LID	-	10.1097/ICO.0000000000000359 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to detect fungal hyphae in a corneal scraping
		sample using a cost-effective assembly of smartphone and pocket magnifier.
		"METHODS: In this case report, a tissue sample was obtained by conventional"
		corneal scraping from a clinically suspicious case of mycotic keratitis. The
		"smear was stained with Gram stain, and a 10% potassium hydroxide mount was"
		prepared. It was imaged using a smartphone coupled with a compact pocket
		magnifier and integrated light-emitting diode assembly at point-of-care.
		Photographs of multiple sections of slides were viewed using smartphone screen
		and pinch-to-zoom function. The same slides were subsequently screened under a
		light microscope by an experienced microbiologist. The scraping from the ulcer
		was also inoculated on blood agar and Sabouraud dextrose agar. RESULTS:
		Smartphone-based digital imaging revealed the presence of gram-positive organism
		with hyphae. Examination under a light microscope also yielded similar findings.
		"Fusarium was cultured from the corneal scraping, confirming the diagnosis of"
		"mycotic keratitis. The patient responded to topical 5% natamycin therapy, with"
		resolution of the ulcer after 4 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Smartphones can be
		"successfully used as novel point-of-care, cost-effective, reliable microscopic"
		screening tools.

PG	-	374-9
LID	-	10.1111/j.1399-3062.2011.00608.x [doi]
AB	-	The occurrence of infections due to previously rare opportunistic pathogens is
		increasing despite the use of novel treatment strategies for immunocompromised
		"patients. Here, we report the case of a patient presenting with fever, muscle"
		"pain, and bilateral endophthalmitis after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell"
		transplantation. Fusarium solani was isolated from peripheral blood samples and
		"identified as the cause of gradual bilateral vision loss, despite appropriate"
		"antifungal prophylaxis, and therapy including vitrectomy and intraocular"
		instillation of antifungal agents. The patient became comatose; basal meningitis
		involving both optic nerves was suspected based on magnetic resonance tomography.
		The patient died 8 days later due to septic multi-organ failure. Autopsy revealed
		"that both kidneys, but no other organs, were infiltrated by Fusarium. No fungus"
		was found in cerebral tissues or cerebrospinal fluid. Our case demonstrates some
		of the typical clinical features of systemic fusariosis and its potentially fatal
		outcome. The clinical observations reported here may help clinicians caring for
		immunocompromised patients to accelerate diagnosis and initiate treatment early
		"at the onset of this fatal complication, and highlight the urgent need for"
		interdisciplinary management of invasive fusariosis.

PG	-	711-3
LID	-	10.1111/j.1365-4632.2012.05761.x [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Hyalohyphomycosis is a rare opportunistic fungal infection caused by
		"saprophytes of genera such as Fusarium, Paecilomyces, Scedosporium, Penicillium,"
		"Scopulariopsis Acremonium, and similar fungi. The literature includes only one"
		previous report of Paecilomyces variotii human infection and very few reports of
		subcutaneous mycosis caused by any of the hyalohyphomycosis group of fungi.
		"METHODS: We report an instance of fungal infection in a 50-year-old woman, known"
		"to have diabetes, who presented with multiple raised lesions on the upper back of"
		"two years' duration. Dermatological examination revealed a 20 × 22-cm, swollen,"
		"indurated area on the upper back with multiple violaceous, exophytic nodules on"
		the surface. RESULTS: Microscopy from pus and tissue smear revealed septate
		branching fungi. Periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain was positive for fungal
		elements. Culture on three occasions yielded P. variotii. Slide culture mounts
		showed septate hyaline hyphae of P. variotii with elongated phialides
		demonstrating bulbous bases and tapering apices attached to the conidiophores.
		"The patient was treated with itraconazole, to which she responded well."
		CONCLUSIONS: This is the first reported case of subcutaneous hyalohyphomycosis
		caused by P. variotii. It appears that this relatively rare fungal pathogen may
		be starting to assert itself as an important cause of infection in humans.

		of the fungus because of bacterial overgrowth in culture. The authors report the
		cases of two immunocompetent patients with F. solani onychomycosis coinfected
		with P. aeruginosa. Both presented with a greenish/yellowish discolouration and
		"thickening of a thumbnail, and were treated with systemic ciprofloxacin in"
		combination with itraconazole or terbinafine.

AB	-	A case of disseminated invasive fusarial infection (DFI) with sinus involvement
		in a patient with acute myeloblastic leukaemia is reported. Amphotericin B with
		rifampin were administrated and wide radical sinus surgery was performed.
		"Nevertheless, the patient died six weeks later. The four principal forms of"
		"fusarial infections in humans are discussed: toxicosis, allergic fungal"
		"sinusitis, locally invasive infection, and disseminated invasive infection."
		"Prognosis of DFI in the immunocompromised host is usually poor, and treatment is"
		difficult. Profound and prolonged neutropaenia appears to be the major
		predisposing factor. The literature on infections caused by Fusarium species in
		"immunocompromised hosts is reviewed, especially those where the sinuses were"
		involved.

		"pathogen. It usually invades rapidly in immunocompromised hosts, and often"

		"mellitus who had untreated fusarial infection of the nails, which developed into"
		"subcutaneous fusariosis, superinfected by bacteria, and then evolved into"
		osteomyelitis that subsequently resulted in septic shock. Early management of
		mycotic nails in immunocompromised hosts is crucial to prevent life-threatening

		case of a 4-year-old Han Chinese girl presenting with an itchy mass on her right
		face of almost 2 years' duration. Direct smear of the lesion sample was positive
		for fungal hyphae. Biopsy of the lesion showed many fungal hyphae in the
		epidermis and dermis. The pathogen was identified as Fusarium lichenicola by
		molecular sequencing and phylogenetic analysis based on the TEF-1α gene.
		Whole-exome sequencing analysis using her peripheral blood revealed a
		"heterozygous mutation in the STAT3 gene, which is related to autosomal dominant"
		hyper-immunoglobulin E syndrome (AD-HIES). The lesion improved following
		"treatment with i.v. and intralesional amphotericin B, oral voriconazole and"
		"topical luliconazole cream. To our knowledge, this is the second reported case of"
		a special localized cutaneous lesion caused by Fusarium species in a child with
		AD-HIES. Both cases suggest that STAT3 deficiency may increase susceptibility to
		fusariosis.

		diagnosis.
PG	-	265-7
AB	-	Cytotoxic T cell lymphomas of the skin include a spectrum of a peripheral T cell
		and natural killer (NK) cell lymphomas with primary and secondary skin
		manifestation and bad prognosis. Fusarium species have recently emerged as the
		"second most common pathogenic fungi in immunocompromised patients, and they are"
		moderately resistant to most antifungal agents. We report a woman with
		concomitant cytotoxin T cell lymphomas of the skin and Fusarium spp infection.
		Patient was treated at the same time with antiblastic and antifungal therapy.
		First line antifungal therapy was amphotericin B-lipid complex (3 mg/Kg iv/die)
		"and then for clinical failure voriconazole (6 mg/Kg bid, loading dose and 4 mg"
		/Kg bid). Lymphoma was treated with a CHOEP 21 regiment without remission and
		after with gemcitabine and vinerolbine. Patient presented a partial remission of
		cutaneous and pulmonary lesions. Our case is intrinsically interesting because
		Fusarium infection was concomitant to cutaneous lymphoma and did non occur during
		neutropenic phases of chemotherapy. In a case with multiple ulcerated nodules of
		the skin is very important to discriminate from disseminated cutaneous Fusarium
		infection and neoplastic conditions such as cutaneous lymphoma. Early treatment
		of Fusarium infection in a patient with neoplastic disease could avoid a
		dissemination during immunosuppressive condition caused by antiblastic therapy.

		from the Fusarium Solani Complex.
LID	-	10.3390/jof7121093 [doi]
LID	-	1093
AB	-	Fusarium spp. are moulds ubiquitously distributed in nature and only occasionally
		pathogenic for humans. Species of the Fusarium solani complex are the predominant
		"keratitis-inducing pathogens, because they are endowed with proper virulence"
		"factors. These fungi can adhere to the cornea creating a biofilm and, with the"
		"help of enzymes and cytotoxins, penetrate the cornea. Whereas an intact cornea is"
		hardly able to be invaded by Fusarium spp. in spite of appropriate virulence
		"factors, these opportunistic fungi may profit from predisposing conditions, for"
		example mechanical injuries. This can lead to a progressive course of corneal
		infection and may finally affect the whole eye up to the need for enucleation.
		"Here, we present and discuss the clinical, microbiological and histopathological"
		aspects of a particular case due to Fusarium tonkinense of the Fusarium solani
		complex with severe consequences in a patient without any obvious predisposing
		"factors. A broad portfolio of antifungal agents was applied, both topically and"
		systemically as well as two penetrating keratoplasties were performed. The exact
		determination of the etiologic agent of the fungal infection proved likewise to
		be very challenging.

AB	-	Cutaneous involvement is often an initial presentation of infection with Fusarium
		"species, which occurs more commonly in immunocompromised hosts and may be either"
		"localized or widespread. Skin lesions typically appear as red or grey macules,"
		which may develop central ulceration and black eschar. Secondary dissemination to
		"extracutaneous organs may occur in immunocompromised hosts, especially those with"
		prolonged and severe neutropenia. We describe a case of widespread cutaneous
		involvement after infection with Fusarium solani in childhood acute lymphoblastic
		leukaemia that responded successfully to treatment with prolonged liposomal
		amphotericin B.

PG	-	105-11
AB	-	Subcutaneous granulomatous lesions by hyaline moulds are rare. This report
		describes a case of hyalohyphomycosis by Fusarium oxysporum. The patient was a
		16-year-old Sri Lankan girl who had had extensive lesions in both arms almost
		from infancy. The fungus was demonstrated in KOH mounts and in histopathological
		sections. It was isolated repeatedly from her lesions over a period of 10 months.
		Combined therapy with ketoconazole and 5-fluorocytosine resulted in marked
		improvement. An inherent immune defect is postulated to account for the prolonged
		and extensive infection by a relatively non-aggressive fungus.

PG	-	585-8
AB	-	Endogenous fungal endophthalmitis is being increasingly recognized in susceptible
		individuals. We report a case of endogenous endophthalmitis due to Fusarium
		solani that occurred as the sole clinical manifestation of fungal disease in an
		immunocompromised host. Four previously reported cases of endogenous fusarial
		endophthalmitis are also reviewed. Two of these patients had no underlying
		"disease and presented with isolated endophthalmitis, while two other patients had"
		acute leukemia and presented with multiple organ involvement due to Fusarium. All
		"three patients with leukemia, including our patient, were severely neutropenic at"
		the time of diagnosis. Two of these three patients had fungemia. MICs of
		amphotericin B for fungal isolates ranged from 0.14 to 10 micrograms/mL. Despite
		"abatement of the endophthalmitis after antifungal therapy and vitrectomy, the"
		prognosis for immunocompromised patients remains guarded because of underlying
		disease.

AB	-	PURPOSE: To describe 2 cases of recalcitrant fungal keratitis successfully
		treated with intracameral Amphotericin B. METHODS: Interventional case series.
		RESULTS: A 59-year-old female and a 41-year-old male each presented with fungal
		"keratitis, caused by Bipolaris spp. and Fusarium spp. respectively. Both cases"
		"were unresponsive to topical antifungals, causing persistent discomfort and"
		decreased vision. The two patients subsequently received a single dose of
		"intracameral amphotericin B (ICAMB) 10mcg/0.1 mL, in addition to continued"
		"topical natamycin. Both patients had remarkable results following ICAMB, with"
		best corrected visual acuity of 20/20 and full corneal reepithelization following
		treatment. CONCLUSIONS: We report 2 cases of intractable fungal keratitis that
		benefited from intracameral injections of amphotericin B. This route of delivery
		appears to be very effective because the medication is delivered directly to the
		"deeper layers of the cornea, where fungal infections tend to reside, and where"
		topical and systemic routes have difficulty accessing.

PG	-	773-6
AB	-	Two cases of Fusarium infection in children with neuroblastoma are reported. One
		of the patients had an overwhelming infection and the diagnosis was based on
		"isolation of Fusarium moniliforme from blood and skin biopsy, and histological"
		findings. The second patient developed chronic polyarthritis and Fusarium solani
		was cultured from synovial fluid samples taken from two different joints four
		months apart. No histological documentation of infection was obtained. The
		"response to antifungal therapy was unfavourable. Both patients died, but in the"
		second case the relationship between fungal infection and death was not
		established.

PG	-	119-21
AB	-	PURPOSE: We studied a case in which a patient had unilateral retinal infiltrates
		and a retinal vasculopathy resembling frosted branch angiitis. He later admitted
		to injecting cocaine intravenously. METHODS: The patient underwent a pars plana
		vitrectomy and received intravitreal and intravenous amphotericin B. RESULTS: The
		vitreous fluid grew Fusarium dimerium. There was rapid response to the treatment
		and full recovery of vision. CONCLUSION: Fusarium species should be considered as
		a potential pathogen in intravenous drug abusers with endogenous endophthalmitis
		and in patients with unilateral frosted branch angiitis.

AB	-	Disseminated fusariosis is an uncommon clinical condition in immunocompromised
		patients. We report a fatal case of disseminated fusariosis secondary to
		"neuroblastoma in a male patient, 15 years old, who underwent a bone marrow"
		transplant. The patient was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU)
		"of a public hospital in Recife-PE, Brazil, presenting bone marrow aplasia, severe"
		"leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. After 15 days, the patient developed right knee"
		effusion. Synovial fluid and blood samples were analyzed at the Medical Mycology
		Laboratory of the Federal University of Pernambuco. Mycological diagnosis was
		based on the presence of hyaline septate hyphae on direct examination and the
		"isolation of Fusarium oxysporum in culture, confirming the case of disseminated"
		"fusariosis. In vitro, the isolate showed fluconazole resistance and sensitivity"
		"to amphotericin B, anidulafungin, and voriconazole. Therapy with voriconazole in"
		combination with liposomal amphotericin B led to an improved clinical response;
		"however, due to underlying disease complications, the patient progressed to"
		death.

TI	-	An unusual case of anaphylaxis. Mold in pancake mix.
PG	-	292-5
AB	-	Anaphylactic reactions involve contact with an antigen that evokes an immune
		reaction that is harmful. This type of reaction is a rapidly developing
		immunologic reaction termed a type I hypersensitivity reaction. The antigen
		complexes with an IgE antibody that is bound to mast cells and basophils in a
		"previously sensitized individual. Upon re-exposure, vasoactive and spasmogenic"
		substances are released that act on vessels and smooth muscle. The reaction can
		be local or systemic and may be fatal. The authors report the death of a
		"19-year-old white male who had a history of ""multiple allergies,"" including pets,"
		"molds, and penicillin. One morning, he and his friends made pancakes with a"
		packaged mix that had been opened and in the cabinet for approximately 2 years.
		The friends stopped eating the pancakes because they said that they tasted like
		"""rubbing alcohol."" The decedent continued to eat the pancakes and suddenly became"
		"short of breath. He was taken to a nearby clinic, where he became unresponsive"
		"and died. At autopsy, laryngeal edema and hyperinflated lungs with mucous"
		"plugging were identified. Microscopically, edema and numerous degranulating mast"
		"cells were identified in the larynx. The smaller airways contained mucus, and"
		findings of chronic asthma were noted. Serum tryptase was elevated at 14.0 ng/ml.
		The pancake mix was analyzed and found to contain a total mold count of 700/g of
		"mix as follows: Penicillium, Fusarium, Mucor, and Aspergillus. Witness statements"
		indicate that the decedent ate two pancakes; thus he consumed an approximate mold
		"count of 21,000. The decedent had a history of allergies to molds and penicillin,"
		and thus was allergic to the molds in the pancake mix. The authors present this
		unusual case of anaphylaxis and a review of the literature.

PG	-	432-6
AB	-	"Pulmonary mycotoxicosis (PM), also termed organic dust toxic syndrome or silo"
		"unloader's syndrome, is an acute illness resulting from massive inhalation of"
		microbial toxins in organic dusts. It has not been well described histologically.
		Three cases of PM are presented in this report. Open lung biopsies were examined
		in each case. All of the patients were farmers with no prior lung disease. One
		"had burning in his eyes, throat, and chest after exposure to moldy silage;"
		"chills, fever, dry cough, malaise, and weakness developed within 24 hours. Two"
		"patients presented with fever, progressive dyspnea, cough, and fatigue within 24"
		"hours of emptying a corncrib, cleaning a chicken coop, and baling hay. Bilateral"
		alveolar and interstitial infiltrates on chest roentgenograms and leukocytosis
		with neutrophilia were observed in all of the three patients. Two patients became
		hypoxemic and required mechanical ventilation. Histologic examination showed
		acute and organizing diffuse alveolar damage in two biopsy specimens and an acute
		bronchopneumonia in the third. One specimen had 1- to 10-microm ovoid organisms
		demonstrable with methenamine silver stains; cultures grew Fusarium and
		Penicillium species. The other two biopsy specimens had negative tissue cultures
		"and special stains for organisms, although Penicillium species were grown from a"
		preoperative bronchoalveolar lavage in one case. The two patients on mechanical
		ventilation recovered completely with high-dose steroids. The third patient
		recovered without steroids. No patient had residual functional deficits or chest
		radiographic abnormalities. PM can be distinguished from allergic and infectious
		diseases common in individuals exposed to large amounts of organic dust by its
		clinicopathologic features.

PG	-	210-3
LID	-	10.1097/ICO.0b013e3181a1648b [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: To report a case of simultaneous Acanthamoeba and Fusarium keratitis
		associated with no-rub multipurpose contact lens solution and silicone hydrogel
		contact lens use. METHOD: Observational case report. RESULTS: A 39-year-old woman
		was referred for worsening of a presumed bacterial corneal ulcer in the setting
		"of silicone hydrogellens wear with occasional overnight wear, no-rub multipurpose"
		"contact lens solution use, and combined topical antibiotic/corticosteroid"
		treatment. Initial corneal scrapings and culture confirmed Acanthamoeba and
		"Fusarium solani, corroborated by in vivo confocal microscopy findings, yet"
		"despite topical chlorhexidine 0.02%, propamidine 1%,neomycin/polymyxin B"
		"ointment, and natamycin 5% along with oral itraconazole, the ulcer worsened. Four"
		"days after amoebic and fungal therapy initiation, it was discovered that the"
		"pharmacy accidentally dispensed neomycin/polymyxin B/dexamethasone, and despite"
		"immediate discontinuation, therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty from corneal"
		melting was ultimately required. Corneal histopathology confirmed the presence of
		amoebic cysts and fungal elements. CONCLUSIONS: Coexisting infection with
		Acanthamoeba and Fusarium species can occur in contact lens wear. Atypical
		infection must be considered in patients with corneal ulcers demonstrating poor
		therapeutic response in the setting of contact lens wear. Corticosteroids should
		"be used with extreme caution in contact lens–related corneal infections,"
		especially when the diagnosis remains unknown because they can lead to
		acceleration of active infection and keratolysis.

AB	-	Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with inv(16)(p13.1q22) resulting in CBFB-MYH11
		fusion is associated with a favorable prognosis. The presence of a KIT mutation
		"modifies it to an intermediate prognosis. Additionally, inv(16) can cooperate"
		with other genetic aberrations to further increase cell proliferation.
		Coexistence of inv(16) and t(9;22) is extremely rare (20 cases). We present a
		case of a 55-year-old male with elevated white blood cell count. Bone marrow
		evaluation and flow cytometry analysis were compatible with AML with monocytic
		"features. Cytogenetic studies revealed two-related clones, a minor clone with"
		inv(16) and a major clone with concurrent inv(16) and t(9;22) rearrangements.
		Fluorescent in situ hybridization studies confirmed these rearrangements.
		Molecular analysis detected a p190 BCR-ABL1 transcript protein. KIT mutations
		were negative. The patient was initially treated with standard induction regimen;
		"7 daily doses of cytarabine from day 1-day 7, 3 daily doses of daunorubicin from"
		"day 1-day 3, and 1 dose of Mylotarg (gemtuzumab ozogamicin) on day 1. The"
		detection of t(9;22) led to the addition of daily doses of dasatinib (tyrosine
		kinase inhibitor) from day 7 onwards. The patient achieved complete remission on
		"day 45. During his treatment course, he acquired disseminated Fusarium infection."
		Day 180 bone marrow evaluation revealed florid relapse with 64% blasts.
		Cytogenetic study showed clonal evolution of the inv(16) clone with no evidence
		"of the t(9;22) subclone. Eventually, bone marrow transplantation was"
		"contraindicated, and the patient was transferred to palliative care. Literature"
		review revealed that AML with co-occurrence of CBFB-MYH11 and BCR-ABL1 gene
		rearrangements was involved by only a small number of cases with de novo and
		therapy-related AML. Most cases were in myeloid blast crisis of chronic myeloid
		leukemia (CML). Treatment and prognosis among the de novo AML cases varied and
		"majority of them achieved clinical remission. In contrast, these cytogenetic"
		abnormalities in the blast phase of CML had a poor prognosis. As the prognosis
		and management of AML is dependent upon the underlying genetic characteristics of
		"the neoplasm, it is imperative to include clinical outcome with such rare"
		combinations of genetic alterations.

PG	-	202-7
AB	-	Post mortem examination of a juvenile loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta)
		stranded in the Canary Islands revealed a fishing-line in the small intestine.
		"Histologically, severe necrotic enteritis, multiple haemorrhages, and marked"
		oedema of the intestinal submucosa were observed. Yeast cells and fungal hyphae
		were seen in the lamina propria of the intestinal mucosa and in the connective
		tissue of the submucosa. Because fungal cultures were not taken at the time of
		"necropsy, an immunohistochemical study was performed in order to identify the"
		fungus involved. Specific monoclonal and heterologously absorbed polyclonal
		"antibodies served as the primary reagents for identification of aspergillosis,"
		"candidiasis, fusariosis, geotricosis, scedosporiosis, and zygomycosis, using an"
		indirect immunofluorescence staining technique. The fungal elements were strongly
		stained only by a polyclonal antibody against Candida albicans and a monoclonal
		antibody against C. albicans. There are no known previous reports of Candida sp.
		causing skin disease or systemic mycotic infection in sea turtles.

AB	-	Foot infections are common and serious complications of diabetic patients. We
		report the case of a 68-year-old patient with a diabetic foot infection that
		developed into a gangrenous necrosis. Fusarium spp. was isolated on two
		successive occasions with no other associated microorganisms. Histopathology
		demonstrated invasion of the fungus into the tisssue. These findings suggested an
		infection rather than colonization. A detailed morphological study showed that
		"the isolate was Fusarium acutatum, which was confirmed by rDNA sequencing. This"
		fungus is found only in Asia and has not been previously reported as a human

		patients without neutropenia. We report a case of fungaemia in a 78-year-old
		French woman without definite immunodeficiency. Fusarium proliferatum grew from
		both central and peripheral blood cultures. Fever was the only clinical sign of
		the infection. An appropriate antifungal therapy with voriconazole led to the
		recovery of the patient. An environmental investigation was undertaken but failed
		to find a reservoir of Fusarium spores. A contaminated central venous catheter
		might have been the source of fungaemia.

PG	-	367-72
AB	-	"Despite appropriate antimicrobial and antifungal therapy (amphotericin B), a"
		disseminated infection with Fusarium oxysporum in a 75-year-old immunocompromised
		"patient (acute myeloid leukaemia, minimal leucocyte count of 0.5 giga l-1) led"
		rapidly to death. A similarly fatal course of an F. oxysporum infection has been
		reported in several cases. Fusarium oxysporum could be isolated shortly before
		death from blood cultures and from a swab taken from skin efflorescences. An
		autopsy revealed histopathologically typical fungal infiltrates in the mucosa of
		"the pharynx, epiglottis, trachea, and oesophagus and in the parenchyma of the"
		"spleen, the lung and both kidneys. Because of the high risk of a fatal outcome of"
		"this infection, the clinician should aim at maximum diagnostic enforcement. We"
		propose both analysis of blood cultures and immediate skin biopsy--with
		PAS-staining--of suspicious dermal efflorescences for microscopic examination.
		The treatment of choice is discussed controversially but a beneficial effect has
		"been reported from granulocyte transfusion, subcutaneous administration of GM-CSF"
		and concomitant treatment with amphotericin B.

TI	-	A case of mycotic endophthalmitis after triamcinolone acetonide-assisted pars
		plana vitrectomy.
PG	-	51-4
AB	-	Only two cases of bacterial endophthalmitis after triamcinolone acetonide
		(TA)-assisted pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) have been reported. As far as we are
		aware there has been no report of fungal endophthalmitis occurring after
		TA-assisted PPV. We report a case of endophthalmitis due to Fusarium after
		TA-assisted PPV. An otherwise healthy 61-year-old woman suffered from branch
		"retinal vein occlusion with macular edema, which led to reduced visual acuity and"
		"metamorphopsia. Because she complained of severe discomfort, TA-assisted PPV was"
		performed to reduce the macular edema. At the end of the surgery 4 mg TA was
		injected into the vitreous cavity. Two weeks after the surgery her visual acuity
		had improved to 20/20. Six weeks after the surgery her visual acuity decreased to
		20/200 but without pain. Slit lamp examination showed no conjunctival hyperemia
		and no inflammatory cell infiltration in the anterior chamber. Fundus examination
		"showed several small, creamy-white, circumscribed retinal lesions, epiretinal"
		"membranes, vitreoretinal traction, and rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. PPV was"
		performed again. Intra-operative light microscopy revealed filamentous fungi in
		"the epiretinal membrane, which was removed during the second PPV. Five days after"
		"the second surgery, retinal detachment recurred. A third PPV with encircling"
		procedures and silicone oil tamponade was performed. Fungal cultures from the
		epiretinal membrane were identified as Fusarium sp. Seven months after the third
		surgery the silicone oil was removed. The retina remained attached and visual
		acuity was 20/200. Any patient who has undergone TA-assisted PPV should be
		"carefully followed up for possible post-operative endophthalmitis, even if the"
		anterior segment abnormality is minor.

TI	-	Voriconazole-Induced Hepatotoxicity Resolved after Switching to Amphotericin B in
		Fusarium dimerum Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infection.
PG	-	e932544
LID	-	10.12659/AJCR.932544 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND Fusarium spp. is a rare cause of opportunistic life-threatening fungal
		infections. It has a remarkably high resistance profile with few effective
		"antifungal agents, mostly limited to voriconazole and liposomal amphotericin B."
		Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) by 1 of these 2 antifungal agents further
		complicates the management of these infections. CASE REPORT A 38-year-old woman
		with short bowel syndrome presented to the hospital with concerns of abdominal
		pain and loose stools. An abdominal CT was negative for inflammatory or ischemic
		"bowel disease, and there was no evidence of liver disease. She tested positive"
		for SARS-CoV-2 and required transfer to the ICU due to hypotension requiring
		"fluid resuscitation and vasopressors. On day 43 of her admission, the patient"
		"developed a low-grade fever, for which she underwent central-line and"
		peripheral-blood cultures that were positive for Fusarium dimerum. The central
		"line was removed and i.v. voriconazole started. After 3 days of treatment, the"
		patient's liver enzymes rose abruptly. Voriconazole was discontinued and replaced
		"with liposomal amphotericin B, and the liver enzymes improved significantly. The"
		patient completed 14 days of therapy and was discharged from the hospital.
		CONCLUSIONS This is a case of F. dimerum infection followed by DILI from
		voriconazole treatment. Her infection was resolved after switching to liposomal
		"amphotericin B, with improvement in liver enzymes on day 1 after discontinuing"
		voriconazole. This observation demonstrates that altering antifungal classes may
		be an appropriate strategy when confronted with DILI.

PG	-	1053-1063
LID	-	10.1093/mmy/myaa016 [doi]
AB	-	This report describes the phenotypic characteristics of a novel Penicillium
		"species, Penicillium labradorum, isolated from a 3-year-old male, castrated,"
		Labrador retriever with disseminated fungal disease. The dog's presenting
		"clinical signs included lethargy, lymphadenopathy, tachypnea, moderate pitting"
		"edema, and nonweight bearing lameness associated with the right hind limb."
		Fine-needle aspirate biopsies from the sublumbar and prescapular lymph nodes were
		initially examined. The cytologic findings were consistent with pyogranulomatous
		inflammation with abundant extracellular and phagocytized fungal fragments and
		"hyphae. Based on the morphology of the organisms and lack of endogenous pigment,"
		"hyalohyphomycosis was considered most likely, with Fusarium, Penicillium, and"
		Paecilomyces species being considerations. Fungal isolates were obtained via
		"culture of samples from the lymph nodes, and molecular identification testing"
		originally identified an undescribed Penicillium species belonging to the
		Penicillium section Exilicaulis. BLAST searches and phylogenetic analyses
		performed approximately 1 year and 9 months after the isolation date revealed an
		isolate within the Penicillium parvum clade in the Penicillium section
		"Exilicaulis but phylogenetically distant from the other species in the section,"
		"thus representing a new species, Penicillium labradorum. Antifungal"
		susceptibility testing was also performed on the isolate and low minimum
		"inhibitory concentrations were observed with terbinafine, voriconazole, and"
		"posaconazole, while in vitro resistance was observed with fluconazole. The dog"
		"had been previously treated with fluconazole, itraconazole, amphotericin B lipid"
		"complex, voriconazole, and terbinafine. Approximately 587 days after the initial"
		"diagnosis, the dog was euthanized due to worsening of clinical signs and concerns"
		for quality of life.

		"deficiency are infected with this mould, resulting in a considerably decreasing"

		associated with Fusarium sp. than with Candida sp. or Aspergillus sp. We describe
		"one patient with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, who was first treated with"
		"chemotherapy after GMALL protocol 07/03. After relapse, the patient was"
		successfully transplanted in second remission with a human leukocyte antigen
		"(HLA)-matched unrelated peripheral blood stem cell graft. Ten months later, the"
		patient died from respiratory insufficiency and recurrence of leukaemia.
		"Previously, Aspergillus antigen was detected in blood. In the latter course,"
		disseminated papules appeared. One of these was examined histologically and
		mycologically. Conventional cultural diagnostics led to the diagnosis of a
		"fusariosis, further supported by internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing and"
		matrix assisted laser desorption/ionisation-time-of-flight mass spectrometry
		"(MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, both determining the isolated strain as Fusarium"
		"proliferatum, which is a very infrequent pathogen within this genus. Our"
		investigations underline the potential of MALDI-TOF MS based identification of
		"Fusarium species as an innovative, time and cost efficient alternative to ITS"
		sequencing.

AB	-	"Fungal keratitis, an infective disease of the cornea, represents a serious"
		"diagnostic and therapeutic problem that, if not recognized on time, could lead to"
		irreversible eye damage. Herein we report a case of fungal keratitis due to
		Fusarium spp. infection. The 60-year-old man was admitted to our clinic due to an
		"atraumatic acute onset of the disease, with a decrease in the visual acuity,"
		"photophobia, redness, and severe pain in the right eye. Clinical observation"
		revealed an ulcer that affected 1/3 of the cornea and a hypopion in the anterior
		"chamber. After the first results of microbiological analyzes, local and systemic"
		antifungal therapy was applied. Due to the fact that the patient voluntarily left
		"the treatment, there was a drastic worsening of the local findings as a full"
		thickness total corneal infiltrate with more intense anterior chamber reaction.
		"Finally, evisceration was performed. Given the fact that fungal keratitis is more"
		"prevalent in developing countries, official protocols and available effective"
		antifungals are crucial for adequate treatment and a favorable outcome of this
		infection.

PG	-	118-21
AB	-	Malignant Glaucoma due to Keratomycosis is a devastating and poorly recognised
		complication occurring in a small percentage of treated patients. It is
		"characterized, in cases of Keratomycosis by a raised tension, uniform shallowing"
		of the anterior chamber and a fungus-exudate-iris mass covering the pupillary
		area. Three cases of 'Keratomycotic Malignant Glaucoma' are discussed here. Two
		"of these were successfully treated with therapeutic keratoplasty, extracapsular"
		lens extraction and systemic antifungals. The development of malignant glaucoma
		after a therapeutic keratoplasty which occurred in one case has not previously
		been reported. All the three cases which developed malignant glaucoma had a
		pupillary size of 4 mm diameter or less and grew Fusarium from the cornea and
		anterior chamber.

		complicated by fungal infections. A recent trip to Egypt and severe
		chemotherapy-induced mucositis were probably the major causes of this severe
		infection.

AB	-	Fusarium spp. are emergent opportunistic moulds capable of producing
		"life-threatening diseases, usually in immunocompromised hosts. When they infect"
		"immunocompetent patients, they usually cause localized diseases. We describe here"
		a case of cutaneous fusariosis in a patient with a medical history of diabetes

PG	-	198-9
AB	-	An unusual manifestation of breast fusariosis was encountered in a 55-year-old
		female diabetic patient. Two fine needle aspirates (FNA) from the abscess were
		"done at three days interval and they showed hyaline, septate, branched, fungal"
		hyphae in 10% potassium hydroxide mount. Fungal infection was confirmed by
		"demonstrating the fungal hyphae in the midst of lymphocytes, macrophages and"
		neutrophils in Leishman stained smears. Culture of both FNAs yielded a heavy and
		pure growth of Fusarium solani. The patient responded to oral ketoconazole 200 mg
		once daily for 3 weeks. The breast fusariosis reported here is presumably the
		first case in India.

PG	-	237-40
AB	-	We present a case of Fusarium osteomyelitis attributed to innocuous trauma in a
		patient with significant peripheral vascular disease and diabetes mellitus type
		2. Fusarium species have been reported to cause an increasing number of
		"infections, particularly in severely immunocompromized patients. Colonization of"
		"normal skin has also been reported. To the best of the author's knowledge, there"
		are 5 cases of Fusarium osteomyelitis described in English-language literature.
		There is also a report with little detail of Fusarium infection involving bone in
		3 patients with hematologic malignancy. We tabulated the pertinent facts of the 5
		detailed cases and compared them to ours. Early diagnosis requires some suspicion
		of invasive fungal infection. Tissue culture and pathologic examination are
		necessary for definitive diagnosis and to distinguish infection from
		colonization. Therapy includes antifungal drugs and aggressive surgical
		"debridement, and even when these modalities are readily implemented the outcome"
		may not be optimal because of the angioinvasive character of the organism.

PG	-	319-24
AB	-	We report the first know case of disseminated fungal infection due to Fusarium
		proliferatum in a bone marrow transplant recipient to our knowledge. Fusarium was
		"cultured from the blood, a paranasal sinus, and necrotic skin lesions. The"
		"isolate was sensitive to amphotericin B and on further sensitivity testing,"
		synergy was demonstrated using rifampin in combination with amphotericin B. The
		"patient had this infection while she was receiving alternate-day amphotericin,"
		"rifampin, and 5-flucytosine (5-FC) therapy. The infection was documented within"
		"48 h of discontinuing daily granulocyte transfusions, which she had received for"
		3 weeks. The 5-FC was discontinued when sensitivities showed the organism
		resistant. After 6 weeks of treatment she showed complete remission of the
		"infection, although neutrophil counts remained below 0.25 X 10(9)/L. From this"
		"case and from a review of the literature, it appears that synergic antifungal"
		agents combined with leukocyte transfusions may be beneficial in the successful
		treatment of fusariosis in the compromised host.

PG	-	451-457
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-017-0221-x [doi]
AB	-	Endogenous fungal endophthalmitis (EFE) caused by disseminated fusariosis is a
		"rare condition that generally has a poor outcome, even with intensive therapy."
		"Here, we describe a case in which this type of EFE was diagnosed with vitreous"
		"sampling and was successfully treated with 25-gauge vitrectomy and antifungals,"
		including liposomal amphotericin B and voriconazole. A 16-year-old male patient
		undergoing treatment for acute myeloid leukemia complained of eye pain and
		"blurred vision in his right eye. Treatment was initiated for a vitreous opacity,"
		"possibly associated with herpetic retinitis, but the patient worsened and he was"
		referred to us. Right-eye visual acuity was limited to light perception. We
		suspected endogenous endophthalmitis and performed 25-gauge vitrectomy with
		"antibiotic perfusion of ceftazidime, vancomycin, and voriconazole. Vitreous"
		"culturing revealed the presence of Fusarium solani species complex, and enhanced"
		"computed tomography revealed disseminated fusariosis lesions in the lung, spleen,"
		and the soft tissue of the left upper arm. The patient received antifungal
		"treatment with liposomal amphotericin B and voriconazole, and these conditions"
		were eliminated. Visual acuity recovered to 20/400 after additional vitrectomy
		for tractional retinal detachment and was maintained at this level during the
		6-month follow-up period. The success of our treatment allowed the capture of
		optical coherence tomography images of the retina during fusarium-associated
		"endogenous endophthalmitis and the follow-up period. Furthermore, this case"
		showed that immediate vitrectomy for suspected EFE and intensive treatment can
		lead to a good clinical outcome.

AB	-	Fusarium is a mould widely distributed in soil and water which causes various
		diseases in plants and occasionally in animals. The Fusarium species cause a
		"broad spectrum of infections in humans, of which, the degree of severity is"
		"largely determined by the immune-status of the host, occurring in the most severe"
		"and invasive forms in immunocompromised individuals. Skin infections, sinusitis"
		and pneumonia are the most common human manifestations of the disease. In
		"patients with severe immunodeficiency, the disease can become invasive and"
		disseminated causing fungemia. We report a case of an immunocompromised patient
		presenting with acute chest pain secondary to complicated Fusarium aortitis.

		administration for disseminated infection with Fusarium in a granulocytopenic
		patient.
PG	-	528-30
AB	-	The use of granulocyte transfusions during amphotericin B treatment of invasive
		fungal infections in granulocytopenic patients is controversial because of
		"concern about pulmonary complications from leukostasis. Moreover, the"
		administration of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to
		patients with active infections has been questioned because of reports that this
		cytokine inhibits neutrophil migration into areas of inflammation. We report a
		"case in which the combined use of amphotericin B, granulocyte transfusions, and"
		GM-CSF was safe and life-saving in a pancytopenic patient with disseminated
		fusarium infection. Histologic evidence of the migration of neutrophils into an
		area of active infection was found.

AB	-	A patient with extensive burn injuries was admitted to the National Hospital of
		"Burns in Hanoi, Vietnam, and diagnosed with fungal wound infection by"
		histological examination of skin biopsy samples. Fusarium solani was isolated and
		identified by analysis of its morphological features and the sequence of the
		internal transcribed spacer region. The isolation showed in vitro resistant to
		"fluconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, amphotericin B, and caspofungin."
		Invasive fusariosis is difficult to treat due to its angioinvasive property and
		its lacking amenability to treatment with antifungal drugs. This infection is
		rare and has not been reported so far in Vietnam.

LID	-	10.1007/s11046-016-9987-5 [doi]
AB	-	Fusarium spp. causes infections mostly in patients with prolonged neutropenia. We
		describe the case of a disseminated Fusarium solani infection in a patient with
		acute myeloid leukemia which never reached complete remission during its clinical
		course. The patient had profound neutropenia and developed skin nodules and
		pneumonia in spite of posaconazole prophylaxis. F. solani was isolated from blood
		"and skin biopsy, being identified from its morphology and by molecular methods."
		"By broth dilution method, the strain was resistant to azoles, including"
		"voriconazole and posaconazole, and to echinocandins. MIC to amphotericin B was"
		4 mg/L. The patient initially seemed to benefit from therapy with voriconazole
		"and amphotericin B, but, neutropenia perduring, his clinical condition"
		deteriorated with fatal outcome. All efforts should be made to determine the
		correct diagnosis as soon as possible in a neutropenic patient and to treat this
		"infection in a timely way, assuming pathogen susceptibility while tests of"
		antimicrobial susceptibility are pending. A review of the most recent literature
		on invasive fungal infections is reported.

AB	-	Severely immunocompromised patients such as those with haematological
		malignancies and haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients are at an
		"increased risk of acquiring invasive mould infections. Fusarium, a ubiquitous"
		"fungus, can cause potentially fatal infections in such hosts. It usually"
		"manifests as skin lesions, fevers and sino-pulmonary infections. Brain abscesses"
		"have been reported, but are relatively uncommon. We report a case of a"
		50-year-old patient with acute lymphocytic leukaemia and failed autologous
		peripheral stem cell transplant that presented with new onset seizures and was
		found to have Fusarium solani brain abscess. Nasal route was the presumed mode of
		entry of the fungus into the cerebrum. Treatment comprised surgical excision of
		"the lesion, and antimycotic therapy with liposomal amphotericin B and"
		"voriconazole. Despite aggressive therapy, patient succumbed to the disease. We"
		"have provided an overview of infections secondary to Fusarium, along with a"
		review of the central nervous system involvement by this pathogenic mould.

AB	-	Fusarium species are hyaline hyphomycetes widely distributed in nature and
		documented agents of both superficial and systemic infections in humans. In this
		"paper, we report a darkly-pigmented and initially non-sporulating isolate in the"
		Fusarium solani species complex (FSSC) causing a post-traumatic sporotrichoid
		"infection in an otherwise healthy, male patient. Sequencing of multiple loci"
		"showed that the isolate represented an otherwise unknown lineage, possibly"
		"corresponding to a separate species, within the multi-species F. solani complex."
		"In prolonged culture, the non-sporulating isolate produced revertant wild-type"
		subcultures with typical Fusarium conidiation. This suggests that the original
		"dense, dark, non-sporulating isolate was a host-adapted form selected in vivo for"
		characters compatible with human pathogenicity. The production of such forms by
		Fusarium species is increasingly recognized now that sequencing has allowed the
		identification of highly atypical isolates. In vitro antifungal susceptibility of
		the isolate was investigated against seven conventional and two newly approved
		"antifungal agents. The isolate showed in vitro resistance to amphotericin B, but"
		appeared susceptible to itraconazole and terbinafine. A cure was ultimately
		achieved with combined terbinafine/itraconazole therapy with prolonged
		itraconazole follow-up therapy.

PG	-	e13344
LID	-	10.1111/tid.13344 [doi]
AB	-	Neocosmospora pseudensiformis (formerly Fusarium pseudensiforme) is a hyaline
		mold in the Fusarium solani species complex that has been changed to the genus
		Neocosmospora. Invasive fusariosis is a rare fungal infection in solid organ
		transplantation. The most commonly reported manifestation of invasive fusariosis
		"in this setting is localized cutaneous fusariosis. Here, we present the first"
		case report of isolated N pseudensiformis pulmonary infection in a patient with
		non-alcoholic steatohepatitis cirrhosis who underwent orthotopic liver
		"transplantation. A 67-year-old Thai woman developed acute graft rejection,"
		"dyspnea, and pulmonary consolidation 6 months after liver transplantation."
		"N pseudensiformis was isolated from her sputum, and her clinical symptoms were"
		"improved with voriconazole treatment. However, she succumbed to Acinetobacter"
		baumannii hospital-acquired pneumonia and acute coronary syndrome with
		cardiogenic shock after 10 days of treatment.

TI	-	Isolation of Fusarium sp. from a claw of a dog with onychomycosis.
PG	-	965-9
AB	-	An 8-year-old male Golden Retriever had lameness and claw abnormality in the
		second digit of the left forelimb. Radiography revealed osteomyelitis in the
		distal phalanx bone of the affected limb. Microscopic examination of the claw
		revealed numerous hyphae in the claw matrix. Fungal DNA fragments coding the
		ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) were detected from the claw
		matrix as well as fungal colonies of the clinical isolates by PCR. Nucleotide
		sequencing revealed that the amplicons shared > 99% homology with Fusarium sp.
		"Therapy including oral itraconazole resulted in regrowth of a new claw, in which"
		"no hyphae were detected. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first case report"
		of canine onychomycosis in which Fusarium sp. was isolated from the affected
		claw.

PG	-	1461-7
AB	-	"Fusarium species are saprophytic molds and important plant pathogens, although"
		"they are increasingly recognized as agents of human mycosis. Frequently, the"
		infection is superficial. Deep tissue infection may occur as an opportunistic
		"hyalohyphomycosis, and wide dissemination is common in immunocompromised hosts."
		We describe a novel case of disseminated hyalohyphomycosis caused by F. napiforme
		in a patient with acute myelogenous leukemia. The clinical manifestations of this
		infection were similar to those attributed to infection with other species. In
		vitro susceptibility testing demonstrated resistance to amphotericin B and
		"flucytosine, and progressive infection was documented until recovery of"
		granulocyte function. The distinguishing clinical mycologic characteristics of
		this opportunistic mold are the unique turnip- or lemon-shaped microconidia. F.
		"napiforme is a new agent of hyalohyphomycosis, further emphasizing the importance"
		of Fusarium species as opportunistic molds.

AB	-	A 69-year-old man with acute myeloblastic leukemia was admitted to the hospital
		for induction chemotherapy. A complication caused by a disseminated mycotic
		infection occurred while the neutropenic patient was maintained on a course of
		"cytotoxic drugs, antibiotics, and corticosteroid therapy. The causal isolate was"
		identified as Fusarium solani on the basis of its colonial and microscopic
		"morphology. This fungus developed in the patient's tissue in the form of hyaline,"
		"branched, septate hyphae. This case fits the definition of the disease entity"
		known as hyalohyphomycosis. The term hyalohyphomycosis encompasses infections
		caused by various nondematiaceous opportunistic fungi with a filamentous tissue
		form. The purpose of this article is to review and discuss the literature on
		hyalohyphomycosis caused by Fusarium species. Combined histopathologic and
		mycologic findings were evaluated to determine the nature of opportunistic
		mycotic infections.

PG	-	166-8
AB	-	PURPOSE: To describe a case of fungal keratitis in a soft contact lens wearer.
		"METHODS AND RESULTS: A 57 year old female, compliant, frequent replacement soft"
		"contact lens wearer, with a possible prior history of herpes simplex keratitis,"
		presented with pain and injection of her left eye of four weeks duration. Gram
		stain of a corneal ulcer of the left eye revealed fungal organisms and cultures
		grew Fusarium solani. The infiltrate responded to topical and systemic antifungal
		"agents, but a corneal perforation developed which required a therapeutic"
		penetrating keratoplasty. CONCLUSIONS: Fungal infections are a cause of corneal
		ulcers in contact lens wearers. Despite the use of topical and systemic
		"antifungal agents, fungal ulcers frequently require surgical intervention."

		killer whale (Pseudorca crassidens).
PG	-	779-82
AB	-	A 10-year-old female false killer whale (Pseudorca crassidens) developed skin
		"lesions in the left breast fin. Histopathologically, the lesions consisted of"
		multiple granulomas spread diffusely into the deep dermis and bone;
		"characteristically, each granuloma had septate, branching fungal hyphae and"
		chlamydospores surrounded by eosinophilic Splendore-Hoeppli materials.
		"Macrophages, epithelioid cells and multinucleated giant cells in the granulomas"
		reacted mainly to anti-SRA-E5 antibody against human macrophage scavenger
		receptor type I. Fusarium solani was isolated and its gene was detected from the
		skin samples. Mycotic skin lesions by Fusarium spp. reported so far in marine
		"mammals were regarded as superficial dermatitis; therefore, the present case is"
		very uncommon in that the lesions spread deeper into the skin.

AB	-	Fusarium proliferatum (F. proliferatum) is known as a pathogen of corn and other
		"crops, but its role in fungal keratitis has not been well investigated. Among 877"
		"Fusarium isolates, we identified 155 (17.7%) stains as F. proliferatum according"
		to their morphological features and partial DNA sequencing of translation
		elongation factor-[Formula: see text] (EF-[Formula: see text]) in this study. In
		vitro antifungal susceptibility tests showed that the F. proliferatum strains
		"were sensitive to natamycin and vorionazole but resistant to amphotericin B,"
		"fluconazol, ketoconazole and itaconazole. Most of the F. proliferatum-positive"
		"keratitis patients (44/155,28.4%) were aged 51-60 years old. The main cause of"
		"infection was injury by a plant (51/155, 32.9%). A combination of 1% amphotericin"
		B and 3% ketoconazole cured 45.2% (14/31) and a combination of 0.5% natamycin and
		0.5% voriconazole cured 59.1% (13/22) of F. proliferatum-positive patients. The
		date suggests that F. proliferatum identified through EF-1ɑ DNA sequencing is an
		important new species that causes fungal keratitis. Based on antifungal
		"susceptibility, treatment with a combination of 0.5% natamycin and 0.5%"
		voriconazole improves the therapeutic efficacy in F. prolifertum-positive
		patients.

PG	-	1190-3
AB	-	BACKGROUND: We report a case of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) in a
		17-year-old male student caused by Fusarium napiforme found in his home
		"environment. METHODS: The patient was diagnosed according to history, chest"
		"radiograph, spirometry, high-resolution chest CT, and transbronchial lung biopsy."
		"To identify the causative agent, cultured aeromolds were collected by the"
		"open-plate method. From the main fungi cultured, fungal antigens were prepared,"
		and immunoblot analysis with the patient's serum and each fungal antigen was
		performed. RESULTS: Five fungal species were isolated from the patient's home.
		Immunoblotting analysis with the patient's serum demonstrated more than 10
		"IgG-binding fractions to F. napiforme extract only, while little binding was"
		noted with the other fungal antigens. CONCLUSIONS: We should be aware that HP may
		be caused by F. napiforme in the home environment.

AB	-	Acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) is a rare subtype of acute myeloid
		leukemia accompanied by an aggressive clinical course and dismal prognosis. We
		herein report a case of AMKL preceded by mediastinal germ cell tumor that
		relapsed early after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with
		myeloablative conditioning but was successfully treated using salvage cord blood
		transplantation (CBT) with reduced-intensity conditioning. Although several
		"serious complications developed, sustained remission with a favorable general"
		condition was ultimately achieved. Although an optimal therapeutic strategy
		"remains to be established, the graft-versus-leukemia effect of CBT may be"
		"promising, even for the treatment of refractory AMKL."

AB	-	"A large volume of historical archives was extensively damaged by flood water,"
		"following Typhoon Hagibis in Fukushima, Japan, in October 2019. They were rescued"
		"from the stricken area within a week, however, the prolonged exposure of paper"
		documents to water caused severe biodegradation by fungal growth. To disinfect
		"fungi, the paper documents were exposed to gamma radiations emitted by a source"
		of Cobalt 60 by the industrial irradiation service. The wet paper documents were
		"mainly contaminated with hydrophilic and cellulolytic fungi, including"
		"Trichoderma, Stachybotrys, and Fusarium; no fungi grew after irradiation. These"
		results indicated that the average absorbed dosage from 13.1 kGy to 16.1 kGy were
		sufficient to disinfect paper documents heavily contaminated with fungi. In the
		"present study, we demonstrated the successful practical use of irradiation in"
		fungi-damaged paper documents using a commercial gamma-irradiation facility.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To report the management of a severe and recurrent fungal keratitis
		"that required repeated penetrating keratoplasties. Despite multiple topical,"
		"intraocular and systemic antifungal treatments, superotemporal hyphal"
		infiltration repeatedly penetrated the corneal transplant causing continuous
		recurrences. Cultures collected before and during surgery isolated the same
		"organism, Fusarium spp. CONCLUSION: Corneal infection extending to the sclera and"
		internal angle structures is the main cause of recurrence of fungal keratitis
		after corneal transplantation. Sectorial full-thickness sclero-keratoplasty
		combined with a central penetrating keratoplasty should be a surgical technique
		to be considered in cases where these locations are suspected to be the source of
		"recurrence. It enables a definitive elimination of the infection, with excellent"
		final visual acuities. No postoperative complications were reported in this case.

AB	-	A healthy 10-year-old Chinese boy developed verrucous plaques on the nose. The
		fungus was identified as Fusarium moniliforme via culture of biopsy fragments.
		The patient had normal immune status and was successfully treated with oral
		itraconazole (100 mg/day) for 2 months and application of oral itraconazole and
		topical sertaconazole nitrate cream. Fusarium is a ubiquitous hyalohyphomycete
		isolated from food that is also widespread in the environment and is present at
		all latitudes. Infections due to this mold may be disseminated or localized.
		"Fusarium species have been known to colonize the cornea, nails, and burn eschars"
		in otherwise healthy patients. Cutaneous and disseminated infections have been
		reported mostly in immunocompromised hosts. Here we describe an unusual case of
		"localized infection caused by Fusarium moniliforme in an otherwise healthy child,"
		with significant improvement after 2 months of oral itraconazole and topical
		sertaconazole nitrate cream therapy.

AB	-	Fusarium is a filamentous opportunistic pathogenic fungus responsible for
		superficial as well as invasive infection in immunocompromized hosts. Net state
		of immunosuppression and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection appear to predispose to
		this disease which is life-threatening when disseminated. Though infections with
		Fusarium have been widely described in hematological malignancies and
		"hematopoietic stem cell transplant cases, they have been reported to be rare in"
		"solid organ transplant recipients, are often localized and carry a favorable"
		prognosis. We here describe a rare case of subcutaneous non-invasive infection
		with Fusarium in a renal allograft recipient two and half years after
		transplantation. Patient had a previous history of CMV infection along with
		multiple other recurrent co-infections. Diagnosis was based on culture of tissue
		specimens yielding Fusarium species. The infection had a protracted course with
		"persistence of lesions after treatment with voriconazole alone, requiring a"
		combination of complete surgical excision and therapy with the anti-fungal drug.

PG	-	236-9
AB	-	Fungal infections of the skin and deeper tissues of the periorbital region are
		"quite rare. We report a case of a localized, deep periorbital necrotizing"
		"Fusarium infection in an otherwise healthy, elderly lady. Since the clinical"
		features and histopathological findings of Fusarium infection are by no means
		"characteristic, the definitive diagnosis was achieved with the help of"
		microbiological examination of cultured organisms. A combined medical and
		"surgical therapy led to adequate control of infection. To conclude, localized,"
		deep periorbital necrotizing soft tissue infection by Fusarium in an
		immunocompetent lady is not reported in literature. One should have a high index
		of suspicion for emerging fungal pathogens in the differential diagnosis of
		"necrotizing orbital or adnexal conditions, even in an immunocompetent patient."
		"The histologic findings of septate, branching hyphae and vascular invasion cannot"
		distinguish Fusarium species from various other moulds such as Aspergillus
		species; microbiologic studies are essential for confirming the diagnosis.

TI	-	Repeated Intrastromal Injections of Voriconazole in Combination with Corneal
		Debridement for Recalcitrant Fungal Keratitis - a Case Series.
PG	-	369-72
LID	-	10.1055/s-0041-111814 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: To report the use of intrastromal voriconazole injections combined
		with corneal debridement to treat deep recalcitrant fungal keratitis. HISTORY AND
		SIGNS: Three patients (2 female and 1 male) with culture proven fungal keratitis
		"(1 Fusarium, 1 Candida, 1 Pseudallescheria boydii) were included in this study."
		The patients were treated with repeated intrastromal voriconazole (100 mg/1 ml)
		in combination with corneal debridement. THERAPY AND OUTCOME: The mean age of the
		patients was 65 years. The mean number of injections was 5. The patients were
		injected every 2-3 days. This technique required repeated corneal debridement to
		achieve complete resolution in these three cases. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated
		intrastromal injection of voriconazole in combination with corneal debridement
		"appears to be an effective and safe way to treat recalcitrant fungal keratitis,"
		even in Fusarium keratitis.

TI	-	Fusarium infection in lung transplant patients: report of 6 cases and review of
		the literature.
PG	-	69-80
LID	-	10.1097/MD.0b013e318207612d [doi]
AB	-	Fusarium is a fungal pathogen of immunosuppressed lung transplant patients
		associated with a high mortality in those with severe and persistent neutropenia.
		"The principle portal of entry for Fusarium species is the airways, and lung"
		involvement almost always occurs among lung transplant patients with disseminated
		"infection. In these patients, the immunoprotective mechanisms of the transplanted"
		"lungs are impaired, and they are, therefore, more vulnerable to Fusarium"
		"infection. As a result, fusariosis occurs in up to 32% of lung transplant"
		patients. We studied fusariosis in 6 patients following lung transplantation who
		were treated at Massachusetts General Hospital during an 8-year period and
		reviewed 3 published cases in the literature. Cases were identified by the
		microbiology laboratory and through discharge summaries. Patients presented with
		"dyspnea, fever, nonproductive cough, hemoptysis, and headache. Blood tests showed"
		elevated white blood cell counts with granulocytosis and elevated inflammatory
		"markers. Cultures of Fusarium were isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage, blood,"
		"and sputum specimens.Treatments included amphotericin B, liposomal amphotericin"
		"B, caspofungin, voriconazole, and posaconazole, either alone or in combination."
		Lung involvement occurred in all patients with disseminated disease and it was
		associated with a poor outcome. The mortality rate in this group of patients was
		"high (67%), and of those who survived, 1 patient was treated with a combination"
		"of amphotericin B and voriconazole, 1 patient with amphotericin B, and 1 patient"
		"with posaconazole. Recommended empirical treatment includes voriconazole,"
		"amphotericin B or liposomal amphotericin B first-line, and posaconazole for"
		refractory disease. High-dose amphotericin B is recommended for treatment of most
		"cases of fusariosis. The echinocandins (for example, caspofungin, micafungin,"
		anidulafungin) are generally avoided because Fusarium species have intrinsic
		"resistance to them. Treatment should ideally be based on the Fusarium isolate,"
		"susceptibility testing, and host-specific factors. Prognosis of fusariosis in the"
		immunocompromised is directly related to a patient's immune status. Prevention of
		"Fusarium infection is recommended with aerosolized amphotericin B deoxycholate,"
		which also has activity against other important fungi.

PG	-	271-4
AB	-	Fungal keratitis represents one of the most difficult forms of microbial
		keratitis to diagnose and treat successfully. It is difficult to obtain correct
		diagnosis and topical antifungal preparations. Fungi can cause severe stromal
		necrosis and enter the anterior chamber by penetrating an intact Descemet
		membrane. The most common pathogens are filamentous fungi (Aspergillus and
		Fusarium spp.) and Candida albicans. The incidence of Trichophyton spp. keratitis
		is 5%. A 22 years old female contact lenses wearer after keratitis developed
		"corneal melting syndrome, spontaneous perforation of the cornea and complicated"
		cataract of the left eye. Conjunctival swab was sterile as well as first sample
		of corneal tissue and sample from the anterior chamber. Urgent therapeutic
		"perforating keratoplasty (PK), was performed together with extracapsular cataract"
		extraction and the implantation of the intraocular lens in the posterior chamber.
		The patient was treated with ciprofloxacin and diflucan (systemic therapy); with
		"dexamethason and atropin (subconjunctivaly) and chlorhexidine, brolene,"
		"levofloxacin, polimyxin B, and dexamethason/neomycin (topically). Microbiology"
		evaluation was performed once again following excisional biopsy of the
		intracameral portion of the lesion. The presence of Trichophyton spp. was finally
		confirmed. Itraconazole and garamycin were included in the systemic therapy.
		Corneal graft was clear for 17 days but decompensated 28 days after the PK. After
		two weeks microorganisms invaded the vitreous and caused endophthalmitis. Despite
		"urgent pars plana vitrectomy patient developed endophthalmitis, lost light"
		sensation and developed phthysis. Evisceration and the implantation of silicon
		prosthesis was done. Perforating keratoplasty is a method of choice in treating
		severe infectious keratitis unresponsive to conservative treatment but without
		the eradication of microorganisms it cannot restore the vision or save the eye.
		Trichophyton spp. may cause a severe disease of the anterior and posterior part
		of the eye which may finish with the lost of vision/eye. Prompt diagnosis and
		treatment of Trichophyton spp. keratitis are essential for a good visual outcome.

PG	-	1017-1021
LID	-	10.1007/s00381-021-05320-7 [doi]
AB	-	Isolated intracranial fungal infection is infrequent and mostly seen in
		"high-risk, immunocompromised patients. Fusarium, a primary plant fungus, rarely"
		contributes to such disease. Amongst the very few cases of Fusarium brain abscess
		"that have been reported, the infection has occurred mostly in adults. We present"
		a case of a 6-year-old boy with tuberculous meningitis diagnosed with multiple
		Fusarium brain abscess caused by Fusarium falciforme during his clinical course.
		An immunocompromised state secondary to tuberculous meningitis presumably led to
		"this infection. After tapping the abscesses, the child was treated with a"
		"combination of amphotericin B, voriconazole and terbinafine. Despite an"
		"aggressive therapy, he remained in poor neurological state. This is the second"
		report of an isolated Fusarium abscess in pediatric age and the first one in a
		young child and provides pertinent review of this unusual central nervous system
		fungal infection. Such unusual infectious spectrum should be borne in mind in
		patients with co-existent immunosuppression.

TI	-	Polymicrobial keratitis after laser in situ keratomileusis.
PG	-	147-8
AB	-	PURPOSE: To report a case of polymicrobial infectious keratitis in one eye of a
		patient who had undergone bilateral simultaneous laser in situ keratomileusis
		(LASIK). METHODS: A 21-year-old healthy female developed infectious keratitis in
		her right eye after bilateral LASIK surgery. Material obtained from the infective
		foci was sent for bacterial and fungal cultures and herpes simplex virus antigen
		"detection, and broad spectrum antimicrobial therapy was instituted. RESULTS:"
		Staphylococcus epidermidis and Fusarium solani were detected on culture and
		herpes simplex virus antigen was found to be positive. The patient did not
		respond to medical therapy and subsequently the ulcer perforated. A therapeutic
		"keratoplasty was performed and the final best-corrected visual acuity was 20/40,"
		"1 month after keratoplasty. CONCLUSION: Polymicrobial infectious keratitis,"
		"although rare, is a potential sight-threatening complication of LASIK."

AB	-	"Fungal infections are common after lung transplantation. However, disseminated"
		fusariosis is rare and we report the first case of airway complications
		"associated with this infectious process. A 77-year-old Caucasian woman, who was"
		"status post left single-lung transplant for emphysema, presented to clinic 8"
		"months after lung transplantation with pleurisy, shortness of breath, and"
		declining lung function. Bronchoscopy showed narrowing of the left anastomotic
		site with dynamic compression during exhalation. An AERO stent was deployed
		"successfully, but 3 weeks later, her symptoms recurred. Bronchoscopy showed total"
		stent occlusion with thick tenacious mucus. Fusarium solani was isolated from
		"cultures, and a new 1.5 cm skin nodule was found on the anteromedial midportion"
		of the patient's left lower leg. Voriconazole and anidulafungin were started. No
		evidence of mucus accumulation was seen during a follow-up bronchoscopy. It is
		likely that Fusarium infection contributed to the initial anastomotic
		"complication as well as to obstruction of the stent. Furthermore, the stent may"
		have contributed to establishment and development of disseminated fusariosis.
		"With antifungal therapy, stent patency was maintained and the patient improved"
		clinically.

PG	-	95-7
LID	-	10.1097/ICO.0b013e318256140e [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: To report the beneficial properties of argon laser as an adjunctive
		therapy in 2 patients with refractory fungal keratitis. METHODS: Case reports and
		a review of the literature. Two cases of Fusarium keratitis refractory to topical
		and systemic antifungals were further treated with argon laser. Before laser
		"treatment, the eye was medicated with proparacaine 0.5%, lidocaine 4%, and a"
		single drop of fluorescein sodium 0.25%. Argon laser irradiation of the affected
		cornea was performed using argon blue-green wavelength (Coherent Ultima 2000;
		"Coherent, Inc). A spot size of 500 μm, pulse duration of 0.10 seconds, and power"
		ranging from 500 to 900 mW were used. RESULTS: During the first week after laser
		"treatment, both patients showed complete resolution of the infiltrates. Two signs"
		were observed during the procedure: a blanching of the corneal stroma and small
		cavitations that reached the middle stroma. No adverse effects were observed.
		CONCLUSIONS: Argon laser phototherapy is useful as an adjunctive treatment of
		refractory fungal keratitis. More cases are needed to validate our findings.

TI	-	Fusarium infections in burn patients: a case report and review of the literature.
PG	-	285-8
AB	-	"Fusarium species, or saprophytic molds, are important plant pathogens and"
		"recognized as agents of human mycotic infections. Frequently superficial,"
		"deep-tissue involvement, and dissemination occurs in immunocompromised hosts with"
		"hematologic malignancies, aplastic anemia, and chemotherapy treatment. Presented"
		in this work is a burn patient with a fatal disseminated infection in addition to
		a review of the literature. A 40-year-old white male acquired a 73% grease scald
		injury at work. His hospital course was interspersed with multiple episodes of
		"Flavobacterium, Fusarium, Candida, Proteus, Enterococcus, coagulase-negative"
		"Staphylococcus, and Serratia infections. He underwent nine operative procedures"
		"for debridement, excision, and skin grafting. The last operative procedure"
		included bilateral below knee amputations to halt an invasive Fusarium infection
		that was invading normal unburned skin. The patient died 55 days after injury.
		Fusarium and Aspergillus infections are frequently confused and do not have
		characteristic clinical features. With the prolonged survival of severely burned
		"patients, better fungal diagnostic and treatment modalities are needed to improve"
		outcome.

		case of acute lymphocytic leukemia.
PG	-	15-20
AB	-	A 35 year old female patient with acute lymphocytic leukemia developed fusariosis
		in which dissemination appeared to be limited to cutaneous and vascular invasion.
		The first evidence of fungemia occurred nearly seven months after initial
		hospitalization. The fungus was identified as Fusarium sp. and was considered a
		contaminant. Two weeks later blood cultures were again positive for Fusarium sp.
		and the patient was placed on amphotericin B and 5-fluorocytosine therapy. The
		following day developing lesions were noted on her forearms and face; lesions
		"ultimately spread to her trunk, abdomen, and lower extremities. Skin lesion"
		biopsy sections revealed abundant septate and branching hyphae throughout the
		dermis and within capillaries. Twenty-six days after the initial isolation the
		"patient died. Post-mortem blood cultures gave rise to the same fungus, which was"
		"identified as Fusarium moniliforme. Postmortem cultures and stains of spleen,"
		"liver, lung, and brain specimens were all negative for fungi. The primary source"
		and portal of entry of the organism remained undetermined.

AB	-	Disseminated fusariosis (DF) is a rare life threatening fungal infection in
		immunocompromised hosts. We herein report a case of a fatal DF mimicking
		varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection that was emerged from a localized genital
		infection during cord blood transplantation (CBT) in a patient with severe
		aplastic anemia (SAA). The patient developed an ulcer following small painful
		vesicles mimics herpes simplex virus infection (HSV) on the glans penis before
		"CBT, but a Fusarium species was identified. Despite administration of"
		"voriconazole, liposomal amphotericin B and granulocyte transfusion, the lesion"
		was extended to extensive skin looked like VZV infection and the patients died
		after CBT. Massive fusarium infiltration was detected in multiple organs at
		autopsy. A genetic analysis of the mold identified Fusarium solani after his
		"death. It should be noted that in patients with fusarium infection, localized and"
		disseminated lesions of fusarium infection sometimes mimic HSV and VZV
		"infections, which hampers an early diagnosis."

AB	-	PURPOSE: To describe the course and outcome in 3 patients with recalcitrant
		fungal keratitis treated with intrastromal voriconazole injection and topical
		voriconazole application. METHODS: The present study was an interventional case
		series. A 50 μg/0.1 mL solution of voriconazole was injected into the corneal
		"stromal tissue around the corneal ulcer, and 1% topical voriconazole was added to"
		the therapeutic regimen if the ulcer failed to respond to 5% topical natamycin
		hourly and oral ketoconazole twice per day. The infiltration and epithelial
		defect size were measured at each visit using a slit-lamp biomicroscope.
		Anatomical outcomes were assessed. RESULTS: A dramatic therapeutic response was
		observed in 2 patients. An amniotic membrane transplantation using cyanoacrylate
		glue was required to seal the microperforation in a patient with a chemical burn
		superinfected with Fusarium. CONCLUSIONS: Intrastromal injection of voriconazole
		together with topical voriconazole effectively reduced the infiltration size and
		"controlled the infection in patients with Fusarium keratitis. However, continued"
		application of the topical medication is critical for a favorable outcome of
		treatment.

PG	-	552-4
AB	-	PURPOSE: To report successful treatment of exogenous Fusarium and Aspergillus
		endophthalmitis with new antifungal agents. DESIGN: Interventional case report.
		METHODS: Treatment of two cases is reviewed. RESULTS: A 64-year-old man developed
		post-cataract Fusarium moniliforme endophthalmitis. Infection persisted despite
		"removal of the intraocular lens, three vitrectomies, and five intravitreal"
		injections of amphotericin. Inflammation resolved and vision improved from 20/80
		to 20/40 on 6 months of oral voriconazole. A 55-year-old man developed
		post-cataract intraocular inflammation. After three vitrectomies and removal of
		"the intraocular lens, Aspergillus fumigatus endophthalmitis was diagnosed."
		"Intravitreal amphotericin and systemic voriconazole were given, but one week"
		later there were early signs of recurrence. Intravenous caspofungin was added and
		the eye improved. Caspofungin was continued for 6 weeks and voriconazole for 6
		months. Vision improved from counting fingers to 20/80 at 6 months and 20/25 at
		23 months. CONCLUSION: Voriconazole is a promising new therapy for Fusarium and
		Aspergillus endophthalmitis. Caspofungin may act synergistically with
		voriconazole in treating Aspergillus endophthalmitis.

		a patient with a refractory leukemia.
PG	-	71-7
AB	-	The difficulty and uncertainty encountered in diagnosing a systemic mycosis often
		lead to a delay in starting antifungal therapy. We reported a disseminated
		infection of multiple fungal isolates including Fusarium species during donor
		leukocyte transfusion (DLT) after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in a
		20-year-old woman with a refractory leukemia. Skin lesions are the feature of
		"Fusarium and occur in the early period of the infection. In this case, during"
		"immunosuppression state after DLT, she presented with the whole body ache and"
		erythematous lesions which appeared rapidly on her trunk and extremities. While
		"administration of amphotericin B was started, her condition was further"
		deteriorated and she died. Autopsy materials revealed that she had multiple
		"fungal infection with different isolates, including Aspergillus and Candida in"
		"the brain, lung and liver, but not in the skin. With the immunohistochemical"
		"staining with specific antibody, Fusarium or Aspergillus infection was identified"
		"from the biopsy skin or autopsy brain, respectively. This rapid and specific"
		immunohistochemical method may be useful for the diagnosis and treatment of
		invasive fungal infection without delay.

		"marrow transplant, with busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and thymoglobulin. One week"
		"after the procedure, a sepsis of unknown origin in neutropenia occurred. Blood"
		cultures and sputum were negative for bacteria and fungi. At the eighth week
		"after the procedure, the patient had acute vision loss of the right eye."
		Funduscopy in the right eye revealed an inferior temporal yellowish white
		elevated lesion of approximately 10 disk areas and superficial perifoveal and
		perilesional hemorrhages. RESULTS: Vitrectomy was performed and samples from the
		vitreous and the subretinal abscess material were sent for analysis. Vitreous and
		subretinal specimens grew colonies of a fungus morphologically consistent with F.
		solani. CONCLUSION: Fusarium solani should be included in the differential
		diagnosis of subretinal abscesses.

AB	-	"Fungal infections of foot in patients with diabetes are not uncommon; however,"
		foot infection due to Fusarium species has been rarely reported. We report here a
		case of a 50-year-old male with type 2 diabetes who developed multiple
		spontaneous nodular lesions on right foot without any systemic symptoms and signs
		for 6 months. The lesions were unresponsive to broad-spectrum antibacterial
		treatment. Fine needle aspiration cytology of nodular lesions revealed the
		"presence of fungal hyphae, and Fusarium species was isolated from the same sample"
		which was identified as Fusarium solani species complex: Fusarium falciforme.
		Radiological investigations and blood culture ruled out any dissemination of the
		disease. The lesions healed after voriconazole therapy for 3 months. No relapse
		was noted at the end of the next 6-month follow-up. All reported cases of
		Fusarium infection of foot in patients with diabetes in English and non-English
		literature since 1970 have been reviewed.

AB	-	We report the successful management of a rare case of bilateral post-laser in
		situ keratomileusis (LASIK) Fusarium oxysporum keratitis and propose a
		therapeutic strategy. A 19-year-old white man with no systemic diseases was
		referred to our emergency service 3 days after microkeratome-assisted myopic
		"bilateral LASIK correction. He complained of blurred-vision, photophobia, and"
		"ocular pain. Clinical findings (satellite lesions, hypopyon) suggested fungal"
		"keratitis. Flaps were immediately lifted and rinsed with povidone-iodine 10%, and"
		intensive topical and systemic and combined antifungal and antibacterial
		treatment was introduced. Topical cortisone drops were administered after 3 days.
		"Despite initial deterioration of the clinical picture, all symptoms resolved"
		quickly. Polymerase chain reaction indicated F oxysporum. Relapse occurred in the
		"left eye, which was successfully managed. The final uncorrected distance visual"
		acuity was 20/20 in both eyes. Fusarium oxysporum post-LASIK keratitis may occur
		"in the early phase. Prompt diagnosis, interface irrigation with povidone-iodine"
		"solution, and intensive long-term treatment contribute to a favorable outcome."

TI	-	Successful treatment of a severe case of fusariomycosis in a beluga whale
		(Delphinapterus leucas leucas).
PG	-	596-602
AB	-	An adult male beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas leucas) was presented with a
		"4-cm-diameter, raised, firm nodule on the medial aspect of the left pectoral fin."
		"A fissure developed within the center of the nodule, which formed an ulcerated"
		"cyst-like lesion. The lesion rapidly progressed in size, and, with peeling of"
		"material present within the cyst, the lesion flattened to a 36 x 25-cm cutaneous"
		ulcer that extended into the axilla. Histopathologic features were consistent
		with lymphocytic and suppurative dermatitis with intralesional fungi. Fusarium
		solani was diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Fungal susceptibility
		testing was performed and revealed drug resistance to multiple antifungal
		medications tested individually and in combination therapies. Treatments used
		"included serial surgical debridement of affected and surrounding tissue, topical"
		"application and regional infusion of various azole, and allylamine antifungals"
		"combined with either dimethyl sulfoxide or Tricide for absorption potentiation,"
		and oral voriconazole administration. Although susceptibility testing revealed
		"resistance to voriconazole, visible improvement of the lesion was noted after 6"
		weeks of oral voriconazole therapy. The voriconazole dosage was tapered based on
		serum levels and was administered over a 12-mo period. No local recurrence or new
		lesions were visible by 14 mo from first presentation.

TI	-	Cladosporium keratitis - a case report and literature review.
PG	-	106
LID	-	10.1186/s12886-015-0092-1 [doi]
LID	-	106
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Fungal keratitis is one of the major causes of infectious keratitis
		"in tropical countries. Symptoms of fungal keratitis consist of blurred vision,"
		"redness, tearing, photophobia, pain and foreign body sensation. If not treated"
		"effectively, it could lead to blindness. Common causes include Candida spp.,"
		Fusarium spp. and Aspergillus spp.. With the limited choices of topical
		"antifungal agents, we were faced with Cladosporium keratitis, a rare cause of"
		fungal keratitis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 62-year-old Asian male construction worker
		"came to us with intense ocular pain, injection of the conjunctiva, blurred"
		"vision, and foreign body sensation in his left eye. His visual acuity was 20/40"
		OD and 20/400 OS. Slit-lamp exam revealed a corneal ulcer with feathery margin
		and Descemet's membrane folding. The culture yielded Cladosporium species.. The
		"patient did not show improvements after applying topical natamycin (5 %), topical"
		"amphotericin B (1mg/ml), topical fluconazole (2mg/ml) and oral ketoconazole"
		(200mg). After shifting the medical regimen to voriconazole via topical and
		"systemic routes (1mg/ml and 200mg respectively), the keratitis was controlled."
		CONCLUSIONS: Fungal keratitis remains a challenge for ophthalmologists as there
		is no evidence suggesting any particular drug or combination of drugs is more
		effective than another. A review of common topical antifungal agents was done.
		Voriconazole could be a good choice for treating corneal infection by
		Cladosporium species.

TI	-	Brainstem auditory evoked response in adolescents with acoustic mycotic neuroma
		due to environmental exposure to toxic molds.
PG	-	67-76
AB	-	Indoor air contamination with toxic opportunistic molds is an emerging health
		"risk worldwide. Some of the opportunistic molds include: Stachybotrys chartarum,"
		"Aspergillus species (A. fumigatus, A. flavus, A. niger, A. versicolor etc.),"
		"Cadosporium, Alternaria, Penicillium, Trichoderma, Fusarium graminearum etc."
		These molds flourish in homes that are moist and damp. Reports of floods are now
		evident in many parts of the world. With these global changes in climatic
		"conditions that favor the opportunistic mode of living among these molds, some"
		health authorities are beginning to feel concerned about the diversity and the
		extent to which opportunistic molds can cause adverse health effects in humans.
		Mycotoxicosis is the collective name for all the diseases caused by toxic molds.
		"Frequently, we have cases of acoustic neuroma due to mycotoxicity in our Center."
		Mycotic neuroma probably has not been reported before and the application of
		brainstem auditory evoked response (BAER) techniques in acoustic mycotic neuroma
		"have not been reported either. The aim of this study, therefore, was to report"
		cases and measurements of acoustic mycotic neuroma in adolescents using the
		"brainstem auditory evoked response. The patients' case history, clinical"
		"neurological and neurobehavioral questionnaires were assessed. Then, the BAERs"
		"were recorded between Cz and Ai, with a second channel, Cz-Ac. The case histories"
		and the questionnaires were analyzed in conjunction with the outcome of the
		objective brainstem auditory evoked response measurements. The prevalent
		"subjective findings in the patients were headaches, memory loss, hearing loss,"
		"lack of concentration, fatigue, sleep disturbance, facial swelling, rashes,"
		"nosebleeds, diarrhea, abdominal pains and respiratory difficulties. Objective"
		BAER showed overall abnormalities in all the patients. Although the waveform
		"abnormalities varied, 1-3 interpeak latencies were abnormal in all the patients."
		Overall results showed the presence of acoustic mycotic neuroma and confirmed the
		sensitivity and usefulness of BAER in screening acoustic mycotic neuroma and
		sensorineural auditory dysfunction.

TI	-	Corneal ulcer due to Neocosmospora vasinfecta in an immunocompetent patient.
PG	-	279-84
AB	-	We report a case of Neocosmospora vasinfecta keratitis in a 55-year-old man.
		"While the patient did not recall any specific trauma or eye injury, he might have"
		sustained a trivial wound during the course of his duties as a farmer. Direct
		examination of corneal scrapings revealed fungus filaments. As topical treatment
		"with natamycin and econazole and subsequent systemic ketoconazole therapy failed,"
		a full thickness therapeutic keratoplasty was performed. Post-operative treatment
		with amphotericin B and clotrimazole combined with cyclosporine resulted in a
		complete cure. The residual corneal infiltration in the recipient cornea became
		clear in a week. The fungal isolate was initially identified as a Fusarium
		"species, but later reidentified through the use of morphological characteristics"
		and sequence analysis of the internal transcribed spacer region as N. vasinfecta.
		The latters is a Hypocrealean fungus not hitherto reported as a causative agent
		of keratomycosis.

TI	-	Fusarium infections in patients with severe aplastic anemia: review and
		implications for management.
PG	-	114-8
AB	-	"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The prognosis of severe fungal infections, such as"
		"fusarium infections, in patients with aplastic anemia is directly related to the"
		"recovery of bone marrow functions. In this study, in vitro anti-Fusarium activity"
		"of granulocytes was investigated, the case of disseminated infection in a child"
		"with very severe aplastic anemia is reported, and implications for management of"
		such infective complications are discussed. DESIGN AND METHODS: The in vitro
		"efficiency of PMNL from three untreated, normal blood donors and from two"
		G-CSF-treated WBC donors in contrasting the growth of the Fusarium sp strain
		isolated from the patient we present was measured by a 3H-glucose uptake
		inhibition assay and confirmed by microscopic examination. RESULTS: Basic growth
		inhibitory activity of unstimulated PMNL on Fusarium cells was significantly
		enhanced in the presence of GM-CSF in all three blood donors tested. In one of
		"the two G-CSF-treated donors, in vitro efficiency of PMNL in contrasting the"
		growth of the fungus increased notably after G-CSF treatment. We report the case
		of a 3-year-old girl with very severe aplastic anemia unresponsive to
		conventional immunosuppressant therapy who developed a disseminated fusarium
		infection. The child initially responded to liposomal amphotericin B and
		granulocyte transfusions from G-CSF stimulated donors. Subsequently she was given
		a cord blood stem cell transplantation but died of disseminated infection.
		"INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Including the present case, there are only ten"
		reports of invasive infections caused by the genus Fusarium in aplastic anemia
		patients and only two of the patients survived. In vitro data seem to suggest
		that in vivo treatment with rh-G-CSF could have a stimulatory effect on the
		anti-Fusarium activity of neutrophils. Despite the efficacy of granulocyte
		transfusions by G-CSF-stimulated donors in the temporary control of fusarium
		"infection, treatment of the underlying hematologic disease is required to cure"
		the infection in patients with severe aplastic anemia. Granulocyte transfusions
		by G-CSF-stimulated donors while awaiting bone marrow recovery following the
		blood stem cell transplant should be considered.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Although fortunately very rare in countries with a temperate climate,"
		"certain factors, such as clinical or pharmacological immunosuppression, may cause"
		"Fusarium-related fungal infections to become an emerging problem. Moreover,"
		Fusarium is one of the most important etiological agents in exogenous
		"endophthalmitis, which is often favored by the disruption of the epithelial"
		barriers. AIMS: The aim of this series of clinical cases is to identify
		characteristic clinical findings that may allow an early diagnosis and more
		efficient management of this ophthalmologic emergency. METHODS: Three cases of
		"endophthalmitis due to Fusarium solani and Fusarium oxysporum, diagnosed in 2009,"
		"2010, and 2014 in patients from two different health regions belonging to the"
		"same health system and separated by around 43 miles, are presented. The Fusarium"
		isolates were initially identified microscopically and the species subsequently
		confirmed by sequencing the elongation factor alpha (EFα) and internal
		transcribed spacers (ITS). Susceptibility to antifungal agents was determined
		using the EUCAST broth dilution method. RESULTS: Evolution was poor as two of the
		three patients progressed to phthisis bulbi despite surgical measures and
		broad-spectrum antifungal antibiotic therapy. CONCLUSIONS: It is essential to
		rapidly instigate multidisciplinary measures to combat suspected endophthalmitis
		due to Fusarium given the poor prognosis of this type of infection.

		syndrome.
PG	-	319-21
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Oral allergy syndrome, resulting from a cross-reactivity between raw"
		"fruits and vegetables and a number of pollens, is well described. However, it has"
		never been associated with mold spore sensitivity and mushrooms. We evaluated a
		"patient with oral allergy symptoms to raw, but not cooked, mushrooms, who also"
		had positive skin testing to molds. OBJECTIVE: To identify and characterize
		antigenic cross-reactivity between mushroom and mold spores. METHODS: The patient
		underwent skin prick testing to molds and mushroom. Proteins from raw and cooked
		mushrooms were extracted and immunoblot/inhibition assays were performed to
		evaluate for cross-reacting immunoglobulin E antibodies between mushroom and mold
		extracts to which the patient was sensitive. RESULTS: The patient had a positive
		skin prick test result to raw mushroom and four types of molds. The immunoblot
		assay revealed immunoglobulin E antibodies directed against similar molecular
		"weight proteins in the raw mushroom and 3 of the 4 molds: Alternaria tenuis,"
		"Fusarium vasinfectum, and Hormodendrum cladosporioides. These protein bands on"
		protein electrophoresis were absent in the cooked mushrooms. Inhibition
		immunoblot of the raw mushroom with the three molds indicated total inhibition of
		the 43- and 67-kD protein bands. CONCLUSIONS: We report the first case of
		cross-reactivity between mushroom and molds in a patient with oral allergy
		syndrome to raw mushroom and allergic rhinitis secondary to molds.

LID	-	10.1002/pbc.27732 [doi]
AB	-	Invasive fusariosis (IF) most commonly occurs in patients with hematologic
		"malignancies and severe neutropenia, particularly during concomitant"
		corticosteroid use. Breakthrough infections can occur in high-risk patients
		despite Aspergillus-active antifungal prophylaxis. We describe a patient with
		rapid acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) progression who presented with
		multifocal skin nodules thought to be choloromatous disease. These lesions were
		ultimately diagnosed as IF and the patient had two simultaneously active disease
		processes. This case highlights the importance of pathologic diagnosis of new
		"skin lesions in ALL patients, even during leukemia progression, and demonstrates"
		that IF can occur despite normal neutrophil counts and Aspergillus-active
		prophylaxis.

TI	-	Eosinophil fungal rhinosinusitis caused by Fusarium infection secondary to
		odontogenic maxillary sinus disease: when collaboration between otolaryngologist
		and allergologist leads to the correct diagnosis and therapy.
PG	-	138-142
AB	-	Rhinitis and sinusitis usually coexist and are concurrent in most individuals;
		"thus, the correct terminology is now ""rhinosinusitis"". On the basis of numerous"
		"causative factors, often co-existing in the same patient, the diagnosis of"
		"rhinosinusitis is also made by a wide variety of practitioners (allergologists,"
		"otolaryngologists, pulmonologists, primary care physicians, paediatricians, and"
		many others). Approximately 5-15% of the population suffers from chronic
		"rhinosinusitis, and in 10-12% of them, it is of dental origin. The treatment of"
		odontogenic maxillary sinus disease is directed to the management of the
		rhinosinusitis and of the odontogenic source. The widespread use of dental
		implants and reconstructive procedures for dental implant placement has led to
		"new types of complication, as in this case report, due to chronic eosinophilic"
		rhinosinusitis secondary to Fusarium infection in the maxillary sinus. The
		"patient was initially evaluated by the allergologist, and subsequently"
		successfully treated by the otolaryngologist with Functional Endoscopic Sinus
		Surgery. The advantages of endoscopic sinus surgery include more accurate
		"visualization, no external incision, reduced soft tissue dissection, and reduced"
		hospital stay. Chronic maxillary sinusitis of dental origin is a common disease
		that requires treatment of the sinusitis as well as of the odontogenic source.

		and Literature Review.
PG	-	805-808
LID	-	10.4269/ajtmh.18-0158 [doi]
AB	-	We report two cases of corneal coinfection with Acanthamoeba and Fusarium sp.
		along with the review of published literature. A 35-year-old woman and
		65-year-old man presented to the institute with corneal ulcer refractory for
		treatment with topical antibiotics. Microbiological examination revealed the
		"presence of Acanthamoeba cysts along with septate, hyaline fungal filaments."
		"After emergency therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty (TPK) in both, the corneal"
		"tissue was sent for histopathologic examination, which confirmed the presence of"
		Acanthamoeba and fungal coinfection. One patient had a recurrence of fungal
		"infection after TPK. In subjects with a rapid progression of mycotic ulcer,"
		coinfection with other microorganisms including Acanthamoeba should be suspected.
		The two cases presented here emphasize the importance of microbiology in making
		prompt diagnosis and appropriate management of these cases at an early stage.

PG	-	377-80
AB	-	BACKGROUND: A 12-year-old boy with asthma and 6 years of recurrent pneumonias who
		had normal serum immunoglobulin concentrations was suspected of having allergic
		bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). OBJECTIVE: To search for and secure a
		fungal etiology for a child who did not have ABPA but was suspected of having an
		allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis. METHODS: Immediate skin testing with fungal
		"extracts, high resolution computerized tomography, and establishment of an ELISA"
		procedure to detect serum IgE and IgG antibodies to Fusarium vasinfectum.
		"RESULTS: Immediate skin reactivity was present for Fusarium, Cladosporium,"
		"Helminthosporium, and Aspergillus fumigatus. The ELISA demonstrated serum IgE and"
		IgG antibodies to Fusarium vasinfectum 8.5 and 5.6 times nonatopic control sera.
		CONCLUSIONS: This 12-year-old with asthma has sufficient criteria for a diagnosis
		of allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis (ABPM) to Fusarium vasinfectum.
		Bronchiectasis was not present despite recurrent pneumonias and hemoptysis. This
		"case appears to be the first pediatric example of ABPM to Fusarium species, a"
		fungus more recognized for causing rotting of tomatoes and melons than human
		disease.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive mould infections (IMIs) are very rare in patients with
		"lymphoid malignancies. However, IMIs, mostly due to Aspergillus species, have"
		been increasingly reported in such patients receiving ibrutinib (IBR). There is
		paucity of information regarding non-Aspergillus invasive mould infections
		"(NAIMIs) in this setting, OBJECTIVES: To review our recent experience and the"
		published literature on the topic. PATIENTS/METHODS: We present a case of
		invasive sinusitis caused by Fusarium in a patient with refractory chronic
		lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) who was treated with IBR and review the 12 published
		cases of NAIMIs during IBR. RESULTS: Nearly all cases of NAIMIs in the setting of
		"IBR use were encountered in patients with CLL. Mixed fungal infections, brain"
		"involvement and late-onset infections were common. CONCLUSIONS: Although rare,"
		NAIMIs should be considered in patients who receive IBR.

AB	-	Voriconazole is a second-generation triazole antifungal approved for the
		"treatment of invasive fungal infections, particularly with Aspergillus, Candida,"
		"Fusarium, and Scedosporium spp. Frequently reported adverse effects of"
		"voriconazole include visual disturbance (21 %), elevated liver enzymes (15.6 %)"
		"and rashes (7 %), which are largely attributable to drug-induced"
		photosensitivity. We report a case of serious phototoxicity in a 8 year old boy
		who underwent chemotherapy for AML. He received voriconazole for the treatment
		and subsequent re-infection prophylaxis after pulmonary aspergillosis. One year
		after the start of therapy he developed blistering eruptions on his face after
		minimal sunlight exposure. Recent reports about the development of squamous cell
		"carcinoma and melanoma, respectively, in children during and after oral therapy"
		with voriconazole seem to warrant systematic follow-up investigations of all
		voriconazole-treated patients.

		sporotrichioides.
PG	-	399-400
AB	-	"A dermatitis characterised by discrete, raised, plaque-like and cracked skin"
		"lesions of variable sizes on the udder, the hind quarters, the lips and muzzle of"
		all the cows in a herd was suspected of being caused by the oat straw used in
		"bedding, after initial feed analysis and skin culture were negative for toxins"
		and dermatophytes. Mycological analysis indicated an extensive infestation of the
		"oat straw by Fusarium sporotrichioides, a toxic mould, and an immunochemical"
		assay indicated dermatotoxic trichothecenes in the straw (0.22 microgram/g dried
		straw). An ethyl acetate extract of the straw induced a necrotic response on
		shaved rat skin. Ingestion of the toxic bedding straw and inhalation of toxic
		straw dust probably also caused the internal haemorrhage and lung emphysema
		observed in the two cows that died. The regression of the dermatitis and the
		recovery of general herd health after the withdrawal of the oat straw further
		supported the diagnosis.

AB	-	Infections caused by Fusarium species are increasing in frequency among
		"immunocompromised hosts, but urinary tract infection (UTI) due to Fusarium"
		proliferatum has not been reported in the literature so far. We describe a case
		of UTI caused by F. proliferatum in a 47-year-old man who was diagnosed with
		rectal cancer and metastasis. He underwent radical resection of rectal carcinoma
		"and local resection of hepatic metastases. After the first adjuvant chemotherapy,"
		"the patient presented the obvious high fever, severely diarrhea and progressive"
		decline of the white blood cell count. The direct microscopic examination of
		"fungi in urine was positive, and the fungal cultures showed white, cotton-like"
		"colony. After the DNA sequencing, it was identified as F. proliferatum. We gave"
		the patient itraconazole and other antibiotics to fight the infection. A month
		"later, the temperature dropped to normal and the results of the direct"
		microscopic examination and culture of fungi in urine turn negative. The
		itraconazole is effective against F. proliferatum.

TI	-	Concurrent Fusarium chlamydosporum and Microsphaeropsis arundinis infections in a
		cat.
PG	-	271-7
AB	-	A 7-year-old cat was presented initially with multiple draining sinuses on the
		metatarsal region of its right hindlimb. Another lesion had appeared at the same
		time on the fifth proximal interphalangeal joint of the left forelimb.
		Histopathological examination of a biopsy from the right hindlimb lesion revealed
		chronic pyogranulomatous inflammation associated with yeast-like bodies and
		septate mycelia; a fungus was cultured on conventional media but not identified
		further. Culture of a swab collected from the left forelimb lesion demonstrated a
		"pigmented fungus, also not characterised further. Although there was initially a"
		"favourable response to ketoconazole (Nizoral, Janssen-Cilag Pty. Ltd) and"
		"beta-lactam therapy, the infection in the hind limb relapsed subsequently, and"
		Fusarium chlamydosporum was cultured from deep biopsy specimens. Clinical
		"improvement followed debridement and itraconazole (Sporanox, Janssen-Cilag Pty."
		"Ltd; 100 mg orally once daily), however amputation of the limb represented the"
		best chance for a cure. The cat made an uncomplicated recovery following surgery
		and remained well for five months until the lesion on the left forelimb recurred.
		"Amputation of the distal fourth digit was then performed, and the resected tissue"
		submitted for culture. The dematiaceous fungus Microsphaeropsis arundinis was
		"subsequently cultured. The cat remained well for several months, until a further"
		F. chlamydosporum infection developed on the body wall. This was excised 7 months
		"ago, and no lesions have recurred in this area. Importantly, this is the first"
		reported case of M. arundinis infection in a mammalian host.

TI	-	Fusarium infections in immunocompromised patients: case reports and literature
		review.
PG	-	152-61
AB	-	Five cases are reported of Fusarium infection in patients with aplasia following
		"chemotherapy of leukemia. The clinical signs, diagnosis and course of the"
		infection during treatment are outlined and discussed in conjunction with the
		characteristics of other cases already reported in the literature. Sixty-three
		"cases of Fusarium infection have been reported in immunocompromised patients, 44"
		cases since 1985. These included patients with hematological malignancies (58
		"cases), especially acute leukemia (43 cases). The main sites of infection were"
		"the skin (46 cases), blood (28 cases) and lungs (13 cases). The infection was"
		mostly diagnosed by means of skin biopsy but also by means of positive blood
		"cultures. Forty-three strains were identified, 19 of which were Fusarium solani."
		"Amphotericin B treatment was given in 55 cases, often combined with other"
		"antifungal agents, leukocyte transfusions or granulocyte-macrophage-colony"
		"stimulating factor. The outcome was fatal in 36 of the 63 cases reported, often"
		"due to resistance of the strain to antifungal agents, particularly amphotericin B"
		(20 of 33 strains tested). The most important risk factor seems to be profound
		and prolonged aplasia. Deep mycoses due to Fusarium species thus pose an
		important problem and are occurring in increasing numbers in immunocompromised
		patients. Treatment of these infections is difficult and the prognosis is poor.

LID	-	588
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Fusarium species are among the most common fungi present in the
		environment and some species have emerged as major opportunistic fungal infection
		"in human. However, in immunocompromised hosts they can be virulent pathogens and"
		can cause death. The pathogenesis of this infection relies on three factors:
		"colonization, tissue damage, and immunosuppression. A novel Fusarium species is"
		reported for the first time from keratitis in an agriculture worker who acquired
		the infection from plant material of maize. Maize plants are the natural host of
		this fungus where it causes stalk rot and seeding malformation under temperate
		"and humid climatic conditions. The clinical manifestation, microbiological"
		"morphology, physiological features and molecular data are described. METHODS:"
		Diagnosis was established by using polymerase chain reaction of fungal DNA
		followed by sequencing portions of translation elongation factor 1 alpha (TEF1 α)
		and beta-tubulin (BT2) genes. Susceptibility profiles of this fungus were
		evaluated using CLSI broth microdilution method. RESULTS: The analyses of these
		two genes sequences support a novel opportunist with the designation Fusarium
		temperatum. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the reported clinical isolate was
		nested within the Fusarium fujikuroi species complex. Antifungal susceptibility
		"testing demonstrated that the fungus had low MICs of micafungin (0.031 μg/ml),"
		posaconazole (0.25 μg/ml) and amphotericin B (0.5 μg/ml). CONCLUSION: The present
		case extends the significance of the genus Fusarium as agents of keratitis and
		underscores the utility of molecular verification of these emerging fungi in the
		human host.

TI	-	How different is invasive fusariosis in pediatric patients than in adults? A
		systematic review.
PG	-	619-626
LID	-	10.1097/QCO.0000000000000776 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To investigate the peculiarities of invasive fusariosis (IF)
		in pediatric patients. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review to
		identify human cases of locally invasive and systemic fusariosis documented in
		children (up to 18 years) published between 1973 (first case report) and 2021.
		"RECENT FINDINGS: One hundred and six cases were retrieved, and hematologic"
		malignancy was reported in 64% (68/106) of the cases. The most frequent anatomic
		"sites involved were skin 66% (70/106), blood 47% (50/106), and lungs 35%"
		"(37/106), bone and joint (8%, 09/106), and eye/central nervous system involvement"
		"(8%, 9/106). Fusarium solani, followed by Fusarium oxysporum, were the most"
		"commonly reported species. In disseminated fusariosis, relapsed or refractory"
		"baseline disease (P < 0.001, OR=10.555, CI 95% 3.552-31.365) was associated with"
		"poor outcome, whereas voriconazole-based therapy was associated with better"
		"prognosis (P  = 0.04, OR = 0.273, CI 95% 0.076-0.978). SUMMARY: Hematologic"
		malignancies and solid tumors requiring intensive immunosuppression are the main
		"conditions related to IF in children where other organs than skin, blood, and"
		lungs were frequently involved. Voriconazole therapy appears to be also effective
		"in children with IF, despite the wide pharmacokinetic variability of this"
		triazole in pediatric patients.

TI	-	Immediate-type hypersensitivity reaction to ingestion of mycoprotein (Quorn) in a
		patient allergic to molds caused by acidic ribosomal protein P2.
PG	-	1106-10
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Quorn is the brand name for a line of foods made with so-called
		"""mycoprotein,"" which springs from the mold Fusarium venenatum. Since the"
		"introduction on the food market, there have been complaints from consumers"
		reporting adverse gastrointestinal reactions after ingestion of mycoprotein. To
		"date, it is not clear whether the reported symptoms are IgE-mediated. OBJECTIVE:"
		The aim of the study was to describe for the first time a case history of an
		asthmatic patient with severe hypersensitivity reactions to ingested mycoprotein
		and to identify and characterize the potential allergen that might be responsible
		for this. METHODS: The sensitization pattern of the asthmatic subject was
		"characterized, and food allergy to mycoprotein was assessed by double-blinded"
		"placebo-controlled food challenge. Afterward, specific IgE antibodies of the"
		serum of this patient were used to screen a Fusarium culmorum cDNA expression
		library. The coding sequence of one enriched cDNA-clone was expressed in
		Escherichia coli to produce a recombinant protein that was further purified and
		immunologically characterized. RESULTS: The patient showed high sensitization to
		many known aeroallergens but apart from Quorn not to any other tested food
		samples. The deduced amino acid sequence of the enriched cDNA-clone (Fus c 1)
		showed large identity to the 60S acidic ribosomal protein P2 which is highly
		conserved among several species and also described as minor allergen in other
		mold species. The frequency of IgE reactivity of sera from F culmorum -sensitized
		subjects to rFus c 1 was approximately 35%. By enzyme allergosorbent test
		"inhibition, we found 65% inhibition of mycoprotein IgE reactivity by rFus c 1. On"
		the opposite we found reduced IgE reactivity of rFus c 1 of 68% by using
		mycoprotein as inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS: Sensitization to mold allergens by the
		respiratory tract and subsequent oral ingestion of cross-reactive proteins may
		"lead to severe food-allergic reactions. Thus, the 60S acidic ribosomal protein P2"
		of F venenatum probably is the reason for the described severe hypersensitivity
		reactions of the patient to Quorn-mycoprotein because of its potential
		cross-reactivity to the F culmorum allergen Fus c 1.
