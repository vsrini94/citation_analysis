AB	-	"Cryptococcosis is a systemic fungal infection, caused by encapsulated yeast of"
		"the genus Cryptococcus, C neoformans and C gattii. These environmental"
		"microorganisms live in pigeon and other bird droppings, as well as in the fruit"
		and bark of various trees. Infection in humans and other animal species usually
		occurs by inhalation and less frequently through the skin and by ingestion of the
		"fungus. Most infections have a benign course and resolve spontaneously; however,"
		"the incidence of cryptococcosis has increased considerably, mainly due to diverse"
		"causes of immunodeficiency, particularly AIDS. Cryptococcus neoformans infections"
		"are common, worldwide, and severe forms are seen in immunocompromised patients."
		Cases caused by C gattii predominate in tropical or subtropical regions.
		"Cryptococcosis may present as an acute, subacute, or chronic lung disease, as a"
		"nonpurulent cerebrospinal fluid meningitis, or as a severe infection with fever,"
		"anemia, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly. The eye can be affected, with"
		partial or total loss of vision. Diagnosis is by direct observation of the
		"causative agent, in histopathologic studies, by isolation in culture, and by the"
		presence of capsular antigen. Treatment is the intravenous administration of
		"amphotericin B deoxycholate, alone or combined with 5-fluorocytosine or"
		"fluconazole, which can be given orally or intravenously. Itraconazole is less"
		effective when the central nervous system is affected. Voriconazole appears to be
		"a drug that can be used in these patients. In AIDS patients, secondary"
		prophylaxis is administered with fluconazole or amphotericin B and is continued
		until CD4 cell counts exceed 200 cells/μL. Evaluation of intracranial pressure is
		important in the first weeks after diagnosis in AIDS patients.

TI	-	Avian cryptococcosis.
PG	-	115-24
AB	-	Clinical and laboratory findings in 15 unreported cases of avian cryptococcosis
		from Australia were collated and contrasted with 11 cases recorded in the
		literature. Cryptococcus species produced localized invasive disease of the upper
		respiratory tract of captive parrots living in Australia. This resulted in signs
		referable to mycotic rhinitis or to involvement of structures contiguous with the
		"nasal cavity, such as the beak, sinuses, choana, retrobulbar space and palate."
		Parrots of widely differing ages were affected and of the seven birds for which
		"sex was determinable, six were male. Cryptococcus bacillisporus (formerly C."
		neoformans var. gattii) accounted for four of five infections in which the
		"species or variety was determinable, suggesting that exposure to eucalyptus"
		"material may be a predisposing factor. In these cases, Cryptococcus appeared to"
		behave as a primary pathogen of immunocompetent hosts. One tissue specimen was
		available from an Australian racing pigeon with minimally invasive subcutaneous
		disease; immunohistology demonstrated a C. neoformans var. grubii (formerly C.
		"neoformans var. neoformans serotype A) infection, presumably subsequent to"
		traumatic inoculation of yeast cells into the subcutis. Two similar cases had
		"been reported previously in pigeons domiciled in America. Data for parrots, one"
		pigeon and other birds studied principally in America and Europe (and likely
		"infected with C. neoformans) suggested a different pattern of disease, more"
		suggestive of opportunistic infection of immunodeficient hosts. In this cohort of
		"patients, the organism was not restricted to cool superficial sites such as the"
		"upper respiratory tract or subcutis. Instead, infections typically penetrated the"
		lower respiratory tract or disseminated widely to a variety of internal organs.
		"Finally, three captive North Island brown kiwis, one residing in Australia, the"
		"other two in New Zealand, died as a result of severe diffuse cryptococcal"
		pneumonia (two cases) or widely disseminated disease (one case). C. bacillisporus
		"strains were isolated from all three cases, as reported previously for another"
		kiwi with disseminated disease in New Zealand.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcosis is one of the major causes of mortality among HIV
		patients worldwide. Though most often associated with late stage HIV
		"infection/AIDS, a significant number of cases occur in other immunocompromised"
		patients such as solid organ transplant recipients and patients with
		hematological malignancies. Immunocompromised patients are a heterogeneous group
		and their number increases constantly. Since little is known about the incidence
		"and the clinical features of cryptococcosis in Northern Europe, our aim was to"
		investigate the clinical characteristics of cryptococcosis patients in Finland.
		METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the laboratory confirmed cryptococcosis
		cases in Finland during 2004-2018. Only those who were treated for cryptococcosis
		were included in the study. Initial laboratory findings and medical records were
		also collected. RESULTS: A total of 22 patients with cryptococcosis were included
		"in our study. The annual incidence of cryptococcosis was 0.03 cases per 100,000"
		population. Ten patients were HIV-positive and 12 out of 22 were HIV-negative.
		Hematological malignancy was the most common underlying condition among
		"HIV-negative patients. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study of"
		the clinical presentation and incidence of cryptococcosis in Finland. We
		demonstrate that invasive cryptococcal infection occurs not only in HIV/AIDS
		patients or otherwise immunocompromised patients but also in immunocompetent
		"individuals. Even though cryptococcosis is extremely rare in Finland, its"
		recognition is important since the prognosis depends on rapid diagnostics and
		early antifungal therapy.

TI	-	Cryptococcemia.
PG	-	98-109
AB	-	Previous reports have emphasized that cryptococcemia is almost uniformly fatal.
		To define the clinical course and prognostic and therapeutic implications of
		"cryptococcemia, we studied 15 patients treated at this medical center over the"
		"past 7 years. Cryptococcemia was strongly associated with corticosteroid therapy,"
		especially when the dosage had recently been increased. Meningitis was common
		"(but not invariably present) in these patients, characteristically with a large"
		burden of organisms in the cerebrospinal fluid. Cryptococcemia developed during
		hospitalization in one-third of our patients; this high rate of nosocomial
		infection emphasizes that C. neoformans infection should be considered in
		"febrile, immunocompromised patients even when the initial work-up is negative."
		Most of these patients were treated with amphotericin B plus 5-fluorocytosine.
		"Although the one-year survival rate of 4/15 (29%) was dismal, no patient died"
		"from uncontrolled cryptococcal infection. Other infections, which developed"
		"before, during or after cryptococcemia was diagnosed, were the major immediate"
		cause of morbidity and mortality. The progress of underlying diseases and the
		outcome of concomitant infections in these patients were more important
		determinants of survival than was cryptococcemia itself.

		"identified via literature review: median age was 13.5 years (IQR 7.8-16 years),"
		18/22 (82%) had meningitis or central nervous system infection. Where outcome was
		"reported, 11/18 (61%) died. Of six audit cases identified from 2008 to 2017, 5"

		positive for C. neoformans and high titers of cryptococcal antigen in the serum.
		The patient was successfully treated with liposomal amphotericin without surgical

AB	-	Disseminated cryptococcosis is rare but can often become severe with a poor
		outcome. Given recent reports that matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
		time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analyser is useful for
		"Cryptococcus species identification, it was applied retrospectively to past cases"
		"of disseminated cryptococcosis at our hospital over the past 10 years, and their"
		"clinical courses were reviewed. For each case, the retained Cryptococcus spp."
		"were used for identification using both MALDI-TOF MS and genetic sequencing, as"
		well as for drug susceptibility testing. A total of eight cases were found.
		Cryptococcus spp. were found in cerebrospinal fluid in 3 cases and blood in 5
		cases; anti-HIV antibody was either negative or untested. MALDI-TOF MS identified
		"Cryptococcus neoformans as the pathogen in all 8 cases, but genetic testing"
		identified one of these as Cryptococcus curvatus. The outcome was death within 30
		days in 5 of the total 8 cases and in 2 of the 3 cases in which C. neoformans was
		"detected in the cerebrospinal fluid, despite regimens and dosages that followed"
		IDSA Guidelines in all 3 cases. Drug susceptibility testing showed no drug
		"resistance that would have affected the therapy. In conclusion, the outcomes were"
		"very poor in these drug-susceptible cases, despite treatment in full accordance"
		with standard guidelines. This study confirmed the need to develop newer
		therapies as well as the high capability of MALDI-TOF MS for the identification
		"of C. neoformans. Genetic testing, however, may be necessary if non-neoformans"
		Cryptococcus is suspected.

LID	-	10.1111/myc.12496 [doi]
AB	-	Cryptococcosis is an opportunistic invasive fungal infection that is well
		described and easily recognised when it occurs as meningitis in HIV-infected
		persons. Malignancy and its treatment may also confer a higher risk of infection
		"with Cryptococcus neoformans, but this association has not been as well"
		"described. A case of cryptococcosis in a cancer patient is presented, and all"
		cases of coincident C. neoformans infection and malignancy in adults published in
		the literature in English between 1970 and 2014 are reviewed. Data from these
		"cases were aggregated in order to describe the demographics, type of malignancy,"
		"site of infection, clinical manifestations, treatment and outcomes of"
		cryptococcosis in patients with cancer. Haematologic malignancies accounted for
		"82% of cases, with lymphomas over-represented compared to US population data (66%"
		vs. 53% respectively). Cryptococcosis was reported rarely in patients with solid
		tumours. Haematologic malignancy patients were more likely to have central
		"nervous system (P < 0.001) or disseminated disease (P < 0.001), receive"
		"Amphotericin B as part of initial therapy (P = 0.023), and had higher reported"
		mortality rates than those with solid tumours (P = 0.222). Providers should have
		heightened awareness of the possibility of cryptococcosis in patients with
		haematologic malignancy presenting with infection.

AB	-	Cryptococcosis is a fungal disease caused by Cryptococcus neoformans and
		"Cryptococcus gattii. By inhalation and subsequent pulmonary infection, it may"
		disseminate to the CNS and cause meningitis or meningoencephalitis. Most cases
		"occur in immunosuppressed hosts, including patients with HIV/AIDS, patients"
		"receiving immunosuppressing drugs, and solid organ transplant recipients."
		"However, cryptococcosis also occurs in individuals with apparently healthy immune"
		"systems. A growing number of cases are caused by C gattii, with infections"
		occurring in both immunosuppressed and immunocompetent individuals. In the
		"majority of documented cases, treatment of C gattii infection of the CNS requires"
		aggressive management of raised intracranial pressure along with standard
		antifungal therapy. Early cerebrospinal fluid evacuation is often needed through
		"placement of a percutaneous lumbar drain or ventriculostomy. Furthermore,"
		pharmacological immunosuppression with a high dose of dexamethasone is sometimes
		needed to ameliorate a persistently increased inflammatory response and to reduce
		"intracranial pressure. In this Grand Round, we present the case of an otherwise"
		"healthy adolescent female patient, who, despite aggressive management, succumbed"
		to C gattii meningoencephalitis. We also present a review of the existing
		literature and discuss optimum clinical management of meningoencephalitis caused
		by C gattii.

AB	-	Cryptococcal infections are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in
		tropical Australia. This retrospective audit was conducted to characterise the
		"aetiology, temporospatial epidemiology, and clinical course of 49 cryptococcal"
		infections in Far North Queensland between 1 January 1999 and 31 December 2019.
		Cryptococcus gattii was identified in 15/32 (47%) in whom it was possible to
		"speciate the organism. Among these 15 patients, 13 (87%) had a rural residential"
		"address, 10 (67%) were Indigenous Australians and 11 (73%) presented during the"
		May-November dry season. When compared to the 17 patients with Cryptococcus
		"neoformans infection, patients with C. gattii were less likely to be"
		"immunocompromised (0/15 versus 8/17 (47%), p = 0.003). Neurosurgery was necessary"
		in 5/15 C. gattii cases and 3/17 (18%) C. neoformans cases (p = 0.42). Outcomes
		were generally good with 42/49 (86%) cases-and 14/15 (93%) with C. gattii
		infection-surviving to hospital discharge. These positive outcomes are likely to
		be explained by the development of standardised treatment guidelines during the
		"study period, low rates of comorbidity in the patients with C. gattii infection"
		and access to liposomal amphotericin and neurosurgical support in the
		well-resourced Australian healthcare system.

PG	-	3801-10

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: Cryptococcus neoformans is a common opportunistic infection in adults
		"with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. However, limited data exist for"
		pediatric patients. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical
		characteristics of cryptococcosis in pediatric patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A
		"retrospective study was conducted at West China Second University Hospital,"
		"Sichuan University. Data on risk factors, clinical manifestations, diagnosis"
		"methods, treatment, and prognosis were evaluated. Clinical characteristics"
		associated with cryptococcal meningitis and disseminated cryptococcosis were
		compared. RESULTS: Twelve cases of cryptococcal meningitis and 11 cases of
		disseminated cryptococcosis were identified. Seventeen cases had no underlying
		"disease, but 6 cases had malnutrition. Only 6 cases had a history of exposure to"
		"pigeon droppings. No cases had pulmonary cryptococcosis alone. Coughing,"
		"pulmonary moist rales, swollen lymph nodes, liver and spleen, and skin rashes"
		were seen only in disseminated cryptococcosis. The prevalence of headache and
		positive meningeal irritation sign was higher in cryptococcal meningitis than
		disseminated cryptococcosis. The proportion of increase in eosinophils was higher
		in disseminated cryptococcosis than cryptococcal meningitis. The primary methods
		"used for diagnosis included cerebrospinal fluid ink staining, cerebrospinal fluid"
		"culture, blood culture, and lymph node biopsy. Two patients stopped treatment,"
		and 21 patients received antifungal therapy. The mortality rate was 39.13%.
		CONCLUSIONS: Cryptococcosis occurs in non-HIV infected and immunocompetent
		children. Cryptococcosis lacks specific clinical manifestations. Disseminated
		cryptococcosis commonly occurs in children. Clinicians should consider a
		diagnosis of disseminated cryptococcosis for children who present with
		"unexplained long-term fever, mild cough, chest imaging inconsistent with clinical"
		"symptoms, lymphadenectasis, hepatosplenomegaly, and eosinophilia."

		an unusual case of an avian influenza A (H7N9) infection with several severe
		mixed bacterial infections and systemic super-infection with Cryptococcus
		neoformans presenting as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and bloodstream
		infection in a previously immunocompetent man during hospitalization.A
		"58-year-old man was admitted to our hospital complaining of hyperpyrexia,"
		"dyspnoea, cough, and phlegm with blood. A chest computed tomography scan revealed"
		multiple ground-glass opacities and consolidation in both lungs with right
		pleural effusion. An initial sputum test was positive for influenza A (H7N9)
		"virus. After antiviral treatment and other supportive measures, the patient's"
		"condition improved. However, the patient's condition deteriorated again"
		"approximately 2 weeks after admission, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF)"
		and blood cultures were positive for C. neoformans. Therapy with intravenous
		liposomal amphotericin B and fluconazole was started. After a 2-week antifungal
		"treatment, BALF and blood cultures were negative for C. neoformans. However, the"
		patient had persistent lung infiltrates with severe pulmonary fibrosis with a
		"prolonged course of disease. On hospital day 40, BALF and blood cultures were"
		"both positive for multidrug-resistant Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Finally, the"
		"patient developed septic shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation and"
		multi-organ failure and succumbed to treatment failure.Cryptococcal infection can
		occur in patients with severe influenza during hospitalization with a more severe
		"condition, and the clinician should be aware of this infection."

		"fungemia and in 24% the agent was isolated from the CSF and blood, concurrently."
		Meningoencephalitis was the most frequent (75%) manifestation of infection.
		"Despite adequate treatment, the mortality of the disease was 58.5%. Most isolates"
		"(97.5%) presented the VNI genotype (serotype A, var. grubii) and one isolate was"
		genotyped as C. gattii (VGI); all the isolates were determined as mating type

AB	-	"Cryptococcal disease, caused by Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii,"
		is associated with significant morbidity and mortality but limited data exist on
		its incidence and impact. A study utilizing the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from
		2000 to 2007 to examine the epidemiology and impact of cryptococcal disease in
		the United States was undertaken. The International Classification of Diseases
		9th Version code was used to identify hospital discharges with diagnosis of
		Cryptococcus (117.5). Our primary outcome was the incidence rate of cryptococcal
		"admissions. The impact of AIDS, age, and sex on hospitalization rates, mortality,"
		"and costs was assessed. The results showed that a total of 10,077"
		hospitalizations for cryptococcosis occurred corresponding to a weighted estimate
		"of 49,010 cases. The median age was 43 years (interquartile range 34-54), and 26%"
		were female. Approximately 64% of cases occurred in persons with AIDS. Although
		"rates declined overall, age-adjusted rates were significantly higher in males"
		with AIDS than in uninfected persons (p < 0.001). The mortality rate decreased
		"but was greater in HIV-uninfected versus infected cohorts (12% versus 10%,"
		"p < 0.001). Conversely, hospital costs were greater in persons with AIDS ($40,671"
		"versus $40,096, p=0.02). Although cryptococcal disease rates are decreasing over"
		"time, the associated mortality and costs remain concerning."

AB	-	"As the diagnosis of cryptococcosis is challenging in low-prevalence settings,"
		uncovering predictive factors can improve early diagnosis and timely treatment.
		The aim of the study was to relate clinical outcomes to predictive variables for
		the presence of cryptococcosis. A retrospective case-control study matched by
		"collection date, age and gender at a 1:2 ratio (55 cases and 112 controls) was"
		performed in case patients diagnosed with Cryptococcus infection at the
		University of Colorado Hospital between 2000 and 2017 (n = 167). A bivariate and
		"a forward, stepwise multivariable logistic regression model were performed to"
		identify predictors of cryptococcosis infection. In an adjusted multivariable
		"model, cryptococcal infection was significantly associated with the presence of"
		"respiratory symptoms, hyponatremia, lung disease or corticosteroids."
		"Additionally, cryptococcal meningitis was associated with headaches,"
		"corticosteroids or increased CSF protein. Conversely, a reduced risk of"
		cryptococcosis was associated with hypertension or peripheral monocytosis.
		Cryptococcal meningitis leads to subsequent hearing impairment (16% vs 4%
		"(control), P = .013), muscle weakness (40% vs 20%, P = .021), cognitive deficits"
		"(33% vs 6%, P = .0001) or any adverse outcome (84% vs 29%, P = .0001). We"
		uncovered novel clinical predictors for the presence of cryptococcal infection or
		cryptococcal meningitis. This study in patients at a low-prevalence US medical
		centre underscores the importance of early diagnosis in this population.

PG	-	44-46
AB	-	Cryptococcus neoformans is an encapsulated yeast found worldwide.1 Patients with
		"immunosuppression, including individuals with HIV/AIDS, transplant recipients"
		and/or individuals with other T-cell mediated immunosuppression are more
		susceptible to becoming infected with Cryptococcus neoformans than
		immunocompetent individuals.2 This is a case report of a 66-year-old woman who
		presented to the emergency department with an unsteady gait and urinary
		incontinence. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on presentation showed a large
		C5-C6 central disc protrusion. The patient underwent surgical repair and was
		treated with five days of IV steroids. Later in the course of her
		"hospitalization, she had an unexplained increasing leukocytosis and tachycardia"
		with witnessed episodes of unresponsiveness. She subsequently had a pulseless
		electrical activity cardiac arrest and succumbed despite resuscitative efforts. A
		post-mortem diagnosis revealed Cryptococcus neoformans fungemia and disseminated
		cryptococcosis involving multiple organs. Disseminated cryptococcosis primarily
		"affects the central nervous system3, and thus this report presents a rare case of"
		disseminated cryptococcosis involving multiple organs.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii are yeasts
		"responsible for invasive infection, primarily pulmonary and neurological. Their"
		clinical epidemiology has been previously described in an Australian national
		"study, but this included no data from the Hunter region, where we anecdotally"
		"noted a high incidence of infection. We aimed to describe the epidemiology,"
		management and outcomes of cryptococcal disease in the Hunter region and to
		compare this with previous Australian data. METHODS: We searched our laboratory
		database for positive cryptococcal antigen and culture results from January
		"2003-December 2016. We extracted demographic factors, risk factors, clinical"
		"presentation, treatment and outcomes from medical records. We used the 2010"
		census-derived estimated resident population to calculate population-based
		"incidences. RESULTS: Over a 13-year period, 107 patients had either a positive"
		culture or a positive cryptococcal antigen with a compatible clinical syndrome.
		"Of these, 46 (42.2%) were C. neoformans, 28 (25.7%) C. gattii, and 33 (30.3%)"
		antigen only. The crude incidence (per million with 95% CI) for all disease was
		"9.5, and for culture proven disease was 2.5 for C. gattii and 4.1 for C."
		neoformans. Geospatial mapping by species revealed no evident cluster. Of the 63
		"patients where detailed information was available, around half were"
		"immunocompromised (3 [15%] for C. gattii and 25 [81%] for C. neoformans,"
		"p < 0.001). Complications were common, including visual loss (11 cases, 17.7%)"
		"and hearing loss (5 cases, 8%). Adverse outcomes at one year (death or"
		"neurological sequelae) occurred in 42%, and was significantly more likely"
		"(OR = 5.2, 95% CI 1.4-18.8) in those with raised intracranial pressure at"
		baseline. Adverse outcomes were no more common in those treated with lower doses
		"of liposomal amphotericin (≤150 mg/day, 5/10) than those treated with the"
		recommended dose of 3-5 mg/kg (≥150 mg; 13/27). CONCLUSION: Although a rare
		"disease, cryptococcosis is more common in the Hunter region than in other parts"
		"of Australia, and long-term sequelae are serious and common."

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that
		causes meningitis worldwide and may be fatal in immunocompromised subjects. In
		"Nigeria, cases have been reported with prevalence between 4 and 13.1% in Human"
		Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients depending on the study subjects. This study
		"was designed to assess the prevalence of cryptococcosis, CD4+T cell counts and"
		possible effect on haematological parameters in HIV seropositive subject in
		"Nnewi, South-Eastern Nigeria. METHOD: A total of four hundred and twenty-nine"
		"(429) subjects were recruited for the study. Of these, two hundred and ninety"
		(290) were HIV positive and one hundred and thirty-nine (139) were HIV
		seronegative subjects recruited from the voluntary counseling and testing (VCT)
		"unit and HIV care clinic at Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital Nnewi,"
		"Anambra State, Nigeria. Their ages were between 18-80 years. One hundred and"
		thirty nine (139) apparently healthy HIV seronegative subjects were recruited as
		controls. Blood samples were taken for C. neoformans by Antigen lateral flow
		"assay (CrAgLFA), HIV testing, CD4+T cell, platelet and Full blood count (FBC)."
		RESULTS: Our results show that of the two hundred and ninety (290) who were HIV
		"positive subjects investigated for cryptococcosis, 4 (1.4%) tested positive for"
		CrAg of whom 1(25%) were male and 3(75%) were female. All those with
		"cryptococcosis had their CD4 count below 200 cells/μL, three of them were on ART"
		and one was not. There were significant differences in the CD4 counts (P<0.05)
		between those infected and not infected with C. neoformans. None of the control
		group tested positive to cryptococcosis. CONCLUSION: Widespread use of
		"anti-retroviral therapy may have reduced C. neoformans infection. However, the"
		threat remains and there may be a possibility that women may be a more vulnerable
		population.

AB	-	"In 2018, a cluster of two cases of cryptococcosis occurred at the Queen Elizabeth"
		"University Hospital (QEUH) in Glasgow, Scotland (UK). It was postulated that"
		"these cases may have been linked to pigeon droppings found on the hospital site,"
		given there have been previous reports of Cryptococcus neoformans associated with
		pigeon guano. Although some samples of pigeon guano taken from the site yielded
		"culturable yeast from genera related to Cryptococcus, they have since been"
		"classified as Naganishia or Papiliotrema spp., and no isolates of C. neoformans"
		were recovered from either the guano or subsequent widespread air sampling. In an
		"attempt to further elucidate any possible shared source of the clinical isolates,"
		we used whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis to examine the
		"relationship of the two Cryptococcus isolates from the QEUH cases, along with two"
		isolates from sporadic cases treated at a different Glasgow hospital earlier in
		2018. Our work demonstrated that these four clinical isolates were not clonally
		related; while all isolates were from the VNI global lineage and of the same
		"mating type (MATα), the genotypes of the two QEUH isolates were separated by 1885"
		"base changes and belonged to different sub-lineages, recently described as the"
		"intercontinental sub-clades VNIa-93 and VNIa-5. In contrast, one of the two"
		sporadic 2018 clinical isolates was determined to belong to the VNIb sub-lineage
		and the other classified as a VNIV/VNI hybrid. Our work demonstrated that the two
		2018 QEUH isolates and the two prior C. neoformans clinical isolates were all
		genetically distinct. It was not possible to determine whether the QEUH genotypes
		"stemmed from independent sources or from the same source, i.e. pigeons carrying"
		"different genotypes, but it should be noted that whilst members of allied genera"
		"within the Tremellomycetes were isolated from the hospital environment, there"
		were no environmental isolations of C. neoformans.

		Patient.
PG	-	31-4
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Ventriculoperitoneal shunting is an effective treatment for
		hydrocephalus. Ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) infection is a common
		complication. Cryptococcus neoformans as an implicated organism is rare. In this
		"report, we describe a patient with cryptococcal VPS infection. CASE REPORT: A"
		"52-year-old male with normal pressure hydrocephalus, status post implantation of"
		"VPS one year prior to the presentation; who was admitted with a fever, lethargy"
		and confusion for three days. He was treated empirically with intravenous
		cefepime and vancomycin for VPS infection. The CSF analysis from both the lumbar
		"puncture and the VPS was significant for a low white blood count, low glucose and"
		high protein. Other work-up including India ink and cryptococcal antigen was
		unrevealing. He remained febrile despite antibiotic treatment for 5 days. The CSF
		from the shunt was sent for analysis again and it demonstrated similar results
		"from the prior study, but the culture was now positive for Cryptococcus"
		neoformans. The patient was started on oral flucytosine and intravenous liposomal
		amphotericin B. The VPS was removed and an externalized ventricular catheter was
		placed. The patient showed rapid resolution of the symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: To
		"date, there was a total of nine reported cases of cryptococcal VPS infection upon"
		review of the literature. Our presenting case and the literature review highlight
		the difficulties in making an accurate diagnosis of cryptococcal shunt infection.
		There were case reports of false negative cryptococcal antigen tests with culture
		proven cryptococcal meningitis. The CSF culture from the shunt remains a mainstay
		for identifying cryptococcal shunt infection. Cryptococcal shunt infections are
		rare and early diagnosis and treatment is essential for patient management which
		involves shunt replacement with concomitant administration of intravenous
		antifungal medication. High clinical suspicion is crucial and shunt culture
		preferably from the valve is recommended.

AB	-	Introduction: Multiple adverse effects have been described for the biological
		therapy in autoimmune diseases including many secondary to immunosuppression
		"producing bacterial, fungal, or viral infections. Clinical case: We present the"
		case of a 64-year-old female patient with proven disseminated cryptococcosis
		secondary to the use of tofacitinib. Other possible causes of immunosuppression
		such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were ruled out. The patient had
		been in treatment for rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed three years before. This
		drug is a biological agent that inhibits JAK enzymes. Very few cases of pulmonary

		bear in mind the possibility of this type of invasive fungal infection associated
		with biological therapy and to take a risk-management approach.

PG	-	565
LID	-	10.1186/s12872-022-02997-9 [doi]
LID	-	565
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcus neoformans is an invasive fungal infection commonly
		"affecting immunocompromised patients as pneumonia or meningitis. More rarely,"
		"case reports describe Cryptococcus neoformans endocarditis, though nearly"
		"exclusively among patients with active immunosuppression, implanted cardiac"
		devices or prosthetic valves. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a patient
		with underlying substance abuse disorder and systolic heart failure presenting
		"with fever, altered mental status, and shower emboli subsequently found to have"
		native tricuspid valve vegetations and blood cultures positive for cryptococcus
		"neoformans in the absence of immunosuppression. CONCLUSIONS: Historically,"
		Cryptococcus neoformans fungemia manifests clinically as pneumonia or meningitis
		among the immunosuppressed. There have been rare reports of endocarditis in this
		population and even fewer reports of native valve endocarditis exist. The present
		"case along with mortality reported in prior literature, suggest suspicion must be"
		"maintained in the absence of immunosuppression, even in patients with native"
		valves.

TI	-	Clinicopathological features of cryptococcal lymphadenitis and a review of
		literature.
PG	-	26-30
LID	-	10.3960/jslrt.17011 [doi]
AB	-	Cryptococcosis is an invasive fungal infection in immunocompromised patients. The
		clinicopathological characteristics of cryptococcal lymphadenitis are not well
		known. We analyzed three cases of cryptococcal lymphadenitis and compared their
		characteristics with those in previous reports. Two patients were human
		"immunodeficiency virus (HIV) carriers, and one patient was a human T-cell"
		leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1) carrier. The age of the HTLV-1 carrier with
		cryptococcosis was much higher than that of the HIV-1 carriers. CD4-positive cell
		counts in peripheral blood were 5.8/μL (Case 1) and 79.9/μL (Case 2) in the HIV
		carriers and 3285/μL in the HTLV-1 carrier (Case 3). According to flow cytometric
		"analysis of the lymph nodes of Cases 1, 2, and 3, 50.0%, 87.1%, and 85.9%,"
		"respectively, of the T-cells were CD3; 9.8%, 16.3%, and 75.8%, respectively, were"
		"CD4; and 35.5%, 77.3%, and 10.2%, respectively, were CD8. Cryptococcus neoformans"
		was detected in tissue culture in all patients. Although gelatinous lesions and
		"numerous fungal cocci were observed in the two HIV patients, the granuloma"
		formation was small. Gelatinous formation and granuloma formation were observed
		"in the HTLV-1 carrier. Necrosis was observed in all cases. In previous reports,"
		"granuloma formation, epithelioid cells, and necrotic lesions were observed in"
		"most cases. Most of the patients were also immunosuppressed. However, no HTLV-1"
		"carrier was detected. In conclusion, lymphadenopathy in a HTLV-1 carrier may"
		suggest the presence of cryptococcal lymphadenitis. The frequency of
		cryptococcosis in HTVL-1 carriers may increase with increase in the long-term
		survival rate of HTLV-1 carriers.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic pathogen that causes
		"∼15% mortality in AIDS patients. Rio Grande City, Rio Grande do Sul (RS), Brazil,"
		"has the highest national rate of HIV/AIDS, considering cities with population"
		"more than 100,000 habitants. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the clinical and"
		epidemiological profile of cryptococcosis in a reference service for HIV-AIDS
		"patients in the South region of Brazil, over seven years. Material and methods A"
		retrospective study was performed including all cryptococcosis cases diagnosed at
		"the University Hospital, Federal University of Rio Grande (UH-FURG) between"
		January 2010 and December 2016. RESULTS: Seventy cases of cryptococcosis were
		diagnosis from 2010 to 2016 in the UH-FURG in the seven years of the study. These
		numbers were responsible for 2.1% to 8.1% of the hospitalizations/year for HIV
		patients. All were caused by C. neoformans infection (95% C. neoformans var.
		grubii VNI and 5% C. neoformans var. grubii VNII). Neurocryptococcosis was the
		major clinical manifestation and cryptococcosis was the HIV- defining condition
		in 40% of patients. The period of hospitalization was an average of 39.3 days
		"(SD=31.3), and more than half of patients (53%; 37/70) died after a mean of 82"
		days. DISCUSSION: The present study showed the importance of cryptococcosis as an
		AIDS-defining disease in HIV-AIDS patients in a tertiary hospital from Southern
		Brazil. More investment is necessary to reduce the impact of this opportunistic
		mycosis in HIV-AIDS patients from southern Brazil.

TI	-	The Simultaneous Occurrence of Histoplasmosis and Cryptococcal Fungemia: A Case
		Report and Review of the Literature.
PG	-	891-897
AB	-	Simultaneous infections with Cryptococcus neoformans and Histoplasma capsulatum
		"are rare and typically occur in immunocompromised individuals, particularly AIDS"
		patients. Because both of those fungi can spur the development of latent
		"infections, it is generally unknown which organism was first present. The"
		"diagnosis of one fungus can hide the diagnosis of the other, leading to"
		underdiagnoses and poor prognosis. We report a case of C. neoformans and H.
		capsulatum co-infection. We also performed a systematic review of the literature.
		"Our patient, a 69-year-old HIV-negative man, presented with a 9-month history of"
		"a productive cough, dyspnea and wheezing. His history showed chronic obstructive"
		pulmonary disease and type II diabetes mellitus (DM). Pulmonary lesions of
		unidentified etiology were noted. Cryptococcal involvement of the central nervous
		"system was confirmed, and C. neoformans and H. capsulatum were also isolated from"
		"blood cultures. In the literature, we found ten cases of simultaneous"
		"histoplasmosis and cryptococcosis. Including our patient, all of the cases were"
		"located in North America and Latin America, except for two, one Indian and one"
		"African diagnosed in France. AIDS was the main predisposing factor, followed by"
		DM and age >60 years. Several diagnostic methods were employed. A blood culture
		and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) culture resulted in the growth of C. neoformans
		in most of the cases. H. capsulatum was more often detected in BAL and bone
		"marrow cultures. Although co-infection by these pathogens is severe, it can be"

AB	-	"Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which is responsible for tuberculosis (TB) and"
		"Cryptococcus sp. responsible for cryptococcosis, are pathogenic microorganisms"
		that especially affect patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus
		"(HIV). Both diseases present similar classic symptoms, which makes diagnosis and"
		"treatment consequently difficult. To our knowledge, a few reported cases of M."
		tuberculosis and Cryptococcus sp. co-infection in non-HIV patients exist. This
		study reports a TB and neurocryptococcosis (NC) comorbidity case in a patient who
		had no clinical or serological evidence of HIV-compromised immunity. A
		"49-year-old male patient, a farmer with a low education level, previously"
		diagnosed with TB and was undergoing treatment for a month when he presented
		"progressive headaches, fever, drowsiness and photosensitivity, a stiff neck and a"
		"positive Lasègue test. During hospitalization, the patient was also diagnosed"
		"with NC through cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, which revealed the presence"
		"of capsulated yeasts by contrast with india ink. Following the yeast isolation,"
		proteomic and molecular analyzes were performed. The patient received antifungal
		"therapy in parallel with TB treatment, which caused complications and had to be"
		"modified twice. However, after three months of hospitalization the patient was"
		discharged. Tuberculosis and cryptococcosis co-infection is a clinical and
		"laboratory challenge, often leading to a delay in diagnosis. In this paper we"
		emphasize the need to understand these infectious comorbidities in non-HIV
		"patients from South America, since the few cases reported in the literature are"
		from studies conducted in the United States and China.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcal ventriculoperitoneal shunt infection is known to occur
		due to an underlying infection in the patient rather than by nosocomial
		transmission of Cryptococcus during shunt placement. A case of chronic
		hydrocephalus due to cryptococcal meningitis that was misdiagnosed as tuberculous
		meningitis is described. CASE REPORT: Patient details were extracted from charts
		and laboratory records. The identification of the isolate was confirmed by
		PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism of the orotodine monophosphate
		pyrophosphorylase (URA5) gene. Antifungal susceptibility was determined using the
		"CLSI M27-A3 broth microdilution method. Besides, a Medline search was performed"
		to review all cases of Cryptococcus ventriculoperitoneal shunt infection.
		Cryptococcus neoformans sensu stricto (formerly Cryptococcus neoformans var.
		"grubii), mating-type MATα was isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid and external"
		ventricular drain tip. The isolate showed low minimum inhibitory concentrations
		"for voriconazole (0.06mg/l), fluconazole (8mg/l), isavuconazole (<0.015mg/l),"
		"posaconazole (<0.03mg/l), amphotericin B (<0.06mg/l) and 5-fluorocytosine"
		"(1mg/l). The patient was treated with intravenous amphotericin B deoxycholate,"
		but died of cardiopulmonary arrest on the fifteenth postoperative day.
		CONCLUSIONS: This report underlines the need to rule out a Cryptococcus infection
		in those cases of chronic meningitis with hydrocephalus.

AB	-	An otherwise healthy 65-year-old male from a rural area presented with a 1-month
		old non-tender scalp mass. He had a history of being stuck with a stone in the
		parietal region a year earlier but hadn't developed any complications. Needle
		"aspiration of the mass revealed numerous yeast cells, which were confirmed to be"
		Cryptoccus neoformans. This case describes a rare presentation of C. neoformans
		"infection in a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative patient. Moreover,"
		"while osteomyelitis due to Cryptococcus is generally preceded by fungemia, in the"
		present case it was caused by direct inoculation of the etiologic agent. We
		review 11 similar cases published since 1983 in which most of the patients
		developed an insidious mass in their scalps with osteolytic lesions as seen on
		X-ray and all were HIV-negative. Nine of the eleven patients in these cases had
		"good recovery after surgical debridement and treatment with amphotericin B,"
		flucytocise and/or fluconazole. The remaining two patients died during
		hospitalization. Cryptococcal osteomyelitis should be part of a differential
		diagnosis when confronted with an insidious growing mass or abscess of unclear
		origin in the scalp.

PG	-	1133-1141
LID	-	10.1093/cid/ciab268 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcosis due to Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii
		"varies with geographic region, populations affected, disease manifestations, and"
		"severity of infection, which impact treatment. METHODS: We developed a"
		retrospective cohort of patients diagnosed with culture-proven cryptococcosis
		during 1995-2013 from 5 centers in North America and Australia. We compared
		"underlying diseases, clinical manifestations, treatment, and outcomes in patients"
		with C. gattii or C. neoformans infection. RESULTS: A total of 709 patients (452
		C. neoformans; 257 C. gattii) were identified. Mean age was 50.2 years; 61.4%
		were male; and 52.3% were white. Time to diagnosis was prolonged in C. gattii
		"patients compared with C. neoformans (mean, 52.2 vs 36.0 days; P < .003), and"
		there was a higher proportion of C. gattii patients without underlying disease
		"(40.5% vs 10.2%; P < .0001). Overall, 59% had central nervous system (CNS)"
		"infection, with lung (42.5%) and blood (24.5%) being common sites. Pulmonary"
		infection was more common in patients with C. gattii than in those with C.
		neoformans (60.7% vs 32.1%; P < .0001). CNS or blood infections were more common
		in C. neoformans-infected patients (P ≤ .0001 for both). Treatment of CNS disease
		with induction therapy of amphotericin B and flucytosine occurred in 76.4% of
		patients. Crude 12-month mortality was higher in patients with C. neoformans
		"(28.4% vs 20.2%; odds ratio, 1.56 [95% confidence interval, 1.08-2.26])."
		CONCLUSIONS: This study emphasizes differences in species-specific epidemiology
		"and outcomes of patients with cryptococcosis, including underlying diseases, site"
		"of infection, and mortality. Species identification in patients with"
		"cryptococcosis is necessary to discern epidemiologic patterns, guide treatment"
		"regimens, and predict clinical progression and outcomes."

TI	-	Epidemiology: surveillance of fungal infections.
PG	-	173-82
AB	-	Surveillance for fungal diseases is essential to improve our understanding of
		their epidemiology and to enable research and prevention efforts to be
		"prioritized. In order to conduct better surveillance for fungal diseases, it is"
		"important to develop more accurate and timely diagnostic tests, to follow"
		rigorous epidemiological methods and to have adequate support from public health
		agencies and the pharmaceutical industry. Investigations of nosocomial and
		community outbreaks of fungal infection have also resulted in a better
		"understanding of the sources and routes of transmission of these diseases, and of"
		the risk factors for infection. This has led to more effective prevention and
		"control strategies. In addition, outbreak investigations have offered excellent"
		"opportunities to develop new molecular sub-typing methods, and to evaluate and"
		"validate older ones. For example, results obtained from a global epidemiological"
		study of the genomic structure of Cryptococcus neoformans have led to a better
		"understanding of the epidemiology of cryptococcosis. Similarly, a study of"
		variations in the genotype of Trichophyton rubrum has found that patients may
		"become infected with multiple strains, which has important implications for study"
		design when looking at the epidemiology of dermatophyte infections.

		California: 93 cases (1988-2010).
PG	-	357-69
LID	-	10.2460/javma.239.3.357 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To compare clinical features of cryptococcosis among cats and dogs in
		"California, determine whether the distribution of involved tissues differs from"
		"distribution reported previously in a study in southeastern Australia, and"
		identify Cryptococcus spp isolated from the study population. DESIGN:
		Retrospective case series. ANIMALS: 62 cats and 31 dogs with cryptococcosis.
		PROCEDURES: Medical records of cats and dogs with cryptococcosis were reviewed.
		"Information collected included geographic location, species, signalment, and"
		"tissues or organs involved. Cryptococcosis was confirmed via serology, cytology,"
		"histology, or microbial culture, and molecular typing was performed. Odds ratios"
		and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to determine significant
		associations among variables. Other comparisons were evaluated via χ(2) or
		"unpaired t tests. RESULTS: American Cocker Spaniels were overrepresented,"
		compared with other dog breeds. Serum cryptococcal antigen test results were
		positive in 51 of 53 cats and 15 of 18 dogs tested. Cryptococcus gattii was more
		"commonly detected in cats (7/9 for which species identification was performed),"
		and Cryptococcus neoformans was more commonly detected in dogs (6/8). Six of 7 C
		gattii isolates from cats were molecular type VGIII. Distribution of involved
		tissues was different between cats and dogs in California and between populations
		of the present study and those of the previously reported Australian study.
		CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Strains of Cryptococcus spp appeared to have
		host specificity in dogs and cats. Differences in lesion distribution between
		geographic locations may reflect strain differences or referral bias. Antigen
		assays alone may not be sufficient for diagnosis of cryptococcosis in cats and
		dogs.

AB	-	An outbreak of infections due to a rare subspecies of Cryptococcus neoformans
		"(var. gattii) was recognized on Vancouver Island (VI), British Columbia, in 2002,"
		"which had affected 59, mostly immunocompetent, individuals since 1999. The"
		objectives of this study were to: (1) determine if the outbreak had spread to
		"Vancouver and its surrounding communities and (2) review the epidemiological,"
		clinical and pathological features of all cryptococcal infections in patients
		admitted to the Vancouver Hospital and Health Sciences Centre (VHHSC) over a 5
		year period. VHHSC microbiology and pathology databases were searched for
		cryptococcal infections from 1 June 1997 to 31 December 2002. Hospital charts of
		all identified patients were reviewed. Available cryptococcal isolates and
		histopathological specimens were reviewed. Twenty-six cases of cryptococcosis
		were identified in both HIV-positive (n = 15) and HIV-negative (n = 11) patients.
		"C. neoformans var. grubii was cultured from 13 patients, of whom 10 were"
		"HIV-positive. The outbreak strain, C. neoformans var. gattii, was detected in"
		three patients; all had travelled to VI. C. neoformans var. neoformans was
		"cultured from two patients, Cryptococcus laurentii was cultured from one, and"
		"seven patients had cryptococcosis based on histopathology alone, without"
		cultures. The majority (10/15) of the HIV-positive patients developed systemic
		disease whilst HIV-negative patients (8/11) presented with pulmonary
		"cryptococcosis. Lung biopsies revealed necrotizing and/or fibrosing granulomas,"
		with cryptococcal cells in 5 of 10 specimens. Brain biopsies showed cryptococcal
		organisms within leptomeninges and deeper structures with minimal associated
		inflammation. This retrospective study demonstrated a sharp increase in the total
		number of C. neoformans infections in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent
		patients at the VHHSC in 2002. There was no evidence of spread of the outbreak
		strain to the Greater Vancouver area. This is the first correlation of clinical
		and investigational findings of cryptococcosis in a region in North America where
		C. neoformans varieties gattii and grubii are endemic.

AB	-	"OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical features, treatments, outcomes, and subtype"
		prevalence of cryptococcosis in Singapore. METHODS: All patients with laboratory
		confirmed cryptococcal infections admitted from 1999 to 2007 to a teaching

		types of Cryptococcus neoformans variants and Cryptococcus gattii were determined
		by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP).
		Serotypes were inferred with a multiplex PCR method. RESULTS: Of 62 patients with
		"cryptococcosis, C. neoformans var. grubii was the predominant subtype (in 95%),"
		affecting mainly immunocompromised hosts (91%) with HIV infection (80%). Patients
		"with HIV were younger (median age 36.5 vs. 49.5 years, p=0.006) and less likely"
		"to present with an altered mental status (14% vs. 50%, p=0.013). In contrast,"
		"delayed treatment (median 7 days vs. 2 days, p=0.03), pulmonary involvement (58%"
		"vs. 14%, p=0.03), and initial treatment with fluconazole (25% vs. 2%, p=0.02)"
		"were more common in HIV-negative patients. C. gattii was uncommon, affecting only"
		"three patients, all of whom were immunocompetent and had disseminated disease"
		"with pulmonary and neurological involvement. All C. gattii were RFLP type VG II,"
		"serotype B and all C. neoformans var. grubii were RFLP type VN I, serotype A,"
		"except for one that was RFLP type VN II. CONCLUSION: C. neoformans var. grubii,"
		"subtype VN I, was the predominant subtype in Singapore, infecting younger, mainly"
		"immunocompromised hosts with HIV. C. gattii was uncommon, causing pulmonary"
		"manifestations in older, immunocompetent patients and were RFLP type VG II."

AB	-	Diabetes mellitus II (DM II) is a newly defined independent factor contributing
		to the morbidity and mortality of cryptococcosis. This retrospective case
		"analysis aims to explore the epidemiology, clinical profile and strain"
		characteristics of cryptococcosis in Chinese DM II patients. This study included
		30 cases of cryptococcosis with DM II occurring from 1993 to 2015 in mainland
		China. The hospital-based prevalence of cryptococcosis in DM II was 0.21%. The
		"mean age of the patients was 56.1 years (95% confidence interval: 51.5, 60.6),"
		and 93% of the patients were older than 40 years. Sixty-two per cent of the
		patients experienced untreated or poorly controlled blood glucose before
		infection. Multilocus sequence typing analysis categorised all cultured strains
		as Cryptococcus neoformans and sequence type 5. Sixty-nine per cent of pulmonary
		cryptococcosis patients experienced misdiagnoses and treatment delays. Sixty per
		cent of cryptococcal meningitis patients received substandard antifungal therapy.
		The overall death rate was 33%. Considering the large population size of DM II
		"patients in China, improved attention should be paid to the high prevalence of"
		cryptococcosis as revealed by us. We also emphasised the importance of blood
		"glucose control for infection prevention, especially among the elderly."

AB	-	"Initially reported in tropical regions, Cryptococcus gattii infection is now"
		diagnosed globally. Methods: case report; Literature review. Although initial
		reports described outbreaks of pulmonary and central nervous system (CNS) disease
		"in tropical regions such as Australia and New Guinea, it is now clear that"
		"Cryptococcus gattii is a global, neurotropic pathogen. In contrast with C."
		"neoformans, C. gattii patients are more likely to present with cryptococcomas in"
		the brain and lungs and are often HIV negative. Imaging findings can mimick
		cancer leading to delays in diagnosis and definitive treatment. Some experts have
		"speculated that the spread of C. gattii is due to climate change, newly"
		"recognized genotypes that cause disease in temperate zones (genotype VGII),"
		"international travel, and improved awareness among physicians and veterinarians."
		"We emphasize neurocritical and neurosurgical management, because patients with"
		CNS involvement often have high intracranial pressures (ICP). Cryptococcus gattii
		patients often have elevated ICP without 'red flag' radiographic signs of
		"elevated ICP such as ventriculomegaly, cerebral edema, or effaced basal cisterns."
		"Therefore, diagnosis of high ICP should be suspected based on clinical symptoms"
		"such as incapacitating headaches, progressive visual loss and associated"
		"papilledema, and then confirmed by measuring the opening pressure with lumbar"
		puncture (LP). Cerebral intraparenchymal deposition of the large cryptococcal
		polysaccharide capsule and cryptococcal organisms causes poor brain compliance
		leading to a 'frozen brain state.' Mortality rates and clinical outcomes are
		"significantly improved with early diagnosis, antifungal therapies, steroids, and"
		aggressive management of elevated ICP including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
		"diversion by serial LP's, external ventricular drains and CSF shunts. Following"
		"institution of antifungal therapy, about 10% of patients can worsen due to immune"
		reconstitution inflammatory syndrome which responds to steroids. We recommend
		neurocritical and neurosurgical management of C. gattii patients with CNS
		involvement and elevated ICP. There is often poor correlation between elevated
		ICP and neuroimaging due to the frozen brain state.

		literature.
PG	-	959-963
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: Cryptococcus is an opportunistic yeast with a worldwide distribution
		"that primarily causes significant infections in immunocompromised individuals,"
		generally by affecting the respiratory tract. But primary cutaneous
		cryptococcosis (PCC) without systemic infection is rare. We report a case of PCC
		in a patient with nephrotic syndrome. METHODS: The 23-year-old man developed
		severe necrotising cellulitis on both the anterior and posterior of his trunk
		following a massage. He had been treated with systemic corticosteroids over
		20 months for nephrotic syndrome. A skin biopsy of the wound area revealed
		cutaneous vasculitis and chronic inflammation with yeast-like organisms. Periodic
		acid-Schiff (PAS) staining indicated that the structures were consistent with
		Cryptococcus. A Cryptococcus neoformans infection was confirmed by culture. Azole
		"therapy was begun, and the skin ulcers gradually stopped disseminating. However,"
		the patient died following continuous capillary haemorrhage on the 22 day since
		admission. CONCLUSION: Cryptococcus is crucial to be considered in the
		differential diagnosis of subcutaneous necrosis in any patient on
		immunosuppressive therapy.

AB	-	A 68-year-old man presented for outpatient evaluation of dyspnea and new-onset
		atrial fibrillation 9 months after undergoing bilateral lung transplantation.
		Echocardiography prior to cardioversion raised concern for tamponade. Therapeutic
		pericardiocentesis returned fluid containing 1875 wbc/mcl (68% pmn) and yielded
		Cryptococcus neoformans in culture. Cryptococcal antigen was detected in serum at
		a titer of 1:20. Cerebrospinal (CSF) fluid was without evidence of inflammation
		and without detectable cryptococcal antigen. There was no radiographic evidence
		of pulmonary cryptococcosis. Cultures of blood and CSF were without growth.
		Liposomal amphotericin B (3 mg/kg/day) was administered for 15 days. Oral
		"fluconazole was added on day seven of amphotericin, and the patient was"
		"discharged to home 3 days later. Daily dosages of prednisone (10 mg),"
		"mycophenolate (500 mg), and tacrolimus (3 mg) at discharge were the same as at"
		hospital admission. He was readmitted 12 days later with dyspnea and with
		re-accumulation and loculation of pericardial fluid. A pericardial window was
		created. Pericardial fluid contained 722 wbc/mcl (35% pmn); Cryptococcus was not
		identified on direct examinations or cultures of pericardial fluid or tissue.
		Cryptococcus antigen was present in serum at 1:160. Liposomal amphotericin B was
		resumed and continued for 2 weeks followed by resumption of fluconazole.
		Mycophenolate was stopped. Prednisone and tacrolimus were continued. Restrictive
		"pericarditis was evident 3 weeks after window creation. Colchicine was initiated,"
		prednisone increased to 15 mg daily and pericardiectomy planned. We aim to raise
		awareness to Cryptococcus as a potential etiology for pericarditis in solid organ
		transplant recipients.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis (CM) is a severe infection of
		central nervous system with high mortality and morbidity. Infection-related
		"inflammatory syndrome is a rare complication of CM. Herein, we report a case of"
		CM complicated by infection-related inflammatory syndrome. CASE PRESENTATION: A
		42-year-old man with chronic hepatitis B presented with a 3-day history of
		aphasia and left hemiparesis at an outside medical facility. The brain magnetic
		resonance imaging (MRI) showed symmetric and confluent hyperintense signal
		"abnormalities mainly located in the basal ganglia, internal capsule, external"
		"capsule, periventricular, corona radiata, frontal and temporal lobes."
		Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examinations revealed elevated leukocyte and protein.
		India ink staining was positive for Cryptococcus. CSF culture and metagenomic
		next-generation sequencing (mNGS) confirmed Cryptococcus neoformans. Initial
		"response was observed with intravenous fluconazole (400 mg per day). However,"
		"11 days later, he developed impaired consciousness and incontinence of urine and"
		feces. A repeat brain MRI showed the lesions were progressive and enlarged. The
		patient was referred to our department at this point of time. Repeat CSF analysis
		"(India ink staining, culture and mNGS) re-confirmed Cryptococcus. However,"
		"clinical worsening after initial improvement, laboratory examinations and brain"
		MRI findings suggested a diagnosis of infection-related inflammatory syndrome.
		"Therefore, a combination of corticosteroids and antifungal therapy was initiated."
		"At follow-up, a complete neurological recovery without any relapse was"
		documented. The repeat brain MRI showed complete resolution of the previous
		lesions. CONCLUSIONS: This case demonstrated that cryptococcal inflammatory
		syndromes must be suspected in cases of CM if an otherwise unexplained clinical
		deterioration is observed after initial recovery. The same can happen even before
		"the primary infection is controlled. Thus, timely identification and prompt"
		treatment is vital to reduce the mortality and disability of CM. The
		administration of corticosteroids in combination with antifungal therapy is an
		effective strategy in such cases. Clinical course and treatment process of the
		patient. Hemiparalysis and aphasia improved after the initiation of antifungal
		"treatment. However, the patient developed impaired consciousness companied by"
		deterioration of brain MRI findings. He was treated with adjunctive
		"glucocorticoid taper therapy consisting of dexamethasone (20 mg/day,"
		"intravenously) for 1 week followed by oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/day, tapered based"
		"on clinical and radiological response, along with amphotericin B (0.6 mg/kg/day,"
		"intravenously), voriconazole (400 mg/day in 2 divided doses, intravenously), and"
		"5-flucytosine (100 mg/kg/day in 4 divided doses, orally). Two weeks later, his"
		"symptoms improved significantly. After discharge, he began oral voriconazole for"
		consolidation and maintenance therapy for 8 weeks and 9 months respectively. He
		recovered without any neurological sequelae at 6-month follow-up. Note:
		MRI = magnetic resonance imaging.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: This study aims to explore the epidemiology, clinical profile and"
		strain characteristics of cryptococcosis from 2013 to 2017 in a major teaching
		hospital in China. METHODS: Trends in antifungal drug susceptibility of 217
		consecutive non-repetitive cryptococcal isolates collected from patients of an
		"university hospital in China were analyzed between 2013 and 2017. Of those, 98"
		isolates were conserved for identification by internal transcribed spacer (ITS)
		sequencing and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass
		spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) system. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was used to
		designate molecular types. Clinical characteristics of the 98 patients with
		cryptococcosis during the period of 2013-2017 were retrospectively evaluated.
		RESULTS: There was a trend for gradual increase in the MIC range of fluconazole
		was from 2013 to 2017. The conserved 98 clinical cryptococcal isolates included
		"97 C. neoformans and one C. gattii, and 90 (91.8%) isolates belonged to ST5"
		"genotype VNI. Out of the 98 patients with cryptococcosis, 28 (28.6%) were"
		HIV-infected and 32 (32.7%) had no underlying diseases. HIV-infected patients had
		"higher mortality than HIV-uninfected patients (28.6% vs 14.3%, p=0.147)."
		CONCLUSIONS: Most of the patients with cryptococcosis were not HIV-infected in
		"this study, while patients with HIV had a higher mortality. Reduced"
		"susceptibility to fluconazole was observed among C. neoformans isolates, most of"
		them belonged to ST5 genotype VNI having an impact on the effective dose of
		fluconazole.

AB	-	"The incidence of cryptococcosis was evaluated in and around Chandigarh, India"
		over a period of 10 years (1982-91). Different species of Cryptococcus were
		isolated from 38 patients. Cryptococcus neoformans was the predominant isolate
		"(26 = 68%) followed by Cr. albidus (2), Cr. laurentii (1) and not precisely"
		identified Cryptococcus species (9 = 24%). Serotyping of the 18 isolates of Cr.
		"neoformans revealed that 13 (72%) were serotype A, two (11%) were serotype AD and"
		three (17%) were serotype B (Cr. neoformans var. gattii). Cryptococcus species
		were found to produce infection in 24 patients and were possibly transient
		"colonizers in another 14 patients. In addition, in 11 patients no Cryptococcus"
		species was isolated from any site but the latex agglutination test for antigen
		(Crypto-LA) was positive in serum and/or cerebrospinal fluid. Response to various
		antifungal drugs was also studied in these patients.

TI	-	Invasive fungal infection in systemic lupus erythematosus: an analysis of 15
		cases and a literature review.
PG	-	539-44
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To analyse 15 cases of invasive fungal infection and mortality
		parameters in the largest series in the last 35 yrs of patients with systemic
		lupus erythematosus (SLE) at a single medical centre. METHODS: Fifteen patients
		with SLE and invasive fungal infections were retrospectively enrolled. Clinical
		"and laboratory data, fungal species and infected sites, corticosteroid and"
		immunosuppressant doses and SLE disease activity index were assessed
		retrospectively. Comparison and correlation analyses utilized Fisher's exact
		"test, the chi-square test, Mann-Whitney U-test or the Wilcoxon signed-rank test"
		"where appropriate. RESULTS: In contrast to other review reports, Cryptococcus"
		neoformans was the most commonly identified fungus in this Taiwanese series.
		"Notably, the prevalence of autoimmune haemolytic anaemia and positive results for"
		the anti-cardiolipin antibody in this study were significantly higher than those
		"in SLE patients in general (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.0001, respectively). Fungal"
		"infection contributed to cause of death in 7 of 15 (46.7%) patients, of which"
		Cryptococcus neoformans accounted for six of these infections. Low-dose
		prednisolone (<1 or <0.5 mg/kg/day based on arbitrary division) prior to fungal
		infection tended to correlate with 1 yr mortality after diagnosis of SLE (P =
		"0.077 or P = 0.080). However, following fungal infection, patients who died from"
		infection itself had been prescribed with higher prednisolone dose or equivalent
		than surviving patients (P = 0.016). All SLE patients with fungal infections had
		active SLE (SLEDAI >7). CONCLUSIONS: Cryptococcus neoformans infection accounted
		for most fatalities in SLE patients with fungal infections in this series. Active
		lupus disease is probably a risk factor for fungal infection in SLE patients.
		"Notably, low prednisolone doses prior to fungal infection or high prednisolone"
		doses following fungal infection tended to associate with or correlated to
		"fatality, respectively. Therefore, we suggest that different prednisolone doses"
		prescribed at various times impact the incidence of fungal infection and its
		associated mortality.

		"clinical outcomes of patients with cryptococcosis were investigated. In addition,"
		a molecular analysis of the Cryptococcus neoformans species complex isolated from
		these patients was performed. METHODS: A prospective study of 62 cases of
		patients with cryptococcal infection was conducted at the Hospital de Doenças
		Tropicais de Goiás Dr. Anuar Auad from 2009-2010. Cryptococcal meningitis cases
		were diagnosed by direct examination and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample
		culture. The profiling of these patients was assessed. The CSF samples were
		"submitted to India ink preparation and cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar, and"
		"C. neoformans was identified by the production of urease, a positive"
		phenoloxidase test and assimilation of carbohydrates. C. neoformans and C. gattii
		isolates were distinguished by growth on L-canavanine-glycine-bromothymol blue
		"medium, and molecular analysis was conducted via PCR fingerprinting reactions"
		"using M13 and (GACA)4 primers. RESULTS: From the 62 patients with cryptococcosis,"
		71 isolates of CSF were obtained; 67 (94.4%) isolates were identified as C.
		"neoformans var. grubii/VNI, and 4 (5.6%) were identified as C. gattii/VGII. Of"
		"these patients, 53 had an HIV diagnosis. The incidence of cryptococcosis was"
		"higher among patients 20-40 years of age, with 74.2% of the cases reported in"
		"males. Cryptococcus-related mortality was noted in 48.4% of the patients, and the"
		"symptoms were altered sensorium, headache, fever and stiff neck. CONCLUSIONS: The"
		high morbidity and mortality observed among patients with cryptococcosis
		demonstrate the importance of obtaining information regarding the epidemiological
		"profile and clinical course of the disease in the State of Goiás, Brazil."

AB	-	BACKGROUND Pulmonary cryptococcosis is an uncommon infection mainly affecting
		immunocompromised individuals. Presentation of cryptococcal disease ranges from
		asymptomatic pulmonary colonization to severe pneumonia. It can progress to acute
		respiratory failure and life-threatening meningoencephalitis. CASE REPORT A
		"55-year-old woman with a history of a kidney transplant, on immunosuppressive"
		"therapy, presented to the hospital with persistent low-grade fever, headache,"
		"weight loss, and fatigue for 2 weeks. On arrival, she was tachycardic,"
		"normotensive, and saturating 99% on room air. Her chest X-ray showed right middle"
		lung opacity measuring 1.9×2.8 cm. She was admitted and started on broad-spectrum
		antibiotics for suspected pneumonia. Her chest computed tomography (CT) scan
		"showed a 3.0×1.7 cm hypo-dense opacity at the right upper lobe. Overnight, she"
		developed a severe headache and neck stiffness. Her serum cryptococcal antigen
		and cerebrospinal fluid culture results were positive. The patient was started on
		intravenous liposomal amphotericin B plus flucytosine. A CT-guided lung biopsy
		was performed to rule out malignancy. Cultures came back positive for
		Cryptococcus neoformans. She completed a 2-week course of amphotericin and
		flucytosine and was switched to oral fluconazole to complete an 8-week course.
		CONCLUSIONS Prompt diagnosis and effective management of the cryptococcal disease
		"can decrease morbidity and mortality. Diagnosis requires CT-guided lung biopsy,"
		with culture growing mucoid colonies of Cryptococcus neoformans. Antifungal
		therapy with intravenous liposomal amphotericin B plus flucytosine is the
		mainstay of treatment. Clinicians should be aware of the various presentations of
		"pulmonary cryptococcosis, especially in immunocompromised patients."

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcus neoformans is frequently present as an opportunistic
		pathogen mainly affecting immunocompromised populations. Disseminated C.
		neoformans infection in immunocompetent population is rare and usually involves
		lung and central nerve system. Cryptococcus from biologic samples can easily grow
		"on routine fungal and bacterial culture media. Besides, cryptococcal latex"
		agglutination test has been established as a reliable diagnostic tool with
		overall sensitivities of 93-100%. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a rare
		disseminated cryptococcosis case which presented with chronic recurrent multiple
		"abscess in an immunocompetent male involving skin, lung, spine and iliac fossa"
		without evidence of central nerve system involving. The results of serum
		cryptococcal latex agglutination tests and standard microbial cultures were
		negative. The patient underwent empirical anti-bacterial and anti-tuberculosis
		"therapy which turned out to be effectless. Finally, bedside inoculation of the"
		"pus was carried out and revealed Cryptococcus neoformans, which was confirmed by"
		polymerase chain reaction. After the administration of anti-fungal drugs
		"including liposomal amphotericin B, the patient recovered from fever and"
		paraplegia. CONCLUSIONS: This case reveals an uncommon pattern of disseminated C.
		neoformans infection in immunocompetent population presented with chronic
		multiple abscess and without central nerve system involving. Negative routine
		"microbial cultures may not necessarily rule out cryptococcosis, especially in"
		"early stage. Besides, cryptococcal latex agglutination test does have a chance of"
		"false negative, which might be related with ""capsule-deficiency"". Moreover, this"
		phenomenon could be related with low-grade virulence and relative long illness
		duration.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcal epidemiology is changing in the modern antiretroviral
		"era, and immune status informs outcomes. We describe the differences in clinical"
		presentation and mortality of cryptococcosis by immune status in the
		antiretroviral therapy era. METHODS: We conducted a single-center retrospective
		cohort study of patients diagnosed with cryptococcosis from 2002 through 2017.
		"Data included demographics, clinical features, diagnostics, and mortality."
		RESULTS: We identified 304 patients with Cryptococcus neoformans infections: 105
		"(35%) were people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 41 (13%) had a"
		"history of transplantation, and 158 (52%) were non-HIV nontransplant (NHNT). Age"
		analysis showed that people living with HIV were younger (40 years) than
		transplant (53 years) and NHNT (61 years) (P < .001). Fevers and headache were
		more common in people living with HIV (70% and 57%) than in transplant (49% and
		"29%) and NHNT (49% and 38%) (P = .003 and P = .001), respectively. Meningitis was"
		more common in people living with HIV (68%) than in transplant recipients (32%)
		"or NHNT (39%, P < .001). Disseminated cryptococcosis was more common in people"
		living with HIV (97%) as compared with transplant (66%) or NHNT (73%) (P < .001).
		"Time to diagnosis from hospitalization was longer for transplant (median 2 days,"
		"interquartile range [IQR] ± 9 days) and NHNT patients (median 2 days, IQR ± 7"
		"days) as compared with people living with HIV (median 1 day, IQR ± 2 days) (P ="
		.003). NHNT patients had a higher risk of 90-day mortality (hazard ratio 3.3; 95%
		"confidence interval, 1.9-5.8) as compared with people living with HIV."
		CONCLUSIONS: The majority of cryptococcosis occurs in NHNT patients. NHNT
		patients had more localized pulmonary cryptococcosis and significantly higher
		90-day mortality. Cryptococcosis in NHNT patients appears to be a distinct entity
		that needs further study and requires a higher level of clinical suspicion than
		it currently receives.

		hip arthroplasties underwent a two-stage procedure followed by treatment with
		vancomycin for a coagulase-negative staphylococcal prosthetic hip infection. This

AB	-	BACKGROUND Cryptococcus neoformans (C. neoformans) infection is one of the most
		common opportunistic infections in AIDS patients. C. neoformans usually infects
		the central nervous system (CNS) and/or lungs with typical clinical
		"manifestation. CASE REPORT Here, we report the case of a 52-year-old"
		"HIV-1-infected man with disseminated cryptococcosis, including subacute"
		"meningitis, pulmonary, and cutaneous cryptococcosis, but only skin lesion served"
		"as the chief complaint. Moreover, the results of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests"
		and lung computed tomography (CT) scan were atypical. CONCLUSIONS We present the
		"clinical characteristics of this case and discuss the diagnostic procedure, which"
		will likely help clinicians in making a timely definitive diagnosis of this
		disease.

AB	-	Cryptococcosis is a rare opportunistic infection increasingly associated with
		lymphoproliferative disorders. The clinical course and outcomes in these patients
		have not been extensively studied. We retrospectively reviewed charts of adult
		patients with lymphoproliferative disorders diagnosed with cryptococcal
		infections. A total of 34 patients were identified; 31 (91%) had a B-cell
		neoplasm and 3 (9%) had a T-cell neoplasm. The most frequent clinical syndrome
		"was disseminated cryptococcal infection (38%), followed by pneumonia (29%). 74%"
		received prior chemotherapy and the overall mortality in this group was nearly
		six-fold higher than chemotherapy naïve patients; 26% were chemotherapy naïve.
		"After a median follow-up of nine months from the date of infection, 24 patients"
		"had died (71%). The overall mortality at 30-days and one year was 18% and 46%,"
		respectively. The high mortality warrants future studies to identify those at
		highest risk. Clinicians should remain vigilant as early diagnosis and treatment
		are of utmost importance.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Ruxolitinib is a novel oral Janus kinase inhibitor that is used for
		treatment of myeloproliferative diseases. It exhibits potent anti-inflammatory
		"and immunosuppressive effects, and may increase the risk of opportunistic"
		"infections. Here, we report a rare case of Cryptococcus neoformans and"
		Mycobacterium haemophilum coinfection in a myelofibrosis patient who was
		receiving ruxolitinib. CASE PRESENTATION: A 70-year-old Thai man who was
		diagnosed with JAK2V617F-mutation-positive primary myelofibrosis had been treated
		with ruxolitinib for 4 years. He presented with cellulitis at his left leg for
		"1 week. Physical examination revealed fever, dyspnea, desaturation, and sign of"
		inflammation on the left leg and ulcers on the right foot. Blood cultures showed
		positive for C. neoformans. He was prescribed intravenous amphotericin B
		deoxycholate with a subsequent switch to liposomal amphotericin B due to the
		development of acute kidney injury. He developed new onset of fever after 1 month
		"of antifungal treatment, and the lesion on his left leg had worsened. Biopsy of"
		"that skin lesion was sent for mycobacterial culture, and the result showed M."
		"haemophilum. He was treated with levofloxacin, ethambutol, and rifampicin;"
		"however, the patient eventually developed septic shock and expired. CONCLUSIONS:"
		This is the first case of C. neoformans and M. haemophilum coinfection in a
		"patient receiving ruxolitinib treatment. Although uncommon, clinicians should be"
		aware of the potential for multiple opportunistic infections that may be caused
		by atypical pathogens in patients receiving ruxolitinib.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Opportunistic infections (OI) are common in patients with acquired
		immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Cryptococcus neoformans and Mycobacterium avium
		"complex (MAC) are frequently responsible of such infections. However, concurrent"
		infection with these two pathogens is uncommon and underreported in the
		literature. CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe the case of a 28-year-old Caucasian
		"Belgian patient with no travel history, who presented with low-grade fever,"
		headache and wasting syndrome. He was diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus
		"(HIV) infection at AIDS stage, with a HIV viral load of 506,000 viral copies/mL"
		and a CD4 + T-cells count of 10 cells/µL. Diagnosis of disseminated Cryptococcus
		neoformans infection was made by positive serum cryptococcal antigen and positive
		culture for Cryptococcus neoformans in blood and in cerebrospinal fluid.
		Diagnosis of disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex infection was made by
		positive culture on a biopsy of a mediastinal lymph node. With adequate
		"anti-retroviral therapy (ART) and treatment of these OIs, the patient recovered"
		well and had a good clinical evolution. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: To our
		"knowledge, this is the second case of coexistence of these two dangerous OIs"
		reported in the post ART era. Clinicians should be aware that such co-infections
		"still happen in high-income countries, in patients with severe immunodeficiency."
		Early detection and treatment of HIV is of paramount importance to prevent AIDS
		and its complications. We highlight the importance of thoroughly excluding all
		opportunistic infections in patients with newly diagnosed AIDS.Abbreviations:

AB	-	"Various infectious diseases can hyper-stimulate the immune system, causing"
		hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS). Little is known regarding the accuracy of
		diagnostic criteria and epidemiological triggering factors in the acquired
		immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) setting. We investigated the major infectious
		disease triggers of HPS in patients living with human immunodeficiency virus
		(HIV)/AIDS and determined the accuracy of bone marrow aspiration (BMA). The
		"inclusion criteria were (i) confirmed HIV diagnosis, (ii) bone marrow aspiration,"
		and (iii) a minimum of four HPS criteria. Patients were further classified into
		"those with four presumed HPS criteria, or ≥ 5 confirmed criteria. The disease"
		"triggers, accuracy of bone marrow aspiration, and prognosis markers were"
		"examined. Presumed HPS was observed in 15/36 patients (41%), and confirmed HPS in"
		58% (n = 21). The major etiological triggers were infection with Mycobacterium
		"(34%), Cytomegalovirus (14%), Cryptococcus neoformans (11%), and hematological or"
		tumoral disease (11%). BMA demonstrated 93% specificity on screening diagnosis
		"(odds ratio [OR] 12.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-115.1, P = 0.01)."
		Ferritin > 5000 ng/mL correlated with probability of death in univariate analysis
		"(OR 6.00, 95% CI 1.33-27.05, P = 0.02). Ferritin performance as test of death"
		"probability presented area under the curve as 0.74 (95% CI 0.56-0.91, P = 0.016)."
		"However, neither cluster of differentiation for lymphocyte count nor HIV viral"
		load correlated with patient deaths. Mycobacterium spp. and Cytomegalovirus were
		"the main factors triggering HPS, followed by Cryptococcus neoformans, and"
		hematological and tumoral diseases. High ferritin levels were associated with
		increased death probability. High specificity was noted with BMA.

AB	-	"Cryptococcus is a genus of fungi, of which two species, Cryptococcus neoformans"
		"and Cryptococcus gattii, cause nearly all human and animal cryptococcal"
		infections. Whereas C. neoformans primarily affects persons infected with human
		"immunodeficiency virus (HIV) worldwide, C. gattii primarily affects"
		"HIV-uninfected persons in tropical and subtropical regions. In December 2004, a"
		"case of human C. gattii infection was reported in Oregon, associated with an"
		"outbreak on Vancouver Island and in mainland British Columbia, Canada. A second"
		"C. gattii case was reported in Oregon in 2005, and 12 more cases were reported in"

		"States, CDC, state and local public health authorities, and the British Columbia"
		Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) formed the Cryptococcus gattii Public Health
		Working Group. States began collecting epidemiologic information on patients and
		"sending isolates to CDC. By July 2010, a total of 60 human cases had been"
		"reported to CDC from four states (California, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington) in"
		"the Pacific Northwest. Among 52 patients for whom travel history was known, 46"
		(88%) said they had not traveled to British Columbia or any other C.
		"gattii--endemic areas, suggesting they acquired the infection locally. Among 45"
		"patients with known outcomes, nine (20%) died because of C. gattii infection, and"
		six (13%) died with C. gattii infection. Physicians should consider C. gattii as
		a possible etiology of a cryptococcal infection among persons living in or

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcus neoformans is encapsulated yeast which causes
		life-threatening infections in up to 40% of AIDS patients in Africa. OBJECTIVE:
		To investigate the prevalence of cryptococcosis among HIV infected patients in
		"Yaounde. METHODS: In a hospital-based surveillance study of cryptococcosis, the"
		"colonization of Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF), urine and blood sample by C."
		neoformans was evaluated by direct microscopic examination and culture
		techniques. Data obtained were then analyzed based on the medical records of the
		"patients. RESULTS: Among the 105 patients sampled for the study, the CD4 counts"
		varied between 31 and 304 lymphocytes/mm(3). Direct specimens examination (n=
		294) in India ink preparations revealed polysaccharide capsule in 25 (8.5%) of
		"the samples. Upon culture, 29 (9.86 %) samples were positive of C. neoformans (23"
		from the CSFs and 6 from the urine). All the positive samples were obtained from
		patients who were not on Antiretroviral Therapy (ART). Meningo-encephalitis
		symptoms were observed in 13 patients with C. neoformans in CSFs. CONCLUSION:
		This study reveals that cryptococcosis is rife in AIDS patients in Yaounde.
		"Therefore, to minimize the death toll, we recommend that its routine check should"
		be integrated in the management of HIV/AIDS patients.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to describe cryptococcal meningitis (CM) cases and
		"the associated demographic, clinical, and microbiological data obtained from"
		cities in the State of Mato Grosso do Sul in the Midwestern region of Brazil.
		METHODS: The data from 129 patients with laboratory-confirmed CM admitted from
		1997 to 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. The molecular types of Cryptococcus
		neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii isolated from cerebrospinal fluid were
		analyzed to determine their geographic distribution. RESULTS: The patients had a
		mean age of 37 years and consisted mostly of men (76.7%). Most of the
		Cryptococcus isolates were obtained from patients infected with human
		immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and included 105 (87.5%) and 5 (55.6%) isolates of
		"C. neoformans and C. gattii complexes, respectively. A restriction fragment"
		length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of URA5 revealed that most of the isolates
		"were C. neoformans molecular type VNI (89.1%), whereas the molecular types VGII"
		"(7%) and VNII (3.9%) were observed less frequently. Notably, 65% of the cases"
		with a time from symptom onset to laboratory diagnosis of more than 60 days
		"resulted in fatalities, and sequelae were observed among the patients who"
		survived. CONCLUSIONS: The present study documents the occurrence of
		"neurocryptococcosis, which is mainly caused by C. neoformans VNI, in Mato Grosso"
		"do Sul, Brazil, with probable autochthonous cases in the Brazilian Pantanal, the"
		"world's largest tropical wetland, and a biome where cryptococcosis has not yet"
		been explored.

AB	-	There is limited research into Invasive fungal disease (IFD) in children with no
		underlying disease. We undertook a retrospective study of children with IFD who
		"did not suffer from another underlying disease, from June 2010 to March 2018 in"
		"Changsha, China. Nine children were identified. Eosinophil counts were elevated"
		in six cases. The level of procalcitonin (PCT) was elevated in six cases. Fungal
		"culture was positive in all patients, including eight cases of Cryptococcus"
		neoformans and one case of Candida parapsilosis. 8.33 days following antifungal
		"treatment, the body temperature of the eight patients affected by cryptococcal"
		disease had returned to normal. Our study indicates that the primary pathogen in
		IFD was Cryptococcus neoformans in children who had no other underlying disease.
		Eosinophils can be considered to be indicators of cryptococcal infection. IFD in
		children with no other underlying disease has a satisfactory prognosis.

TI	-	Analysis of asthma patients for cryptococcal seroreactivity in an urban German
		area.
PG	-	576-86
LID	-	10.1093/mmy/myv024 [doi]
AB	-	Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that causes lung
		inflammation and meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised patients but is also
		able to asymptomatically infect immunocompetent individuals. C. neoformans is
		"found ubiquitously especially in urban areas where it is spread by pigeons, and"
		"fungal exposure may predispose for asthma development already at an early age, as"
		"soon as confronted with pigeon droppings. In the study presented here, we"
		investigated the presence of specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) against C.
		neoformans in sera from patients suffering from asthma in comparison to a healthy
		"control cohort, accrued from the Leipzig Research Centre for Civilization"
		Diseases (LIFE). For serological analysis we developed a flow cytometry (FACS)
		based assay specific for an acapsular strain of C. neoformans to comprehensively
		"analyze different cryptococcal serotypes. Compared with the non-asthmatic cohort,"
		"asthmatics exhibited, as expected, an elevated level of total serum"
		"immunoglobulin E (IgE), whereas the IgG seroreactivity against C. neoformans was"
		"not significantly different among the two groups (P = .118). Nevertheless, there"
		was a trend toward increased Cryptococcus-specific IgG antibodies in the serum of
		"asthmatics. Additionally, in male asthmatics an increased IgG-mediated"
		seroreactivity compared to female asthmatics was found. This points to a higher
		prevalence of subclinical C. neoformans infection in male asthmatics and may
		support the hypothesis of C. neoformans as a risk factor for the development of
		asthma in urban areas.

AB	-	Disseminated cryptococcosis primarily affects immunosuppressed patients and has a
		poor outcome if diagnosis and treatment are delayed. Skin lesions are rarely
		manifest causing misdiagnosis. We present a case of cryptococcal cellulitis with
		severe pain in a kidney transplant recipient on long-term immunosuppressive
		"therapy. Multiple organs were involved, and there was cutaneous dissemination of"
		the lesions. Histopathology revealed abundant yeast-like cells with wide capsular
		"halos in subcutaneous tissue, suggesting Cryptococcus spp. infection. Laser"
		capture microdissection (LCM)-PCR on skin biopsies confirmed Cryptococcus
		neoformans var. grubii. A literature review of 17 cases of disseminated
		cryptococcosis with cutaneous cellulitis or panniculitis in HIV-negative
		"individuals found that over half the patients (52.9%, 9/17) had a history of"
		"glucocorticoid therapy, and that the most common site was the legs (76.5%,"
		"13/17). C. neoformans was the main pathogenic species, accounting for 88.2%"

		cryptococcosis and fungaemia: an unusual manifestation and a literature review.
PG	-	385

LID	-	385
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcus neoformans infection usually presents as chronic
		meningitis and is increasingly being recognized in immunocompromised patients.
		"Presentation with pleural effusion is rare in cryptococcal disease; in fact, only"
		4 cases of pleural effusion as the initial clinical presentation in
		cryptococcosis have been reported in English-language literature to date. We
		report the first case of pleural effusion as the initial clinical presentation in
		a renal transplant recipient who was initially misdiagnosed with tuberculous
		pleuritis but who then developed fungaemia and disseminated cryptococcosis. The
		examination of this rare manifestation and the accompanying literature review
		will contribute to increased recognition of the disease and a reduction in
		misdiagnoses. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a 63-year-old male renal transplant
		recipient on an immunosuppressive regimen who was admitted for left pleural
		effusion and fever. Cytological examinations and pleural fluid culture were
		"nonspecific and negative. Thoracoscopy only found chronic, nonspecific"
		inflammation with fibrosis in the pleura. After empirical anti-tuberculous
		"therapy, the patient developed an elevated temperature, a severe headache and"
		vomiting and fainted in the ward. Cryptococci were specifically found in the
		cerebrospinal fluid following lumbar puncture. Blood cultures were twice positive
		for C. neoformans one week later. He was transferred to the respiratory intensive
		care unit (RICU) immediately and was placed on non-invasive ventilation for
		respiratory failure for 2 days. He developed meningoencephalitis and fungaemia
		with C. neoformans during hospitalization. He was given amphotericin B liposome
		"combined with 5-flucytosine and voriconazole for first 11 days, then amphotericin"
		"B liposome combined with 5-flucytosine sustained to 8 weeks, after that changed"
		to fluconazole for maintenance. His condition improved after antifungal
		"treatment, non-invasive ventilation and other support. Further pathological"
		consultation and periodic acid-Schiff staining revealed Cryptococcus organisms in
		"pleural sections, providing reliable evidence for cryptococcal pleuritis."
		CONCLUSION: Pleural effusion is an unusual manifestation of cryptococcosis.
		Cryptococcal infection must be considered in the case of patients on
		"immunosuppressives, especially solid-organ transplant recipients, who present"
		"with pleural effusion, even if pleural fluid culture is negative. Close"
		"communication between the pathologist and the clinician, multiple special biopsy"
		section stains and careful review are important and may contribute to decreasing
		misdiagnosis.

AB	-	Cryptococcosis is a common opportunistic systemic mycosis caused by members of
		the encapsulated yeast genus Cryptococcus. The aetiological agents of the disease
		"are classified into two species, i.e., Cryptococcus neoformans (serotypes A, D,"
		and AD) affecting mainly immunocompromised patients and Cryptococcus gattii
		(serotypes B and C) usually found in immunocompetent individuals. Limited data
		"exist on Cryptococcus infections in French Guiana, the department with the"
		highest HIV incidence in the French territories. A retrospective study between
		"January 1998 and December 2008 was performed on all patients with cryptococcosis,"
		"admitted to hospitals in French Guiana. Epidemiological data, clinical forms and"
		"diagnosis methods were studied. Of the 43 patients with cryptococcosis, 29"
		"(67.4%) had HIV infections. Among the HIV-negative patients, two (4.7%) presented"
		identified risk factors for cryptococcosis. This study has shown a high frequency
		of patients with HTLV-1 positive serology (12.1%). C. neoformans var. grubii was
		recovered with a frequency of 77.3% and was mainly isolated from patients with
		"AIDS (13/17), whereas C. gattii (22.7%) was strictly isolated from HIV-negative"
		patients with no apparent risk factors. Despite a socio-economic environment
		"closer to western countries, the overall epidemiology of cryptococcosis in French"
		"Guiana is more similar to that found in South America, particularly with"
		"reference to the serotypes of the causative yeasts. Indeed, French Guiana"
		"presents an especially high proportion of cases caused by C. gattii, which may"
		"explain the significant incidence of this disease, particularly in HIV-negative"
		and immunocompetent patients.

PG	-	212-6
AB	-	PURPOSE: Although cryptococcosis is a significant opportunistic infection among
		"patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), there is conflicting"
		information on rates of cryptococcosis among HIV-positive and HIV-negative
		patients. Precise state-wide epidemiologic data for cryptococcosis are not
		available in Alabama. METHODS: We conducted an active laboratory and hospital
		"medical record-based surveillance for cryptococcosis in Alabama from October 1,"
		"1992 to September 30, 1994. A case of cryptococcosis was defined as a patient's"
		initial episode of cryptococcal disease and based on either a positive culture
		"for C. neoformans from any normally sterile site, a positive latex agglutination"
		"serologic test for cryptococcal antigen in CSF or serum, or histopathologic"
		"findings consistent with C. neoformans. RESULTS: Over the two year period, 153"
		"cases were identified. The diagnosis was based on positive culture (37%),"
		"positive antigen (24%), positive autopsy culture (2%), and histopathologic"
		"findings (4%). Further, 33% of the total cases were diagnosed from combined"
		"positive culture, antigen, or histopathology. Of the total 153 cases, 55% were in"
		HIV-positive patients and 44% were in HIV-negative individuals and one case (1%)
		had an unknown HIV status. The overall annual incidence rate of cryptococcosis
		"was 1.89 cases per 100,000 population. The incidence was 1638.7 per 100,000 in"
		"the HIV-positive population and 0.84 per 100,000 in the HIV-negative population."
		CONCLUSION: The first Alabama statewide active surveillance system for
		cryptococcosis confirms previous observations that rates of cryptococcosis are
		consistently higher in HIV-infected individuals than in their HIV-negative
		"counterparts. In Alabama, cryptococcosis occurs more commonly in urban residents"
		and in men. Cryptococcosis in HIV-positive persons is more likely to occur in the
		"20 to 44 year age group, whereas cryptococcosis in HIV-negative persons is more"
		likely to occur in those greater than 45 years old.

		Cryptococcus neoformans in Australia and New Zealand. Australasian Cryptococcal
		Study Group.
PG	-	499-508
AB	-	A prospective population-based study was conducted in Australia and New Zealand
		during 1994-1997 to elucidate the epidemiology of cryptococcosis due to
		Cryptococcus neoformans var. neoformans (CNVN) and C. neoformans var. gattii
		(CNVG) and to relate clinical manifestations to host immune status and
		cryptococcal variety. The mean annual incidence per 10(6) population was 6.6 in
		"Australia and 2.2 in New Zealand. Of 312 episodes, CNVN caused 265 (85%; 98% of"
		the episodes in immunocompromised hosts) and CNVG caused 47 (15%; 44% of the
		episodes in immunocompetent hosts). The incidence of AIDS-associated cases in
		Australia declined annually (P<.001). Aborigines in rural or semirural locations
		(P<.001) and immunocompetent males (P<.001) were at increased risk of CNVG
		infection. Cryptococcomas in lung or brain were more common in immunocompetent
		hosts (P< or =.03) in whom there was an association only between lung
		cryptococcomas and CNVG. An AIDS-associated genetic profile of CNVN serotype A
		was confirmed by random amplification of polymorphic DNA analysis. Resistance to
		antifungal drugs was uncommon. The epidemiology of CNVN infection has changed
		substantially. Clinical manifestations of disease are influenced more strongly by
		host immune status than by cryptococcal variety.

TI	-	Cryptococcal osteomyelitis: case report and review.
PG	-	33-5
AB	-	Cryptococcosis is a disseminated infection of man and animals caused by
		Cryptococcus neoformans. The most commonly involved sites are the lungs and the
		central nervous system. Isolated osteomyelitis due to C. neoformans is a rare
		complication of disseminated cryptococcosis. Herein we report a case of isolated
		osteomyelitis due to C. neoformans. A review of the English-language literature
		has been made and shows 40 cases (including this present report) with detailed
		data available since 1956. Most of the cases occurred between the ages of 21 and
		59. Seventy-five percent of cases involved only one single site of bone
		"infection, with vertebrae being the most common site. Sarcoidosis is the most"
		"common underlying disease, followed by tuberculosis and previous steroid therapy."
		Most of the cases (> 60%) reported were treated successfully with medical
		treatment alone or the combination of medical treatment and surgical curettage.

AB	-	Cryptococcosis is widely reported in North America and Australia but considered
		rare in the UK. Disease is mainly caused by Cryptococcus neoformans and
		Cryptococcus gattii and affects animals and humans. Cases of cryptococcosis have
		"been described in non-human primates, including a few in the Callitrichidae"
		family. Six captive callitrichids from five zoological facilities in the UK were
		diagnosed with cryptococcosis on post-mortem examination over a 13-year period.
		Histological examination revealed intralesional yeast bodies consistent with
		"Cryptococcus spp in lung, brain, lymph nodes, larynx, salivary gland and ears. C."
		neoformans was confirmed in two cases by culture and by culture and polymerase
		"chain reaction (28S rRNA gene), respectively. This case series is the first"
		report of Cryptococcus spp in captive callitrichids in the UK and reinforces the
		need to include this fungal disease in the differential diagnosis of sick
		callitrichids in zoo settings.

TI	-	Pulmonary cryptococcosis after recovery from COVID-19 in an immunocompetent
		patient: A rare case report.
PG	-	e30143
LID	-	10.1097/MD.0000000000030143 [doi]
LID	-	e30143
AB	-	RATIONALE: Cryptococcus neoformans (C neoformans) infection typically occurs in
		"immunocompromised patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or"
		"those taking immunosuppressive drugs, corticosteroids, or chemotherapy. Recently,"
		there have been an increasing number of reports of cryptococcosis as
		"opportunistic infections in COVID-19 patients, all of which have been related to"
		"immunocompromising conditions, underlying medical diseases, immune suppression"
		"drugs, or corticosteroids. Here, we report the first case of pulmonary"
		cryptococcosis in an immunocompetent patient with a history of COVID-19 who had
		no history of underlying diseases or immune modulation drugs. PATIENT CONCERNS: A
		previously healthy 46-year-old man presented with tiny lung nodules. He had quit
		smoking 6 years prior. He had no significant medical history except for COVID-19
		"3 months prior, and had not received corticosteroids or cytokine blockers when he"
		had COVID-19. He had been coughing since he recovered from COVID-19. DIAGNOSIS:
		Bronchoalveolar lavage cultures showed the growth of C neoformans. A CT-guided
		percutaneous needle biopsy of the lung lesion was performed. Histopathology of
		the biopsy specimen showed granulomas with encapsulated yeast. There was no
		growth of C neoformans in the CSF or blood. He was diagnosed with pulmonary
		cryptococcosis. INTERVENTION: Antifungal drug (fluconazole) was administered for
		6 months in the outside clinic. OUTCOMES: The lung lesions disappeared after 6
		months medication. LESSONS: This case may illustrate the risk of pulmonary
		cryptococcosis after SARS-CoV-2 infection in an immunocompetent patient.
		Opportunistic infections can occur even after recovery from COVID-19 for several
		"reasons. First, SARS-CoV-2 infection causes immune dysregulation including"
		"lymphocytopenia. Second, T lymphocytes play a principal role against"
		"Cryptococcus. Third, these changes in the immune system due to COVID-19 may last"
		"for several weeks. Thus, we suggest careful consideration of lung lesions in"
		patients with a history of COVID-19.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: A survey on cryptococcosis is being conducted regularly in Colombia
		since 1997. We present hereby the results corresponding to patients diagnosed
		from 2006 to 2010. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the data obtained during this period.
		MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of the corresponding surveys.
		RESULTS: A total of 526 surveys originating from 72% of the Colombian political
		divisions were received during the 5-year period. Most patients (76.6%) were
		males and 74.9% were 21-50 years old. The most prevalent risk factor was HIV
		infection (83.5%) with cryptococcosis defining AIDS in 23% of the cases. In the
		general population the estimated mean annual incidence rate for cryptococcosis
		was 2.4 x 106 inhabitants while in AIDS patients this rate rose to 3.3 x 103. In
		"474 surveys stating clinical features, most frequent complaints were headache"
		"84.5%, fever 63.4%, nausea and vomiting 57.5%, mental alterations 46.3%,"
		"meningeal signs 33.0%, cough 26.4% and visual alterations 24.5%."
		Neurocryptococcosis was recorded in 81.8% of the cases. Laboratory diagnosis was
		"based on direct examination, culture and latex in 29.3% cases. From 413"
		"Cryptococcus isolates analyzed, 95.6% were identified as C. neoformans var."
		"grubii, 1% C. neoformans var. neoformans, and 3.4% C. gattii. Treatment was"
		reported for 71.6% of the cases with amphotericin B alone or in combination with
		fluconazole prescribed in 28%. CONCLUSIONS: Surveys done through passive
		surveillance continue to be sentinel markers for HIV infection and represent a
		systematic approach to the study of opportunistic problems regularly afflicting
		AIDS patients since cryptococcosis requires no compulsory notification in
		Colombia.

AB	-	"In sub-Saharan Africa, cryptococcal meningitis (CM) continues to be a predominant"
		cause of AIDS-related mortality. Understanding virulence and improving clinical
		treatments remain important. To characterize the role of the fungal strain
		"genotype in clinical disease, we analyzed 140 Cryptococcus isolates from 111"
		Ugandans with AIDS and CM. Isolates consisted of 107 nonredundant Cryptococcus
		neoformans var. grubii strains and 8 C. neoformans var. grubii/neoformans hybrid
		"strains. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was used to characterize genotypes,"
		yielding 15 sequence types and 4 clonal clusters. The largest clonal cluster
		consisted of 74 isolates. The results of Burst and phylogenetic analysis
		suggested that the C. neoformans var. grubii strains could be separated into
		three nonredundant evolutionary groups (Burst group 1 to group 3). Patient
		mortality was differentially associated with the different evolutionary groups (P
		"= 0.04), with the highest mortality observed among Burst group 1, Burst group 2,"
		"and hybrid strains. Compared to Burst group 3 strains, Burst group 1 strains were"
		"associated with higher mortality (P = 0.02), exhibited increased capsule shedding"
		"(P = 0.02), and elicited a more pronounced Th(2) response during ex vivo cytokine"
		release assays with strain-specific capsule stimulation (P = 0.02). The results
		of these analyses suggest that cryptococcal strain variation can be an important
		determinant of human immune responses and mortality. IMPORTANCE: Cryptococcus
		neoformans is a common life-threatening human fungal pathogen that is responsible
		for an estimated 1 million cases of meningitis in HIV-infected patients annually.
		"Virulence factors that are important in human disease have been identified, yet"
		the impacts of the fungal strain genotype on virulence and outcomes of human
		infection remain poorly understood. Using an analysis of strain variation based
		on in vitro assays and clinical data from Ugandans living with AIDS and
		"cryptococcal infection, we report that strain genotype predicts the type of"
		immune response and mortality risk. These studies suggest that knowledge of the
		strain genotype during human infections could be used to predict disease outcomes
		and lead to improved treatment approaches aimed at targeting the specific
		combination of pathogen virulence and host response.

TI	-	Cryptococcosis in apparently immunocompetent patients.
PG	-	143-51
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Few reports have described the clinical and microbiological features
		of cryptococcosis in immunocompetent patients. AIM: To compare clinical
		presentations and outcomes of cryptococcosis in immunocompetent vs.
		immunocompromised patients. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. METHODS: All
		culture- or histology-confirmed cases (n = 46) of cryptococcosis in two acute
		"hospitals in Hong Kong (1995-2005) were included. Clinical presentations, rates"
		"of fungaemia, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) parameters and clinical outcomes were"
		"recorded. RESULTS: Twenty patients (43.5%) were apparently immunocompetent, 17"
		"(37.0%) had predisposing factors other than HIV infection, and 9 (19.6%) were"
		"HIV-positive. Thirty-one (67.4%) presented with meningitis, four (8.7%) with"
		"pulmonary cryptococcosis, and 11 (23.9%) with extraneural, extrapulmonary"
		cryptococcosis. Of the immunocompetent patients with retrievable isolates (n =
		"8), three (37.5%) were Cryptococcus gattii; all isolates (n = 6) from"
		immunocompromised patients were Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii.
		Immunocompetent patients more commonly presented with meningitis (80.0% vs.
		"47.1%, p = 0.03), and tended toward lower rates of fungaemia (10.0% vs. 35.3%, p"
		"= 0.06) and mortality (25.0% vs. 52.9%, p = 0.06). Death was associated with"
		fungaemia (p = 0.01) and underlying malignancy (p < 0.01). In cryptococcal
		"meningitis, immunocompetent patients had longer mean time from illness onset to"
		"presentation (34.4 vs. 12.6 days, p = 0.02), more intense inflammatory responses"
		"(CSF: white blood cells 108 vs. 35 x 10(9)/l, p = 0.03; protein 1.61 g/l vs. 0.79"
		"g/l, p = 0.07), less fungaemia (0% vs. 26.7%, p = 0.04) and more satisfactory"
		"clinical outcomes (81.3% vs. 46.7%, p = 0.04). DISCUSSION: A substantial"
		proportion of patients with cryptococcosis are apparently immunocompetent. C.
		neoformans var. grubii and C. gattii are the common causes. Immunocompetent
		"patients tend to present with localized, indolent neurological disease, with more"
		intense inflammatory responses but better clinical outcomes.

AB	-	"OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of"
		cryptococcosis in HIV-negative patients. METHODS: HIV-negative adult patients
		with positive culture for Cryptococcus neoformans who attended Ramathibodi
		Hospital between 1987 and 2003 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: During the
		"17 year review period, 40 HIV-negative patients with cryptococcosis were"
		"identified. Of these, 37 patients had medical records available for study. The"
		mean age was 49+/-18 (range 16-83) years and 73% were female. Twenty-four
		patients (65%) had associated underlying conditions. The most common associated
		"conditions included immunosuppressive drug treatment (41%), presence of systemic"
		"lupus erythematosus (16%), malignancies (16%), and diabetes mellitus (14%). C."
		"neoformans was mainly recovered from cerebrospinal fluid (32%), blood (28%), and"
		sputum/bronchoalveolar lavage/lung tissue (28%). Twenty-three patients (62%) had
		disseminated cryptococcosis. Six of 14 patients with cryptococcal meningitis were
		asymptomatic. About half of the patients were treated with amphotericin B and
		subsequent fluconazole. Five patients (14%) were initially misdiagnosed and
		treated for tuberculosis or bacterial infection. The overall mortality rate was
		27%. CONCLUSIONS: Cryptococcosis is not rare in HIV-negative patients. The
		mortality rate is high. Early recognition of cryptococcosis and use of
		appropriate antifungal therapy in these patients may improve clinical outcomes.

AB	-	A 68-year-old male plasterer with no history of trauma presented to our clinic in
		March 2012 with a 16×14-mm ulcer that developed following a crushed small papule
		"on the right anterior chest. In April 2012, the patient was referred to another"
		"hospital, where cutaneous cryptococcosis was diagnosed based on discharge culture"
		results. The patient was treated with oral itraconazole at a dose of 150 mg/day
		"for 10 weeks; however, the ulcer remained unchanged and he discontinued the"
		"treatment. In May 2014, when he revisited our clinic, the ulcer with crust had"
		grown to 29×13 mm. No regional lymph node swelling was noted. India ink staining
		"showed a yeast-like fungus with a thick, clear capsule. A cream-colored, viscous"
		yeast-like colony was observed on Sabouraud dextrose agar. Genetic testing
		identified the isolate as Cryptococcus neoformans serotype A. The patient was
		negative for serum cryptococcal antigen. Neither chest radiography nor computed
		tomography revealed any abnormalities. The patient had no underlying disease.
		"Oral fluconazole (400 mg/day for 12 weeks) was prescribed, resulting in scar"
		"formation. The patient has remained free of relapse for one year to date, since"
		the end of treatment. Localized cutaneous cryptococcosis is not a commonly used
		"disease name overseas. However, 36 cases of this disease have been reported in"
		Japan (since in 1968). We herein report a new case with localized cutaneous
		cryptococcosis and summarize previously reported cases in Japan.

		cryptococcosis. Four patients with C. neoformans infection had received a short
		course of steroids; this short-term use was associated with increased risk for
		cryptococcosis (rate ratio 19.1; 95% CI 2.1–170.0; p<0.01). Although long-term
		"use of steroids is a known risk factor for cryptococcosis, the relationship"

AB	-	Cryptococcosis is an invasive fungal infection caused primarily by Cryptococcus
		"neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii species, presenting predominantly as"
		meningoencephalitis. The aim of this study is to assess all cryptococcal
		"infections managed at our facility from 2001 to 2015 to determine incidence, risk"
		"factors, and comparison of outcomes prior to and following introduction of the"
		2010 Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) guidelines. Retrospective
		analysis of all patients diagnosed and treated for cryptococcal infection
		occurring between January 2001 and December 2015. Of 102 patients diagnosed with
		"cryptococcal infection, 97 were eligible for study inclusion. There appears to be"
		an overall increased incidence of cryptococcosis in both transplant and
		non-transplant cohorts with a peak in 2015 of 6 transplant and 13 non-transplant
		"cases. In the meningitis cohort, 38/52 (73%) of identified isolates were"
		"C. neoformans, and 14/52 (27%) were C. gattii. Notably, 14/14 (100%) of C. gattii"
		"isolates were associated with meningitis, as compared to only 38/64 (59%)"
		C. neoformans associated with meningitis (P: .003). It appears that patients
		"presenting with cough are less likely to have meningitis, 17/27 (63%), (P: .005)."
		When stratifying for culture positive meningitis lumbar puncture opening
		"pressure, the median in the culture positive cohort was 31.5 cm H(2) O compared"
		with 15.5 cm H(2) O (P: .036).Multiple admissions were required prior to
		diagnosis in the majority of cases with only 18/72 (25%) diagnosed on 1st
		presentation. Postguideline mortality has improved from 15% to 6.1% (P: .046).
		"Cryptococcal infection remains relatively uncommon, but there appears to be an"
		increasing trend in incidence. Overall mortality is relatively low and has
		improved since introduction of the 2010 IDSA guidelines.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Cryptococcus neoformans is known to be a cause of meningitis.
		"However, as cryptococcal endocarditis is rare, it is not well understood. Here,"
		we describe a case with Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator associated
		endocarditis and meningitis caused by Cryptococcus neoformans and we review the
		literature associated cryptococcal endocarditis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 72 years
		old Japanese male presented in emergency department with non-productive cough and
		respiratory discomfort. His past medical history was ischemic heart disease four
		years ago and ICD was implanted. Physical examination was unremarkable. Chest
		computer tomography revealed ground glass opacity in the right lung. He received
		a diagnosis of amiodarone-induced interstitial pneumonitis and high dose steroid
		pulse therapy. Septic shock and acute respiratory failure occurred after steroid
		therapy. Cryptococcus neoformans was identified by blood culture and cerebral
		spinal fluid. Intravenous liposomal Amphotericin B and oral flucytosine were
		initiated. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed vegetation on the lead of
		the ICD. Diagnosis of cryptococcal endocarditis was made. The patient died
		despite antifungal therapy was continued. DISCUSSION: We analyzed our case and 8
		cases of cryptococcal endocarditis in the literature for 40 years. Almost all of
		the patients had previous valve replacement surgery or immunocompromised state.
		Three cases had meningitis. Surgery performed in 3 cases. The overall mortality
		rate were 44.4%. CONCLUSIONS: Cryptococcal endocarditis is rare and carries a
		high mortality. Almost all of the patients had underlying diseases. Diagnosis
		"needs repeating blood culture and echocardiogram, sometimes. Cryptococcal"
		endocarditis needs lumber puncture for rule out meningitis.

AB	-	"Cryptococcosis is a mycosis caused by yeasts of genus Cryptococcus, mainly the"
		species C. neoformans and C. gattii that can affect humans and animals. These
		yeasts are widely distributed in the environment and are typically associated
		with avian droppings and decaying wood. Most infections are related to the
		"respiratory tract, but the central nervous system and cutaneous lesions are also"
		reported in the literature. The present report is a case of cryptococcosis in an
		18-month-old unspayed female English Bulldog with the main complaint of weight
		loss and diarrhea. The presence of two large masses observed in an ultrasound
		examination leads us to perform an exploratory laparotomy. Considering the size
		"of the lesion and the impossibility of owner to provide intensive care, the"
		consent for euthanasia was requested. The postmortem diagnosis of cryptococcosis
		"was revealed by cytological evaluation, and the involvement of C. gattii VGII was"
		confirmed by isolation and identification tests as well as by the detection of
		the URA5 gene restriction fragment length polymorphism PCR analysis. Reports in
		the literature of the involvement of Cryptococcus in gastrointestinal lesions are
		rare in both human and veterinary medicine. Data about different forms of
		cryptococcosis are important to provide more knowledge of uncommon clinical
		presentations of this yeast and therefore improve the diagnoses and decisions for
		the best therapy.

TI	-	Primary abdominal lymphonodular cryptococcosis in children: 2 case reports and a
		literature review.
PG	-	e11-5
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcus neoformans is an important opportunistic fungal pathogen
		that is acquired via the respiratory tract. It causes several clinical syndromes
		and most commonly presents as meningitis. The establishment of C neoformans
		"infections in immunocompetent individuals could be owing to increased virulence,"
		"dose of the organism, or genetically determined differences in the ability to"
		generate a protective immune response against the organism. OBJECTIVES: The
		purpose of this study is to report on 2 case studies and a literature review and
		to discuss the diagnosis and management of primary abdominal lymphonodular
		cryptococcosis. METHODS: We conducted 2 case studies and a literature review.
		RESULTS: Two cases of primary abdominal lymphonodular cryptococcosis in childhood
		were reported herein. The patients suffered from C neoformans without
		immunoglobulin or lymphocyte abnormalities. The cause of hospitalization of the 2
		cases was mainly the persisting fever with or without abdominal pain. Imaging
		findings indicated dramatic lymphadenopathy and light hepatosplenomegaly.
		Excision biopsy of the abnormal lymph node demonstrated reactive lymphoid
		hyperplasia and the presence of C neoformans. The results of nested polymerase
		chain reaction confirmed the diagnosis of C neoformans. CONCLUSION: This is the
		first report on C neoformans in the primary abdominal lymph node in children.
		This report suggests that C neoformans infection should be considered in the
		"differential diagnosis of fever and marked lymphadenopathy, and empirical"
		"administration of antifungal agent may be necessary. C neoformans antibody test,"
		"polymerase chain reaction assay, fine-needle aspiration biopsy, or surgical"
		excision biopsy is needed in early diagnosis.

TI	-	Clinical analysis of 16 cases of pulmonary cryptococcosis in patients with normal
		immune function.
PG	-	1117-1124
LID	-	10.21037/apm-20-897 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Pulmonary cryptococcosis (PC) is an invasive pulmonary fungal disease
		caused by Cryptococcus neoformans or Cryptococcus gattii. Cryptococcus is the
		opportunistic pathogen. Immune damage and chronic consumptive diseases are the
		high risk. The prevalence of cryptococcus infection is 5% to 10% in individuals
		"with weakened immune function. In recent years, with the application of"
		"glucocorticoids, antitumor drugs, and broad-spectrum antibiotics, the prevalence"
		of cryptococcal infection has increased yearly. Cryptococcus infection can also
		"occur in normal people without underlying diseases. One in every 100,000"
		"individuals with normal immune function is also affected, but these cases are"
		often misdiagnosed due to inadequate understanding and low awareness of PC in
		"individuals with normal immune function. In this study, we investigated the"
		clinical characteristics of PC in patients with normal immune function to improve
		the diagnosis and treatment of these cases. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed
		"the clinical, imaging and pathological data of 16 patients with pulmonary"
		cryptococcosis treated at Beijing Shijitan Hospital between 2010 and 2017.
		"RESULTS: Of the 16 patients with disseminated cryptococcosis, 6 were men, and 10"
		were women; their ages were 35 to 76 years (median: 53 years). Initial symptoms
		"were cough, sputum, chest pain, and fever. Thirteen patients had a history of"
		"chronic disease or tumor, including diabetes and bronchial asthma (n=2), simple"
		"hypertension (n=2), chronic bronchitis (n=2), diabetes and hypertension (n=5),"
		"previous tuberculosis (n=1), and previous lung cancer surgery (n=1). Chest"
		computed tomography (CT) in these 16 patients showed single or multiple nodules
		"and masses (n=14), lobar consolidation (n=1), and diffuse mixed lesions (n =1)."
		Lung biopsy showed granulomatous lesions in these 16 patients. Cryptococcus
		neoformans was identified with Grocott's methenamine silver and Grocott's
		methenamine silver (GMS) stains. Fourteen patients received fluconazole alone;
		two patients with intracranial infection received fluconazole combined with
		"amphotericin B. Five patients improved significantly, and nine patients improved"
		with significant lesion absorption. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical manifestations of
		PC are nonspecific in patients with normal immune function. Lung biopsy and
		cryptococcus antigen tests of cerebrospinal fluid are valuable diagnostic aids.
		Fluconazole is an effective treatment for disseminated cryptococcal infection.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Pulmonary cryptococcosis (PC) and mixed pulmonary infection are
		difficult to be diagnosed due to the non-specificity and their overlapping
		clinical manifestations. In terms of the clinical diagnosis of PC and mixed
		"pulmonary infection, conventional tests have limitations such as a long detection"
		"period, a limited range of pathogens, and low sensitivity. Metagenomics"
		next-generation sequencing (mNGS) is a nascent and powerful method that can
		"detect pathogens without culture, to diagnose known and unexplained infections in"
		reduced time. CASE PRESENTATION: A 43-year-old female was admitted to the
		"hospital after suffering from a cough for one month. At the time of admission, a"
		contrast-enhanced chest CT revealed multiple nodules and plaques in her right
		"lung, as well as the formation of cavities. The blood routine assays showed"
		"evidently increased white blood cell count (mainly neutrophils), CRP, and ESR,"
		which suggested she was in the infection phase. The serum CrAg-LFA test showed a
		"positive result. Initially, she was diagnosed with an unexplained pulmonary"
		infection. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples were collected for
		"microbial culture, immunological tests and the mNGS. Microbial culture and"
		"immunological tests were all negative, while mNGS detected Corynebacterium"
		"striatum, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Cryptococcus"
		neoformans. The diagnosis was revised to PC and bacterial pneumonia. Lung
		infection lesions were healed after she received targeted anti-infection therapy
		"with mezlocillin and fluconazole. In a follow-up after 2 months, the patient's"
		"symptoms vanished. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we demonstrated that mNGS was capable of"
		accurately distinguishing Cryptococcus from M. tuberculosis in pulmonary
		"infection, and notably mNGS was capable of swiftly and precisely detecting"
		"pathogens in mixed bacterial and fungal pulmonary infection. Furthermore, the"
		results of mNGS also have the potential to adjust anti-infective therapies.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to characterize patients with cryptococcemia and
		compare the clinical features of cryptococcemia and cryptococcal meningitis.
		"METHODS: This was a retrospective, case-control study. We retrospectively"
		identified blood cultures with Cryptococcus spp. growth. Controls were
		"hospitalized patients who suffered from cryptococcal meningitis, but did not"
		"experience cryptococcemia. Controls and cases were matched by admission date,"
		"age, sex, and body weight. Clinical information was analyzed by two independent"
		reviewers. RESULTS: Eight patients with cryptococcemia and eight patients with
		cryptococcal meningitis were included. They were all negative for human
		immunodeficiency virus. The most common underlying disease was primary nephrotic
		"syndrome. All patients presented with fever. The incidence of headache,"
		"nausea/vomiting, seizures, and cough/expectoration was significantly lower in"
		patients with cryptococcemia than in those with cryptococcal meningitis. All
		"clinical strains of Cryptococcus, except for one, were sensitive to fluconazole,"
		"voriconazole, itraconazole, amphotericin B, and flucytosine in vitro. The rate of"
		receiving an amphotericin B-containing regimen was significantly higher in
		patients with cryptococcal meningitis than in those with cryptococcemia.
		In-hospital mortality was significantly higher in cryptococcemia cases compared
		with cryptococcal meningitis cases. CONCLUSION: Cryptococcemia is an unusual
		infection characterized by a high mortality. Cryptococcemia requires early
		identification and prompt antifungal therapy.

TI	-	Cryptococcus laurentii fungemia in a premature neonate.
PG	-	1608-11
AB	-	Cryptococcus spp. other than Cryptococcus neoformans are generally considered
		nonpathogenic to humans. There are only 15 case reports of disease in humans
		caused by Cryptococcus laurentii infection. Underlying diseases and predisposing
		risk factors seem to play an important role in these cases. Our patient is the
		first case of an extremely low birth weight infant with C. laurentii fungemia
		"reported in the English literature. In our case, the MIC of amphotericin B for C."
		laurentii was 0.25 to 1 microg/ml and the patient had a good outcome following
		the administration of amphotericin B at 10 mg/kg combined with central venous
		catheter removal. There will undoubtedly be an increasing occurrence of unusual
		fungal infections accompanying further advances in medicine. A high degree of
		suspicion and improvements in the techniques for culture and identification will
		contribute to the earlier diagnosis and treatment of unusual fungal infections.

		literature review.
PG	-	74-7
LID	-	10.6002/ect.2012.0288 [doi]
AB	-	Cryptococcosis occurring within 30 days after transplant is unusual. We present a
		case of cryptococcosis diagnosed within 2 weeks of liver transplant and
		cryptococcal infection transmitted by liver transplant is considered as the
		cause. A 63-year-old woman with hepatitis C virus-related cirrhosis and
		hepatocellular carcinoma had an orthotopic liver transplant from a 45-year-old
		"donor. The immediate postoperative course was smooth, although she was confused"
		"with a fever, tachycardia, respiratory failure of 1 week's duration after the"
		orthotopic liver transplant. A liver biopsy was performed for hyperbilirubinemia
		2 weeks after the orthotopic liver transplant that showed a Cryptococcus-like
		"yeast. Her blood culture was reexamined, and it was confirmed as Cryptococcus"
		neoformans that had been misinterpreted as candida initially. At the time of the
		"re-examination, her sputum was clear. We checked her preoperative blood sample,"
		"retrospectively, for serum cryptococcal antigen with negative result. She was on"
		liposomal amphotericin treatment for 1 month when her blood culture became
		"negative. She was discharged home, with good liver function and a low antigen"
		titer for cryptococcal infection. Cryptococcal disease usually develops at a mean
		of 5.6 months after transplant. However an early occurrence is rare. Apart from
		"that, its variable clinical presentations make early detection difficult. It"
		might be an early reactivation or a donor-derived infection. The latter usually
		"occurs in unusual sites (eg, the transplanted organ as the sole site of"
		involvement). Our case presented as cryptococcoma and liver involvement was
		diagnosed by an unintentional liver biopsy.

AB	-	The species of the Cryptococcus neoformans complex show different epidemiological
		"patterns in the infection of immunosuppressed or immunocompetent individuals, and"
		a common tropism peculiarity for the central nervous system. Primary cutaneous
		"cryptococcosis is a rare clinical entity, with manifestations that are initially"
		"restricted to the skin through fungal inoculation, and the absence of systemic"
		disease. The authors report in the present study the case of a 61-year-old
		"immunocompetent man, with a rapidly evolving mucoid tumor on abrasions in contact"
		with bird droppings on the forearm. The early identification of the polymorphic
		skin manifestations and treatment are crucial for the favorable prognosis of the
		"infection, which can be life-threatening."

		"pleural effusion. Computed tomography scan revealed a large, lobulated mass"
		effect in the ventral right hemithorax with concurrent sternal lymphadenopathy. A
		"cytologic sample of the mass contained pyogranulomatous inflammation, necrotic"
		"material, and abundant yeast structures that lacked a distinct capsule and"
		demonstrated rare pseudohyphal forms. Fungal culture and biochemical testing
		"identified the yeast as Cryptococcus albidus, with susceptibility to all"

		with a strain of Cryptococcus neoformans and only 92% homology with C. albidus.
		The patient responded well to fluconazole therapy unlike the only known previous
		report of C. albidus in a cat. The unusual cytologic morphology in this case
		underscores the need for ancillary testing apart from microscopy for fungal
		identification. Though C. albidus should be considered as a potential feline
		"pathogen, confirmation with PCR is recommended when such rare non-neoformans"

		"female Boxer dog from Uberlândia, Minas Gerais, Southeastern Brazil. Clinically,"

AB	-	"Cryptococcosis is a classical systemic opportunistic mycosis, primarily occurring"
		"among patients with significant immunologic impairment. However, this disease"
		"could also affect patients without any recognized immunologic defects, that is,"
		phenotypically normal patients. The medical records of 29 non-HIV/nontransplant
		patients with cryptococcal disease during the period 2007-2014 were

		"nervous system (n = 25, 86.2%), followed by the pulmonary system (n = 11, 37.9%)"
		"and blood (n = 2, 6.8%). Thoracic- and brain-computed tomography demonstrated"

		= 6) of the patients experienced a significant underlying condition. More than
		one therapeutic regimen was used in 77.8% (n = 21) of the patients. The isolates
		"were identified as being Cryptococcus neoformans species complex (n = 4, 36.4%)"
		"and Cryptococcus gattii species complex (n = 7, 63.6%). The overall mortality was"
		"20.7% (n = 6). Herein, we presented the first case series of cryptococcosis in"
		"this specific population in São Paulo City, Brazil. The incidence of"
		"cryptococcosis in our hospital has not increased in recent years, and 77.8% (n ="

PG	-	1069-73
AB	-	Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungus with a predilection for
		infecting the meninges. Ocular sequelae of cryptococcal infections of the CNS
		usually include cranial nerve palsies or papilledema secondary to increased
		"intracranial pressure. Intraocular cryptococcosis occurs less frequently, and"
		"over the last 23 years, only 27 cases have been reported, including the case"
		presented here. Intraocular infection was most often manifested by chorioretinal
		lesions and vitritis. Underlying diseases were detected in only 11 (41%) of the
		"27 patients. Of note, ocular lesions preceded symptomatic meningitis in six (27%)"
		"of 22 patients with CNS involvement. For seven patients, the diagnosis was made"
		by histologic examination of specimens of aqueous or vitreous humor; for another
		"eight patients, the diagnosis was made after enucleation or at autopsy. Ocular"
		involvement frequently led to severe visual loss; return of vision to normal was
		unusual. Early recognition and treatment may improve outcome for these patients.

LID	-	10.7754/Clin.Lab.2021.210412 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) is a life-threatening infectious disease
		and causes high morbidity and mortality. No information about Cryptococcal
		meningitis in populations with Sjogren's syndrome (SS) was available. METHODS:
		This report details the first case of Cryptococcal meningitis in a 75-year-old
		female patient with 10-years history of Sjogren's syndrome. RESULTS: Detailed
		"findings of C. neoformans from CSF examinations, including routine examination,"
		"India ink stain, immunological test, culturing, mass spectrum analysis and"
		"molecular biology identification were all delineated in this case, which"
		facilitated understanding of detection methods in C. neoformans infection. The
		etiological exploration was initiated from a positive finding of yeast cells in
		routine examination of unstained CSF in the present case. Morphology description
		of C. neoformans in unstained CSF was depicted for the first time. CONCLUSIONS:
		Clinicians should consider the possible complication of Cryptococcal meningitis
		when patients with Sjogren's syndrome show neurological symptoms. Importance of
		"screening yeast cells from unstained CSF for routine examination was emphasized,"
		which may reduce errors in cell counting and trigger further etiological
		ex-ploration of C. neoformans infection in laboratory and clinical practice.

		"hemangiosarcoma. At postmortem, microscopic foci of persistent cryptococcosis"
		were detected. The diagnosis raised concerns that the owners and other ferrets
		"were exposed to a common environmental source of infection, thus prompting an"
		"investigation. Soil samples, swabs of a hollow eucalypt log (used for behavioral"
		"enrichment), and nasal swabs from 8 asymptomatic ferrets were collected. Nasal"
		exudate (obtained at diagnosis) and tissues (collected at postmortem) were
		available from the clinical case. Bird seed agar culture resulted in a heavy
		"growth of Cryptococcus spp. from one environmental site (the log), one nasal"
		"swab, and nasal exudate and tissues from the clinical case. All other samples"
		were culture-negative. Sub-cultured isolates from the log were a mixture of C.
		gattii molecular type VGI and C. neoformans molecular type VNI. Ferret isolates
		were a similar mixture of C. gattii VGI (all disease isolates) and C. neoformans
		VNI (nasal-colonizing isolate). Multilocus sequence typing further revealed the
		"ferret isolates as identical to environmental isolates collected from the log,"
		confirming the log as the source of clinical disease and nasal colonization. The
		log was removed to prevent further exposure to a high environmental load of
		Cryptococcus spp.

AB	-	BACKGROUND Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) is one of the most common opportunistic
		neuroinfections in patients with HIV. Most studies have focused on non-HIV CM and
		there are only a few studies on HIV CM in China. The purpose of the present study
		was to evaluate the characteristics and risk factors for CM recurrence in
		patients infected with HIV in the Chongqing Public Health Treatment Center in
		"China. MATERIAL AND METHODS From January 2014 to December 2017, all patients with"
		CM aged 18 years or older were enrolled and a case-control study was performed to
		determine the risk factors associated with recurrence of CM. Antimicrobial
		susceptibility was determined with a fungal drug sensitivity kit and the sequence
		types (STs) were analyzed with multilocus sequence typing. RESULTS The incidence
		of CM in the 5185 HIV-infected patients was 3.5% (179). Follow-up data were
		available for 82 of the patients for whom complete medical records were available
		and they were included in the present study. There were 7 STs among 82
		Cryptococcus neoformans isolates; ST5 and ST31 were the most prevalent genotypes.
		Testing showed that C. neoformans had high sensitivity to 5 antifungal drugs and
		"no differences in resistance were observed, even when different STs were tested."
		"Risk factors for recurrence were analyzed in 69 patients, excluding those who"
		died. The results of multivariate analysis showed that only hospital stay was
		associated with recurrence of CM. CONCLUSIONS Our results indicated that
		combining education about medication with clinical treatment could help prevent
		recurrence of CM.

PG	-	942282

LID	-	942282
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Pulmonary cryptococcosis (PC) is a serious opportunistic fungal
		infection that usually occurs in immunocompromised patients. This disease is
		often difficult to diagnose in time due to its clinical manifestations and
		"radiological feature similar to other pulmonary infections, as well as the low"
		sensitivity of conventional diagnostic methods. Cryptococcosis in
		immune-competent patients is rare. CASE PRESENTATION: Here we report a case of PC
		in an immune-competent patient. Tuberculosis was suspected according to
		radiological features due to the positive T-lymphocyte spot test and pure protein
		"derivative skin test. To further detect the pathogen, bronchoalveolar lavage"
		fluid (BALF) was collected for metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS).
		"Cryptococcus neoformans (one specific read) was identified by mNGS, indicating"
		the PC of this patient. The following BALF culture and cryptococcal antigen
		"lateral flow assay (CrAg-LFA) test also showed Cryptococcus infection, confirming"
		the mNGS detection. Voriconazole (0.4 g daily) was given orally according to the
		"subsequent susceptibility results. After seven months of treatment, the patient's"
		condition improved. CONCLUSION: Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) is
		a better diagnostic tool to help clinicians distinguish pulmonary cryptococcosis
		from other atypical pulmonary infections.

LID	-	10.1093/mmy/myz045 [doi]
AB	-	The benefits of screening for cryptococcal antigenemia and of preemptive
		antifungal treatment in HIV-infected patients have been proven. Liver cirrhosis
		is an important risk factor for cryptococcal infections. Cryptococcal infections
		"are rapidly fatal in patients with liver cirrhosis, especially when diagnosis is"
		"delayed. However, screening for cryptococcal antigenemia has not been"
		investigated in these patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the
		prevalence of cryptococcal antigenemia in hospitalized patients with liver
		cirrhosis. This prospective study was conducted at Seoul National University
		Hospital from July 2017 to January 2018. We included patients with liver
		cirrhosis who were admitted regardless of symptoms or signs suggesting
		cryptococcal infections. The severity of cirrhosis was evaluated from Child-Pugh
		and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) scores. Serum cryptococcal
		antigenemia was determined using a latex agglutination test. A total of 294
		"patients were included in the analysis, comprising 104 (35.4%), 100 (34.0%), and"
		"90 (30.6%) patients in Child-Pugh classes A, B, and C, respectively. There were"
		"21 cases of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and 14 of hepatic encephalopathy,"
		"but none of cryptococcal peritonitis or meningitis. In addition, none of the"
		patient specimens tested positive in the serum cryptococcal latex agglutination
		"test (one-sided 97.5% confidence interval, 0% ∼ 1.2%). Liver cirrhosis is a major"
		"risk factor for cryptococcal infections, but the prevalence of serum cryptococcal"
		"antigen positivity in patients with liver cirrhosis is very low. Therefore,"
		screening for cryptococcal antigenemia and preemptive antifungal treatment in
		cirrhotic patients might not be beneficial.

TI	-	Determinants of disease presentation and outcome during cryptococcosis: the
		CryptoA/D study.
PG	-	e21
LID	-	e21
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcosis is a life-threatening opportunistic fungal infection
		in both HIV-positive and -negative patients. Information on clinical presentation
		"and therapeutic guidelines, derived mostly from clinical trials performed before"
		introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy in patients with
		"cryptococcal meningoencephalitis, is missing data on extrameningeal involvement"
		and infections by serotype D as opposed to serotype A of Cryptococcus neoformans.
		METHODS AND FINDINGS: The prospective multicenter study CryptoA/D was designed in
		France (1997-2001) to analyse the factors influencing clinical presentation and
		outcome without the bias of inclusion into therapeutic trials. Of the 230
		"patients enrolled, 177 (77%) were HIV-positive, 50 (22%) were female, and 161"
		"(72.5%) were infected with serotype A. Based on culture results at baseline,"
		"cryptococcosis was more severe in men, in HIV-positive patients, and in patients"
		infected with serotype A. Factors independently associated with mycological
		"failure at week 2 independent of HIV status were initial dissemination (OR, 2.4"
		"[95% confidence interval (CI), 1.2-4.9]), high (>1:512) serum antigen titre (OR,"
		"2.6 [1.3-5.4]), and lack of flucytosine during induction therapy (OR, 3.8"
		[1.9-7.8]). The three-month survival was shorter in patients with abnormal
		"neurology or brain imaging at baseline, and in those with haematological"
		"malignancy. CONCLUSIONS: Thus sex, HIV status, and infecting serotype are major"
		determinants of presentation and outcome during cryptococcosis. We propose a

LID	-	10.1159/000496979 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Tracheobronchial fungal infections (TBFI) cause life-threatening
		complications in immunocompromised hosts but are rarely reported. Misdiagnosis
		and delayed antifungal treatment are associated with the high mortality rate of
		patients with TBFI. OBJECTIVES: This study analyzed the bronchoscopic features of
		"TBFI and their roles in the early diagnosis of TBFI. METHODS: The demographic,"
		"clinical, radiologic, and bronchoscopic data of 53 patients diagnosed with TBFI"
		in our department during a 15-year period were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS:
		"Most of the TBFI patients were male, and mass was the most common radiologic"
		abnormality. Obvious predilection in primary bronchus distributions was observed.
		"41.9% of the 43 Aspergillus tracheobronchitis (AT) patients, 70% of the 10"
		"tracheobronchial mucormycosis (TM) patients, and 100% of the 3 endobronchial"
		cryptococcosis patients had been misdiagnosed as having cancer on bronchoscopy
		because of the presence of tumor-like lesions. The most common features of AT
		"were bronchial occlusion with a mass or mucosal necrosis, bronchial stenosis with"
		"mucosal hyperplasia, or uneven mucosa. The main descriptions of TM were bronchial"
		"stenosis or obstruction due to mucosal necrosis, uneven mucosa, or a mass. The"
		endoscopic characteristics of endobronchial cryptococcosis included occlusion due
		"to uneven mucosa or mass, or external compressive stricture. CONCLUSION:"
		Immunocompromised patients and immunocompetent patients with underlying disease
		displaying tumor-like lesions on bronchoscopy should be differentially diagnosed
		with cancer. Bronchial biopsy is indispensable for the early diagnosis of TBFI.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Spinal cord involvement by Cryptococcus neoformans infection is
		"extremely rare, with most cases occurring in immunosuppressed patients. CASE"
		PRESENTATION: A young male patient presented with a 10-day history of progressive
		"lower limb weakness culminating in paralysis, urinary incontinence, and"
		constipation. The patient had no known immunodeficiency induced by the human
		"immunodeficiency virus (HIV), malignancy, or organ transplantation. Laboratory"
		"investigations showed elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels; however, all"
		other immune indicators were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed
		oval-shaped extradural masses (1.3-3.5 cm) with isointense T1-weighted signal and
		heterogeneous T2-weighted signal in the spinal canal at the level of the 9th
		thoracic vertebra. The lesions spread along the intervertebral foramen and
		"involved both sides, showing significant enhancement in contrast-enhanced MRI."
		"The patient was managed surgically, in combination with antifungal and"
		anti-tuberculous therapy and could walk independently 3 months after the
		treatment. Cryptococcosis was confirmed by histopathology and fungal culture.
		CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that for lesions that affect spinal stability or
		"cause severe nerve damage, surgical treatment should be considered along with"
		medical management.

LID	-	10.1016/j.riam.2019.04.005 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcosis is a generally systemic and potentially lethal fungal
		"infection. Although HIV infection is a predisposing condition, especially if the"
		"CD(4+) lymphocyte count is less than 100cells/mm(3), other forms of"
		"immunosuppression may be associated with this opportunistic fungal condition,"
		such as prolonged steroid therapy or solid organ transplantation. Pulmonary
		presentation must be included in the differential diagnosis of pneumonia or
		pulmonary neoplasia in the immunosuppressed patient. CASE REPORT: We report a
		case of pulmonary cryptococcosis in a non-diagnosed HIV patient. In a 44 year-old
		male suffering from dyspnea and chest pain the image of a pulmonary nodule was
		"observed in a radiological finding. In the histopathological study, intracellular"
		"structures suggestive of fungal conidia, and morphologically compatible with"
		"Cryptococcus, were observed. HIV serology and cryptococcal antigen detection in"
		"serum were requested, given the possibility of cryptococcosis. Cryptococcus"
		neoformans var. grubii was isolated from the culture of the pulmonary biopsy. The
		patient was finally diagnosed with pulmonary cryptococcosis and HIV-1 infection.
		With a proper antifungal treatment the patient evolved satisfactorily.
		CONCLUSIONS: The best strategy to avoid opportunistic infections such as
		cryptococcosis in HIV-infected patients consists of an early diagnosis and a
		"highly active antiretroviral treatment. In our case, the diagnosis of a pulmonary"
		infection by C. neoformans var. grubii allowed a late diagnosis of HIV-1
		infection.

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis is commonly caused by
		"Cryptococcus neoformans, whilst infections with Cryptococcus gattii sensu lato"
		"are historically rare. Despite available studies, little is known about the"
		occurrence of C. gattii sensu lato infections among HIV-infected individuals in
		"Zimbabwe. METHODS: In a prospective cohort, we investigated the prevalence of C."
		"gattii sensu lato meningitis among HIV-infected patients (n = 74) in Harare,"
		"Zimbabwe. RESULTS: Of the 66/74 isolates confirmed by molecular characterization,"
		16.7% (11/66) were found to be C. gattii sensu lato and 83.3% (55/66) C.
		neoformans sensu stricto. From one patient two phenotypically different C. gattii
		sensu lato colonies were cultured. The majority (n = 9/12; 75%) of the C. gattii
		"sensu lato isolates were Cryptococcus tetragattii (AFLP7/VGIV), which has been an"
		infrequently reported pathogen. In-hospital mortality associated with C. gattii
		sensu lato was 36.4%. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests that C. tetragattii
		(AFLP7/VGIV) is a more common cause of disease than C. gattii sensu stricto
		(genotype AFLP4/VGI) among patients with HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis
		"in Harare, Zimbabwe and possibly underreported in sub-Saharan Africa."

TI	-	Vertebral cryptococcosis simulating tuberculosis.
PG	-	556-9
AB	-	Infection with the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans is seen predominantly in two
		forms: (a) pulmonary and (b) cerebromeningeal. Skeletal cryptococcosis is
		uncommon. There have been only occasional case reports of thoracic vertebral
		cryptococcosis presenting as cord compression. A young female had cervical
		lymphadenopathy diagnosed as tuberculosis by fine needle aspiration cytology
		(FNAC) and was on antitubercular therapy (ATT) for 5 months. She developed
		rapidly progressive paraparesis and imaging demonstrated a destructive vertebral
		body lesion involving T2-3 with a paraspinal abscess producing cord compression.
		A costotransversectomy with excision of the diseased bone and bone grafting was
		done. Histopathological examination revealed cryptococcosis. The patient was put
		"on antifungal medication, but expired 2 weeks after surgery. Radiological,"
		magnetic resonance imaging and surgical finding of vertebral cryptococcosis can
		mimic tuberculosis. The definite diagnosis of cryptococcosis depends upon
		microscopic identification of the organism. A high index of suspicion leading to
		early surgical confirmation and institution of anti fungal therapy is necessary
		to reduce the mortality and morbidity.

AB	-	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify markers of disseminated
		infection in patients presenting with pulmonary cryptococcosis. METHODS: Patients
		diagnosed with pulmonary cryptococcosis at a tertiary hospital between April 1998
		"and April 2005 were included and their clinical, radiological and pathological"
		data analysed retrospectively. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients (14 male) were
		"recruited into the study. Disseminated infection was seen in nine patients (29%),"
		with the isolation of Cryptococcus neoformans from the blood of five patients and
		the cerebrospinal fluid of seven (three patients had both positive blood and
		cerebrospinal fluid findings). Patients with disseminated infection had a
		significantly higher incidence of impaired cellular immunity (immunosuppressant
		"use, AIDS and haematological malignancy) (P = 0.015), fever (P < 0.001),"
		"interstitial abnormalities on CXR (P < 0.001), pleural effusion (P = 0.017) and"
		death (P = 0.04) when compared with patients with localized infection. Serum
		cryptococcal antigen (sCRAG) was positive in 17 of the 19 patients tested at the
		time of diagnosis. Significantly higher sCRAG titres were noted in patients who
		"had fever (P = 0.001), interstitial abnormalities on CXR (P = 0.004), pleural"
		"effusion (P = 0.018), disseminated disease (P = 0.003) and in those who died (P ="
		"0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In pulmonary cryptococcosis patients, the presence of fever,"
		interstitial abnormalities on CXR or pleural effusion should lead clinicians to
		suspect disseminated infection. High titres of sCRAG may indicate more extensive
		extra-pulmonary involvement and a worse prognosis.

LID	-	620
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal (GI) cryptococcosis is rarely reported. Most cases
		"were diagnosed during evaluation of comorbid conditions, incidental findings, or"
		"postmortem. Here, we present a case of Crohn's disease with gastrointestinal"
		cryptococcosis that resembled exacerbation of Crohn's disease. CASE PRESENTATION:
		A 64-year-old woman with Crohn's disease (CD) was referred to Siriraj Hospital
		due to worsening of abdominal pain and watery diarrhea for 2 weeks. The dose of
		immunosuppressive agents was increased for presumed exacerbation of CD.
		Pathologic examination of tissue obtained from polypoid mass at ileocecal valve
		and multiple clean-based ulcers at cecum revealed active ileitis and colitis with
		"multiple round shape organisms with capsule, which was compatible with"
		Cryptococcus species. Disseminated cryptococcosis was diagnosed due to
		gastrointestinal involvement and presumed pulmonary involvement regarding the
		presence of an oval-shaped cavitary lesion on chest X-ray and computed tomography
		of the lung. Patient was successfully treated with amphotericin B followed by
		fluconazole with satisfactory result. CONCLUSION: Early diagnosis of
		gastrointestinal cryptococcosis in Crohn's disease is difficult due to the lack
		of specific symptoms and sign or mimicking an exacerbation of Crohn's disease.
		Seeking for other site of involvement in disseminated cryptococcosis including
		lung or central nervous system as well as detection of serum cryptococcal antigen
		would be helpful for early diagnosis and management.

		infection.
PG	-	309-13
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcus neoformans var. neoformans is an opportunistic yeast
		that typically infects immunocompromised patients. METHODS: A case report and
		review of the pertinent English-language literature are presented. RESULTS:
		Necrotizing vasculitis associated with cryptococcal invasion was identified in
		"1986. Until now, only 24 cases of cryptococcal cellulitis have been reported,"
		including one case of cryptococcal necrotizing fasciitis and one case of
		necrotizing vasculitis. We report an unusual case of occult disseminated
		"cryptococcosis presenting as necrotizing cellulitis, fasciitis, and myositis."
		CONCLUSIONS: Cryptococcal soft tissue infection serves as a marker of
		disseminated cryptococcosis in immunocompromised hosts. Owing to its rarity as a
		"cause of soft tissue infections, diagnosis is difficult and mortality is high."

AB	-	The majority of patients with symptomatic cryptococcosis have an underlying
		immunocompromising condition. In the absence of coexisting immunocompromising
		"condition, Cryptococcus neoformans is rarely considered in the differential"
		diagnosis of obstructive jaundice that occurs in children with hilar masslike
		"lesion. Here, we report a 5-year-old boy without immunoglobulin or lymphocyte"
		abnormalities who developed a hepatobiliary infection with C. neoformans.
		Ultrasonography and computed tomography showed dilatation of the bilateral
		intrahepatic bile ducts and a low-attenuated mass in the hepatic hilum.
		Microscopic examination of tissue samples revealed abundant numbers of
		encapsulated yeast cell suggestive of C. neoformans. After 4 months of antifungal
		"therapy (liposomal amphotericin B for 2 weeks and oral fluconazole for 3 months),"
		the disease was effectively controlled. Unnecessary operation could be avoided by
		"an early and accurate diagnosis. By sharing our experience, we suggest"
		hepatobiliary surgeons and gastroenterologists should have a suspicion of this
		unusual entity to make earlier diagnosis and treatment.

AB	-	Cryptococcus neoformans causes life-threatening meningoencephalitis. Human
		immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is the most significant predisposing
		"condition, but persons with other immunodeficiency states as well as"
		phenotypically normal persons develop cryptococcosis. We retrospectively reviewed
		medical records of all patients with a diagnosis of cryptococcosis between 2005

		"newly diagnosed with AIDS, and 4% had unmasking cryptococcus-associated immune"
		reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. The majority were Hispanic or black in

		"FROM ENVIRONMENTAL SOURCES IN NAIROBI, KENYA."
PG	-	281-5
AB	-	Objective: To establish the environmental reservoirs of Cryptococcus neoformans
		"and Cryptococcus gattii in Nairobi, Kenya. Design: Prospective study. SETTING:"
		"Kenya Medical Research Institute, Mycology laboratory, Nairobi, Kenya. SUBJECTS:"
		A total of 400 environmental samples from different sites were analysed
		"including; avian droppings, tree swabs, soil contaminated with avian droppings"
		and swabs from garbage damping sites. Samples were subjected to various
		"phenotypic tests including microscopic morphology, physiological and biochemical"
		"tests, pigmentation on bird seed agar and reaction on"
		Canavanine-Glycine-Bromothymol Blue agar. RESULTS: Cryptococcus neoformans was
		isolated from 23/200 (11.5%) dropping samples and Cryptococcus gattii in 5/200
		(2.5%) of the same samples. Cryptococcus gattii was isolated from 7/60 (11.7%)
		tree swabs and Cryptococcus neoformans in 5/60 (8.5%) of the same samples. From
		"other sites there was no Cryptococcus gattii recovered with (5/50: 10%), (6/60:"
		"10%), (2/30: 6.7%) Cryptococcus neoformans recovered from chicken cage, garbage"
		damping site and soil respectively. CONCLUSION: Findings clearly showed a high
		presence of Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii from several
		"environmental sites in Nairobi, Kenya. This could probably explain the high"
		incidence of cryptococcal meningitis in HIV/AIDS patients in Kenya.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Pulmonary cryptococcosis (PC) was once thought to occur only in
		"patients with immune deficiencies, such as tested positive for the Human"
		"Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). However, in recent years, it has been discovered"
		that more than half of the patients with PC in our nation are individuals with
		"normal immune function. As more and more PC cases are recorded, our diagnosis and"
		"treatment approaches, as well as our understanding of PC, are gradually"
		"improving. In reality, most PC patients still have a high incidence of"
		misdiagnosis on their initial visit. It is primarily linked to the diverse
		"clinical manifestations, atypical imaging findings, and inaccurate diagnostic"
		approaches. METHODS: The research was conducted from 2019 to 2020. We performed
		traditional microbiological testing and mNGS on sample from patients with fever
		"of Pulmonary nodules or lung infections. Furthermore, we collected patients'"
		"baseline information, clinical features, laboratory and imaging examination"
		"results, diagnosis, treatment and outcome. In the end, we confirmed three cases"
		of PC using biopsy and mNGS. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrates that mNGS can be
		utilized as an auxiliary method for PC diagnosis. Early mNGS aids in the
		"identification of pathogens, enabling early diagnosis and treatment, as well as a"
		reduction in the rate of misdiagnosis and illness progression.

AB	-	"Cryptococcemia is a life-threatening fungal infection. Sometimes, it is hard to"

		specifically were limited. We performed this retrospective analysis in a Chinese
		"hospital during 2002-2015, including 85 cryptococcemia cases and 52 Cryptococcus"
		"spp. isolates. The species, mating type, antifungal susceptibility and multilocus"
		sequence typing of Cryptococcus spp. were determined. C. neoformans var. grubii
		"MATα of sequence type (ST) 5 is the representative strain of cryptococcemia,"
		"accounting for 51 isolates. The MIC50/90 values were 0.5/0.5, 1.0/1.0, 2.0/4.0,"
		"≤0.06/0.25, and ≤0.06/≤0.06 μg/ml for amphotericin B, flucytosine, fluconazole,"
		"itraconazole, and voriconazole, respectively. Cryptococcemia was the first"
		"diagnostic proof of cryptococcosis in 37 patients (43.5%, 37/85). Compared with"
		the patients initially diagnosed of cryptococcosis in other sites (mainly
		"cerebrospinal fluid), the patients firstly diagnosed by blood culture had"
		"prolonged time from admission to diagnosis of cryptococcosis (9 days vs. 2 days,"
		"P < .001) and higher 30-day mortality (54.1% vs. 20.8%, P = .003), while fewer"
		"symptoms of meningitis (45.9% vs. 100%, P < .001). For the patients receiving"
		"lumbar puncture, the occurrence of meningitis was similar between the patients"
		firstly diagnosed by blood culture and those firstly diagnosed in other sites
		"(94.1% vs. 100%, P = .26). However, the patients first diagnosed by blood culture"
		"had lower baseline intracranial pressure (250 mm H2O vs. 342.5 mm H2O, P = .001)."
		"In conclusion, patients with cryptococcemia as the first diagnostic proof of"
		"cryptococcosis usually had neglected subtle symptoms of meningitis, which may"
		result in delayed diagnosis and catastrophic outcome.

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) remains an important cause of morbidity
		and mortality among immunocompromised patients. Laboratory diagnostics for CM
		"includes antigen detection, staining and culture. Data on the performance of the"
		Biofire® FilmArray® meningitis/encephalitis (ME) panel for detecting Cryptococcus
		"neoformans/gattii is limited, with several reports describing false negativity"
		for this target. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 1384 physician-ordered ME
		panel tests ordered between January 2017 to October 2018 was performed. ME panel
		results were compared to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cryptococcal antigen (CrAg)
		and CSF culture testing and clinical significance of cryptococcal detection was
		determined. RESULTS: There were 34 patients positive for cryptococcal detection
		"by either ME panel, CSF CrAg or CSF culture in 2.7% of CSF specimens tested"
		"(38/1384). Of the 34 patients positive for cryptococcal detection, 85.3% were"
		human immunodeficiency virus positive (29/34). The ME panel detected 32/38
		"(84.2%) cryptococcal-positive specimens, culture detected 28/38 (73.7%) and CSF"
		CrAg was positive in 37/38 specimens (97.4%). The ME panel had a sensitivity and
		specificity of 96.4% (95% CI 81.7-99.9%) and 99.6% (95% CI 99.2-99.9%) compared
		"with culture, and 83.8% (95% CI 68.0-93.8%) and 99.9% (95% CI 99.6-100.0%)"
		"compared to CSF CrAg testing, respectively. CrAg titres were lower among ME"
		"panel-negative, culture-negative specimens compared with ME panel-positive,"
		culture-negative specimens (reciprocal median end-point titres of 128 ± 60 vs.
		"1920 ± 1730, p 0.04). All five CrAg-positive, ME panel- and culture-negative"
		specimens were obtained from previously treated CM patients. DISCUSSION: The ME
		panel had high correlation with CSF culture and a somewhat lower correlation with
		CSF CrAg testing. The potential utility of using negative ME panel test results
		to predict culture sterility among patients undergoing treatment for CM warrants
		further study.

TI	-	Primary cutaneous cryptococcosis in an immunocompetent host: case report and
		review of the literature.
PG	-	145-9
AB	-	We report a 46-year-old male who developed cellulitis of his third right finger
		after being injured with a metallic object. Cryptococcus neoformans var.
		neoformans was isolated from both the skin and the metallic object. Systemic
		cryptococcosis and immunosuppression was excluded by appropriate tests. Complete
		healing was achieved after 10 months of itraconazole 100 mg/12 h and surgical
		excision of the remaining lesion. Our literature review shows another 16 cases of
		"primary cutaneous cryptococcosis in nonimmunocompromised hosts. The clinical,"
		mycological and therapeutic characteristics of these patients are reviewed.

AB	-	"To gain a more detailed picture of cryptococcosis in Thailand, a retrospective"
		study of 498 C. neoformans and C. gattii isolates has been conducted. Among
		"these, 386, 83 and 29 strains were from clinical, environmental and veterinary"
		"sources, respectively. A total of 485 C. neoformans and 13 C. gattii strains were"
		studied. The majority of the strains (68.9%) were isolated from males (mean age
		"of 37.97 years), 88.5% of C. neoformans and only 37.5% of C. gattii strains were"
		from HIV patients. URA5-RFLP and/or M13 PCR-fingerprinting analysis revealed that
		the majority of the isolates were C. neoformans molecular type VNI regardless of
		"their sources (94.8%; 94.6% of the clinical, 98.8% of the environmental and 86.2%"
		"of the veterinary isolates). In addition, the molecular types VNII (2.4%; 66.7%"
		"of the clinical and 33.3% of the veterinary isolates), VNIV (0.2%; 100%"
		"environmental isolate), VGI (0.2%; 100% clinical isolate) and VGII (2.4%; 100%"
		clinical isolates) were found less frequently. Multilocus Sequence Type (MLST)
		analysis using the ISHAM consensus MLST scheme for the C. neoformans/C. gattii
		species complex identified a total of 20 sequence types (ST) in Thailand
		combining current and previous data. The Thai isolates are an integrated part of
		"the global cryptococcal population genetic structure, with ST30 for C. gattii and"
		"ST82, ST83, ST137, ST141, ST172 and ST173 for C. neoformans being unique to"
		"Thailand. Most of the C. gattii isolates were ST7 = VGIIb, which is identical to"
		"the less virulent minor Vancouver island outbreak genotype, indicating Thailand"
		as a stepping stone in the global spread of this outbreak strain. The current
		study revealed a greater genetic diversity and a wider range of major molecular
		types being present amongst Thai cryptococcal isolates than previously reported.

		"donor-derived cryptococcal infection in the kidney, liver, and lung recipients"
		"from a single donor. Remarkably, the onset of illness in the kidney and liver"
		"recipients occurred more than 8-12 weeks after transplantation, which is beyond"
		the incubation period previously reported for donor-derived cryptococcosis. DDI
		should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of transplant
		"recipients admitted with febrile illness, even when presenting beyond the first"
		"month post-transplant. Communication between reference laboratories, transplant"
		"centers, and organ procurement organizations is critical to improve outcomes."

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcosis is a severe fungal infection with a high mortality
		"rate among solid-organ transplant recipients. Today, China is among the countries"
		"performing the most kidney transplants worldwide, however data on the association"
		of cryptococcosis with kidney transplantation in mainland China remain scarce and
		fragmented. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed cases of culture-confirmed
		cryptococcosis following kidney transplantation that have occurred at our
		hospital and reviewed the published cases in China over the last 30 years.
		RESULTS: Cryptococcosis in kidney transplant recipients was mainly caused by
		Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii VNI strains and occurred most frequently in
		"patients aged 41-50 years (37.9%, 11/29). The average time to infection after"
		kidney transplantation was 5.16 ± 3.97 years. The clinical manifestations were
		"found to be diverse, with slight to moderate headache and fever, meningeal"
		"irritation, and high cerebrospinal fluid pressure being relatively common."
		Physicians should be alert to these symptoms among kidney transplant recipients.
		CONCLUSIONS: Cryptococcosis is a serious infection among kidney transplant
		"recipients in mainland China. It has unique characteristics, such as a relatively"
		"long time to onset after kidney transplantation, and diverse clinical"
		manifestations. Treatment with intrathecal injection of amphotericin B is
		considered effective for central nervous system involvement. The findings of this
		"study also highlight the urgent need for multicenter, prospective, and"
		multidisciplinary clinical studies and education on cryptococcosis in kidney
		transplant recipients in China.

LID	-	10.6002/ect.2018.0051 [doi]
AB	-	Cryptococcosis is an opportunistic infection caused by the Basidiomycota
		"Cryptococcus neoformans (Cryptococcus gattii), which affects immunosuppressed"
		patients and less frequently immunocompetent patients. Solid-organ transplant
		"recipients are a particularly high-risk group, depending on the net state of"
		"immunosuppression. In these patients, the infection usually appears after the"
		"first year after transplant, although it may occur earlier in liver transplant"
		"recipients. In most cases, the infection is secondary to the reactivation of a"
		"latent infection, although it may be due to an unidentified pretransplant"
		"infection by primary infection. Less frequently, it may be transmitted by the"
		graft. The lung and central nervous system are most frequently involved.
		"Extrapulmonary involvement is seen in 75% of the cases, and disseminated disease"

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Pulmonary Cryptococcosis (PC) is diagnosed with increasing incidence
		"in recent years, but it does not commonly involve the pleural space. Here, we"
		report a HIV-negative case with advanced stage IIIB non-small cell lung cancer
		"(NSCLC) treated with radiation therapy presented with dyspnea, a new PET-positive"
		"lung mass and bilateral pleural effusion suspecting progressive cancer. However,"
		the patient has been diagnosed as pulmonary cryptococcal infection and
		successfully treated with oral fluconazole therapy. CASE PRESENTATION: A
		77-year-old male with advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer treated with
		"combined chemo-radiation therapy who presented with progressive dyspnea, a new"
		PET-positive left lower lobe lung mass and bilateral pleural effusions. Initial
		"diagnostic thoracentesis and bronchoscopy yielded no cancer, but instead found"
		yeast forms consistent with cryptococcal organisms in the transbronchial biopsies
		"of the left lower lobe lung mass. Subsequent to this, the previously collected"
		pleural fluid culture showed growth of Cryptococcus neoformans. The same sample
		of pleural effusion was tested and was found to be positive for crytococcal
		antigen (CrAg) by a lateral flow assay (LFA). The patient has been treated with
		oral fluconazole therapy resulting in gradual resolution of the nodular
		infiltrates. CONCLUSION: PC should be considered in immunosuppressed cancer
		"patients. Additionally, concomitant pleural involvement in pulmonary cryptococcal"
		infections may occur. The incidence of false positive (18)FDG-PET scans in
		granulomatous infections and the use of CrAg testing in pleural fluid to aid in
		diagnosis are reviewed.

PG	-	151-6
LID	-	10.1111/myc.12444 [doi]
AB	-	Cryptococcal meningitis is the leading fungal infection and AIDS defining
		"opportunistic illness in patients with late stage HIV infection, particularly in"
		"South-East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Given the high mortality, clinical"
		differences and the extensive ecological niche of Cryptococcus neoformans and
		"Cryptococcus gattii species complexes, there is need for laboratories in"
		sub-Sahara African countries to adopt new and alternative reliable diagnostic
		algorithms that rapidly identify and distinguish these species. We biotyped 74
		and then amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) genotyped 66 Cryptococcus
		isolates from a cohort of patients with HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis.
		C. gattii sensu lato was isolated at a prevalence of 16.7% (n = 11/66) and C.
		neoformans sensu stricto was responsible for 83.3% (n = 55/66) of the infections.
		"l-Canavanine glycine bromothymol blue, yeast-carbon-base-d-proline-d-tryptophan"
		and creatinine dextrose bromothymol blue thymine were able to distinguish
		pathogenic C. gattii sensu lato from C. neoformans sensu stricto species when
		compared with AFLP genotyping. This study demonstrates high C. gattii sensu lato
		"prevalence in Zimbabwe. In addition, biotyping methods can be used as alternative"
		diagnostic tools to molecular typing in resource-limited areas for
		differentiating pathogenic Cryptococcus species.

AB	-	We describe a case of cryptococcal fungemia in a 62-year-old male renal
		transplant patient. The diagnosis was established by isolation of Cryptococcus
		neoformans using the Isolator(®) blood culture lysis-centrifugation system.
		Testing for cryptococcal antigens was negative in the serum and cerebrospinal
		fluid. Transbronchial lung biopsies and bronchoalveolar lavage were negative.
		"Antifungal therapy with fluconazole was started, resulting in fever remission,"
		and a sustained clinical response was achieved. The literature on miliary
		"pulmonary cryptococcosis is reviewed, and three similar cases were previously"
		reported with disseminated cryptococcosis that resembled miliary tuberculosis on
		imaging. These emphasize the importance of eliminating causes other than
		"tuberculosis in patients presenting with miliary pulmonary disease, even in"
		countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis.

AB	-	"A retrospective study of clinical characteristics, outcome and prognostic factors"
		of patients with cryptococcosis was undertaken in intensive care units (ICUs) of
		a medical centre for the period 2000-2005. Twenty-six patients with Cryptococcus
		"neoformans var. grubii infection were identified (16 males, median age 58 years)."
		"The most frequent underlying diseases were liver cirrhosis (38.5%), diabetes"
		mellitus (26.9%) and HIV infection (19.2%). The most frequently identified sites
		"of infection were blood (61.5%), cerebrospinal fluid (38.5%) and airways (34.6%)."
		The mean Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation II score at ICU
		admission was 22.46. The ICU mortality rate in these patients was 73.1% (19/26)
		"and there were a further two mortalities recorded after discharge from ICU,"
		reaching a total mortality rate of 80.8% (21/26). Patients with ICU survival >2
		"weeks had lower rates of HIV infection (P=0.004), less use of inotropic agents"
		during ICU stay (P<0.001) and lower white blood cell counts (P=0.01). After
		"adjusting for clinical variables in the multivariate Cox regression model,"
		diabetes and cryptococcal infection after ICU admission were independent
		predictors of good long-term prognosis (P=0.015) and HIV infectious status was
		associated with poor outcome (P=0.012).

PG	-	36-43
AB	-	"OBJECTIVE: Describe the clinical characteristics, treatment, outcomes,"
		"complications, and factors associated with mortality of cryptococcosis in"
		HIV-negative patients. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A retrospective cohort study was
		conducted among HIV-negative adult patients with positive culture for
		Cryptococcus neoformans between 2005 and 2010. RESULTS: Forty-nine HIV-negative
		patients were identified with median (IQR) age of 62.5 (45.5-71.9) years of which
		40.8% were male. The common underlying medical conditions were cardiovascular
		diseases (36.7%). The common sites of positive culture were cerebrospinal
		"fluid/intracerebral abscess (46.9%), blood (36%), and sputum/bronchoalveolar"
		larvage fluid (28.6%). Twenty-nine (59.2%) patients had co-infections with
		"another organism, such as Gram-negative bacteria (24.4%), M. tuberculosis"
		"(17.8%), and Gram-positive bacteria (13.3%). The common clinical presentations"
		"were fever (67.3%), alteration of consciousness (34.7%), and headache (26.5%)."
		"Complication was detected in 61.2% such as acute kidney injury (47.0%), coma"
		"(38.8%), and shock (22.4%). The overall mortality was 51%. By multivariate"
		"logistic regression, factors associated with mortality were alteration of"
		"consciousness (adjusted OR = 6.85; 95% CI: 1.41-33.28, p = 0.017) and"
		"co-infections (adjusted OR = 5.32; 95% CI: 1.25-22.69, p = 0.024). CONCLUSION:"
		The mortality rate of HIV-negative patients with cryptococcosis is very high.
		Early recognition and treatment of cryptococcosis in HIV-negative patients are
		crucial and may improve the outcome.

AB	-	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Infections including those of the central nervous system
		(CNS) are a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in systemic lupus
		"erythematosus (SLE). This case series describes the etiology, contributing"
		factors and outcomes of CNS infections in a group of Filipino patients with SLE.
		DESIGN: Retrospective case series. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of
		SLE patients diagnosed and confined for a CNS infection at the University of
		"Santo Tomas Hospital in Manila, Philippines, from 1997 to 2007. RESULTS: A total"
		of 23 SLE patients (22 females) diagnosed with CNS infection were included in
		"this study. The mean age was 25.8 years (range 12-51) at SLE diagnosis, and 30.9"
		"years (range 14-58) at CNS infection, with a mean disease duration of 55 months"
		"(range 7-125). Nineteen cases (82.6%) were meningitis, and four (17.4%) were"
		diagnoses of brain abscess. The etiologic agents were identified as Cryptococcus
		"neoformans in seven (30.4%), Mycobacterium tuberculosis in seven (30.4%),"
		"Streptococcus pneumoniae in two (8.7%), Salmonella sp. in one (4.4%),"
		"Corynebacterium bovis with Actinomyces sp. in one (4.4%), and no isolate in five"
		(21.7%). The average daily prednisone dose was 28.9 mg (range 0-60 mg); 10
		"patients had recently received pulse cyclophosphamide, and two were on"
		mycophenolate mofetil at the time of infection. Most cases had active SLE; the
		lone patient in disease remission had S. pneumoniae meningitis post-splenectomy.
		The most common presentation was headache (100%) and fever (87%). The infection
		"resolved completely in nine patients (39.1%), and resolved with sequelae in two"
		patients (8.7%); 12 patients (52.2%) died. CONCLUSION: We described the etiology
		and outcomes of CNS infections in a group of Filipino patients with SLE. Risk
		factors included active SLE in the majority of cases requiring moderate- to
		high-dose steroids and other immunosuppressants like cyclophosphamide. Although
		"C. neoformans and M. tuberculosis were the most common etiologic agents, it is"
		just as important to search for less common organisms which can produce disease
		in highly susceptible hosts. A high index of suspicion and early appropriate
		management are crucial to favorable outcome among these patients.

		Experience.
PG	-	807-814
AB	-	Cryptococcal meningitis carries a high mortality. Further understanding of immune
		suppression factors associated with neuroinvasive infection will improve risk
		stratification and enhance early diagnosis and treatment with antifungal therapy.
		The aim of the study was to corroborate established or find novel clinical
		predictors for cryptococcal meningitis. We performed a matched case-control study
		of Cryptococcus infection in immunocompromised patients with or without
		cryptococcal meningitis. Data of all patients with a diagnosis of cryptococcal
		disease were collected at University of Colorado Hospital between 2000 and 2015
		(n = 51). Thirty patients were diagnosed with cryptococcal meningitis. We built a
		logistic regression model for risk factors associated with cryptococcal
		meningitis. The single-predictor univariate model found that a positive blood
		"culture, positive serum cryptococcal antigen, current malignancy, and headaches"
		were significantly associated with cryptococcal meningitis (p = 0.02). In the
		"adjusted multivariate model, central nervous system disease was significantly"
		"associated with a diagnosis of HIV infection (OR 24.45, 95 % CI 1.62-350.37;"
		"p = 0.022) and a positive serum cryptococcal antigen test (OR 42.92, 95 % CI"
		3.26-555.55; p = 0.0055). In patients with HIV infection or a positive serum
		"cryptococcal antigen, the pretest probability of neuroinvasive Cryptococcus"
		infection is increased and an aggressive diagnostic evaluation should be
		conducted to exclude infection and consider empiric therapy.

		three groups according to their associated predisposing conditions (if any):
		"group 1 comprised nonimmunosuppressed patients, group 2 comprised patients with"
		"AIDS, and group 3 comprised those patients with other conditions and/or who were"
		users of immunosuppressive drugs. Analysis and correlation of the behavior of the
		"mycosis among the three groups showed differences in the demographic data,"

		"morbidity and mortality rates, and histopathologic aspects. Study of the clinical"
		isolates of Cryptococcus neoformans from 83 patients with cryptococcosis showed
		that 75 were characterized as C. neoformans variety neoformans and eight as C.
		neoformans var. gatti. Comparison of the distribution of the gattii and
		neoformans varieties between the nonimmunosuppressed (group 1) and

PG	-	1110-3
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term clinical outcomes and serologic changes in
		cryptococcal antigen and antibody titers in cats with confirmed Cryptococcus
		neoformans infection. DESIGN: Prospective case series. ANIMALS: 47 cats with
		cryptococcosis. PROCEDURE: Cats included in this study were determined to have
		cryptococcosis on the basis of identification of C neoformans on histologic or
		"cytologic examination, isolation of C neoformans in culture, or positive"
		serologic test results for cryptococcal antigens. Information concerning the
		"signalment, history, physical examination findings, FeLV and feline"
		"immunodeficiency virus status, serologic testing, treatment, and outcome for each"
		cat was requested on a survey form. Follow-up measurements of serum cryptococcal
		antigen and antibody titers were requested for all surviving cats. RESULTS:
		Signalment and clinical signs of cats with cryptococcosis reported here were
		consistent with previous reports. Treatment consisted primarily of azole
		"antifungal drugs. All cats were seronegative for cryptococcal antibody titers,"
		whether tested initially or at follow-up examination. All but 1 cat tested were
		seropositive for cryptococcal antigens when initially tested. Cats with and
		without clinical signs of C neoformans infection were seropositive for
		cryptococcal antigens months to years after initial diagnosis of cryptococcosis.
		CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The results of this study indicate that serum titers to
		cryptococcal antigens in cats can persist with or without clinical signs for
		months to years after an initial diagnosis of cryptococcosis is made. Repeated
		evaluation of serum cryptococcal antigen titers is advised during the treatment
		"of cats to monitor progress, evaluate prognosis, and guide cessation of"
		treatment.

AB	-	RATIONALE: Intracranial infections are associated with high morbidity and
		"mortality in immunocompromised patients, due to delayed diagnosis and treatment."
		"Establishing a rapid, accurate diagnosis and a precise therapeutic regimen is"
		crucial for management of the patients. Our report described a rare intracranial
		infection of patient with nephrotic syndrome. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 66-year-old
		woman with a history of nephrotic syndrome presented symptoms in central nervous
		"system for 1 month, followed by headache and fever over several days. DIAGNOSIS:"
		"Neurological examination, brain imaging, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests"
		"exhibited resemblance to intracranial infection. Subsequently, CSF cultures"
		"confirmed the presence of Cryptococcus. Fortunately, next-generation sequencing"
		revealed the concomitant infection with Nocardia farcinica in addition to
		Cryptococcus neoformans. INTERVENTIONS: The treatment with intravenous
		fluconazole combined with amphotericin could not immediately ameliorate her
		symptoms. The patient's condition improved significantly with minimal deficits
		after timely administration of antibiotics against N farcinica. OUTCOMES: One
		"month later, cranial MRI indicated that basal ganglia lesions ameliorated. The"
		"patient has recovered well. LESSONS SUBSECTIONS: To our best knowledge, this is"
		the first case report of intracranial infection caused by both N farcinica and C
		"neoformans in a patient with nephrotic syndrome. Remarkably, extensive"
		application of next-generation sequencing can facilitate investigation on the
		potential role of various pathogenic organisms in infectious diseases.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcus gattii is a fungal pathogen causing an emerging outbreak
		in the United States Pacific Northwest (PNW). Treatment guidelines for
		cryptococcosis are primarily based on data from C. neoformans infections;
		applicability to PNW C. gattii infection is unknown. We evaluated the
		relationship between initial antifungal treatment and outcomes for PNW C. gattii
		patients. METHODS: Cases were defined as culture-confirmed invasive C. gattii
		infections among residents of Oregon and Washington States during 2004-2011.
		Clinical data were abstracted from medical records through one year of follow-up.
		"Recommended initial treatment for central nervous system (CNS), bloodstream, and"
		severe pulmonary infections is amphotericin B and 5-flucytosine; for non-severe
		"pulmonary infections, recommended initial treatment is fluconazole. Alternative"
		initial treatment was defined as any other initial antifungal treatment. RESULTS:
		Seventy patients survived to diagnosis; 50 (71%) received the recommended initial
		treatment and 20 (29%) received an alternative. Fewer patients with pulmonary
		infections [21 (64%)] than CNS infections [25 (83%)] received the recommended
		"initial treatment (p = 0.07). Among patients with pulmonary infections, those"
		with severe infections received the recommended initial treatment less often than
		"those with non-severe infections (11% vs. 83%, p<0.0001). Eight patients with"
		severe pulmonary infections received alternative initial treatments; three died.
		Four patients with non-severe pulmonary infections received alternative initial
		treatments; two died. There was a trend towards increased three-month mortality
		among patients receiving alternative vs. recommended initial treatment (30% vs.
		"14%, p = 0.12), driven primarily by increased mortality among patients with"
		pulmonary disease receiving alternative vs. recommended initial treatment (42%
		"vs. 10%, p = 0.07). CONCLUSIONS: C. gattii patients with pulmonary"
		infections--especially severe infections--may be less likely to receive
		recommended treatment than those with CNS infections; alternative treatment may
		be associated with increased mortality. Reasons for receipt of alternative
		"treatment among C. gattii patients in this area should be investigated, and"
		clinician awareness of recommended treatment reinforced.

		involving mainly HIV-infected patients who are not receiving antiretroviral
		therapy (ART) or present poor adherence. This study aims to evaluate
		"epidemiological, clinical and outcome aspects of patients with cryptococcosis"
		"from 1998-2010. Patients were prospectively recruited, and their medical and"
		"laboratory records were reviewed. A total of 131 cases were included, and of"
		"these, 119 (90.83%) had AIDS, 4 received a renal transplant, 2 presented systemic"
		lupus erythematosus and 6 (4.6%) were apparently immunocompetent. Ninety-one
		"(69.46%) were men, and the median age was 38.7 years. Cryptococcal meningitis"
		"(CM) was diagnosed in 103 (78.62%), whereas 28 (21.38%) had cryptococcal"
		"infection in other sites. Of patients with CM, 94 (91.26%) had AIDS being"
		"cryptococcosis the first defining illness in 61 (64.9%), while 37 (60.65%) of"
		"them presented simultaneously both diagnosis. Headache, altered mental status,"
		papilledema and seizures at admission were significatively associated with a poor
		"outcome. Of 163 different isolates, 155 (95.09%) were Cryptococcus neoformans and"
		eight (4.88%) Cryptococcus gattii. Antifungal therapy was warranted in 8 (87.4%)
		"patients with CM, but 46 (51.1%) died during the first days or weeks. Of 28"
		"patients without CM, 21 (75%) received treatment, but 6 (28.6%) died. The poor"
		outcome among this case series was similar to that reported from other developing
		"countries, but it is paradoxal in Brazil where the ART is at free disposal in the"
		"public health services. Despite, at least 60-70% of patients present advanced"
		immunosuppression when they receive the AIDS diagnosis.

PG	-	229-235
LID	-	10.1080/24725625.2021.1909214 [doi]
AB	-	A 78-year-old man developed disseminated cryptococcosis with central nervous
		system involvement as encapsulated yeast cells were detected in transbronchial
		"biopsy and skin biopsy specimens, and cerebrospinal fluid. Cryptococcus"
		neoformans was confirmed by culture. He had been treated with low-dose
		prednisolone and methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis. He started receiving
		antifungal therapy with intravenous liposomal amphotericin B followed by oral
		fluconazole. Methotrexate was discontinued. Approximately 4 months after the
		"course of intravenous liposomal amphotericin B was completed, he complained of"
		"pain and swelling of the right wrist, which suggested that rheumatoid arthritis"
		"was worsening. Abatacept therapy was initiated along with antifungal therapy, and"
		"his symptoms relieved. After 24 months of antifungal therapy, although he was"
		"still receiving oral fluconazole, he was doing well and the serum cryptococcal"
		antigen had become negative. Disseminated cryptococcosis is an important
		opportunistic infection associated with low-dose methotrexate for rheumatoid
		arthritis. Abatacept therapy may be feasible in strictly selected patients with
		rheumatoid arthritis complicated with cryptococcosis concomitantly with intensive
		anti-fungal therapy.

AB	-	RATIONALE: Cryptococcal infection has been documented in immunocompromised
		patients. AIDS and renal transplant recipients account for majority of the cases.
		"Most cases present with central nervous system or disseminated disease, with only"
		"few presenting soft tissue, bone, and joint manifestations. PATIENT CONCERNS: We"
		present a case of soft tissue mass in a 66-year-old female renal transplant
		recipient and that of arthritis in a 64-year-old immunocompetent man who
		presented pseudogout arthropathy. Chest radiographies of both cases were
		negative. Biopsy revealed cryptococcal organisms. Blood culture or cerebrospinal
		fluid sampling indicated positive results for cryptococcal antigen. DIAGNOSIS:
		Cryptococcus neoformans was recovered in the wound culture. INTERVENTIONS: The
		"patients received intravenous fluconazole and flucytosine, followed by oral"
		fluconazole administration. OUTCOMES: Symptomatic improvements were achieved and
		no subsequent relapses were observed. LESSONS: The authors experienced 2 cases of
		cryptococcosis with very unusual clinical presentation. Early clinical suspicion
		and serum cryptococcal antigen testing can help in rapid appropriate diagnosis in
		immunocompetent as well as immunocompromised patients even in the absence of
		pulmonary involvement.

PG	-	284-8
AB	-	"In a retrospective evaluation, the incidence of systemic fungal infections (SFIs)"
		in 296 kidney graft recipients admitted to our center between 1986 and 1999 was
		found to be 4%. Eighteen percent of 28 recipients transplanted in India and 8% of
		"12 recipients transplanted in Russia developed SFI. In contrast, SFI was"
		encountered in only 2% of recipients transplanted at our center. The median time
		of diagnosis of SFI was 5 months after transplantation. The lungs and central
		nervous system were the most frequently affected sites. The most common etiologic
		"agent was Aspergillus fumigatus (n = 7) but Candida spp. (n = 1), Rhizopus spp."
		"(n = 1) and Cryptococcus neoformans (n = 1) were also encountered. In 2 patients,"
		2 different pathogens were isolated at the same time: A. fumigatus and Rhizopus
		spp. in 1 patient and Candida spp. and A. fumigatus in another. In order to
		"determine predisposing factors for SFI, patients admitted immediately before and"
		"after those with SFI were used as controls: long-term hospitalization, long-term"
		antibiotic use and post-transplant diabetes mellitus were found to be
		predisposing factors. Eight patients were treated with antifungal drugs and a
		good response to liposomal amphotericin B therapy was obtained in 3/5. Nine
		patients (75%) with SFI died. As SFIs are associated with a high mortality rate
		"in renal transplant recipients, antifungal therapy, especially with liposomal"
		"amphotericin B, should be started whenever fungal infection is suspected, even"
		before the results of microbiologic and/or histologic examinations are known.

AB	-	Infection by human T-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1) is often seen as the cause of
		"chronic infection or lymphoproliferative disorders, but many clinicians do not"
		recognise its association with severe immunosuppression. We report the case of a
		woman in her 70s from the Caribbean who sought care at the emergency department
		"for weakness, fatigue and weight loss. Further work-up showed atypical"
		lymphocytosis with floral lymphocytes and smudge cells in the peripheral blood
		smear and hypercalcaemia. Chest CT demonstrated a moderate right pleural
		"effusion. Results of HIV testing were negative, and screening and confirmatory"
		"tests for HTLV-1 were positive. Empiric antibiotic therapy was administered, and"
		"the patient was discharged home. Five days later, she was readmitted with"
		shortness of breath and severe abdominal pain. A disseminated infection with
		Cryptococcus neoformans was diagnosed. Despite aggressive intravenous antifungal
		"therapy, the patient died on day 7 of hospitalisation."

		outcomes of Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii fungemia.
PG	-	1114-1121
LID	-	10.1093/mmy/myab046 [doi]
AB	-	Mortality rates due to Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii fungemia remain
		significant despite treatment with antifungal drugs. The predictive function of
		antifungal susceptibility and its correlation with treatment outcome remains
		"controversial. A retrospective study was conducted from January 1, 2009, to"
		"December 31, 2016, on 85 patients with C. neoformans var. grubii fungemia"
		confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass
		spectrometry. Antifungal drug susceptibility was determined using the YeastONE™
		colorimetric broth microdilution method coupled with Vizion™ System following the
		Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Six antifungal
		"agents-amphotericin B, fluconazole, flucytosine, itraconazole, posaconazole, and"
		voriconazole-were tested. The patients' demographic data and clinical information
		were abstracted for further analyses. Antifungal regimens consisting of
		amphotericin B with or without fluconazole or flucytosine were administered for
		"induction treatment of these patients, followed with intravenous or oral"
		fluconazole for maintenance therapy. Clinical outcomes were defined by 14- and
		30-day mortality rates. Risk factors associated with outcomes were fitted in a
		logistic regression model by univariate or multivariate method. Eighty-five
		patients with C. neoformans var. grubii fungemia were enrolled in the study. The
		"Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score, Glasgow Coma Scale, Charlson"
		"comorbidity score, and adequate duration of therapy for amphotericin B were"
		predictors for mortality in univariate analysis. Antifungal susceptibility
		testing with YeastONE™ does not predict clinical outcomes of C. neoformans var.
		"grubii fungemia. Greater disease severity, high comorbidities, poor consciousness"
		"level, and inappropriate treatment were associated with increased mortality in"
		cryptococcemia cases.

OAB	-	Cryptococcus neoformans is an encapsulated yeast living in both plants and
		"animals that is composed of three main serotypes: C. neoformans var. grubii, C."
		"neoformans var. gattii, and C. neoformans var. neoformans. C. neoformans var."
		grubii is the most common disease-causing Cryptococcus species worldwide. C.
		neoformans var. gattii is more prevalent than C. neoformans var. neoformans in
		"both tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. C. neoformans causes severe, even"
		"fatal, diseases such as pulmonary infection, bloodstream infection, skin and soft"
		"tissue infection, bone and joint infection, central nervous system infection, and"
		"disseminated infection, regardless of host immunocompetence. We conducted a"
		"retrospective study on 85 patients who contracted cryptococcemia from January 1,"
		"2009, to December 31, 2016. This work conducted both microbiological and clinical"
		"studies involving in vitro susceptibility testing, demographic data,"
		"comorbidities, treatment modalities, and treatment outcomes. We utilized a modern"
		"medical technique-based instrument, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization"
		"time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF MS; Biotyper, Bruker Daltonics,"
		"Inc.), which determines the unique proteomic fingerprint of an organism, to"
		identify the C. neoformans serotype. We utilized Thermo Fisher Scientific™
		Sensititre™ YeastONE™ colorimetric broth microdilution plates coupled with a
		Vizion™ Digital MIC Viewing System (a computer-assisted optical reading machine)
		"to determine the in vitro susceptibility of amphotericin B, flucytosine,"
		"fluconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole against 85 C."
		"neoformans var. grubii blood isolates. In conclusion, the susceptibility patterns"
		of these antifungal agents did not correlate significantly with treatment
		"outcomes. However, a lower disease severity score, a lower Glasgow Coma Scale"
		"score, fewer comorbidities, and adequate amphotericin B treatment duration were"
		predictors for treatment success in univariate analysis.

		report and review of the literature.
PG	-	282-8
AB	-	In the absence of coexisting HIV infection Cryptococcus neoformans is rarely
		considered in the differential diagnosis of peritonitis that occurs in patients
		"with cirrhosis and ascites. Here, we report on a 39-year-old male, HIV-negative"
		patient with decompensated alcohol toxic liver cirrhosis who developed a lethal
		intraperitoneal infection with C. neoformans. We reviewed the literature and
		found an additional 19 cases with culture confirmed cryptococcal peritonitis in
		combination with liver disease or AIDS. We suggest that awareness of this unusual
		but lethal entity may lead to earlier diagnosis and proper treatment.

TI	-	Central nervous system cryptococcoma in immunocompetent patients: a short review
		illustrated by a new case.
PG	-	129-36
LID	-	10.1007/s00701-009-0311-8 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: Cryptococcal infection in CNS is frequently seen in HIV patients and
		"those with other immunosuppressed conditions. However, cryptococcal granuloma in"
		CNS in immunocompetent patient is rare. We present one new case of cryptococcoma
		and review literature to illustrate diagnosis and treatment of these lesions.
		METHODS: We conducted literature search in Pubmed search engine of the National
		Center for Biotechnology Information. RESULTS: Seventeen cases of CNS cryptoccoma
		"in immunocompetent patients, including ours, have been reported to date. Of them,"
		"two patients had lesions inside spinal cord, and C. neoformans var. gattii was"
		identified in three cases. All patients were symptomatic with normal
		immunocompetency although two patients had type 2 diabetes mellitus and one had
		torsades de pointes. Eight patients received surgical treatment and all were
		given antifungal agents except one suspected of teniasis. CONCLUSIONS: With
		"literature reports and our experiences, we suggest that ring shaped enhancement"
		of mass lesion with or without cystic changes in MR scan may indicate
		"cryptococcoma, but definitive diagnosis relies on pathology study of lesion"
		"specimen. Open surgery and anti-fungal therapy should be scheduled, and outcome"
		of cryptococcoma is largely determined by its locations.

TI	-	Fungal infections as a complication of therapy for sarcoidosis.
PG	-	451-6
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Treatment of symptomatic sarcoidosis usually includes systemic
		immunosuppressive agents. These agents may render the patient more susceptible to
		"opportunistic infections. In addition, the fungal infection may be difficult to"
		distinguish from the underlying sarcoidosis. AIM: To examine the presentation and
		management of invasive fungal infections in sarcoidosis patients. DESIGN:
		Retrospective record review. METHODS: We reviewed the notes of all sarcoidosis
		patients (n = 753) seen at our clinic over an 18-month period. RESULTS: Seven
		patients (0.9%) with previously diagnosed sarcoidosis developed fungal
		infections: two each with Histoplasma capsulatum and Blastomyces dermatitidis and
		three others with Cryptococcus neoformans. No cases of invasive aspergillus or
		tuberculosis were identified. The diagnosis of fungal infection was made by
		"bronchoscopy (four cases), open-lung biopsy (one case), bone-marrow aspirate (one"
		"case), and spinal fluid examination (one case). All patients were receiving"
		corticosteroids at the time of worsening chest X-ray or clinical status. Four
		patients were also receiving methotrexate prior to infection. No patient with
		systemic fungal infection was receiving either infliximab or cyclophosphamide.
		All patients responded to anti-fungal therapy and a reduction in
		immunosuppression. DISCUSSION: Fungal infections occur rarely in treated patients
		"with sarcoidosis. Deterioration of chest X-ray, especially a localized"
		"infiltrate, warrants investigation."

		Case report and review of fungal pericarditis.
PG	-	245-255

AB	-	Cryptococcus neoformans is a saprophytic fungal pathogen that can cause serious
		illness in immune-compromised hosts and it presents with a wide variety of
		clinical symptoms. We present a fatal case of fulminant C. neoformans infection
		presenting as pericardial tamponade in a 71-year-old male with chronic
		myelomonocytic leukaemia undergoing chemotherapy with the JAK-STAT inhibitor
		ruxolitinib. We also review the published cases of fungal pericarditis/tamponade.
		"In addition to illustrating an atypical presentation of C. neoformans, this case"
		highlights the risk for opportunistic fungal infections in patients with
		"haematological malignancies, especially the ones treated with small molecule"
		kinase inhibitors.

AB	-	Idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia (ICL) is a rare disease characterized by marked
		loss of CD4 T-cells without human immunodeficiency virus infection. CD4 T-cells
		play an important role in granuloma formation in cryptococcal infection. Thus
		"far, among ICL patients, it has not been concluded definitely whether granuloma"
		is formed or not. We report the case of a 39-year-old woman with ICL and
		disseminated cryptococcal infection with granuloma formation. She was referred to
		"our department because of a lung mass, osteolytic lesion, and a subcutaneous mass"
		"identified on a computed tomography scan, and an elevated C-reactive protein"
		level. Cryptococcus neoformans was isolated from the tissues. She also had marked
		"CD4 lymphocytopenia (33 cells/μL), without human immunodeficiency virus"
		"infection. In a biopsy specimen of the lung mass, granulomas containing CD4"
		T-cells were observed. The cryptococcosis was treated with liposomal amphotericin
		B followed by fluconazole and she was found to be cured. The CD4 T-cell count was
		persistently low. This case showed that granulomas containing CD4 T-cells can be
		formed in ICL patients with cryptococcal infection despite very low CD4 T-cell
		counts.

AB	-	Ten cases of cryptococcosis due to unusual microscopic forms of Cryptococcus sp.
		observed over a twenty-eight year period (1981-2009) are presented. The most
		important clinicopathological and laboratory data are tabulated. The uncommon
		forms of cryptococcal cells given are: structures resembling germ tube (one
		"case), chains of budding yeasts (one case), pseudohyphae (two cases) and"
		nonencapsulated yeast-like organisms (eight cases). The diagnosis was based on
		the histopathological findings. The causative organism was isolated and
		"identified in seven cases; five were due to C. neoformans, and two to C. gattii."
		"In addition, the importance of using staining histochemical techniques -"
		"Grocott's silver stain (GMS), Mayer's mucicarmine stain (MM) and Fontana-Masson"
		stain (FM) - in the diagnosis of cryptococcosis is argued.

		Primary cutaneous infection occurs rarely due to direct inoculation. Cutaneous
		"lesions are usually secondary and act as a key marker of disseminated infection,"
		"especially in patients with impaired cell-mediated immunity, such as those"
		"infected with HIV, solid-organ transplant recipients, and those on chronic"

AB	-	The fungal pathogen Cryptococcus gattii was considered to be restricted to tropic
		and sub- tropic regions. A recent outbreak in North America due to isolates
		"belonging to molecular type VG II, affecting mostly non-immunocompromised hosts,"
		documented the potential public health impact of this fungal pathogen also in
		"temperate regions. Surveillance of these infections in Germany is challenging, as"
		cryptococcosis is not notifiable and often C. gattii is diagnostically not
		distinguished from the more prevalent Cryptococcus neoformans. We used hospital
		discharge data and identified cryptococcal isolates received by the German
		cryptococcosis reference laboratory at the species level to gain insights into
		the epidemiology of C. gattii-infections in Germany between 2004 and 2013.
		Between 49 and 60 (Median 57) hospitalizations for cryptococcosis are documented
		per year. Between 5 and 28 (Median 14) isolates were received at the reference
		"laboratory per year. Among 155 single patient isolates, four C. gattii (3%) of"
		the molecular types VGI and VG III were identified from patients with
		"meningoencephalitis, including one interspecies hybrid. Patient histories and"
		molecular typing suggest that half of the infections were acquired abroad. Only
		one patient survived the infection. C. gattii remains rarely identified as agent
		of cryptococcosis in Germany but underestimation is likely. Definition of
		environmental niches occupied by C. gattii in Germany may help to assess the
		associated risk of infection and prevent this deadly fungal infection.

AB	-	Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis (CM) remains the most prevalent invasive fungal
		infection worldwide. The main objective of this study was to describe the
		prevalence of CM and cryptococcal infection in HIV-infected patients in
		Madagascar. The secondary objectives were to assess the adjusted prevalence of CM
		"according to clinical presentation and patient characteristics, to determine"
		"crude 90-day survival according to cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) status and CM, and"
		to identify the genotypes of Cryptococcus clinical isolates. This cross-sectional
		study was carried out at two urban hospitals in Antananarivo (central highlands)
		and Toamasina (east coast) between November 2014 and December 2016. Consecutive
		HIV-infected adults presenting with CD4 cell counts ≤200/μl were enrolled.
		"Lateral flow immunoassays of CrAg were performed on serum for all patients, and"
		"on cerebrospinal fluid for patients with CM symptoms. MALDI-ToF MS, ITS"
		"sequencing, and determinations of the molecular and mating types of the isolates"
		were performed. Fluconazole is the only drug for CM treatment available in
		"Madagascar. Patients were treated orally, with high doses (1200 mg/day) for 10-12"
		weeks and then with 200 mg/day. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined
		"for amphotericin B, flucytosine, voriconazole and fluconazole in E-tests. Overall"
		prevalence was 13.2% (95% CI 7.9-20.3) for cryptococcal infection and 10.9% (95%
		"CI 6.1-17.5) for CM, among the 129 HIV-infected patients studied. The 90-day"
		mortality rate was 58.8% (10/17) in CrAg-positive patients and 17.9% (20/112) in
		CrAg-negative patients (p<0.001). The 13 Cryptococcus strains obtained at
		"baseline were all Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii, genotypes VNI-αA (3"
		"isolates), VNII-αA (4 isolates) or hybrid VNI/VNII-αAAα (6 isolates), suggesting"
		high diversity. Two strains acquired fluconazole resistance after four and five
		"months of exposure, respectively. The prevalence of cryptococcosis is high in"
		Madagascar and this serious condition is life-threatening in HIV-infected
		patients. These findings will be used to raise the awareness of national
		authorities to strengthen the national HIV/AIDS control program.

PG	-	93-6
AB	-	Cryptococcus neoformans is a yeastlike encapsulated basidiomycetous fungus that
		is able to cross the blood-brain barrier and cause meningitis in both
		immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals. Cryptococcus neoformans has
		emerged as a major opportunistic pathogen because of the widespread use of
		"immunosuppressive therapy. It causes most cryptococcal infections in humans, and"
		disseminated infection can have cutaneous manifestations. We report a rare case
		of disseminated C neoformans in a 52-year-old man who underwent an orthotopic
		liver transplant. We also provide a concise review of the literature on C
		"neoformans, including its associations, histology, and treatment."

LID	-	bcr1120115224
AB	-	Cryptococcus neoformans is associated with a spectrum of diseases including
		"meningoencephalitis, pneumonia and soft tissue infections. Incidence is higher in"
		immunocompromised hosts like HIV-infected individuals and solid organ transplant
		recipients. The influenza virus is known to cause immunologic defects.
		"Additionally, the 2009-pandemic H1N1 virus is associated with increased incidence"
		of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring treatment with systemic
		steroids. The authors present the first case of cryptococcal meningitis in a
		"patient with flu A-associated ARDS (FLAARDS). In this patient, risk factors for"
		invasive fungal disease included a combination of severe and prolonged
		"H1N1-influenza virus infection, corticosteroid therapy and broad-spectrum"
		antibiotics. While prolonged corticosteroid use is a known risk factor for
		"development of invasive fungal disease, the authors postulate that by causing"
		"immunologic defects and FLAARDS, the 2009-pandemic H1N1 virus may represent an"
		additional independent risk for the development of C neoformans meningitis in a
		previously healthy individual.

AB	-	Cryptococcosis is the most common fungal disease in HIV-infected persons. It is
		known as the AIDS-defining illness for 60-70% of HIV-infected patients. Before
		"antiretroviral therapy (ARV) was discovered, fungal and other opportunistic"
		infections were a major problem for people with advanced HIV/AIDS. Presented here
		"is a case of a 43-year-old man who was newly diagnosed HIV, in which he was"
		admitted due to shortness of breath and decreased consciousness. His clinical
		"symptoms, physical examination, laboratory and radiologic findings indicated a"
		Cryptococcus neoformans infection. The patient had received treatment using
		anti-fungal and ARV that showed a clinical improvement during observation.

TI	-	Necrotizing Fasciitis Caused by Cryptococcus gattii.
PG	-	E517-22
AB	-	Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a severe soft-tissue infection that can lead to
		high morbidity and mortality. The etiology of NF is often polymicrobial. Although
		"rare, fungal organisms have been known to cause NF. Cryptococcus is a fungal"
		infection that may lead to NF. Here we report the case of a 73-year-old man who
		had diabetes and presented with pain and swelling in the left hand after being
		bitten by an insect over the dorsum of the hand. Operative débridement revealed
		"NF caused by Cryptococcus gattii. Antifungal medication was started, and the"
		patient underwent multiple débridements of the hand with subsequent skin
		"grafting. Four months later, the hand wound was completely healed. Authors have"
		reported several cases of NF secondary to Cryptococcus neoformans in
		immunocompromised patients. The emerging C gattii pathogen affects
		"immunocompetent patients. Although the transmission route is mainly respiratory,"
		direct inoculation has been described as well. Ours is the first reported case of
		NF secondary to C gattii. It is important to consider fungal elements as a source
		of NF. Appropriate treatment includes aggressive surgical débridement and
		antifungal therapy.

TI	-	Outcomes of flucytosine-containing combination treatment for cryptococcal
		meningitis in a South African national access programme: a cross-sectional
		observational study.
PG	-	1365-1373
LID	-	S1473-3099(22)00234-1 [pii]
LID	-	10.1016/S1473-3099(22)00234-1 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Although flucytosine is a key component of WHO-recommended induction
		"treatment for HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis, this antifungal agent is"
		not widely available in low-income and middle-income countries due to limited
		"production and cost. In 2018, a national flucytosine access programme was"
		initiated in South Africa. We aimed to determine the effectiveness of
		flucytosine-containing induction regimens in routine care to motivate for the
		urgent registration of flucytosine and its inclusion in treatment guidelines.
		"METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we compared outcomes of adults aged 18"
		years and older with incident laboratory-confirmed cryptococcal meningitis
		treated with or without flucytosine-containing regimens at 19 sentinel hospitals
		in South Africa. A case of cryptococcosis was defined as illness in an adult
		with: (1) positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) India ink microscopy; (2) a positive
		CSF cryptococcal antigen test; or (3) culture of Cryptococcus neoformans or
		Cryptococcus gattii from CSF or any other specimen. We excluded patients without
		"a case report form, those with an unknown or negative HIV serology result, those"
		"with a recurrent episode, and those who did not receive antifungal treatment in"
		hospital. We assessed cumulative in-hospital mortality at 14 days and 30 days and
		calculated the overall crude in-hospital case-fatality ratio. We used
		random-effects logistic regression to examine the association between treatment
		"group and in-hospital mortality. FINDINGS: From July 1, 2018, to March 31, 2020,"
		10 668 individuals were diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed cryptococcal
		"meningitis, 7787 cases diagnosed at non-enhanced surveillance sites and 567 cases"
		from eight enhanced surveillance sites with no access to flucytosine were
		excluded. Of 2314 adults with a first episode of cryptococcosis diagnosed at 19
		"facilities with access to flucytosine, 1996 had a case report form and of these,"
		1539 received induction antifungal treatment and were confirmed HIV-seropositive
		"first-episode cases. Of 1539 patients who received antifungal therapy, 596"
		(38·7%) individuals received a flucytosine-containing regimen and 943 (61·3%)
		received another regimen. The median age was 36 years (IQR 32-43) and 906 (58·9%)
		participants were male and 633 (41·1%) were female. The crude in-hospital
		case-fatality ratio was 23·9% (95% CI 20·0-27·0; 143 of 596) in those treated
		with flucytosine-containing regimens and 37·2% (95% CI 34·0-40·0; 351 of 943) in
		those treated with other regimens. Patients admitted to non-academic hospitals
		(adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1·95 [95% CI 1·53-2·48]; p<0·0001) and those who were
		antiretroviral treatment-experienced (aOR 1·30 [1·02-1·67]; p=0·033) were more
		"likely to receive flucytosine. After adjusting for relevant confounders,"
		flucytosine treatment was associated with a 53% reduction in mortality (aOR 0·47
		"[95% CI 0·35-0·64]; p<0·0001). Among survivors, the median length of hospital"
		admission in the flucytosine group was 11 days (IQR 8-15) versus 17 days (13-21)
		in the comparison group (p=0·0010). INTERPRETATION: In-hospital mortality among
		patients treated with a flucytosine-containing regimen was comparable to reduced
		mortality reported in patients receiving a flucytosine-containing regimen in a
		recent multicentre African clinical trial. Flucytosine-based treatment can be
		delivered in routine care in a middle-income country with a substantial survival
		"benefit. FUNDING: National Institute for Communicable Diseases, a Division of the"

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcal infections of the central nervous system are very rare
		in immunocompetent patients. They usually present as meningitis or as fungal
		cysts with or without hydrocephalus. Rapid diagnosis and treatment is crucial to
		the prognosis. CASE REPORT: We report the case of an immunocompetent 40-year-old
		"male patient with no medical or surgical history and no recent travel, who was"
		hospitalized in our neurosurgery department because of a rapidly worsening
		headache. The neurological examination revealed no focal deficit but worrying
		signs of increased intracranial pressure. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with
		"contrast showed thick and large-scale cortico-pial cerebellar enhancements,"
		associated with severe obstructive hydrocephalus. This required emergency
		endoscopic ventriculocisternostomy during which we observed cottony tissues along
		the ventricular walls. Biopsied tissues and cerebrospinal fluid samples (CSF)
		were not contributive. A CT scan of the chest and abdomen and blood markers of
		common primary tumors were all negative. No evidence of HIV infection or any
		cause of immunosuppression was identified. Symptoms and a second MRI slightly
		improved with intravenous corticosteroid therapy. The hypothesis of a lymphoma or
		granulomatous disease was made initially for which direct surgical biopsies were
		scheduled. The diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis was obtained later on by
		simultaneous plasma and CSF Cryptococcus antigen detection. Cryptococcus
		neoformans (formerly C. neoformans var. grubii [serotype A]) was then identified
		by PCR. Clinical improvement was obtained with antifungal therapy. CONCLUSION:
		"Cryptococcal meningitis is a well-known condition in immunocompromised patients,"
		often causing hydrocephalus requiring neurosurgical management. The diagnosis is
		more difficult in patients with no history of HIV or organ transplant.
		"Neurologists and neurosurgeons must consider this possibility in case of diffuse,"
		thick leptomeningeal enhancement on MRI.

PG	-	551-553
LID	-	10.1111/1346-8138.15280 [doi]
AB	-	Cutaneous cryptococcosis is classified as localized cutaneous cryptococcosis and
		cutaneous manifestations of disseminated cryptococcosis. The former presents as
		"lesions, confined to isolated parts of the skin, which are neither systemically"
		disseminated nor associated with cryptococcal fungemia or antigenemia. The latter
		presents as lesions through dissemination of Cryptococcus from visceral organs
		"such as the lungs, with most cases being immunosuppressed hosts. We report the"
		case of an immunocompetent elderly long-term pigeon fancier who presented with
		disseminated cutaneous cryptococcosis caused by Cryptococcus neoformans. Although
		the patient had been at risk of inhaling the pathogen by keeping pigeons for many
		"years, and had been treated with topical steroids for a localized nodular lesion,"
		the cause of development of multiple skin lesions could not be determined. The
		"patient paradoxically showed no pulmonary or central nervous system symptoms,"
		fungemia or glucuronoxylomannan antigenemia. Treatment with oral itraconazole
		"200 mg/day was not effective, but combination therapy of 5-fluorocytosine"
		200 mg/kg per day and fluconazole 100 mg/day resolved the disease.

TI	-	Acute respiratory failure associated with cryptococcosis in patients with AIDS:
		analysis of predictive factors.
PG	-	1231-7
AB	-	The incidence of acute respiratory failure (ARF) associated with cryptococcal
		disease in patients with AIDS is underestimated in the literature. We performed a
		"retrospective, case-control (referent) study to determine the prevalence of ARF"
		associated with cryptococcal disease and analyzed associated factors. Potential
		cases of ARF were identified at four university-affiliated teaching hospitals
		from a cohort of 210 patients with AIDS who had positive cryptococcal antigen
		tests and/or Cryptococcus neoformans isolated from any body site. Twenty-nine of
		the 210 (13.8%) had ARF associated with cryptococcal disease. Nineteen were
		"thought to have respiratory failure due solely to C. neoformans. The demographic,"
		"clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data of 19 cases of respiratory"
		failure were compared with data for 20 patients without respiratory failure.
		"In-hospital mortality was 100% and median survival was 2 days for cases, vs. 25%"
		"and > 365 days, respectively, for referents. The clinical presentation was"
		"identical to that of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. In multivariate analysis,"
		variables independently predictive of ARF in patients with cryptococcal disease
		"were black race, a lactate dehydrogenase level of > or = 500 IU/L, the presence"
		"of interstitial infiltrates, and the presence of cutaneous lesions. ARF with"
		cryptococcosis in patients with AIDS is associated with disseminated disease and
		high mortality. The diagnosis frequently is not considered before death. Serum
		cryptococcal antigen testing is a sensitive and rapid screening method.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Ocular involvement in AIDS patients is a common event mainly caused
		by inflammation or infection. Despite the high prevalence rate of cryptococcosis
		"in these individuals, ocular features have been occasionally described. CASE"
		REPORT: A 20-year-old Brazilian female with HIV infection recently diagnosed was
		admitted with a respiratory profile presumptively diagnosed as Pneumocystis
		jirovecii pneumonia; an ophthalmologic exam suggested choroiditis by this agent
		as well. She was complaining of headaches and blurred vision which led to
		cryptococcal meningitis diagnosis by a CSF positive India ink stain and
		Cryptococcus neoformans positive culture. Despite therapy based on amphotericin B
		"plus fluconazole, her clinical state progressively worsened and the patient died"
		"one week later. At necropsy, disseminated cryptococcal infection was evidenced in"
		"several organs including eyes, which presented bilateral chorioretinitis."
		CONCLUSIONS: Cryptococcal ocular involvement in AIDS patients has been
		"occasionally proved among the cases already reported. Thus, the post mortem exam"
		"is still pivotal to improve the quality of the clinical diagnosis, especially in"
		limited-resource settings.

AB	-	"Cryptococcal meningitis is a rare entity among immunocompetent hosts but, when it"
		"occurs, it is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Clinical"
		presentation as well as the course of the disease is usually subtle and indolent
		with headache and altered mental status. The authors present the case of a
		"59-year-old man, who sought medical help with a 2-week history of headaches"
		accompanied by nausea and visual and hearing disturbances. On admission the
		"patient was afebrile, presented visual and hearing deficits and had a normal"
		magnetic resonance image of the brain. A lumbar puncture was performed and
		microscopic examination of the cerebrospinal fluid revealed yeasts that were
		"identified as Cryptococcus spp. and later, by means of molecular biology"
		"techniques, as Cryptococcus neoformans, var. grubii. The patient was treated with"
		liposomal amphotericin B plus fluconazole for 28 weeks. At follow-up after 1 year
		the patient was asymptomatic and received fluconazole 400 mg/day as prophylactic
		therapy. The outcome of Cryptococcus infections in immunocompetent hosts is
		reported to be poor as a result of a delayed diagnosis and suboptimal initial
		antifungal therapy. The influence of the normal immune response is unclear.

AB	-	Cryptococcosis is the third most common invasive fungal infection following solid
		"organ transplantation, and mortality is high. Most cases occur late and are due"
		"to reactivation of latent infection; however, very early reactivation and"
		donor-derived transmission can occur. Routine screening pre-transplant and
		antifungal prophylaxis for cryptococcosis post-transplant in solid organ
		transplantation are not standard practice. We present two cases of very
		early-onset Cryptococcus neoformans disease following liver transplantation to
		highlight the need to consider individualized pre-transplant screening and be
		aware that reactivation of Cryptococcosis neoformans can occur in the immediate
		post-transplant period.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To illustrate three different ophthalmic presentations of cryptococcal
		meningitis (CM). INTRODUCTION: CM is the most common manifestation of
		extra-pulmonary cryptococcosis. Intracranial hypertension occurs in up to 75% of
		patients with CM and is associated with increased mortality. CM can present to
		"the ophthalmologist as vision loss, papilledema, abducens palsy, and/or other"
		"cranial neuropathies. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: We report three cases, two C."
		"neoformans and one C. gattii, highlighting the various CM presentations. The"
		first was a woman immunosuppressed following kidney transplantation in whom
		idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) was initially suspected. The second
		was a man immunocompromised by previously undiagnosed HIV/AIDS who presented with
		signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. The third case is an
		immunocompetent man with bilateral disc edema and an incomplete macular star
		diagnosed with presumed neuroretinitis. Further evaluation revealed positive CSF
		cryptococcal antigen with culture positive for C. gattii. CONCLUSIONS:
		Ophthalmologists should be aware that cryptococcosis can mimic more benign
		"etiologies including IIH and neuroretinitis. Additionally, C. gattii, an emerging"
		"organism, can infect immunocompetent patients. In contrast to the typical"
		"treatment of increased ICP, serial lumbar punctures are recommended while"
		acetazolamide and surgical CSF shunting may be harmful.

AB	-	Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii are environmental fungi that can
		"cause fever, cough, pneumonia, meningoencephalitis, dissemination, and death. C."
		gattii causes cryptococcomas more frequently than does C. neoformans and may
		require prolonged antifungal treatment. We present a rare case of C. gattii
		"pneumonia in a renal transplant patient. A 44-year-old man, living in a rural"
		"area endemic for C. gattii and who had received a kidney transplant, was admitted"
		"to the hospital with fever, vomiting, weight loss, and diarrhea. A chest computed"
		"tomography revealed 2 alveolar, nodular, subpleural infiltrates in the periphery"
		"of the lungs. Differential diagnoses included infectious infiltrates,"
		"granulomatosis, embolization, and hemorrhage. C. gattii, molecular type VGI, was"
		confirmed on day 28. Treatment consisted of amphotericin B at 1 mg/kg/day or
		"fluconazole at 800 mg/day for first 6 weeks, followed by fluconazole at 400"
		mg/day for the subsequent 12 months. Response to the therapy has been slow.
		Because of the occurrence of outbreaks and its high morbidity and mortality
		"rates, physicians must be aware of this complication in transplant recipients to"
		avoid delays in diagnosis and to provide prompt management.

		recipients.
PG	-	1550-4
AB	-	Cryptococcosis is a significant infection with a high mortality in solid-organ
		"transplant recipients. Nonetheless, the pathogenesis of this disease is poorly"
		understood. It has been hypothesized that cryptococcosis may result from either
		primary infection or reactivation of a latent infection. Sera were obtained from
		transplant recipients prior to transplantation and at the time they developed
		cryptococcosis. Control sera were obtained before and after transplant from
		patients who did not develop cryptococcosis. Sera were tested for antibodies
		against Cryptococcus neoformans by using an immunoblot assay. Antibody responses
		were also compared with those observed in sera from rats with experimental
		"pulmonary cryptococcosis. In all, 52% of the transplant recipients who developed"
		cryptococcosis exhibited serologic evidence of cryptococcal infection before
		transplantation. These patients developed cryptococcosis significantly earlier
		after transplant than patients without preexisting reactivity did (5.6 +/- 3.4
		"months compared to 40.6 +/- 63.8 months, respectively [P = 0.0011]). The results"
		from our study suggest that a substantial proportion of transplant-associated
		cryptococcosis cases result from the reactivation of a latent infection. These
		findings also highlight the potential utility of serologic studies in identifying
		patients at risk for the development of cryptococcosis after transplantation.

TI	-	Cryptococcal liver abscess: a case report of successful treatment with
		amphotericin-B and literature review.
PG	-	59-60
AB	-	Cryptococcus neoformans usually involves the central nervous system and the
		respiratory tract. We report a case of disseminated cryptococcosis with a liver
		abscess and meningoencephalitis in a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome.
		Computed tomography of the abdomen showed a 3-cm low-attenuated lesion in the
		"left lobe of liver. Cultures from specimens of blood, the liver abscess, and the"
		cerebrospinal fluid all yielded C. neoformans. The cryptococcal antigen titers
		for the serum and cerebral fluid were both 1:32. The patient was successfully
		"treated with 1,335 mg of amphotericin-B followed by fluconazole. Most"
		"cryptococcal liver infections present as hepatitis, cholangitis, or"
		microabscesses.

		soldier.
PG	-	e1059-61

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcus neoformans is an encapsulated yeast that commonly causes
		disease in individuals in the setting of immunocompromised states. It is rarely
		reported in immunocompetent patients in the literature. HIGHLIGHT OF A REPORT: An
		active duty service member with no significant medical history presented with
		"persistent headache, nausea, vomiting, weight loss, and nocturnal fevers for 2"
		months. The patient was admitted to the hospital where a lumbar puncture was
		"performed showing an elevated white blood cell count, low glucose, and elevated"
		protein. Subsequent cerebral spinal fluid analysis yielded cryptococcal antigen
		latex screen and culture which speciated C. neoformans. The patient received
		"fluconazole and flucytosine, and completed a 10-week course to result in a full"
		recovery. CONCLUSION: C. neoformans is found throughout the world in soil
		contaminated with bird droppings and usually causes infection and disease in
		individuals who are immunosuppressed. Rare case reports exist where C. neoformans
		causes central nervous infection in immunocompetent hosts. This fungal etiology
		should be considered in all patients presenting with meningitis symptoms and a
		"cerebral spinal fluid panel with low glucose and high protein, or without a clear"
		bacterial etiology. This case illustrates the importance of broadening the
		differential when previously healthy service members present with common or
		nonspecific symptoms.

TI	-	Cryptococcal lymphadenitis as a manifestation of immune reconstitution
		inflammatory syndrome in an HIV-positive patient: a case report and review of the
		literature.
PG	-	751-6
AB	-	Cryptococcus neoformans infections are typically associated with T-cell
		"deficiencies, including acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Although"
		highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has strongly reduced AIDS-related
		"opportunistic infections, the restoration and reactivation of CD4+ cells can"
		"induce an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), consisting in a"
		deregulated inflammatory response to latent infectious pathogens and/or to their
		residual antigens. Cryptococcal lymphadenitis has occasionally been documented in
		IRIS. Here we report a case of histology- and culture-negative cryptococcal
		lymphadenitis associated with IRIS in an adult AIDS patient with a history of
		"disseminated cryptococcosis, after the start of fully adherent HAART. Appropriate"
		diagnosis was established on nested-PCR and sequence analysis of the interspacer
		"region 2 of C. neoformans ribosomal DNA, and detection of slow-growing"
		blastospores in enrichment cultures of fine-needle lymph node aspirate. Review of
		recent literature and our case findings suggest that IRIS-associated cryptococcal
		lymphadenitis is more likely the flare up of a latent infection rather than an
		immunopathological response to residual antigen of unviable cryptococci.

TI	-	Cryptococcal infection in a cohort of HIV-1-infected Ugandan adults.
PG	-	1031-8
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: Despite the recognition of Cryptococcus neoformans as a major cause of
		"meningitis in HIV-infected adults in sub-Saharan Africa, little is known about"
		the relative importance of this potentially preventable infection as a cause of
		mortality and suffering in HIV-infected adults in this region. DESIGN: A cohort
		"study of 1372 HIV-1-infected adults, enrolled and followed up between October"
		"1995 and January 1999 at two community clinics in Entebbe, Uganda. METHODS:"
		Systematic and standardized assessment of illness episodes to describe
		cryptococcal disease and death rates. RESULTS: Cryptococcal disease was diagnosed
		in 77 individuals (rate 40.4/1000 person-years) and was associated with 17% of
		all deaths (77 out of 444) in the cohort. Risk of infection was strongly
		associated with CD4 T cell counts < 200 x 10(6) cells/l(75 patients) and World
		Health Organization (WHO) clinical stage 3 and 4 (68 patients). Meningism was
		present infrequently on presentation (18%). Clinical findings had limited
		discriminatory diagnostic value. Serum cryptococcal antigen testing was the most
		sensitive and robust diagnostic test. Cryptococcal antigenaemia preceded symptoms
		by a median of 22 days (> 100 days in 11% of patients). Survival following
		diagnosis was poor (median survival 26 days; range 0-138). CONCLUSIONS:
		Cryptococcal infection is an important contributor to mortality and suffering in
		HIV-infected Ugandans. Improvements in access to effective therapy of established
		"disease are necessary. In addition, prevention strategies, in particular"
		"chemoprophylaxis, should be evaluated while awaiting the outcome of initiatives"
		to make antiretroviral therapy more widely available.

AB	-	Cryptococcosis is an invasive fungal infection that mainly affects the lungs and
		central nervous system. While patients with cell-mediated immunodeficiency are at
		"high risk of developing cryptococcosis, there have been increasing reports of"
		cryptococcosis in immunocompetent individuals with no underlying conditions.
		"Herein, we report a case of cryptococcal meningitis in a 55-year-old apparently"
		immunocompetent man with a history of heavy alcohol consumption. Although the
		patient was initially treated for tuberculous meningitis and varicella-zoster
		virus induced vasculopathy due to a history of exposure to tuberculosis and a
		"presence of stroke, a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay of"
		"cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) identified Cryptococcus species unexpectedly, enabling"
		"swift treatment and a favorable clinical outcome. The multiplex PCR assay, which"
		"can identify multiple pathogens simultaneously and instantly, may lead to early"
		"diagnosis and treatment by detecting unanticipated pathogens. Furthermore, the"
		strain was identified through multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis as
		"Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii, Sequence Type 5, molecular type: VNI."
		Although simplified microbial identification techniques such as mass spectrometry
		"have recently been developed, molecular biological assays are still essential for"
		the accurate identification of infectious strains.

AB	-	We retrospectively carried out a descriptive and prognostic study of 76 human
		immunodeficiency virus-infected patients with cryptococcosis diagnosed by a
		"positive culture of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood, urine, or other body fluid"
		or tissue. We focused on the 65 patients with cryptococcal meningitis. At

		"67%, headache; 37%, stiff neck; 29%, altered mentation or confusion; 20% cranial"
		"nerve deficiency; and 48%, other focal deficiencies. Analysis of CSF specimens"
		"revealed the following results: normal (25% of the specimens), leukocyte count of"
		"< 20/mm3 (62%), positive India ink smear (87%), and positive cryptococcal antigen"
		"(92%). Twenty patients died within the first 3 months (3-month survival rate,"
		70%). A Cox regression model selected the following as prognostic parameters: age
		"older than 30 years (relative risk [RR] = 2.1), CSF glucose level of < 2 mmol/L"
		"(RR = 3.7), previous admission to an intensive care unit (RR = 4.7), and"
		mechanical ventilation (RR = 4.6). The outcome of cryptococcal meningitis in
		"patients with AIDS remains difficult to predict at admission, and every case"
		should be considered as potentially severe.

AB	-	Cryptococcus neoformans is an important cause of morbidity in HIV-infected
		"patients worldwide. In the northern region of Brazil, the prevalence of this"
		infection is poorly known due to a lack of systematic investigations. This study
		aimed to determine the occurrence of cryptococcosis by detecting antigenaemia in
		"HIV-infected patients in the State of Para, Brazil. A latex Cryptococcus antigen"
		detection kit was used to test 418 serum samples from HIV-infected patients seen
		at two Infectious Disease Specialized Units in the State of Para. The C.
		"neoformans antigenaemia prevalence was 2.6%, and titres reached 1:8. The cases"
		"occurred mainly in asymptomatic females, and 45% presented CD4(+) T lymphocyte"
		counts of fewer than 200 cells/mm(3). These results show the importance of early
		C. neoformans antigenaemia detection to prevent fungal disease.

TI	-	Cryptococcal pleuritis with pleural effusion as the only clinical presentation in
		a patient with hepatic cirrhosis: A case report and literature review.
PG	-	e16354

LID	-	e16354
AB	-	RATIONALE: Cryptococcosis is a significant life-threatening fungal infection in
		"worldwide, mainly reported in immunocompromised patients. Pleural effusion"
		presentation of cryptococcal infection as the only clinical presentation is
		"rarely seen in pulmonary cryptococcosis, which may lead to be misdiagnosed, and"
		the study on this subject will provide further insights. PATIENT CONCERNS: A
		64-year-old man was hospitalized in our department and diagnosed as hepatic B
		cirrhosis. A computed tomography (CT) of the thorax showed a massive right
		pleural effusion without pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities. He was started on
		"empirical treatment for pleural tuberculosis (TB). However, during his"
		"hospitalization, a right pleural effusion developed and fever was not controlled."
		"DIAGNOSES: On day 14 admission, pleural fluid cultured positive for Cryptococcus"
		neoformans. The C neoformans isolate belonged to ST5 and molecular type VNI (var.
		"grubii). INTERVENTIONS: The patient was diagnosed with cryptococcal pleuritis,"
		"then amphotericin B and fluconazole were administrated. OUTCOMES: Finally, the"
		patient was improved and discharged from our hospital. LESSONS: Similar cases in
		cryptococcal pleuritis patients with pleural effusion as the only clinical
		"presentation in the literature are also reviewed. Through literature review, we"
		recommend that pleural effusion cryptococcal antigen test should be used to
		diagnose cryptococcal pleuritis to reduce misdiagnosis. The early administration
		of antifungal drug with activity to Cryptococcus seemed beneficial in preventing
		dissemination of cryptococcosis.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcosis is a severe universally distributed mycosis which
		mainly affects immunocompromised hosts. This mycosis is caused by yeasts of two
		species complex of the genus Cryptococcus: Cryptococcus neoformans and
		Cryptococcus gattii. Meningeal cryptococcosis is the most frequent clinical
		presentation of this disseminated mycosis. The oral mucosa involvement is
		extremely unusual. CASE REPORT: We present a case of cryptococcosis with an
		unusual clinical form. The patient was assisted because she had an ulcerated
		lesion on the lingual mucosa. Encapsulated yeasts compatible with Cryptococcus
		were found in microscopic exams of wet preparations from lingual ulcer clinical
		samples obtained for cytodiagnosis and mycological studies. Cryptococcus
		neoformans (C. neoformans var. grubii VNI) was isolated in culture. This patient
		did not know her condition of HIV seropositive before the appearance of the
		tongue lesion. CONCLUSIONS: The involvement of the oral mucosa is uncommon in
		"this fungal infection, but is important to include it in the differential"
		diagnosis in HIV positive patients.

PG	-	e760-6
LID	-	10.1111/j.1439-0507.2011.02018.x [doi]
AB	-	We conducted a retrospective study of 58 cases of cryptococcosis (1986-2008) with
		"urine test positive for Cryptococcus sp, in Mycology Laboratory, Santa"
		"Casa-Hospital Complex, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil. The diagnosis of cryptococcuria"
		was based on microscopic examination and culture of urinary sediment.
		"Cryptococcus was isolated from other clinical specimens such as blood,"
		"cerebrospinal fluid, ascitic and pleural fluids, respiratory secretions, biopsies"
		"of skin, nasal and bone marrow. Cryptocccus neoformans was present in 55 cases"
		and Cryptocccus gattii in three cases. Males predominated (79.3%); age ranged
		from 12 to 86 years. Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) were present in
		"60.3%, 31.1% did not have AIDS and 5.2% were apparently immunocompetent patients."
		The most frequent signs and symptoms were headache (53.4%) and fever (51.7%). The
		most widely used medication was the amphotericin B (43 patients). The mortality
		rate was 45%. We conclude that the mycological examination of the urine can be an
		"alternative simple, non-invasive and useful in diagnosis of disseminated"
		"cryptococcosis, especially when used in conjunction with techniques for"
		demonstration of the capsule (nigrosine) and/or production of melanin in special
		culture media (Staib agar).

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcosis is a common opportunistic infection in patients
		infected by Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and is the second leading cause of
		mortality in Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) patients worldwide. The
		"most frequent presentation of cryptococcal infection is subacute meningitis,"
		especially in patients with a CD4+ T Lymphocytes count below 100 cells/μL.
		"However, in severely immunosuppressed individuals Cryptococcus neoformans can"
		"infect virtually any human organ, including the bone marrow, which is a rare"
		presentation of cryptococcosis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 45-year-old HIV-infected
		male patient with a CD4+ T lymphocyte count of 26 cells/μL who presented to the
		emergency department with fever and pancytopenia. Throughout the diagnostic
		"evaluation, the bone marrow aspirate culture yielded encapsulated yeasts in"
		"budding, identified as Cryptococcus sp. The bone marrow biopsy revealed a"
		hypocellularity for age and absence of fibrosis. It was observed presence of
		loosely formed granuloma composed of multinucleated giant cells encompassing
		"rounded yeast like organisms stained with mucicarmine, compatible with"
		"Cryptococcus sp. Then, the patient underwent a lumbar puncture to investigate"
		"meningitis, although he had no neurological symptoms and neurological examination"
		was normal. The cerebrospinal fluid culture yielded Cryptococcus sp. The species
		and genotype identification step showed the infection was caused by Cryptococcus
		neoformans var. grubii (genotype VNI). The patient was initially treated with
		"amphotericin B deoxycholate plus fluconazole for disseminated cryptococcosis,"
		"according to guideline recommendations. However, the patient developed acute"
		kidney injury and the treatment was switched for fluconazole monotherapy. The
		symptoms disappeared completely with recovery of white blood cells and platelets
		counts. Cerebrospinal fluid cultures for fungi at one and two-weeks of treatment
		were negative. CONCLUSIONS: Bone marrow infection caused by Cryptococcus
		neoformans is a rare presentation of cryptococcosis. The cryptococcal infection
		should be included for differential diagnosis in HIV-infected patients with fever
		"and cytopenias, especially when CD4+ T lymphocytes count is below 100 cells/μL."

		an immunocompetent host.
PG	-	29-32
AB	-	Primary cutaneous cryptococcal infection is uncommon. The cutaneous
		manifestations are most often the result of dissemination from the central
		"nervous system or lung, usually in an immunocompromised host; cellulitis is"
		regarded as the rarest cutaneous form. Primary cutaneous cryptococcosis has
		"occasionally been reported in the immunocompetent, the causative organism being"
		Cryptococcus neoformans var. neoformans. We present a case of cellulitis of the
		"right arm in a 75-year-old man caused by Cryptococcus neoformans var. gattii, a"
		fungus which is endemic in Australia and an important cause of infection in the
		immunocompetent. This is the first case described of a primary cutaneous
		infection due to Cryptococcus neoformans var. gattii. The interesting ecology of
		this organism is discussed.

AB	-	Cryptococcus neoformans is an encapsulated yeast which causes opportunistic
		"infection in the context of immunosuppression, including advanced HIV infection."
		Cryptococcal infection is systemic and can result in a fatal meningoencephalitis.
		Cutaneous lesions occur in 15% of those with systemic cryptococcosis and may be
		the first indicator of infection. Identification of these lesions may therefore
		expedite diagnosis and access to treatment. Cutaneous lesions typically present
		"as papulonodular molluscum-like lesions; however, may vary significantly in"
		appearance. We describe a rare case of extraneuronal cryptococcal infection
		manifesting as large subcutaneous tumours in a patient with advanced HIV-related
		immune deficiency.

AB	-	Cryptococcal infection (CI) is an uncommon fungal disease that poses a particular
		fatal risk to liver transplant (LT) recipients because of the potential rapid
		"development and dissemination of the disease. Depending on the pathophysiology,"
		CI may manifest with a wide range of clinical presentations that may delay early
		"diagnosis and timely treatment. Additionally, most anticryptococcal therapies may"
		threaten LT recipients owing to the associated hepatotoxicity of these
		medications. We report a case of a 25-year-old woman who received an LT for
		"cryptogenic cirrhosis and developed rapidly progressive CI with pulmonary,"
		"myocardial, and cerebral involvement within a month of transplantation."
		She presented with severe pulmonary hypertension refractory to medical management
		"and subsequently died despite our efforts. Herein, we review the etiology of"
		"cryptococcosis, the natural history of cryptococcal disease, and standard"
		"treatments for CI, and we highlight peculiarities of Cryptococcus neoformans"
		infection in solid organ transplant recipients.

AB	-	Background: Cryptococcal pneumonia is an uncommon lesion in immune-competent
		adults. Histological evidence of Cryptococcus neoformans is a gold criterion for
		diagnosis. Here we report a case firstly misdiagnosed as tuberculosis from a lung
		biopsy. Methods: Chest computed tomography (CT) scan and CT-guided puncture were
		performed for diagnosis and blood tests explored for the latent etiology.
		Results: Chest CT scan images showed multiple nodules in the left peripheral
		lower lobe. Histopathology demonstrated multiple granulomatous inflammatory
		"response lacking evidence of Cryptococcus neoformans, acid-fast staining was"
		"negative, serum cryptococcal antigen was positive. Conclusions: Serum"
		cryptococcal antigen has high specificity in cryptococcal pneumonia.

AB	-	Cryptococcosis is frequently associated to the immune reconstitution inflammatory
		syndrome (IRIS) in AIDS patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).
		This study aimed to evaluate clinical and evolutive features of IRIS associated
		"cryptococcosis patients in Uberaba, Brazil. PATIENTS: Eighty-one AIDS individuals"
		admitted at the teaching hospital with cryptococcal meningitis were evaluated and
		"from these, 40 were prospectively followed. Of 40 patients with cryptococcosis,"
		nine (22.5%) presented clinical and laboratory features of IRIS. Six (66.6%) were
		"male, with a mean age of 37.2. Five (55.5%) presented cryptococcosis as first"
		AIDS defining condition. In seven (77.9%) IRIS was characterised as a relapse of
		"meningeal symptoms after 10 weeks, mean time of 72 days, of starting HAART"
		"whereas, two asymptomatic patients developed the syndrome as an unmasked"
		cryptococcosis after 10 and 12 weeks on HAART. Lymphadenitis as isolated finding
		associated with IRIS was evidenced in three cases. All patients presented low
		CD4(+) and high RNA viral load baseline values. Cultures of cerebrospinal fluid
		and lymph-node fragments tissues of these cases were negative. Six of nine
		individuals developed high intracranial pressure requiring a daily relief lumbar
		puncture. No deaths occurred during the evolution of these patients. The
		incidence and clinical evolutive profile observed in this case series are in
		accordance with other reports elsewhere.

AB	-	Cryptococcus neoformans is an important pathogen that can cause severe illness
		and mortality in immunocompromised patients. We highlight here the case of a
		"53-year-old man presenting to hospital 4 years postliver transplant with fever,"
		acute renal failure and a medial thigh lesion. Initially treated as bacterial
		"sepsis, the patient failed to improve on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Further"
		investigations revealed disseminated cryptococcemia complicated by patellar
		"osteomyelitis and an intramuscular abscess. Unfortunately, although the patient"
		initially showed signs of clinical improvement after starting standard antifungal
		"agents, he deteriorated and died secondary to acute renal failure. Osteomyelitis"
		is a rare manifestation of cryptococcal infection for which there is often a
		significant delay to diagnosis and treatment. This is the fourth reported case of
		cryptococcal osteomyelitis in a liver transplant patient and underlines the
		importance of considering fungal infections in the differential diagnosis of
		osseous lesions in solid organ transplant and other immunocompromised patients.

AB	-	CASE: We describe a case of cryptococcal osteomyelitis in a 70-year-old man who
		presented with left elbow and shoulder pain. Subsequent imaging indicated
		"osteomyelitis of the entire humerus, and he underwent debridement of the elbow"
		and shoulder. Pathological findings revealed Cryptococcus neoformans infection.
		Surgical management was followed by a prolonged course of antibiotics.
		CONCLUSION: Although C. neoformans is rare as the etiology of infection of the
		"entire humerus, orthopaedic surgeons should consider cryptococcosis as a"
		potential cause of infection.

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To educate healthcare providers on Cryptococcus neoformans as a novel
		cause of glottic webs especially in an immunocompromised patient and discuss
		recurrence of the glottic web. This case also emphasizes the importance of a
		"comprehensive patient evaluation in cases such as this, as laryngeal involvement"
		in this case was only a portion of the patient's disease burden. METHODS: An
		extensive review of the patient's clinical course was assessed including patient
		"presentation, diagnostic techniques, medical and surgical treatment, and"
		complications. RESULTS: Prolonged Fluconazole therapy and two excisions of the
		"glottic web, the second with keel placement, was an effective treatment course"
		"for our patient. CONCLUSION: Cryptococcal glottic webs are rare, and this case"
		report demonstrates successful treatment in one such case with operative
		intervention following medical management of disseminated disease.

TI	-	Two cases of cutaneous cryptococcosis.
PG	-	238-41
AB	-	We report two cases of cutaneous cryptococcosis in male patients without
		"underlying disease. Case 1 had a granulomatous mass on his right neck, gradually"
		"enlarging for 3 months. After the mass was debrided surgically in a hospital, the"
		incision wound gradually developed into a severe ulceration. Mycological
		examination revealed Cryptococcus neoformans infection. It was significant that
		histopathology of both pre-surgery granuloma and post-surgery ulceration revealed
		thick-walled spores with thick capsule. Chest X-ray revealed a shadow in the left
		"lower lung. After treatment with amphotec for 21 days, the lesion healed. Case 2"
		"had an approximately 2 x 2 cm solitary dull nodule on his right thigh, which had"
		been present for 8 months. Mycological examination confirmed that the lesion was
		caused by C. neoformans. The patient's ratio of peripheral blood CD4(+) cell was
		"slightly reduced. After 14 days of treatment with oral fluconazole, followed by"
		"oral itraconazole for 2 months, mycological and clinical cure were achieved. The"
		two isolates were identified as C. neoformans var. gattii serotype C and C.
		neoformans var. grubii serotype A.

TI	-	Cutaneous cryptococcosis with molluscum contagiosum coinfection in a patient with
		acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
PG	-	88-90
AB	-	We report the first patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in whom
		molluscum contagiosum and Cryptococcus neoformans were documented in the same
		cutaneous lesion. While cases of the co-occurrence of two pathologic entities in
		"patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome have been reported, namely"
		cytomegalovirus with herpes simplex virus and Kaposi's sarcoma with Histoplasma
		"capsulatum, the findings in this patient are unique. The clinical presentation of"
		cutaneous lesions caused by molluscum contagiosum and by Cryptococcus neoformans
		is reviewed. The findings in this case are more remarkable still given the
		often-noted tendency of cutaneous cryptococcosis to masquerade as molluscum
		contagiosum. It may be that the lesions of molluscum contagiosum create a
		favorable environment for cryptococcal dissemination. Examination of a biopsy
		"specimen is crucial to the diagnosis of skin lesions, often atypical or"
		"deceptive, in immunosuppressed patients."

LID	-	13030/qt2hs2s4nb [pii]
AB	-	Cryptococcus neoformans is a common fungus found throughout the environment that
		causes opportunistic disease in immunocompromised individuals. Infection of
		humans with C neoformans usually manifests as lung disease through inhalation of
		spores or meningoencephalitis by involvement of the central nervous system.
		"Rarely, dissemination in the form of cutaneous lesions can occur in individuals"
		with long term immunosuppression. We present a patient with C. neoformans
		manifesting as cellulitis with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis treated with
		corticosteroids. Because of the mortality associated with disseminated
		"cryptococcosis, early identification, especially of atypical cutaneous"
		presentations is critical from a dermatological perspective.

AB	-	RATIONALE: Aspergillus and Cryptococcus exposure can cause serious secondary
		"infections in human lungs, especially in immunocompromised patients or in"
		conjunction with a chronic disease caused by low disease resistance. Primary
		"invasive fungal infections are clinically rare; therefore, coexistence of 2 fungi"
		at an infection site is uncommon. This paper reports a case of healthy male who
		was diagnosed with both Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus infections.
		PATIENT CONCERNS: A healthy 33-year-old male office worker was admitted to the
		Second Hospital of Jilin University for hemoptysis. A chest computed tomography
		"(CT) scan showed a cavity, which was formed by the thick dorsal wall of the lower"
		left lobe with an irregular inner wall and burr changes around the lesion.
		"INTERVENTION: After 1.0 week of antibiotic and antituberculosis treatment, the"
		hemoptysis symptoms remained. A resection of the left lower lobe was performed.
		DIAGNOSES: The postoperative pathological reports indicated the presence of both
		Aspergillus and Cryptococcus. The 2 fungal lesions were separate but within the
		"same location. OUTCOMES: After treatment, the patient no longer had hemoptysis."
		LESSONS: The current study indicated that fungi can infect not only
		"immunocompromised patients but also healthy people, and that there can be 2"
		separate fungal infections at the same infection site.

PG	-	680-5
LID	-	10.3855/jidc.2622 [doi]
AB	-	Cryptococcosis is a potentially fatal fungal disease caused by variants of
		Cryptococcus neoformans species.  The respiratory tract is the usual portal of
		"entry, with a peculiar predilection to invade the central nervous system.  The"
		skin can be secondarily involved in disseminated infection or be exceptionally
		involved as primary cutaneous infection by inoculation.  The disease is mostly
		seen in immunodeficiency states.  The diagnosis is frequently unsuspected in
		immunocompetent patients. We report a case of disseminated cryptococcal
		meningitis in an immunocompetent young adult. The cutaneous eruption prompted the
		"accurate diagnosis.  The patient, a 20-year-old female, had fever, cough,"
		headache and intractable vomiting for the past two months and was being managed
		as a case of tuberculous meningitis. Two weeks after starting antituberculous
		treatment she developed umbilicated papules on the head and neck region.
		Necessary laboratory workup identified C. neoformans in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
		and skin specimens.  The titers of cryptococcal antigen were measured in CSF and
		serum for diagnostic and prognostic purposes.  Anti-fungal treatment resulted in
		regression of the cutaneous lesions and resolution of systemic complaints. The
		"case highlights the need for high degree of suspicion, especially in healthy"
		"young adults, in the diagnosis of cryptococcosis. The cutaneous eruptions can be"
		the first manifestation or a diagnostic clue of enormous significance.

TI	-	Cryptococcaemia: clinical features and prognostic factors.
PG	-	511-8
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Limited data are available on the clinical significance of
		"cryptococcaemia, which occurs in 10-30% of patients with cryptococcal diseases."
		AIM: To describe the clinical features of cryptococcaemia and identify its
		prognostic factors. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: All adult
		patients with Cryptococcus neoformans isolated from blood culture at the National
		"Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, 1981-2001, were included. Demographic and"
		clinical information was obtained from medical records. RESULTS: Fifty-two
		patients were diagnosed and treated for cryptococcaemia. Acquired
		"immunodeficiency syndrome (24/52, 46%), immunosuppressive therapy (12/52, 23%)"
		"and decompensated liver cirrhosis (11/52, 21%) were the three major predisposing"
		"conditions. Forty-two patients (81%, n=52) had sepsis, including four patients"
		"with septic shock, when blood cultures were obtained. Of the 38 patients in whom"
		"lumbar puncture was done, cerebrospinal fluid culture showed meningeal"
		"involvement in 32 (84%). The 30-day fatality rate was 37%. Liver cirrhosis,"
		"septic shock at presentation, an initial APACHE II score >/=20, age >/=60 years"
		and female gender were associated with mortality under univariate analysis.
		Starting antifungal therapy within 48 h after blood culture was associated with
		"improved survival. Under multivariate analysis, liver cirrhosis remained a strong"
		"independent predictor of mortality at 30 days after blood culture (HR 16.3, 95%CI"
		"2.6-101.7, p=0.003). DISCUSSION: Patients with cryptococcaemia have a high risk"
		of mortality within 30 days. Sepsis and meningeal involvement are common. Those
		with liver cirrhosis have a particularly poor prognosis.

AB	-	"The present study was carried out in two different areas of Province of Cordoba,"
		"Argentina, where there was a suspicious of endemic mycosis. The previous data"
		were the presence of a clinical case of pulmonary cryptococcosis in one area
		(Alta Gracia) and the previous findings of a high incidence of coccidioidin and

		the absence of underlying disease.
PG	-	199
LID	-	10.1186/1471-2334-10-199 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Most cases of cryptococcal meningitis occur in patients with HIV
		infection: the course and outcome of disease in the apparently immunocompetent is
		much more poorly understood. We describe a cohort of HIV uninfected Vietnamese
		"patients with cryptococcal meningitis in whom underlying disease is uncommon, and"
		relate presenting features of patients and the characteristics of the infecting
		species to outcome. METHODS: A prospective descriptive study of HIV negative
		patients with cryptococcal meningitis based at the Hospital for Tropical
		"Diseases, Ho Chi Minh City. All patients had comprehensive clinical assessment at"
		"baseline, were cared for by a dedicated study team, and were followed up for 2"
		years. Clinical presentation was compared by infecting isolate and outcome.
		RESULTS: 57 patients were studied. Cryptococcus neoformans var grubii molecular
		type VN1 caused 70% of infections; C. gattii accounted for the rest. Most
		"patients did not have underlying disease (81%), and the rate of underlying"
		disease did not differ by infecting species. 11 patients died while in-patients
		(19.3%). Independent predictors of death were age > or = 60 years and a history
		"of convulsions (odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals 8.7 (1 - 76), and 16.1"
		"(1.6 - 161) respectively). Residual visual impairment was common, affecting 25 of"
		46 survivors (54.3%). Infecting species did not influence clinical phenotype or
		outcome. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of flucytosine and amphotericin B
		were significantly higher for C. neoformans var grubii compared with C. gattii (p
		< 0.001 and p = 0.01 respectively). CONCLUSION: In HIV uninfected individuals in
		"Vietnam, cryptococcal meningitis occurs predominantly in people with no clear"
		predisposing factor and is most commonly due to C. neoformans var grubii. The
		rates of mortality and visual loss are high and independent of infecting species.
		There are detectable differences in susceptibility to commonly used antifungal
		"drugs between species, but the clinical significance of this is not clear."

TI	-	A case of pulmonary cryptococcosis by capsule-deficient Cryptococcus neoformans.
PG	-	83-7
AB	-	Pulmonary infection by capsule-deficient Cryptococcus neoformans (CDCN) is a very
		rare form of pneumonia and it is seldom seen in the immunocompetent host. The
		authors experienced a case of pulmonary cryptococcosis by CDCN in 25-year-old
		woman who was without any significant underlying disease. The diagnosis was made
		"from the percutaneous lung biopsy and special tissue staining, including"
		Fontana-Masson silver (FMS) staining. Fungal culture confirmed the diagnosis
		afterward. Her clinical and radiologic features improved under treatment with
		fluconazol. It's known that CDCN is not so readily confirmed because fungal
		culture does not always result in growth of the organism and the empirical fungal
		stain is not helpful for the differentiation between CDCN and the other
		infections that are caused by the nonencapsulated yeast-like organisms. In this
		"report, we emphasize the diagnostic value of performing FMS staining for"
		differentiating a CDCN infection from the other confusing nonencapsulated
		yeast-like organisms.

TI	-	Sarcoidosis with cryptococcal infection apparently engaging only
		immune-privileged body compartments: a case report.
PG	-	440
LID	-	10.1186/s12879-020-05174-5 [doi]
LID	-	440
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Infection with the Cryptococcus neoformans yeast fungus is largely
		"restricted to patients with HIV, sarcoidosis or immunosuppressive therapies. In"
		"sarcoidosis, there is intense local immune response in granuloma lesions, coupled"
		with a paradoxical systemic anergy. An analysis of cryptococcal infection in
		sarcoidosis may therefore shed light on whether opportunistic pathogens
		preferentially engage immune-privileged tissues. CASE PRESENTATION: A 54-year-old
		man was admitted to our hospital after 2 months with palpitations and
		"activity-related presyncope. A chest X-ray was normal, electrocardiography showed"
		"type-II atrioventricular-block, and there was a tentative diagnosis of"
		myocarditis. Computed tomography reported minor hilar lymph glands and multiple
		nodular lesions in the lungs. Magnetic resonance imaging showed oedema and
		"nodular structures in the heart, and fibrosis and granulomas were found in"
		"endomyocardial biopsies. The diagnosis was revised to cardiac sarcoidosis, and"
		"prednisone was initiated. In parallel, positron-emission tomography had revealed"
		"a marked uptake in the right thyroid lobe, a thyroid lobectomy was then"
		"performed, and the pathology showed a BRAF-positive papillary thyroid carcinoma."
		Four days postoperatively the patient developed symptoms suggestive of
		meningoencephalitis. Cerebrospinal fluid and blood cultures yielded growth of C.
		neoformans. Fungal staining of the thyroid specimen revealed cryptococcal
		"elements in the carcinoma and in granulomas close to the tumour. Notably, there"
		was no evidence of cryptococci in the heart sarcoid sections or in the normal
		thyroid parenchyma. The patient was successfully treated with antifungal agents
		and at the 2-year follow-up there was no evidence of thyroid cancer relapse.
		CONCLUSION: This sarcoidosis patient had a remarkable clinic with evidence of
		cryptococcal infection only in body compartments commonly regarded to be
		immune-privileged. The findings suggest that an opportunistic and environmentally
		"abundant pathogen, when infecting an immunocompromised host, primarily engages"
		"immunodeficient locations such as the brain, a tumour microenvironment and some"
		forms of granuloma.

AB	-	Infections caused by emerging Cryptococcus non-neoformans species are being
		"reported with increasingly frequency. Here, we present a case of fungaemia by"
		Cryptococcus laurentii in a woman receiving aggressive immunosuppressive therapy
		for cervical neoplasia. Three venous blood samples were aseptically collected on

		"antifungal therapy, the patient showed significant improvement and blood culture"
		"became negative. Thus, patients following immunosuppressive therapies and using"
		invasive medical devices are at risk of C. laurentii blood infections.

TI	-	Manifestations of pulmonary cryptococcosis in patients with acquired
		immunodeficiency syndrome.
PG	-	64-7
AB	-	Cryptococcosis is a common opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS.
		Meningitis is the most frequent manifestation of infection with Cryptococcus
		"neoformans; pneumonia due to this organism, though less frequently recognized, is"
		also a significant entity. A retrospective review was performed of all patients
		seen at Duke University Medical Center between January 1981 and July 1989 who
		were infected with both human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and C. neoformans. Of
		"31 patients with these concomitant infections, 12 had cryptococcal pneumonia (10"
		definite and two presumptive cases). Eleven of these 12 patients had evidence of
		extrapulmonary cryptococcal disease as well. Chest radiography showed
		"interstitial infiltrates in 11 instances. For ten of the 12 patients, pulmonary"
		cultures were positive for C. neoformans. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from all
		five patients who underwent bronchoscopy yielded the organism. Acute-phase
		mortality from cryptococcosis was 42% among patients with pneumonia. Cryptococcal
		pneumonia in patients with AIDS is probably more common than has previously been
		recognized and typically presents as interstitial disease that may mimic other
		opportunistic infections.

AB	-	A case of an 82-year-old female with primary laryngeal cryptococcosis who had
		undergone long-term corticosteroid therapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary
		disease and rheumatoid arthritis is reported. She complained hoarseness with
		swallowing pain and irritability of the larynx for over a month. Endoscopic
		"examination revealed a white, exudative irregular region on right arytenoid that"
		mimicked a laryngeal carcinoma. Histological examination showed
		pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia and severe submucosal inflammation with ovoid
		budding yeasts by Grocott's stain. A serological study indicated a high titer of
		"cryptococcal antigen. After treating with oral fluconazole for 3 months, her"
		primary lesion of larynx turned to be clear. We implicate a long-term use of
		steroids as the significant risk factor in developing cryptococcosis of the
		larynx.

PG	-	226-9

AB	-	Cryptococcal infection primarily affects the lung or the central nervous system
		"and rare cases have been reported involving the gastrointestinal tract. However,"
		"among patients with HIV/AIDS, the gastrointestinal involvement is increasing."
		"According to the PubMed search results, there were seven cases reported involving"
		"duodenal cryptococcosis combined with AIDS in five reports. Here, we report the"
		"case of a patient found to have AIDS combined with duodenal, pulmonary, and"
		subsequent neurological cryptococcal infection simultaneously. The duodenal
		"cryptococcosis was diagnosed on the basis of PET/computed tomography, which"
		showed intense captation of glucose metabolism in duodenum (maximum standardized
		uptake value 16.53); a positive serum cryptococcal latex agglutination test; and
		upper gastrointestinal endoscopy-guided duodenal biopsy that confirmed
		Cryptococcus neoformans yeast. The patient's HIV screen test was positive.
		Because of refusal of lumbar puncture and the difficulty of performing
		"transbronchial lung biopsy, the pulmonary and neurological involvements were the"
		only clinical diagnoses. This case indicates that when cryptococcosis exists in a
		"rare location, AIDS should be considered and when cryptococcosis occurs in the"
		"HIV-infected patient, disseminated disease is more common."

		"year old buck showing severe neurological signs, including paraplegia and strong"
		pain reaction to touch of the hindquarters region. Treatment with antibiotics was
		unsuccessful and the animal was euthanized for humanitarian reasons. Postmortem
		"examination revealed lumbar meningitis, lung nodules and caseous lymphadenitis"
		lesions. Encapsulated Cryptococcus neoformans were identified from the lungs and
		"meninges, showing that cryptococcal meningitis should be included in the"
		differential diagnosis of goats showing paresis and hyperesthesia. The
		possibility of concurrent immunosuppression due to Corynebacterium
		pseudotuberculosis infection is raised. CONCLUSIONS: Cryptoccocal meningitis
		should be included in the differential diagnosis list of goat diseases with
		ataxia and hyperesthesia.

		urinary tract infection.
PG	-	203-5
AB	-	Fungal infection of the genitourinary system is a relatively uncommon
		presentation. Cryptococcuria has rarely been recognized in clinical practice.
		Patients with positive urine culture for Cryptococcus neoformans from 1992 to
		2003 were retrospectively reviewed. Sixteen patients were identified. Nine (56%)
		"patients were male, with a mean age of 44 +/- 21 (range, 16-88) years. Fifteen"
		"(94%) patients had underlying conditions such as HIV infection, diabetes"
		"mellitus, hypertension, and/or systemic lupus erythematosus. Thirteen (81%)"
		"patients had cryptococcuria as a manifestation of disseminated cryptococcosis,"
		and the rest had only isolated cryptococcuria. Urinary analysis revealed
		"proteinuria (75%), pyuria (31%), and budding yeast (13%). Nine (56%) patients"
		received antifungal therapy. Other patients were misdiagnosed or died before
		"treatment. The mortality rate was 64%. In conclusion, cryptococcuria is not"
		extremely rare and can present as a manifestation of disseminated cryptococcosis
		or isolated urinary tract infection.

AB	-	A 62-year-old immunocompetent rural woman who represents an isolated cryptococcal
		skull infection without systematic involvement is described. Diagnosis was based
		"on positive India ink staining, positive histopathologic examination, and"
		positive culture. Species identification was performed by growth on Sabouraud
		dextrose agar and CHROMagar medium and by sequencing of the intergenic and
		internal transcribed spacer regions of the rRNA genes. This case describes a rare
		presentation of Cryptococcus neoformans infection in a human immunodeficiency
		virus-negative patient. The lesions were significantly improved with treatment of
		daily oral itraconazole 400 mg. A maintenance therapy with a low-dose
		itraconazole was prescribed to warrant a clinical and mycological eradication. A
		two-year follow-up did not show any recurrence of infection.

LID	-	10.1007/s42770-021-00555-7 [doi]
AB	-	This is a case report of a feline animal that presented with a skin infection on
		the neck from which Cryptococcus neoformans (former C. neoformans var. grubii)
		"was isolated and identified. The cat presented two nodular tumors, approximately"
		"2 cm in diameter, raised, solid, with a slightly irregular surface and a reddish"
		"color with white areas. Histologically, these tumors corresponded to"
		granulomatous dermatitis and panniculitis with the presence of a large number of
		intralesional yeasts. From identification with biochemical and spectroscopic
		"techniques of these lesion samples, it was determined that the etiological agent"
		was C. neoformans. There is little information on this variety of Cryptococcus
		"causing subcutaneous infection without involvement of other organs, and the"
		presence of this pathogen in the few reports available has not been reliably
		determined. This is the first report of a cat affected by C. neoformans in Costa
		Rica.

TI	-	Multimodal treatment of recurrent sinonasal cryptococcal granulomas in a horse.
PG	-	723-30
LID	-	10.2460/javma.235.6.723 [doi]
AB	-	"CASE DESCRIPTION: A 7-year-old 509-kg (1,120-lb) Tennessee Walking Horse mare was"
		"evaluated because of bilateral mucosanguinous nasal discharge, intermittent"
		"right-sided epistaxis, and worsening dyspnea of 9 months' duration. CLINICAL"
		FINDINGS: Multiple masses in the nasopharynx were detected via endoscopic and
		radiographic examinations. Cytologic and histologic examinations of biopsy
		specimens of 1 mass revealed round yeasts with thick nonstaining capsules and
		occasional narrow-based budding that resembled cryptococcal organisms. TREATMENT
		AND OUTCOME: Oral administration of fluconazole and organic ethylenediamine
		"dihydriodide and intermittent intralesional injections with fluconazole,"
		"amphotericin B, and formalin resulted in resolution of lesions for a period of"
		"2.5 years. The horse then developed exophthalmos, recurring clinical signs, and"
		extensive nasopharyngeal masses. The masses were surgically debulked via a large
		"frontonasal bone flap, and the horse was treated with IV injections of"
		amphotericin B and long-term oral administration of fluconazole. Clinical signs
		did not recur in the following 2-year period. A presumptive diagnosis of
		cryptococcosis was made following cytologic and histologic evaluations of the
		masses; results of serologic analysis and fungal culture confirmed infection with
		Cryptococcus neoformans. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Cryptococcal infection of the upper
		respiratory tract in horses has previously been described as a uniformly fatal
		"disease. As this case report illustrates, medical and surgical treatment of"
		"sinonasal cryptococcal granulomas in horses may be successful, but the importance"
		of long-term follow-up and the potential for disease recrudescence should be
		"considered. As efficacious antifungal agents become less expensive, their"
		increased use will likely decrease mortality rates in horses with fungal
		infections.

LID	-	10.1136/bcr-2019-233860 [doi]
LID	-	e233860
AB	-	"In the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), disseminated Kaposi"
		sarcoma (KS) has become much rarer in the USA. We report a case of a 34-year-old
		"man with KS of the skin, oropharynx, lung and rectum. Within the same lung"
		"nodule, we discovered significant burden of colesional Cryptococcus neoformans,"
		"in the context of a positive asymptomatic cryptococcal antigenemia, which was a"
		previously unreported occurrence. The gold standard of treatment for KS continues
		"to be HAART. The role of chemotherapy is still controversial. In addition, a"
		cryptococcal antigen screen-and-treat approach with fluconazole is still not
		routinely recommended in the USA to prevent serious meningeal disease despite
		recent studies showing efficacy and applicability. We discuss both issues here
		and the outcome of our patient. We also present the patient's own unique
		perspective in dealing with the ramifications of these diagnoses.

AB	-	"Cryptococcus neoformans causes life-threatening meningoencephalitis, particularly"
		in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals with low CD4 levels
		(<100 cells/μL). Although the burden of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis (CM) in
		"Turkey is low (0.13 cases per 100 000 persons), asymptomatic individuals at risk"
		of cryptococcosis should be screened for antigenemia to prevent the disease
		and/or promote early CM diagnosis. A lateral flow assay (LFA) is used to detect
		Cryptococcus antigen (CrAg) in cerebrospinal fluid and serum. We determined
		Cryptococcus antigenemia prevalence in serum samples of HIV-positive and
		"HIV-negative adult patients by using Dynamiker® CrAg-LFA, a point-of-care"
		"dipstick test. Patients' demographic data, CD4 count, HIV-RNA levels and"
		anti-retroviral therapy status were recorded. CrAg was detected in 28 (11%) of
		254 HIV-positive patients screened but not in 100 HIV-negative control
		individuals; a significant difference was observed in the CrAg-LFA positivity
		rate between HIV-positive and HIV-negative groups (x(2)  = 11.970; P < .05). In
		"CrAg-positive patients, the median CD4 level was 666 cells/μL"
		"(115-1344 cells/μL), with a median viral load of 23 copies/mL (0-3.69 × 10(6)"
		" copies/mL). In HIV-positive CrAg-negative patients, the median CD4 level was"
		633 cells/μL (31-2953 cells/μL) and the median viral load was 12 copies/mL
		(0-1.95 × 10(6)  copies/mL; P > .05). Results indicate that HIV-positive patients
		with both low (<200 cells/μL) and high (>200 cells/μL) CD4 counts should be
		screened for asymptomatic cryptococcal antigenemia. HIV-associated asymptomatic
		"cryptococcosis is not uncommon in Turkey, which warrants systematic screening."
		Updated strategies for CM prevention among HIV-positive patients should be used
		even in non-endemic countries.

PG	-	2227-9
LID	-	10.1007/s10072-013-1461-2 [doi]
AB	-	A pseudo-subarachnoid hemorrhage (pseudo-SAH) is a brain computed tomography (CT)
		"finding that is seen as high-density areas along the basal cisterns, the sylvian"
		"vallecula/fissure, the tentorium cerebella, or the cortical sulci, although no"
		SAH is found upon lumbar puncture or at autopsy. There is one report of
		"cryptococcal meningitis presenting as pseudo-SAH, but the explanatory pathology"
		"is unknown. A 68-year-old woman with headache, fever, decreased hearing, and"
		decreased vision was admitted to our hospital. Cerebrospinal fluid India ink
		"staining was positive, and culture yielded Cryptococcus neoformans. Cryptococcus"
		meningitis was diagnosed. Head CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed no
		"abnormality upon admission, but 1 month later, head CT showed iso- to"
		"high-density areas within the sulci, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MRI"
		showed high signal intensity within the convexity sulci resembling an SAH. These
		areas were enhanced by gadolinium on T1-weighted images. Lumber puncture produced
		"no evidence of bleeding. Biopsy of the left frontal lobe sulci was performed, and"
		histopathological study revealed inflammation and granulation with capsules of C.
		neoformans. The inflammation and granulation at the convexity sulci induced by
		the C. neoformans infection explained the pseudo-SAH in this case. Physicians
		should be aware that cryptococcal meningitis-induced inflammation and granulation
		at the sulci can present as pseudo-SAH on CT and MRI.

AB	-	The first case of cryptococcosis caused by Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii in
		a new species of bandicoot (Bandicota indica) is described. The animal was
		"trapped in a bamboo thicket in a park located in the city of Jabalpur, India. On"
		"necropsy, pathological lesions were seen in the lungs and liver and C. neoformans"
		"var. grubii was isolated from the lungs, liver, kidneys, spleen and brain but not"
		the heart or intestine. The soil of the animal's burrow and bamboo debris around
		it also revealed the presence of C. neoformans var. grubii. We hypothesize that
		the bandicoots may potentially act as sentinel animals for environmental human
		pathogenic Cryptococcus species.

AB	-	Reported is one case of cerebral cryptococcosis in a 12-year-old girl. The
		diagnosis was confirmed by the detection of Cryptococcus neoformans with both
		India ink preparation of the cerebrospinal fluid and Sabouraud's media culture.
		"Clinical presentation included progressive severe headache, vomiting, left eye"
		"pain, diplopia, dizziness and unstable gait. Fever was absent as a symptom."
		Initial brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed a focal lesion over the right
		cerebellar hemisphere with better demonstration than contrast-enhanced computed
		tomography. The patient was treated with amphotericin B and 5-flucytosine with
		good final outcome. Early diagnosis and proper therapy are necessary in order to
		decrease the motality of cerebral cryptococcosis.

		paracoccidioidomycosis.
PG	-	65-9
AB	-	We describe the case reports of two patients with immunodeficiency secondary to
		paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) and opportunistic Cryptococcus neoformans
		infections. Secondary immunodeficiency likely occurred as a consequence of the
		intestinal loss of proteins and lymphocytes associated with malabsorption
		syndrome due to obstructed lymphatic drainage. Both patients had had severe
		abdominal involvement during the acute PCM disease. Immunological evaluation
		showed cellular and humoral immunity impairment. Cryptococcosis manifested as
		relatively well circumscribed lesions: osteolytic lesions of the skull in one
		"patient, and pulmonary nodules in the other. The latter was treated surgically"
		"and with amphotericin B, whereas the other was treated with the combination"
		amphotericin-B and flucytosine. Both patients had a good response to treatment
		with complete regression of the lesions. They have now 2 and 4 years of follow-up
		with maintenance therapy and no indication of reactivation of the infection. PCM
		also did not reactivate. The clinical and immunological characteristics of these
		patients are discussed and compared to the opportunistic C. neoformans infections
		of AIDS and transplant patients.

AB	-	Osteomyelitis due to Cryptococcus neoformans are described in mostly 10% of
		"patients with disseminated cryptococcosis, being direct inoculation even more"
		uncommon. We report the case of an HIV-infected patient with history of recurring
		"itching on his scalp and repetitive local trauma. For eighteen months, he noticed"
		a painful and slow growing lump on his scalp. He was submitted to an excisional
		biopsy of the lesion but no etiological diagnosis was identified. After this
		"procedure, the post-surgical wound never completely healed. At admission, the"
		patient presented nausea and headache for three days and an open orifice into his
		skull. Investigations confirmed meningitis and skull osteomyelitis caused by
		Cryptococcus neoformans. He was treated with bone debridement and combined
		"systemic antifungals, showing good clinical and laboratorial outcome."
		Cryptococcal disease should be included in the differential diagnoses of chronic
		osteomyelitis in HIV-infected patients and trauma is a possible source of
		infection.

		diagnosis of pulmonary cryptococcosis.
PG	-	1588-91
AB	-	Pulmonary cryptococcosis causes significant morbidity and mortality in
		immunocompromised patients. Definitive diagnosis of pulmonary cryptococcosis is
		usually difficult. The use of direct determination of cryptococcal antigen in
		transthoracic needle aspirate to diagnose pulmonary cryptococcosis was
		"investigated. Over a 2-year period, we studied a total of 41 patients with"
		respiratory symptoms and pulmonary infiltrates of unknown etiology who were
		suspected of having pulmonary cryptococcosis. Twenty-two patients were
		immunocompetent patients and 19 patients were immunocompromised. A diagnosis of
		"pulmonary cryptococcosis was based on cytological examination, culture for"
		"Cryptococcus neoformans, histopathologic examination, and clinical response to"
		antifungal therapy. All patients underwent chest ultrasound and ultrasound-guided
		percutaneous transthoracic needle aspiration to obtain specimens for cryptococcal
		antigen determination. The presence of cryptococcal antigen was determined by the
		"latex agglutination system (CALAS; Meridian Diagnostics, Cincinnati, Ohio). An"
		antigen titer equal to or greater than 1:8 was considered positive. The specimens
		"were also sent for cytological examination, fungal culture, and/or"
		histopathologic examination. A final diagnosis of pulmonary cryptococcosis was
		made in eight patients. Direct determinations of cryptococcal antigen in lung
		aspirate were positive in all eight patients with pulmonary cryptococcosis (100%
		"sensitivity, 97% specificity, a positive predictive value of 89%, and negative"
		"value of 100%), and there was only one false-positive in noncryptococcosis"
		patients. The diagnostic accuracy was 97.5%. Serum cryptococcal antigen was
		"positive in only three patients with pulmonary cryptococcosis (sensitivity,"
		37.5%). This study showed that direct measurement of cryptococcal antigen in lung
		aspirate can be a rapid and useful test for diagnosis of pulmonary
		cryptococcosis.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Cellulitis is an unusual presentation of disseminated cryptococcosis,"
		a serious infection seen predominantly in immunocompromised hosts. Disseminated
		"cryptococcosis carries significant morbidity for transplant recipients,"
		"especially of the pulmonary and central nervous systems, and carries a high"
		mortality risk. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 59-year-old renal transplant
		recipient who presented with bilateral lower leg cellulitis without other
		symptoms or signs. Failure of conventional therapy for cellulitis prompted a skin
		biopsy confirming cryptococcal cellulitis. Additional evaluation to exclude
		disseminated disease revealed Cryptococcus neoformans in blood cultures and
		cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Treatment included reduction in immunosuppression
		regimen and targeted treatment for cryptococcal disease with liposomal
		amphotericin B and flucytosine followed by fluconazole consolidation and
		maintenance therapy. Treatment with liposomal amphotericin B and flucytosine
		followed by fluconazole consolidation and maintenance therapy achieved a good
		clinical response. Our patient achieved significant reduction in leg cellulitis
		and recovered without serious complication. CONCLUSIONS: This case suggests that
		cutaneous cryptococcosis in immunosuppressed patients warrants a low threshold
		for investigation for disseminated disease even in the absence of other symptoms
		or signs.

		"reported in the immunosuppressed patients, infections related to other"
		Cryptococcus spp. are rarely reported. We are reporting a case of pulmonary
		infection and ARDS due to C. albidus in a patient receiving immunosuppressive
		therapy because of Still's disease. The diagnosis was made by tissue biopsy and
		culture. The patient responded to treatment with amphotericin B lipid complex 400

AB	-	This report describes a case of unusual deep skin ulcers with tortuous sinus
		tract formation in an immunocompetent woman. She was initially diagnosed with a
		Staphylococcus aureus skin infection and histopathologically diagnosed with
		"pyoderma gangrenosum. However, culture from the deep end of ribbon gauze inserted"
		"into the subcutaneous sinus tract revealed shiny, light-yellow mucoid colonies,"
		which were identified as Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii. She was treated
		with fluconazole for nine months and completely healed. Cryptococcosis is an
		opportunistic infection caused by variants of C. neoformans species. Cutaneous
		"manifestations of cryptococcosis are quite divergent, rarely occurring as deep"
		skin ulcers with sinus formation.

AB	-	"Infections due to Cryptococcus neoformans cause severe disease, mostly in AIDS"
		patients. The antifungal drug recommended for the initial treatment of these
		"infections is amphotericin B with or without flucytosine, but treatment failure"
		"occurs, associated with high mortality. Thus, antifungal susceptibility testing"
		"is needed. However, the in vitro susceptibility tests available for C. neoformans"
		are not useful to detect isolates that are not susceptible to antifungal agents
		such as amphotericin B. The aims of the present study were: (1) to determine and
		compare the in vitro activity of amphotericin B against C. neoformans clinical
		isolates by using different dilution and diffusion methods; (2) to evaluate the
		concordance among the methods used and the reference method; (3) to evaluate
		which method could be the best to correlate with the clinical outcome. The
		reference method EDef 7.2 from the European Committee on Antimicrobial
		Susceptibility Testing and commercial Etest strips were used to determine the
		"minimal inhibitory concentration against amphotericin B. curves, minimal"
		"fungicidal concentration, and a disk diffusion method were also developed to"
		evaluate the cidal activity of amphotericin B. The time-kill curve assay showed
		"correlation (p < 0.05) with clinical outcome, whereas EDef 7.2, minimal"
		"fungicidal concentration, Etest, and disk diffusion showed no correlation (p >"
		"0.05). Thus, the time-kill curve assay could be a potential tool to guide a more"
		efficient treatment when amphotericin B is used.

PG	-	346-8
AB	-	PURPOSE: To report an uncommon case of multifocal choroiditis as the result of
		disseminated Cryptococcus neoformans infection in a patient who is HIV-positive.
		DESIGN: Interventional case report. METHODS: A 27-year-old HIV-positive woman
		"with fever, headache, and vomiting was examined. Lumbar puncture was performed"
		and revealed C neoformans infection. Her condition evolved with sudden bilateral
		blindness and deafness. Ophthalmologic examination revealed multiple yellowish
		choroidal lesions in the posterior pole of both eyes. RESULTS: Postmortem
		examination showed disseminated C neoformans infection. Histologic examination of
		the eyes confirmed the presence of C neoformans in the choroiditis. CONCLUSION:
		Multifocal choroiditis in C neoformans infection is a rare ophthalmic
		manifestation. The recognition of this condition by ophthalmologists can help
		physicians to diagnose a disseminated and fatal disease.

		rarely been described. We report the case of a male patient with normal immune
		function who presented with a right upper lobe mass lesion. Bronchoscopy revealed
		a tumour-like growth that completely occluded the anterior segment of the right
		upper lobe bronchus. Bronchial biopsy and computed tomography-guided lung biopsy
		"revealed Cryptococcus, and culture of lung biopsy specimen grew Cryptococcus"
		neoformans and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The patient responded clinically to

		There is very limited literature on Cryptococcus neoformans cholangitis or
		Candida cholangitis in immunocompetent patient while mixed Cryptococcus
		neoformans and Candida cholangitis has not been reported in the literature ever

		"included nodules in the cystic duct and common bile duct, dilatation of the"
		"intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts with mural thickening, irregular hypodense"
		mass-like lesion extending along the bile ducts from the liver hilum to the
		periphery which was confirmed by the presence of enlarged and confluent lymph
		nodes. CT characteristics can contribute to timely diagnosis and treatment of
		this disease.

TI	-	In vivo development of fluconazole resistance in serial Cryptococcus gattii
		isolates from a cat.
PG	-	396-401
LID	-	10.1093/mmy/myw104 [doi]
AB	-	Elevated fluconazole minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) are more frequently
		"observed in Cryptococcus gattii compared to C. neoformans isolates; however, the"
		development of in vivo resistance and the molecular mechanisms responsible have
		not been reported for this species. We report a case of Cryptococcus gattii
		(molecular type VGIII) that developed reduced susceptibility to fluconazole
		during therapy and delineate the molecular mechanisms responsible. Multilocus
		sequence typing and quantitative DNA analysis of the pre- and post-treatment
		isolates was performed using well-characterized methods. Pre- and post-treatment
		"clinical isolates were confirmed isogenic, and no differences in ERG11 or PDR11"
		sequences were found. qPCR found an overexpression of ERG11 and the efflux pump
		PDR11 in the resistant isolate compared to the isolate collected prior to
		initiation of antifungal therapy. Reversion to wild-type susceptibility was
		observed when maintained in antifungal-free media confirming the in vivo
		development of heteroresistance. The in vivo development of heteroresistance to
		fluconazole in our patient with C. gattii is secondary to overexpression of the
		efflux pump PDR11 and the drug target ERG11. Additional work in other clinical
		isolates with elevated fluconazole MICs is warranted to evaluate the frequency of
		heteroresistance versus point mutations as a cause of resistance.

PG	-	261-265
LID	-	10.1007/s13730-019-00403-6 [doi]
AB	-	Cryptococcosis is an invasive fungal infection that is common among organ
		"transplant recipients, and it is challenging to treat among these patients"
		because of their immunocompromised status. Fluconazole (FLCZ) is recommended as a
		first-line treatment modality for pulmonary cryptococcosis in organ transplant
		"recipients. However, cases of FLCZ resistance among Cryptococcus neoformans"
		isolates have been reported from the Asia Pacific region. Previous studies have
		reported the efficacy of voriconazole (VRCZ) in patients with FLCZ-resistant
		"fungal infections. Herein, we report a case of FLCZ-resistant pulmonary"
		cryptococcosis after renal transplantation that was successfully treated with
		VRCZ combined with amphotericin B-liposome (L-AMB). The patient was a-23-year-old
		woman who underwent living-donor kidney transplantation at age 20 years. She has
		"attended our hospital since before for mental retardation, epilepsy, and dilated"
		"cardiomyopathy. At age 23 years, she presented to our hospital with fever and"
		cough. She was diagnosed with pulmonary cryptococcosis based on positive-serum
		cryptococcal antigen. Chest radiography showed bilateral consolidations.
		"Fosfluconazole (F-FLCZ) was administered, and her condition improved. However,"
		she developed cough and fever again on day 60 of hospitalization. Cryptococcosis
		recurrence was suspected due to the high degree of cryptococcal antigen titers
		"showed (1:2048) taken on the same day. Therefore, L-AMB was added, and F-FLCZ was"
		"substituted with VRCZ. Her condition improved, but L-AMB was discontinued due to"
		"hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and elevated serum creatinine. This indicates that"
		VRCZ caused the remission. She was discharged after 6 months of admission. In
		"conclusion, this case shows the efficacy of VRCZ combined with L-AMB for"
		refractory pulmonary cryptococcosis.

AB	-	We communicate the diagnosis by microscopy of a pulmonary coinfection produced by
		"Cryptococcus neoformans and Pneumocystis jiroveci, from a respiratory secretion"
		obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage of an AIDS patient. Our review of literature
		identified this coinfection as unusual presentation. Opportunistic infections
		associated with HIV infection are increasingly recognized. It may occur at an
		early stage of HIV-infection. Whereas concurrent opportunistic infections may
		"occur, coexisting Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) and disseminated"
		cryptococcosis with cryptococcal pneumonia is uncommon. The lungs of individuals
		infected with HIV are often affected by opportunistic infections and tumours and
		over two-thirds of patients have at least one respiratory episode during the
		course of their disease. Pneumonia is the leading HIV-associated infection. We
		present the case of a man who presented dual Pneumocystis jiroveci and
		cryptococcal pneumonia in a patient with HIV. Definitive diagnosis of PCP and
		Cryptococcus requires demonstration of these organisms in pulmonary tissues or
		"fluid. In patients with < 200/microliter CD4-lymphocytes, a bronchoalveolar"
		lavage should be performed. This patient was successfully treated with
		amphotericin B and trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole. After 1 week the patient showed
		clinical and radiologic improvement and was discharged 3 weeks later.

		agglutination kit was positive. A biopsy revealed multiple capsulated yeasts
		"cells in the cutaneous lesions, which were consistent with cryptococcus"
		neoformans. The patient was successfully treated with Amphotericin B and
		Fluconazole with regression of cranial and cutaneous lesions.

		cryptococcal meningitis and wound or cutaneous cryptococcosis. CASE PRESENTATION:
		An 81-year-old woman developed severe necrotizing cellulitis on her left arm
		without any preceding injury. The patient had been treated with systemic
		corticosteroids over twenty years for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Skin biopsies of
		the wound area were initially interpreted as cutaneous vasculitis of unknown
		"etiology. However, periodic acid Schiff staining and smear analysis later"
		"revealed structures consistent with Cryptococcus neoformans, and the infection"
		was subsequently confirmed by culture. After the initiation of therapy with
		fluconazole 400 mg per day the general condition and the skin ulcers improved
		rapidly and the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility. Subsequently
		surgical debridement and skin grafting were performed. CONCLUSIONS: Opportunistic
		infections such as cryptococcosis can clinically and histologically mimic
		cutaneous vasculitis and have to be investigated rigorously as a differential
		diagnosis in immunosuppressed patients.

PG	-	20
LID	-	10.1186/1471-2369-14-20 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcosis is considered as an opportunistic infection because it
		mainly occurs in immunosuppressed hosts. C. neoformans is usually acquired by the
		"respiratory route and then may disseminate hematogenously to other places, such"
		"as meninges, bone and skin. Cutaneous involvement is a rare but important feature"
		of disseminated cryptococcosis with a poor outcome if misdiagnosis. We reported
		the first case of patients with nephrotic syndrome suffering from disseminated
		cryptococcosis initially presented as cellulitis. CASE PRESENTATION: A
		34-year-old man developed severe cellulitis on his both lower extremities without
		any preceding injury and allergies. The patient had been treated with systemic
		corticosteroids nearly one year for nephrotic syndrome. According to the outcome
		"of blood culture, the wound area was interpreted as bacterial cellulitis at"
		"first. However, the antimicrobial treatment made no response and the skin biopsy"
		"revealed the presence of Cryptococcus neoformans, which was subsequently"
		confirmed by microbiological culture. Though the initiation of therapy with
		"fluconazole 400 mg per day was immediately adopted, the patient's conditions"
		suddenly plummeted and he died in the end. CONCLUSION: Since the poor outcome of
		"disseminated cryptococcosis if unrecognized and untreated in time, it should be"
		investigated rigorously as a differential diagnosis in patients with nephrotic
		syndrome suffering from cutaneous diseases.

AB	-	"We report here, to the best of our knowledge, the first description of an in"
		vitro fluconazole (FLZ)-resistant Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii from a case
		of feline cryptococcosis. In vitro testing demonstrated that this isolate was
		"resistant to FLZ (minimum inhibitory concentration, MIC, of 128 μg/ml) but"
		"remained susceptible to amphotericin B (0.064 µg/ml), itraconazole (0.38 µg/ml),"
		"voriconazole (0.023 µg/ml), and posaconazole (0.125 µg/ml). The predicted amino"
		acid sequence of the lanosterol 14-α demethylase (ERG11) protein in the isolate
		"was identical to that of the C. neoformans var. grubii reference strain,"
		indicating that resistance was not mediated by mutation of the target gene's open
		reading frame. The RT-qPCR analysis for ERG11 and ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
		transporter-encoding gene (AFR1) indicated that the isolate increased
		transcription factor function of ERG11 and AFR1 than that of FLZ-susceptive
		"strains. This observation, in combination with the lack of resistance to other"
		"azoles (that is, lack of crossresistance), suggests that resistance in our"
		isolate was the result of overexpression of the endogenous ERG11 and ABC
		transporter.

		Immunodeficiency Virus-Infected Adults in Ethiopia.
PG	-	786-792
AB	-	In a cross-sectional study among hospitalized human immunodeficiency virus
		"(HIV)-infected patients in Ethiopia, we sought to determine the rates and"
		predictors of cryptococcal disease and evaluate the test performance of a
		recently introduced point-of-care test for Cryptococcus neoformans detection in
		"various biological samples. We tested serum, urine, and fingerstick blood samples"
		from each patient with a cryptococcal antigen lateral flow assay (CRAG LFA;
		"Immuno Mycologic Inc., Norman, OK). Cerebrospinal fluid was collected at the"
		discretion of the treating physician. Logistic regression was used to identify
		risk factors for a positive test result. Agreement between different sample types
		was also assessed. Among 198 hospitalized HIV-infected patients with a median CD4
		"count of 93 cells/mm(3), 18 patients (9.1%) had a positive serum CRAG LFA. Of"
		"these, 16 (8.1%) had confirmed cryptococcal meningitis (CM), all of whom had a"
		positive fingerstick blood LFA result. There was a very high agreement between
		"CRAG LFA tests in serum and fingerstick blood samples (κ = 0.97, 95% confidence"
		interval [CI] = 0.91-1.00); this was higher than that between serum and urine
		"samples (κ = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.58-0.93). A CD4 count < 100 cells/mm(3) was"
		"significantly associated with a positive CRAG LFA. The absence of fever,"
		"headache, meningismus, and neck stiffness had a negative predictive value of 100%"
		"for CM. In addition to finding high rates of cryptococcal disease, our study"
		"demonstrated that the use of the LFA on fingerstick whole blood is less invasive,"
		and an effective method for CM case finding among hospitalized patients with HIV.

		Importance of Suspecting Atypical Pathogens in the Immunocompromised Host.
PG	-	609-612
LID	-	10.6002/ect.2017.0292 [doi]
AB	-	Cryptococcal infection has been documented in 2.8% of solid-organ transplant
		"recipients, with the median time to disease onset being 21 months. Renal"
		transplantrecipients accountforthe majority of cases. Most patients present with
		"central nervous system or disseminated disease, with only a minority having"
		cutaneous manifestations. We present the case of a 47-year-old female renal
		transplant recipient who presented with refractory acute cellulitis 7 months
		after transplant. She had received thymoglobulin induction and was on a
		"maintenance immunosuppressive regimen oftacrolimus, mycophenolic acid, and"
		prednisone (5 mg/d). She did not respond to broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy
		for presumed bacterial cellulitis. Skin and soft tissue biopsies subsequently
		showed the presence of yeast; Cryptococcus neoformans was recovered in culture.
		"Blood cultures, chest radiography, and cerebrospinal fluid sampling were"
		"negative, which resulted in a diagnosis of multifocal soft tissue cryptococcosis,"
		a form of disseminated disease. Serum cryptococcal antigen testing was strongly
		"positive (≥ 1:2560). The patient's immunosuppression was reduced, and she"
		"received treatment with liposomal-amphotericin B and flucytosine for 2 weeks,"
		which resulted in symptomatic improvement. This was followed by 1 year of
		consolidation and subsequent maintenance therapy with fluconazole. This case
		should increase awareness of the broader differential diagnosis of soft tissue
		"infection in immunocompromised patients. Her case mimicked bacterial cellulitis,"
		which delayed administration of effective therapy. Although our patient was
		"initially diagnosed via biopsy, early clinical suspicion and serum cryptococcal"
		antigen testing can lead to the correct diagnosis more rapidly. As transplant
		"patients return to their community providers, heightened vigilance for unusual"
		infections and presentations is warranted.The possibility of a cryptococcal cause
		"for acute soft tissue infection should be considered, even in the absence of"
		pulmonary or central nervous system involvement.

PG	-	315-8
AB	-	A 67-year-old previously healthy woman presented with low back pain of 2 months
		duration and daily fever of 39 degrees C for 3 weeks. CT scan showed a lytic
		lesion in the third lumbar vertebra and a small right lower lobe lung infiltrate
		with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Culture of material obtained from open biopsy
		"of the vertebra grew Cryptococcus neoformans var. neoformans, which was also"
		demonstrated on histology. Cryptococcal antigen was detected in the patient's
		serum. Treatment with amphotericin B (1000 mg total dose) and oral
		"5-fluorocytosine, resulted in complete recovery and resolution of the chest X-ray"
		"findings with a follow-up of 2 years. Since this case, as well as most of the"
		"previously described cases of cryptococcal osteomyelitis, were in normal hosts,"
		cryptococcal osteomyelitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis
		"even in a normal host, and therefore, prior to possible invasive diagnostic"
		"procedures, cryptococcal antigen in the serum should be determined."

AB	-	"We report a case of cryptococcal sinusitis, a rare presentation of Cryptococcus"
		neoformans infection in a patient with multiple myeloma. The objective of this
		case report is to highlight the utility of structural and functional imaging
		modalities in the differential diagnosis of sinonasal soft tissue masses in the
		immunocompromised patient population. PET-CT was the first imaging modality in
		"this patient, who presented for routine follow-up staging of multiple myeloma,"
		and was asymptomatic at the time of his presentation. PET-CT findings prompted
		"further evaluation with MRI, to aid in the differential diagnosis with respect to"
		"a neoplastic versus infectious etiology. Ultimately, surgical excision with"
		histopathology was required to provide definitive diagnosis. Final histopathology
		displayed yeast-organism staining consistent with Cryptococcus neoformans/gatti.
		"The patient subsequently underwent treatment for this infection, along continued"
		treatment for multiple myeloma. To our knowledge this is the first known case of
		cryptococcal sinusitis in a patient with neoplastic disease. Imaging represents
		an important tool to differentiate fungal infection from neoplasm in the
		immunocompromised patient population. As the population of immunocompromised
		"patients continues to grow, the relevance of this diagnosis as well as the use of"
		alternative imaging modalities is becoming more important in clinical practice.

AB	-	"CASE HISTORY: Two young, large-breed female dogs were presented with an acute"
		onset of sneezing and nasal discharge. One patient had concurrent epistaxis and
		facial deformity. CLINICAL FINDINGS: Decreased airflow was noted through the left
		"nostril in Case 1, while Case 2 showed facial deformity. Nasal radiographs from"
		Case 1 showed a soft tissue opacity in the left nasal cavity and frontal sinus.
		"Rhinoscopy revealed roughened, erythematous nasal turbinates in both patients,"
		and a mass in the left caudal nasal cavity of Case 1. Cryptococcus spp. were
		demonstrated histopathologically on a nasal biopsy. Tissue culture and serum
		antigen titres were positive for Cryptococcus spp. DIAGNOSIS: Chronic rhinitis
		"secondary to Cryptococcus gattii infection in Case 1, and Cryptococcus neoformans"
		infection in Case 2. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These are the first reported cases of
		Cryptococcus spp. rhinitis in dogs in New Zealand.

TI	-	A Rare Presentation of Cryptococcal Meningitis and Cerebellitis in an Asplenic
		"Patient, Seronegative for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)."
PG	-	183-186
AB	-	BACKGROUND Cryptococcal meningitis in patients who are seronegative for the human
		immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and in patients who are splenectomized is rare. This
		report is an unusual case of meningeal and cerebellar infection due to the
		"encapsulated yeast, Cryptococcus neoformans, which has not previously been"
		associated with asplenia. CASE REPORT A 65-year-old HIV-negative patient with a
		"previous splenectomy, presented with a three-day history of fever, vomiting, and"
		"headache. His symptoms progressed to generalized body aches, persistent fever,"
		"and neck stiffness. A lumbar puncture was performed, and cerebrospinal fluid"
		(CSF) culture grew Cryptococcus neoformans. Treatment commenced with intravenous
		amphotericin B and flucytosine. The patient required serial lumbar punctures due
		to persistent raised intracranial pressure (ICP). Magnetic resonance imaging
		(MRI) of the brain showed acute meningitis and cerebellitis. Antimicrobial
		therapy and CSF drainage resulted in clinical improvement.  CONCLUSIONS The
		occurrence of meningeal and cerebellar cryptococcosis in an asplenic patient is
		"rare, and few cases have been previously reported. This case report highlights"
		"the possibility of invasive cryptococcal infection, or cryptococcosis, in"
		asplenic individuals in the absence of HIV infection.

LID	-	10.1007/s11046-019-00322-1 [doi]
AB	-	An 82-year-old woman presented to our hospital with a deep skin ulcer in her
		right lower limb. Although the skin biopsy showed necrosis and neutrophil
		"infiltration, we could not initially detect any pathogen. Chest radiography"
		"showed multiple nodules despite the lack of respiratory symptoms or fever, and"
		the serum latex agglutination test for cryptococcus showed an elevated titer
		"(1:512). Considering these findings, we performed additional stains of periodic"
		acid-Schiff reaction and Grocott to the skin-biopsy specimen and detected
		multiple yeast-like fungi. The cultures of the skin and lung-biopsy specimens
		"revealed Cryptococcus neoformans. In this case, it is suggested that a large deep"
		"skin ulcer can be an initial manifestation of systemic cryptococcosis, as, in"
		"some cases, pulmonary cryptococcosis may be asymptomatic. Second, cutaneous"
		cryptococcosis of an unexposed area such as the thigh can contribute to the
		diagnosis of systemic cryptococcal infection because it is attributable to
		bloodstream dissemination from other organs.

TI	-	Antifungal susceptibilities of Cryptococcus neoformans cerebrospinal fluid
		isolates and clinical outcomes of cryptococcal meningitis in HIV-infected
		patients with/without fluconazole prophylaxis.
PG	-	795-802
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To compare the MICs of FLUconazole (FLU) and amphotericin B against
		isolates of Cryptococcus neoformans (C. neoformans) obtained from the
		CerebroSpinal Fluid (CSF); and clinical outcomes of HIV-infected patients
		diagnosed with cryptococcal meningitis. MATERIAL AND METHOD: There were two
		groups including those who did not receive FLU (group A) and those who did
		receive either FLU 400 mg/week for primary prophylaxis cryptococosis or 200
		mg/day for secondary prophylaxis cryptococosis (group B). CSF isolates of C.
		neoformans from group A and group B between January 2003 and October 2004 were
		retrospectively studied. The MICs were determined by using the standard NCCLS
		"broth microdilution methods (M27-A). The MICs of FLU and amphotericin B, and"
		clinical outcomes after 10 weeks of cryptococcal meningitis treatment were
		determined. RESULTS: There were 98 isolates; 80 in group A and 18 in group B. The
		patients in group B had a higher proportion of previous opportunistic infections
		(p = 0.008). The other baseline characteristics between the two groups were not
		"different. The median (range) MIC of FLU was 8.0 (0.5-32) microg/ml in group A,"
		and 6.0 (0.5-32) microg/ml in group B (p = 0.926). The median (range) MIC of
		"amphotericin B was 0.25 (0.03-1.0) microg/ml in group A, and 0.25 (0.12-1.0)"
		microg/ml in group B (p = 0.384). Sixty patients from group A and 14 from group B
		received standard treatment and continued to follow-up. After the 10-week
		"treatment, 39/60 (65%) patients in group A and 7/14 (50%) in group B had complete"
		"recovery (p = 0.364; RR = 0.538, 95%CI = 0.166-1.742). The overall mortality rate"
		"was 14/60 (23.3%) in group A and 7/14 (50.0%) in group B (p = 0.096; RR = 3.286,"
		95%CI = 0.983-10.979). CONCLUSION: The MICs of FLU and amphotericin B against CSF
		isolates of C. neoformans and clinical outcomes between HIV-infected patients who
		receive or did not receive FLU prophylaxis are not different.

PG	-	"592, 594"
AB	-	Cryptococcosis is a common opportunistic infection in AIDS patients. Almost all
		cases present with meningitis with or without fungaemia. Cryptococcal
		osteomyelitis occurs as part of a disseminated infection. Isolated cryptococcal
		osteomyelitis is rare and more so in immunocompetent patients. A case of isolated
		osteomyelitis caused by Cryptococcus neoformans in an immunocompetent patient is
		reported here. A female patient of 60 years old presented with pain and swelling
		of left clavicle. The histopathological examination of the biopsied material
		"(bony fragment) showed histiocytes, lymphocytes with many foam cells showing"
		"organisms, the morphology was consistent with cryptococcus. Fluconazole was"
		advised and she responded favourably.

		cryptococcal meningitis prior to delivery. Cesarean section was performed with
		delivery of a single full-term male infant. There was no evidence of HIV or
		cryptococcal infection in the infant. The placenta grossly showed multiple white
		"nodules. Microscopically, numerous encapsulated budding yeasts, morphologically"
		"consistent with cryptococci, were identified in the intervillous space and, to a"
		"lesser extent, in the chorionic villi. Cryptococcal infections are not uncommon,"
		but only 2 cases of placental cryptococcosis have been reported. Our case is the
		"1st account documenting cryptococcal organisms within the chorionic villi, and"
		yet there was no evidence of infection in the infant. Mother-to-fetal
		transmission of cryptococcal infection is not well defined. We review the
		literature and discuss its possible mechanisms.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic immunologic disorder
		that can affect multiple organ systems and makes the patient susceptible to
		infection. Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) is a rare but often fatal complication of
		"SLE. DESIGN: In this study, 6 patients with CM were identified among 631 patients"
		"with SLE. The demographic, clinical, laboratory profiles, serological features"
		and outcomes of these 6 SLE patients with CM were retrospectively analyzed.
		RESULTS: The mean age of these patients was 24.1 years (range 12-42) at the time
		"of SLE diagnosis, and 27.1 years (range 14-42) at the time of Cryptococcus"
		"neoformans infection, with mean disease duration of 37 months (range 3-72). Four"
		patients had active SLE. All patients were receiving glucocorticoids therapy
		(mean prednisone dose of 20.5 (5.0-36.0) mg/day) at the onset of infection. Five
		patients had received other immunosuppressive drugs. The most common
		presentations of CM were headache and fever and 4 of the 6 patients were normal
		on physical examination. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) indices (protein and
		"glucose) were normal in 4 cases, whereas they were mildly abnormal in the other 2"
		patients. White counts in the CSF ranged from 8 to 240 cells/mm. C. neoformans
		were isolated from CSF of 4 patients. The isolation of crytococci from
		"extraneural sites, including blood and lungs, was found in 2 patients. Results of"
		the head computed tomography scan were unremarkable in 5 of the patients. The
		"infection was completely resolved in 5 patients, and it was resolved with serious"
		"sequelae in one patient. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the key to a rapid diagnosis"
		of CM in patients with SLE is to maintain a high degree of awareness which will
		help avoid delays in treatment. This is mainly due to the fact that the clinical
		"presentation and laboratory results from routine hematological, biochemical and"
		CSF analyses of CM in patients with SLE are mostly non-specific.

AB	-	Cryptococcal disease is a rare but often serious infection in solid organ
		"transplant recipients, commonly presenting as meningitis and pneumonia but can"
		rarely cause myositis. We report the case of a 43-year-old female kidney
		transplant recipient with two previous graft failures requiring
		re-transplantations who presented with a 1-month duration of worsening unilateral
		"leg pain, swelling, and shortness of breath. Blood cultures isolated Cryptococcus"
		neoformans. A calf biopsy was performed and histopathology revealed myonecrosis
		with yeast forms consistent with Cryptococcus spp. Liposomal amphotericin B
		(LamB) was administered. Her course was complicated by hypoxemic respiratory
		failure with development of ground glass opacities on chest imaging. Work-up
		revealed bacterial and C neoformans pneumonia and probable Pneumocystis jirovecii
		pneumonia (PJP) She received trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and LamB and was
		"discharged on fluconazole. Shortly thereafter she was re-admitted with confusion,"
		"septic shock, and multi-organ failure. Work-up revealed PJP with subsequent"
		"development of cryptococcal meningitis. Despite aggressive management, she"
		expired. Disseminated cryptococcal infection may manifest as myositis. Presence
		of cryptococcal infection is a marker of severe net state of immunosuppression
		"(IS), hence, presence of other opportunistic infections is likely. Early"
		"recognition of cryptococcal infection, institution of targeted therapy, and IS"
		reduction are important to improve overall survival.

LID	-	13030/qt4rc0q7vx [pii]
AB	-	Cutaneous cryptococcosis is usually secondary to the hematogenous dissemination
		of pulmonary or meningeal Cryptococcus neoformans. Primary cutaneous
		"cryptococcosis (PCC) is a rare form of the infection, typically caused by direct"
		inoculation from trauma to the skin [1]. Most cases of PCC present as a localized
		"cellulitis, abscess, nodule, or ulceration. Herein, we present a case of a"
		"rapidly spreading cellulitis characterized by bullae and ulceration, caused by"
		direct inoculation from a fall.

LID	-	10.1136/bcr-2015-210250 [doi]
LID	-	bcr2015210250
AB	-	Disseminated cryptococcosis is uncommon and almost always occurs in HIV-infected
		"patients. However, cryptococcosis can also be found in patients of organ"
		"transplantation, in those on disease modifying agents for rheumatological"
		conditions and in patients with underlying immunodeficiency. Cryptococcal
		"infection may occur in an immunocompetent patient, but the pathogenic strain is"
		"usually Cryptococcus gattii, and not C. neoformans. However, disseminated"
		"disease, especially cerebral involvement in the form of primary intraventricular"
		"haemorrhage, is exceedingly rare. We report a case of disseminated cryptococcosis"
		"with cutaneous, cerebral and bone marrow involvement in an HIV-negative,"
		apparently immunocompetent patient. Although the patient did not have the usual
		"immunocompromising diseases, there were clinical signs possibly indicating a"
		weakened immune system. This report highlights the need for awareness of
		disseminated cryptococcosis among patients with no apparent immunocompromising
		conditions.

TI	-	Cryptococcoma mimicking a brain tumor in an immunocompetent patient: case report
		of an extremely rare presentation.
PG	-	492-496
LID	-	10.1590/1516-3180.2017.0046210417 [doi]
AB	-	CONTEXT: Central nervous system (CNS) infectious diseases have high prevalence in
		developing countries and their proper diagnosis and treatment are very important
		for public health planning. Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungus that may cause
		"several CNS manifestations, especially in immunocompromised patients."
		Cryptococcal meningitis is the most common type of involvement. Mass-effect
		lesions are uncommon: they are described as cryptococcomas and their prevalence
		is even lower among immunocompetent patients. The aim here was to report an
		extremely rare case of cryptococcoma causing a mass effect and mimicking a brain
		tumor in an immunocompetent patient. The literature on CNS cryptococcal
		"infections was reviewed with emphasis on cryptococcomas. Clinical, surgical and"
		radiological data on a female patient with this rare presentation of
		cryptococcoma mimicking a brain tumor are described. CASE REPORT: A 54-year-old
		female patient presented to the emergency department with a rapid-onset
		progressive history of confusion and completely dependency for basic activities.
		Neuroimaging showed a left occipital lesion and neurosurgical treatment was
		"proposed. From histopathological evaluation, a diagnosis of cryptococcoma was"
		"established. She received clinical support with antifungals, but despite optimal"
		"clinical treatment, her condition evolved to death. CONCLUSIONS: Cryptococcal"
		"infections have several forms of presentation and, in immunocompetent patients,"
		their manifestation may be even more different. Cryptococcoma is an extremely
		rare presentation in which proper surgical and clinical treatment should be
		"instituted as quickly as possible, but even so, there is a high mortality rate."

		cryptococcosis. This case represents an invaluable example of disseminated
		"cryptococcosis with rapidly growing lung nodules in a dialysis patient, and"
		illustrates that dialysis causes innate immune disorder and the reactivation of
		cryptococcosis.

AB	-	Use of the PLEX-ID system can lead to a rapid molecular diagnosis in
		microbiology. To illustrate the clinical implications of this new diagnostic
		"tool, we present the case of a 46-year-old patient admitted with severe"
		respiratory failure and septic shock. Cryptococcal pneumonia was diagnosed by
		Fungi-Fluor™ staining of the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and the patient tested
		"positive for HIV. Unfortunately, he died 12h after admission despite intensive"
		"care support and treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, amphotericin B, and"
		"flucytosine. Retrospective use of the PLEX-ID on the BAL, bronchial aspirate, and"
		blood yielded Cryptococcus neoformans in all fluids tested. Rapid molecular
		"diagnosis with PLEX-ID, especially when performed on the blood of septic"
		"patients, may reduce the time to adequate treatment and limit the number of"
		diagnostic procedures needed.

AB	-	Prosthetic joint infections due to Cryptococcus neoformans have not been
		described before. We report a case of a prosthetic hip joint infection due to C.
		neoformans. An 84-year-old man with chronic lymphocytic leukemia presented with
		progressive left groin pain and fever. There was radiographic evidence of
		"prosthesis loosening, and an aspirate of the left hip joint grew C. neoformans."
		The patient was treated with amphotericin B with good initial symptomatic
		"response. The patient elected not to undergo revision arthroplasty, and oral"
		suppressive therapy with fluconazole was initiated. After 10 months of
		"fluconazole therapy, the prosthesis was removed secondary to pain and increased"
		instability of the implant. Despite excellent penetration of fluconazole into the
		joint fluid and reports of successful outcome in patients with native joint
		cryptococcal infections as well as prosthetic joint infections due to Candida
		"spp., suppressive fluconazole therapy failed. The failure may have been due to an"
		unfavorable interaction between the organism and immune mechanism as well as
		reduced activity of fluconazole in biofilm.

AB	-	CASE: Two patients presented with pathological lytic bone lesions in the rib and
		associated soft tissue mass believed initially to represent soft tissue neoplasm.
		"However, further consideration of infectious etiologies led to the identification"
		"of cryptococcal osteomyelitis. In one case, the microbiological culture was"
		"negative, but Cryptococcus neoformans was identified with the help of the"
		metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) technique. Both patients received
		"oral fluconazole-only treatment, and the infections were successfully eradicated."
		CONCLUSIONS: The mNGS technique helps identify cryptococcal infection in the rib.

PG	-	S37-40
LID	-	10.1007/s40261-012-0019-z [doi]
AB	-	Fungal infections constitute an important cause of morbidity and mortality in
		HIV-infected patients. The authors describe the case of a 40-year-old healthy
		"male patient with a 2-month history of fever, shivers, asthenia and anorexia, who"
		had lost weight during the past 6 months. Laboratory investigations revealed a
		positive HIV screening. Computed tomography scans of the chest and abdomen showed
		thoracic and lumbo-aortic adenopathies. Cryptococcus neoformans was isolated from
		"cultures of blood, bone marrow, cerebrospinal fluid and from material obtained by"
		"transbronchial biopsy. Moreover, Cryptococcus spp. were seen in the lymph node"
		"biopsy. Pneumocystis jirovecii was isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage, whereas"
		Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus flavus were detected in material from a
		transbronchial biopsy. The patient initially received treatment with
		"sulfamethoxazole plus trimethoprim and amphotericin B, which resulted in a"
		"substantial clinical improvement. After the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis,"
		amphotericin B was replaced by voriconazole as antifungal therapy and
		antiretroviral therapy was added. The simultaneous occurrence of three different
		"infectious diseases-disseminated cryptococcosis, invasive pulmonary aspergillosis"
		and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonitis-in a HIV-infected patient is extremely
		rare and there is no doubt that both early diagnosis and treatment are crucial
		for the patient's chances of survival.

		morbidity and mortality. A cachectic 26-year-old HIV-positive man with a CD4
		"count of 103 cells/μl presented with fever, breathlessness, and bilateral lower"

		was isolated from the admission blood culture. The laboratory diluted both the
		"serum and cerebrospinal fluid specimens to retest for cryptococcal antigens, and"
		"finally, an antigen titer of ≥1:2560 was recorded."

PG	-	505-6
AB	-	Cryptococcosis is the commonest fungal infection of the CNS and it is an
		important cause of morbidity and mortality in immunodeficient patients [1]. It
		has been occasionally described in immunocompetent patients [2]. We report a
		patient with no predisposing factors who was treated with flucytosine and
		"amphotericin B for cryptococcal meningitis. Following treatment, she developed a"
		reversible acute cerebellar syndrome that was probably secondary to the
		"administration of flucytosine, an adverse effect that has not previously been"
		"described [3, 4]. An 87-year old women with no relevant personal or family"
		"history was admitted to the hospital for headache, fever, and confusion over the"
		"past week. The vital signs, general and neurological examination were normal. In"
		"laboratory tests, the urine, urea nitrogen, glucose, bilirubin, electrolytes,"
		"aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase, alkaline phosphatase, haematocrit,"
		"white-cell count, and platelet were also normal. A lumbar puncture was performed"
		"which showed: 60 typical lymphocytes per ml, adenosine deaminase (ADA) activity 6"
		"U.l-1 (normal under 4 U.l-1), proteins 75.7 mg.dl-1, and glucose 13 mg.dl-1 with"
		a glycaemia of 120 mg.dl-1. The microbiology study showed staining and a positive
		"culture for Cryptococcus neoformans, and an antigen titre of 1/2080. The serology"
		"for HIV infection was negative, and other predisposing factors for this fungal"
		"infection, such as immunological defects, a lymphoreticular malignancy and"
		sarcoidosis were excluded. A CT scan of the cranial-thoracic-abdominal regions
		was normal and tumour markers were absent.

AB	-	Cryptococcus neoformans is a human pathogen ubiquitously present in the
		"environment. It primarily affects immunocompromised patients, but individuals"
		with no underlying disease or immunodeficiency can also be affected. We herein
		describe the case of a patient found to have Crohn's disease and disseminated
		cryptococcosis simultaneously. She had no predisposing underlying cause for
		impaired immunity. Our patient showed signs that would have make it hard to
		discriminate between an inflammatory bowel disease and an infection if bowel only
		would have been involved. The patient underwent surgical intervention; medical
		therapy was effective against Cryptococcus. She is at now being followed-up for
		Crohn's disease. When dealing with patient affected with inflammatory bowel
		"diseases, careful history taking, objective and instrumental examination are"
		demandable in order not to overlook associated conditions or infectious diseases.
		Diagnosis and therapy of cryptococcosis infection in patient with Crohn's disease
		are herein discussed.

TI	-	Screening for invasive fungal disease using non-culture-based assays among
		inpatients with advanced HIV disease at a large academic hospital in South
		Africa.
PG	-	478-487
LID	-	10.1111/myc.13071 [doi]
AB	-	"INTRODUCTION: Despite widespread access to antiretroviral therapy (ART), the"
		burden of advanced HIV disease in South Africa is high. This translates into an
		"increased risk of AIDS-related opportunistic infections, including invasive"
		"mycoses. METHODS: Using a limited number of non-culture-based diagnostic assays,"
		we aimed to determine the prevalence of invasive mycoses and tuberculosis among
		hospitalised adults with very advanced HIV (CD4 counts < 100 cells/µL) at a large
		academic hospital. We conducted interviews and prospective medical chart reviews.
		We performed point-of-care finger stick and serum cryptococcal antigen lateral
		flow assays; serum (1 → 3) ß-D-glucan assays; urine Histoplasma galactomannan
		antigen enzyme immunoassays and TB lipoarabinomannan assays. RESULTS: We enrolled
		"189 participants from 5280 screened inpatients. Fifty-eight per cent were female,"
		with median age 37 years (IQR: 30-43) and median CD4 count 32 cells/µL (IQR:
		"13-63). At enrolment, 60% (109/181) were receiving ART. Twenty-one participants"
		"(11%) had a diagnosis of an invasive mycosis, of whom 53% (11/21) had"
		cryptococcal disease. Thirteen participants (7%) had tuberculosis and a
		concurrent invasive mycosis. ART-experienced participants were 60% less likely to
		have an invasive mycosis than those ART-naïve (adjusted OR: 0.4; 95% CI 0.15-1.0;
		P = .03). Overall in-hospital mortality was 13% (invasive mycosis: 10% [95% CI
		1.2-30.7] versus other diagnoses: 13% (95% CI 8.4-19.3)). CONCLUSIONS: One in ten
		participants had evidence of an invasive mycosis. Diagnosis of proven invasive
		fungal disease and differentiation from other opportunistic infections was
		challenging. More fungal-specific screening and diagnostic tests should be
		applied to inpatients with advanced HIV disease.

PG	-	697-8
AB	-	Disseminated cryptococcosis was diagnosed as the cause of death of a 2-week-old
		"pup. Cryptococcus neoformans was isolated from the dam's vaginal discharge, but"
		"not from the dam's milk, blood, feces, or environment. During succeeding months,"
		"C neoformans was isolated repeatedly from the dam's vagina, even though vaginitis"
		"was not evident. One year after the death of the 2-week-old pup, cryptococci"
		"could not be isolated from the dam's vagina, and evidence of cryptococcosis was"
		not detected in pups of the dam's next litter. This case was unusual because
		cryptococcosis has been reported previously only in dogs 11 months or older and
		because the source of the pup's infection may have been the dam rather than the
		environment.

		recipient.
PG	-	60-3
LID	-	10.3855/jidc.2479 [doi]
AB	-	Cellulitis is an unusual presentation of cryptococcal infection in renal
		"allograft recipients. In such patients, disseminated cryptococcal infection can"
		result in significant morbidity and mortality. Patients are often treated with
		"antibiotics before a definitive diagnosis is made, delaying appropriate therapy."
		We describe the case of a 43-year-old post renal transplant recipient presenting
		"with fever and swelling in the right thigh. On physical examination, the patient"
		was found to have features suggestive of cellulitis with minimal slurring of
		speech. Material obtained from incision and drainage of the wound showed yeast
		cells resembling Cryptococcus spp. Blood culture and cerebrospinal fluid culture
		were also found to have growth of Cryptococcus neoformans. He received treatment
		"with amphotericin B 6 mg/kg daily intravenously for two weeks, then continued"
		with fluconazole 400 mg daily for three months. The patient showed a remarkable
		improvement. There was no recurrence of cryptococcosis after four months of
		follow-up. The diagnosis of disseminated cryptococcosis should be considered in
		differential diagnosis of cellulitis among non HIV immunocompromised hosts. A
		high clinical suspicion and early initiation of therapy is needed to recognize
		and treat patients effectively.

		Treated with Fingolimod.
PG	-	3383-3386
AB	-	We herein report the case of a 63-year-old man who presented with a 3-month
		"history of a cutaneous nodular lesion of his jaw, low grade fever, lethargy and"
		progressive cognitive impairment. He had a 30-year history of multiple sclerosis
		and had been treated with fingolimod for the previous 2 years. Laboratory data
		revealed CD4 lymphocytopenia and a tissue culture of the skin nodule was positive
		for Cryptococcus neoformans. Cerebrospinal fluid and serum cryptococcal antigen
		tests were also positive and we diagnosed him to have disseminated
		cryptococcosis. This dissemination might be associated with fingolimod-induced
		CD4 lymphocytopenia. The risk of an opportunistic infection should therefore be
		considered when encountering fingolimod-treated patients.

PG	-	1396-8
AB	-	A 28-year-old male infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) developed
		a pleural empyema caused by Cryptococcus neoformans. He responded well to
		chest-tube drainage and antifungal therapy; he received fluconazole as
		maintenance therapy for 1 year and has not relapsed. We reviewed the
		English-language literature on cryptococcal pleural effusions in patients with
		"and without AIDS. Only three other cases of empyema, one of them in an"
		"HIV-infected patient, have been reported. A pleural-fluid cryptococcal antigen"
		test was diagnostic in our case and should be included in the diagnostic
		evaluation of unexplained pleural empyema/effusion in immunocompromised patients.

AB	-	We describe a case of central venous catheter-related fungemia caused by
		"Cryptococcus liquefaciens, a non-neoformans and non-gattii Cryptococcus, in a"
		non-HIV patient. A 71-year-old man with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma receiving
		antineoplastic chemotherapy was febrile approximately 30 weeks after central
		"venous port insertion, and C. liquefaciens was isolated from all three performed"
		blood cultures as well as a central venous catheter tip culture. In vitro
		antifungal susceptibility tests showed that this yeast isolate was susceptible to
		"low concentrations of amphotericin B, fluconazole, itraconazole and voriconazole"
		"yet was resistant to 5-fluorocytosine (MIC: >64 μg/ml), unlike Cryptococcus"
		neoformans. Treatment of the patient with oral and intravenous voriconazole was
		effective and consistent with the susceptibility tests. Although non-neoformans
		and non-gattii Cryptococcus spp. are considered non-pathogenic environmental
		"yeast, they may rarely be the causative agents of serious infections in humans,"
		as in the present case.

PG	-	566-8
AB	-	Individuals who are asplenic or have impaired splenic function are at increased
		"risk of developing life-threatening infections, especially due to encapsulated"
		"bacteria. This risk is higher in children, but adults can also develop fulminant"
		"infection or ""post splenectomy sepsis"" (PSS). Cryptococcus neoformans is an"
		encapsulated yeast usually causing infection in immunocompromised patients. In a
		"recent review of cryptococcal infection in HIV-negative patients, splenectomy was"
		reported to be a risk factor for infection in 3% of cases. Detailed case reports
		are lacking. Here we report a case of disseminated C. neoformans infection in a
		patient who had a splenectomy performed for warm autoantibody haemolytic anaemia
		some months before he presented with signs and symptoms of meningitis. This
		report aims to raise awareness of the possibility of C. neoformans infection in
		asplenic patients.

		lymphocytopenia: case report and literature review.
PG	-	862
LID	-	10.1186/s12879-019-4453-x [doi]
LID	-	862
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia (ICL) is a rare clinical disease with
		relative CD4 deficiency in the absence of HIV infection. The pathogenicity of ICL
		is poorly understood with an unclear incidence rate in the general population.
		"Sequelae of ICL includes AIDS-defining infections, which most commonly includes"
		"Cryptococcus neoformans. Typically, C. neoformans infections present with CNS"
		"involvement but rarely with extra-CNS manifestations. Here, we present a rare"
		case of ICL with exclusively primary pulmonary cryptococcus and a review of the
		literature. CASE PRESENTATION: A 56-year-old female presented to our tertiary
		care hospital requiring a right hip open reduction intervention. The patient
		"became febrile during admission, prompting a work-up that included a chest X-ray"
		showing a peripheral pulmonary solitary nodule. Transthoracic biopsy revealed
		"encapsulated yeast forms in keeping with C. neoformans. CD4 counts, repeated at"
		"least one month apart, were < 200 cells/mm(3), with negative HIV testing. Flow"
		cytometry and genetic testing were completed to elucidate the etiology of the
		"immune deficiency, both of which were unremarkable. She was subsequently treated"
		with 12 months of posaconazole with clinical resolution. CONCLUSIONS: Our patient
		"highlights a rare clinical disease, which a review of literature revealed only"
		five cases in the literature with exclusive pulmonary Cryptococcus in ICL/ This
		case demonstrates the strong clinical acumen required to properly diagnose and
		ultimately manage the patient.

TI	-	An unusual case of cryptococcal endophthalmitis.
PG	-	300-4
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Cryptococcal endophthalmitis is a rare disorder, almost invariably"
		diagnosed after enucleation or at postmortem examination. There are therefore few
		guidelines as to its identification or treatment. METHODS: A case of
		culture-positive cryptococcal endophthalmitis in a patient with chronic uveitis
		was diagnosed by vitreous biopsy at the time of retinal detachment repair. The
		patient was treated with oral fluconazole for 5 months. All reported cases of
		cryptococcal endophthalmitis were reviewed and compared. RESULTS: After oral
		"fluconazole therapy, the patient was culture negative on repeat tap. Despite"
		"conversion to culture-negative status, however, visual acuity declined to hand"
		motions because of hyphema and hypotony. The organism was successfully identified
		"as a non-neoformans species, Cryptococcus laurentii, previously unreported as an"
		ocular pathogen. CONCLUSION: This unique case demonstrates that cryptococcal
		"disease can be diagnosed antemortem by vitreous biopsy, and should be added to"
		the differential diagnosis in cases of chronic smoldering uveitis. A
		non-neoformans organism is also identified for the first time as a cause of
		"ocular cryptococcosis. Fluconazole, used here for the only time of which we are"
		"aware to treat cryptococcal endophthalmitis, produced successful conversion to"
		culture negativity and resolution of the uveitis.

TI	-	Cryptococcosis in a bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) caused by
		Cryptococcus neoformans var. gattii.
PG	-	721-4
AB	-	We describe the first case of cryptococcosis caused by Cryptococcus neoformans
		var. gattii in a male Atlantic bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus). The
		"dolphin showed clinical signs of tachypnea, transient dyspnea, and mild"
		"tachycardia and developed multiple hyperechoic nodules, parenchymal"
		"consolidation, and thickening of pleura. A diagnosis of bronchopneumonia with"
		"pleuritis was made. Itraconazole therapy was implemented for 120 days, and trough"
		levels in serum were within or above the suggested therapeutic range. Titers of
		"cryptococcal antigen in serum increased eightfold during therapy, and the case"
		had a fatal outcome. Necropsy examination findings included enlarged pulmonary
		lymph nodes and extensive coalescing granulomatous lesions throughout both lungs.
		"Histologic examination revealed numerous, spherical to ellipsoidal,"
		"mucicarmine-positive, 3- to 14-microm, encapsulated, budding cells consistent"
		with C. neoformans. Culture of the lung tissue yielded colonies of C. neoformans.
		The isolate was urease positive and nitrate negative and exhibited phenoloxidase
		activity. It was positive on canavanine-glycine-bromothymol blue agar. When
		"tested by the Iatron serodiagnostic reagent kit (Iatron Laboratories, Inc.), it"
		was shown to belong to serotype B.

LID	-	297
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cerebral cryptococcomas is a rare form of central nervous system
		cryptococcosis. Most previous cases were mistaken for neoplasm before surgery. We
		present a case of cerebral cryptococcomas whose radiological profiles resembled
		"demyelinating disease, especially tumefactive demyelinating lesion. CASE"
		PRESENTATION: A 40-year-old male was admitted for 1-week-long unconsciousness.
		Brain MRI revealed a rim-enhanced mass within the corpus callosum body. Central
		nervous system demyelinating disease was suspected. Empirical corticosteroid
		"treatment led to some improvement, but his condition deteriorated 2 months later."
		Brain MRI revealed punctate new foci. Cryptococcus neoformans was detected in
		cerebrospinal fluid. Cryptococcus antigen test was positive in his current and
		previous cerebrospinal fluid samples. The patient died despite standard
		antifungal treatment. CONCLUSION: Diagnosis of cerebral cryptococcomas is
		challenging. It may mimic demyelinating diseases.

PG	-	692-5
AB	-	Cryptococcal skin lesions are found in 10 to 15% of patients with disseminated
		cryptococcosis. Primary skin inoculation by Cryptococcus neoformans is rare but
		has been reported. We report the first known case of primary cutaneous
		"cryptococcosis in a lung transplant recipient. Our patient, a 57-year-old man,"
		underwent left single-lung transplantation and presented with a nonhealing ulcer
		50 months later. Skin histopathology and culture confirmed C. neoformans. Serum
		and cerebrospinal fluid cryptococcal antigen tests were negative. The lesion
		"healed after treatment with fluconazole. To date, disseminated disease is not"
		evident. Primary cutaneous cryptococcosis has been reported in kidney and liver
		recipients but not in lung transplantation recipients. Nonhealing ulcers in
		immunocompromised patients mandate aggressive diagnostic procedures. Differential
		"diagnosis of these cutaneous lesions should consider fungi, including C."

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcosis is a disease of wide geographic distribution. It is
		"most critical when it affects immunocompromised patients, with AIDS, tuberculosis"
		or other diseases that require prolonged hospitalization. METHODS: This study
		"described a case report, molecular epidemiology, the phylogenetic relationship,"
		along with antifungal susceptibility test of a new ST 623 of C. neoformans
		"isolated in a patient with non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, from Manaus, Brazil. RESULTS:"
		The new C. neoformans was susceptible to all antifungal drugs tested. Our results
		showed that ST623 new clone has no evident evolutionary proximity to any other ST
		of the VNI subtype group identified in Brazil. CONCLUSIONS: In the context of
		"phylogenetic analysis, this new genotype belongs to VNI subtype, and"
		subsequencing complete genome studies are necessary to better understand the
		phylogenetic relationships amongst STs in this group.

TI	-	Pulmonary cryptococcosis and pituitary Cushing's disease.
PG	-	365-7
AB	-	Pulmonary cryptococcosis was diagnosed by examining smears obtained by
		fine-needle aspiration (FNA) in a patient with pituitary Cushing's disease. FNA
		allowed for rapid diagnosis and prompt treatment of a potentially serious
		infection. The patient fully recovered from her pulmonary disease. Although
		opportunistic infections may occur in patients with endogenous Cushing's
		"syndrome, it is rare to see such infections in the subset of patients with"
		pituitary Cushing's disease. Hypercortisolism associated with Cushing's syndrome
		appears to induce a transitory immune deficiency state and opens a window of
		opportunity for certain infectious agents such as Cryptococcus neoformans to
		"exploit. To our knowledge, this is the third such case reported in this clinical"
		"setting, and the first diagnosed by FNA."

LID	-	10.1055/s-0034-1387775 [doi]
AB	-	Here we report on a case of primary cryptococcal skin infection in an
		immunocompetent 8-year-old boy. The infection first manifested itself as a
		subcutaneous abscess around the proximal joint of his right thumb after a minor
		injury from contact with a thorny shrub. After surgical incision and drainage was
		"performed, Cryptococcus neoformans var. neoformans was the only pathogen cultured"
		from the lesion. An agglutination test for the capsular antigen in serum
		displayed negative results and the immunological work-up revealed no underlying
		"immunodeficiency. A ""watch and wait"" strategy - one without systemic antifungal"
		"treatment - was adopted and this resulted in uneventful healing. In summary,"
		primary cryptococcal skin infections in immunocompetent hosts may be managed
		successfully by surgical treatment in combination with careful clinical
		follow-up. This approach may help avoid unnecessary antimicrobial treatments.

PG	-	509-13
LID	-	10.2460/javma.234.4.509 [doi]
AB	-	"CASE DESCRIPTION: A 12-year-old 500-kg (1,100-lb) American Quarter Horse mare was"
		"evaluated because of chronic mucopurulent, bloody discharge from the left"
		"nostril, inspiratory dyspnea, and respiratory noise. CLINICAL FINDINGS: The horse"
		had severe inspiratory dyspnea and stertorous respiration with no airflow from
		the left nostril. A temporary tracheostomy was performed. Endoscopy revealed a
		tan mass protruding from the left middle nasal meatus into the left common nasal
		meatus; it extended caudally into the nasopharynx and around the caudal edge of
		"the nasal septum into the right nasal cavity. Radiographically, a soft tissue"
		opacity was evident in most of the left nasal cavity and left paranasal sinuses.
		Cytologic examination of mass tissue revealed evidence of pyogranulomatous
		"rhinitis; thickly encapsulated, budding yeast typical of Cryptococcus neoformans"
		were detected. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME: While the horse was sedated and in a
		"standing position, the fungal granuloma was removed from the paranasal sinuses."
		"Treatment with fluconazole (5 mg/kg [2.27 mg/lb], PO, q 24 h for 4 weeks) was"
		initiated; enilconazole (50 mL of a 10% solution) was instilled into the
		"paranasal sinuses every other day (7 lavages). Six weeks after surgery, infection"
		had not recurred and epithelialization appeared normal in the left paranasal
		sinuses. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In horses with cryptococcosis of the paranasal
		"sinuses, surgical removal of granulomatous lesions and systemic and topical"
		administrations of antifungal drugs may be curative. Successful surgery may be
		performed in standing horses. Concommitant removal of a large portion of the
		conchae allows follow-up rhinoscopic evaluation of the paranasal sinuses.

		a case report.
PG	-	693
LID	-	10.1186/s12879-018-3573-z [doi]
LID	-	693
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Highly active antiretroviral therapy has significantly changed the
		"natural history of HIV infection, leading to a dramatic reduction of HIV-related"
		"morbidity and mortality. Late Presenters, Very Late Presenters and AIDS"
		"presenters still represent, also in Europe, including Italy, a huge challenge in"
		terms of diagnostic and therapeutic management. CASE PRESENTATION: A 35-year-old
		male with a history of fever and back pain. HIV test resulted positive with a
		high HIV Viral Load and a very low T-CD4 number of cells (5 cells/mm(3)). Imaging
		investigations revealed multiple vertebral and pulmonary lesions together with
		abdominal and thoracic lymphadenopathy. Blood cultures were positive for
		Cryptococcus neoformans and for Staphylococcus haemolyticus. Lymphnode biopsy
		resulted positive in PCR for Non-Tuberculosis Mycobacteria (Mycobacterium
		chelonae). A gastric biopsy also revealed a GIST. The patient also had CMV DNA
		positive. Although we performed antiretroviral therapy and specific-therapies for
		"each disease, he was transferred to intensive care unit where he died due to an"
		Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. CONCLUSION: The reported case is unusual due
		to the relevant number of opportunistic diseases (both infectious and tumoral)
		emerging not long after the HIV infection had been diagnosed. Late presenters HIV
		"patients and AIDS presenters still represent a challenge, which is often too"
		"complex for clinicians to deal with. In spite of proper management, the risk of"
		suboptimal results cannot be excluded.

PG	-	53-7
AB	-	We prospectively collected laboratory details and outcome data on all patients
		with laboratory-confirmed cases of meningitis that presented to our unit in
		"Blantyre, Malawi, from 1 April 1998 through 31 March 1999. There were 502"
		patients with cases of meningitis; the most common causative organisms were
		Cryptococcus neoformans and Streptococcus pneumoniae. This pattern probably
		reflects the local human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seroprevalence (31%) and is
		"different from the pattern in 1974, when Neisseria meningitidis was the most"
		common isolate. There has been an 8-fold increase in the number of meningitis
		"cases per year since 1974, and a doubling of the percentage of medical admissions"
		due to meningitis. The inpatient mortality rate among patients with cases of
		"pneumococcal meningitis was 61%, and in the group as a whole was 41%. Despite the"
		HIV-related pattern of infecting pathogens among these cases of meningitis and
		"the increased incidence of the condition, there was evidence that the typical"
		"seasonal pattern of pneumococcal meningitis, which peaks in the cold, dry season,"
		was preserved.

AB	-	Cryptococcal osteomyelitis is extremely rare and almost always occurs in
		immunocompromised patients. We describe a case of osteomyelitis due to
		Cryptococcus neoformans involving both scapula and rib in an immunocompetent and
		previously healthy patient. The patient received treatment with amphotericin B
		"deoxycholate and flucytosine for 4 weeks, followed by oral fluconazole 400 mg per"
		day for 8 weeks and 200 mg per day for 9 months. The 12-month course of
		antifungal therapy resulted in complete clinical recovery and undetectable serum
		cryptococcal antigen. Cryptococcal osteomyelitis should be suspected in any
		immunocompetent patient with osteolytic lesions on radiological images.

PG	-	260-3
LID	-	10.1177/0300985812451623 [doi]
AB	-	Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii was identified at necropsy in a case of
		"bilateral otitis interna in a 7-year-old, female, domestic shorthair cat with a"
		"9-day history of acute onset of vestibular disease. Gross examination, including"
		"that of the middle and inner ears, was unremarkable. Histologically, the"
		"auricular vestibuli, cochleae, and semicircular canals were bilaterally affected"
		by granulomatous inflammation with extracellular and intrahistiocytic yeasts. The
		yeasts and associated inflammation obstructed and disrupted perilymphatic and
		endolymphatic spaces of the inner ears. Disruption of the saccular and utricular
		"maculae, cristae ampularis, and organ of Corti, as well as changes in the"
		"endolymphatic and perilymphatic fluids, probably impaired the vestibular and"
		auditory functions of this cat. The route of infection was most likely
		hematogenous.

		of ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma: A case report.
PG	-	e7124
LID	-	10.1097/MD.0000000000007124 [doi]
LID	-	e7124
AB	-	RATIONALE: Microbial infection should be regarded in the differential diagnosis
		of neurosurgical complications after transnasal transsphenoidal pituitary
		"microsurgery, albeit cryptococcal meningitis is rare. This article will discuss"
		the risk factors of cryptococcal meningitis in patients underwent transnasal
		"transsphenoidal pituitary microsurgery, and summary the potential origins of"
		"infection. PATIENT CONCERNS AND DIAGNOSIS: Here, we report a case of 37-year-old"
		male who had cryptococcal meningitis after transnasal transsphenoidal pituitary
		microsurgery of a relapsing ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma. INTERVENTION:
		Standard therapy for Cryptococcus neoformans (fluconazole [400 mg per day] and
		flucytosine) was administered and followed by maintenance dose. OUTCOMES: The
		patient had been on treatment for one and a half years during follow-up and
		reported neurologically well with repeated negative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
		culture until sudden death of heart arrest. MAIN LESSONS TO LEARN: C neoformans
		can be a possible cause of meningitis in immunocompetent patients after
		"transnasal transsphenoidal pituitary microsurgery. Risk factors, such as"
		"pre-existed pulmonary infection and Cushing-associated hypercortisolemia, should"
		be stressed. Promising preventive measures may include preoperative routine
		"sputum smear and India-ink stain for screening, preoperative treatment of"
		"cryptococcal pneumonia, postoperative antibiotic management, and a more secure"
		skull base reconstruction. Radiation and pharmaceutical treatment may be
		alternative for recurrent Cushing disease.

AB	-	A 52-year-old man without underlying diseases visited a local hospital with
		symptoms of memory deficit and mild headache. Radiological examination of the
		brain with computed tomography (CT) revealed hydrocephalus. Etiology was not
		revealed by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and a ventricular-atrial (V-A)
		shunt was installed. The patient had congestion and dacryorrhea of the right eye
		and uveitis was diagnosed three months after placement of the V-A shunt. The
		serum cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) tested positive at a titration of 64 times.
		"Additionally, samples of the right eye anterior chamber aqueous humor (ACAH),"
		cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and prostate fluid were positive for Cryptococcus
		"antigen at a titration of 128 times. In addition, Cryptococcus neoformans var."
		"grubii was isolated from the peripheral blood, CSF and ACAH, resulting in a"
		diagnosis of disseminated cryptococcosis. Fluconazole (FLCZ) at 800 mg/day was
		"administered for the first two days, followed by a 400 mg/day maintenance dose."
		"After six months of treatment, his visual power recovered. This is a rare case of"
		"disseminated cryptococcosis involving uveitis, which was successfully treated by"
		FLCZ. Disseminated cryptococcosis should be considered in cases with mild
		symptoms and V-A shunt installation for hydrocephalus.

AB	-	A case of disseminated cryptococcosis caused by Cryptococcus neoformans var.
		grubii is presented in a male diabetic who had AIDS. The diagnosis was based upon
		the isolation and identification of the aetiological agent from a lymph-node
		"biopsy, cerebrospinal fluid and sputum. The isolate formed spherical,"
		"encapsulated yeast cells, produced cherry-brown colonies on niger-seed agar, grew"
		"on canavanine-glycine-bromothymol blue (CGB) medium, changing its colour from"
		"greenish yellow to blue, and hydrolysed urea weakly in the presence of 100 microM"
		"EDTA. The strain was unable to assimilate D-proline and, serologically, it was"
		"untypable. The identity of the isolate as C. neoformans var. grubii, serotype A,"
		"possessing a mating-type allele A alpha, was confirmed by crossing with standard"
		laboratory test strains and by performing PCR with the mating-type alpha
		allele-specific primer of the STE12 gene and with serotype (A and D)- and mating
		type (a and alpha)-specific primers of the STE20 gene. To the best of our
		"knowledge, this is the first report of disseminated cryptococcosis in an AIDS"
		"patient caused by a canavanine-resistant strain of C. neoformans var. grubii,"
		"serotype A, possessing mating type allele A alpha; the strain is probably a"
		"hybrid. The report suggests that, in the absence of a clear-cut serotyping"
		"result, a positive CGB reaction alone is not sufficient for intervarietal"
		discrimination and additional confirmatory evidence is required.

AB	-	Cryptococcosis occurs primarily in immunocompromised patients such as organ
		transplant recipients. Central nervous system and pulmonary infections are
		documented most frequently; hepatic involvement is rarely reported. We report a
		case of early hepatic cryptococcosis in a 54-year-old male liver transplant
		"recipient. Two weeks after orthotopic liver transplant, he was readmitted with"
		"fever, malaise, diarrhea, and progressive pulmonary infiltrates. On admission,"
		liver-associated enzymes were decreased from those at discharge after
		transplantation. Blood and bronchoalveolar lavage cultures were positive for
		"Cryptococcus neoformans. Despite treatment with amphotericin B and flucytosine,"
		the patient developed both marked cholestasis and transaminase elevation. A liver
		biopsy performed 22 days after admission revealed numerous yeast-like organisms
		"in hepatic sinusoids consistent with C. neoformans. Despite treatment, the"
		patient died 55 days after admission and 66 days after transplantation. Our case
		illustrates hepatic involvement of cryptococcal infection within the first month
		following transplantation.

TI	-	Asymptomatic pulmonary cryptococcosis in solid organ transplantation: report of
		four cases and review of the literature.
PG	-	140-3
AB	-	Cryptococcus neoformans is the third most common cause of invasive fungal
		infections in solid organ transplantation. The infection generally presents as
		"disseminated disease, involving multiple sites including the central nervous"
		"system, lungs, and skin. An increase in the incidence of primary pulmonary"
		cryptococcal infections has been reported recently in solid organ recipients;
		these infections were generally symptomatic with an accelerated clinical course.
		We report four cases of asymptomatic pulmonary cryptococcosis in solid organ
		"recipients (kidney, n=2, heart, n=2). In each case, an incidental finding on a"
		routine chest radiograph led to the microbiological or histopathological
		"diagnosis of invasive pulmonary C. neoformans infection. In these patients,"
		cryptococcosis occurred a median of 25 months (range 7-36 months) after organ
		"transplantation. All patients had a calcineurin inhibitor, prednisone, and"
		azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil as part of their immunosuppressive therapy
		at the time of diagnosis. Serum cryptococcal antigen was available and positive
		in the three patients studied; assessment of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of all
		four patients revealed no organisms by smear or culture. Therapy consisted of
		"oral fluconazole in all cases, with flucytosine in one case, combined with"
		resection of lung tissue in two individuals. All patients have remained free of
		"cryptococcal disease (follow-up median 42 months, from 18 to 88 months)."
		"Cryptococcal disease in solid organ recipients may present as asymptomatic,"
		localized pulmonary disease. The natural history of such infections is unknown.
		New pulmonary radiographic findings should prompt an aggressive diagnostic
		"evaluation including serum and CSF cryptococcal antigen assays, and a biopsy of"
		pulmonary lesions. Prolonged therapy may be used to reduce the risk of
		progression and dissemination during periods of intensified immune suppression.

		"Cryptococcal antigen was detected with a titre of 1024 by Latex agglutination, is"
		serum and CSF. Her serum was reactive for HIVI and 2 antibodies. The CD4
		"lymphocytes count was 80/cmm. The HIV viral load was 2,48,084 copies/mL. She was"
		treated with amphotericin B injectable and oral fluconazole. She responded well
		and lesions regressed.

TI	-	Intraventricular cryptococcal cysts masquerading as racemose neurocysticercosis.
PG	-	647-9
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcal infections of the CNS are infrequent in immunocompetent
		"hosts. When present, they usually present as meningitis and hydrocephalus or as"
		fungal masses called cryptococcomas. We report a case in which intraventricular
		cryptococcal cysts clinically and radiologically simulated the racemose form of
		neurocysticercosis. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 23-year-old man presented to the
		"emergency department with a 1-week history of severe headache, dizziness, nausea,"
		"vomiting, and some lethargy. A computed tomography scan revealed significant"
		hydrocephalus. The patient was admitted to the hospital and immediately underwent
		a right ventriculostomy tube placement. CSF examination showed a meningitic
		"pattern. Magnetic resonance imaging, including FLAIR images, showed multiple"
		large cysts in the temporal horns of both lateral ventricles in addition to
		hydrocephalus. When an endoscopic left temporal cyst fenestration failed to
		"decompress his trapped right temporal horn, he underwent placement of a left"
		lateral ventricle to peritoneal shunt and a right temporal cyst to peritoneal
		shunt. ELISA test results for HIV-1 and -2 antibodies in the patient's serum were
		negative. His CD4 and CD8 counts were within normal limits. Multiple tests for
		CSF anticysticercal antibody using IgG ELISA gave unequivocally negative results.
		Latex agglutination tests detected Cryptococcus neoformans antigen in his CSF in
		"titers of 1:1024, which progressively decreased in response to antifungal"
		"therapy. The patient underwent treatment with IV amphotericin B for 7 weeks, IV"
		"5-FC for 2 weeks, and oral fluconazole for 5 weeks. At discharge, 3 consecutive"
		CSF cultures were negative for bacteria and fungi. His neurologic status returned
		to baseline. CONCLUSIONS: Cryptococcal CNS infections in immunocompetent hosts
		can mimic the intraventricular form of racemose neurocysticercosis.
		Distinguishing between the two is essential because the medical management of the
		2 conditions is distinct from each other.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcosis is an opportunistic infection caused by the
		encapsulated yeast Cryptococcus neoformans and most remarkably manifests in
		"HIV-infected individuals, especially in the settings of very low CD4 count."
		Development of cryptococcosis in HIV-uninfected individuals is exceedingly rare
		and usually signifies a marked immunodeficiency. Cryptococcosis in association
		with myasthenia gravis or thymoma has been previously documented in only very few
		cases in the literature. CASE PRESENTATION: We reported a complicated case of
		severe cutaneous cryptococcosis in a 39-year-old Vietnamese male patient with
		myasthenia gravis on long-term immunosuppressive therapy. The patient presented
		with a five month history of recurrent and progressive skin lesions that later on
		"progressed into cryptococcal meningitis. CONCLUSION: Through this case, we aimed"
		to emphasize the importance of including cutaneous cryptococcosis in the
		differential diagnosis of cutaneous lesions in patients on chronic
		immunosuppressive therapy. The cutaneous manifestations of cryptococcosis can be
		"the first clue for a disseminated disease, which makes early recognition crucial"
		and life-saving.

TI	-	Ventriculoperitoneal shunt in cryptococcal meningitis with hydrocephalus.
PG	-	314-9
AB	-	Fourteen patients with cryptococcal meningitis were reviewed. All patients had a
		ventriculoperitoneal shunt for hydrocephalus. Early recognitions and prompt
		relief of hydrocephalus were useful for eight patients who showed rapid
		deterioration of consciousness or signs of cerebral herniation. There was no
		surgical response in four patients who had had weeks of confusion or mental
		"change. It seems, therefore, that the duration of disturbance of consciousness or"
		change of mentality before shunting is critical in determination of the outcome
		of the treatment. Ventricular shunting was effective in relieving papilledema in
		"five patients. However, the surgery did not prevent the development of"
		"papilledema to optic atrophy and subsequent blindness in two patients. Hence, in"
		"addition to hydrocephalus with increased intracranial pressure, conditions such"
		as direct invasion of the optic pathways by Cryptococcus neoformans or
		optochiasmatic arachnoiditis may be responsible for the visual failure.
		Ventricular shunting was also helpful in restoring paraparesis in one patient. Of
		"the cerebrospinal fluid determinations, low protein concentration was a favorable"
		indicator for surgery. Of the seven patients who received the surgical procedure
		"before the start of antifungal therapy, four showed a significant improvement"
		despite active infection of the central nervous system. None of the seven
		"patients deteriorated because of the surgical operation. Thus, active stage of"
		"cryptococcal meningitis does not contraindicate the necessity of shunting, and"
		"premedication with antifungal drugs is unnecessary. Also, no shunt-related"
		morbidity and mortality was seen in this study.

TI	-	A case of feline cryptococcosis treated with itraconazole.
PG	-	381-3
AB	-	We successfully treated a feline case of cryptococcosis with itraconazole (ITZ)
		at a lower dosage. The patient was a 2-year-old castrated male Abyssinian cat
		weighing 4.1 kg and with two masses on the head. Clinical signs were sneezing and
		nasal discharge. The plasma cryptococcal antigen titer measured by the latex
		agglutination test was proved to be high (512). The biopsy specimen from the
		masses disclosed yeast cells which were cultured and identified to be
		Cryptococcus neoformans. The cat was treated with ITZ 5 mg kg-1 given orally once
		"a day with food. After 4 weeks, treatment of ITZ discontinued, because the cat"
		"was clinically normal and the antigen titer was low (128). However, about 7"
		"months later, a subcutaneous nodule was detected on the same area. The nasal"
		"discharge appeared again, and the cryptococcal antigen titer was 256. ITZ"
		treatment was continued again at the same dosage for 3 months until the antigen
		"titer was negative (< 8). Four months after discontinuation of ITZ, the cat did"
		not relapse and the antigen titer was in the negative range. No side-effects of
		ITZ were detected by physical and laboratory examination.

		"responding to broad-spectrum antibiotic regimens. In our case, prompt diagnosis"
		and treatment could dramatically modify the outcome.

AB	-	A case of cryptococcal meningitis in a patient with the acquired immunodeficiency
		"syndrome (AIDS) is described, as well as the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical"
		"manifestations, diagnosis, and therapeutic management of the disease. In July"
		"1987 a 38-year-old white man was admitted to the hospital because of confusion,"
		"disorientation, and headache. His medical history was notable for a positive"
		human immunodeficiency virus test. Culture of the cerebrospinal fluid was
		positive for Cryptococcus neoformans. The patient was started on amphotericin B
		16 mg/day (0.3 mg/kg/day) intravenously and flucytosine 2 g every six hours (150
		"mg/kg/day) orally. Despite premedication with diphenhydramine and acetaminophen,"
		he experienced rigors that were treated with hydrocortisone and meperidine. Three
		weeks later he was discharged on flucytosine 2 g orally every six hours and
		amphotericin B 50 mg intravenously every other day. One week later the patient
		developed fever and chills; blood cultures were positive for
		"methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, and his peripheral leucocyte count"
		"was 1.8 X 10(3)/cu mm. Flucytosine was discontinued, and he was treated with"
		intravenous nafcillin while remaining on amphotericin B. In October the patient
		"complained of nausea, vomiting, weakness, and agitation. A CSF latex"
		agglutination titer for cryptococcal antigen was 1:32. He was treated with
		amphotericin B 50 mg daily until symptoms resolved and then continued on
		amphotericin B 50 mg twice weekly. Cryptococcosis is the most common
		life-threatening fungal infection among AIDS patients. In contrast to
		"immunocompetent hosts, this population invariably develops disseminated disease,"
		with 85% having meningeal involvement. The most effective therapy for
		cryptococcal meningitis in patients with AIDS has not been established.(ABSTRACT

AB	-	Central nervous system (CNS) involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is
		"reported in about 50% of patients. Among the neuropsychiatric features of SLE,"
		"myelopathy, including acute transverse myelitis (ATM) or acute longitudinal"
		"myelitis (ALM), represents an uncommon event. A possible vascular aetiology of"
		SLE myelopathies has been hypothesized and it seems to be much more associated to
		"SLE-associated antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). Furthermore, a possible"
		infectious cause of ATM or ALM in healthy subjects has been described. SLE
		patients are susceptible to infection due to the disease itself or to the
		immunosuppressive therapy. Cryptococci non-neoformans have been rarely associated
		to infections in humans. Here we describe the case of a 47-year-old woman with
		SLE and Sjögren Syndrome who developed an ALM concurrently with a Cryptococcus
		"laurentii pneumonia. The patient was treated with antimycotics, high doses of"
		glucocorticoids and intravenous immunoglobulins with a significant clinical and
		"radiological improvement. As far as we know, this is the first case of"
		Cryptococcus laurentii infection and ALM in a patient with SLE who later
		developed a seronegative APS. Even though myelopathy may be considered primarily
		"associated to SLE, a possible role of the infection in ALM development cannot be"
		excluded.

		there were large numbers of pigeons. This animal was referred for examination
		with progressive paralysis and shown to be free from feline immunodeficiency
		"virus, feline leukaemia virus, feline coronavirus and Toxoplasma gondii. It died"
		"2 months later. At necropsy, the only lesion detected was a malacic area, 4cm in"
		"length, in the spinal cord. Histopathological examination of the spinal cord"
		revealed severe granulomatous inflammation associated with large numbers of
		"encapsulated yeast cells. In addition to the granulomatous host response,"
		"necrosis, digestion chambers, Gitter cells, spheroids and lymphocytic"
		perivascular cuffs were features of the malacic areas. Immunohistochemistry
		confirmed the presence of Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii yeast cells.

PG	-	691-5
LID	-	10.1017/S002221511600801X [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Sensorineural hearing loss is a recognised complication of
		cryptococcal meningitis. The mechanism of hearing loss in patients with
		cryptococcal meningitis is different from that in bacterial meningitis. CASE
		REPORT: An immune-competent man with cryptococcal meningitis presented with
		"sudden onset, bilateral, severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss and"
		vestibular dysfunction. He was initially evaluated for cochlear implantation.
		"However, he had a significant recovery; he no longer required surgery and was"
		"able to cope without a hearing aid. CONCLUSION: Typically, cochlear implantation"
		is performed with some urgency in patients with hearing loss post-bacterial
		"meningitis, because of the risk of labyrinthitis ossificans. However, this"
		process has not been described in patients with cryptococcal meningitis.
		"Furthermore, patients with hearing loss associated with cryptococcal meningitis"
		"have shown varying degrees of reversibility. In this case report, hearing loss"
		"from cryptococcal meningitis is compared with that from bacterial meningitis, and"
		the need for cochlear implantation in patients with cryptococcal meningitis is
		discussed.

TI	-	Cryptococcal meningitis in patients with acquired immunudeficiency syndrome in
		prehaart era at Gondar College of Medical Sciences Hospital north-west Ethiopia.
PG	-	237-41
AB	-	BACKGROUND: CIyptococcal meningitis is an important opportunistic funimgal
		infection that became very common after the era of HIV infection. OBJECTIVES: To
		determine the magnitude of Clyptococcal meningitis and study the clinical pattern
		among inpatients with HV infection at Gondar Hospital. METHODS: A descriptive
		study was done among ELISA confirmed admitted HIV patients. Clinically suspected
		cases of meningitis underwent lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal fluid analysis.
		The clinical profile and outcomes of the confirmed Cryptococcal meningitis cases
		were described. RESULTS: Among 375 HIV serology positive patients 31 were
		confirmed to have Cryptococcal meningitis. Their median age was 29 years (range
		16-64); and 22 were males. The major manifestation at presentation included
		"headache and fever each in 90% malaise (65%), stiffness of the neck (48%),"
		"altered Mentation (32%) and nausea and vomiting (32%), photophobia (23%) and"
		seizure (3.6%). Median duration of illness was 16 days; ranging from 1-40 days.
		Temperature was above 38.4 degreees C in 80%. Meningial signs were observed in
		32% altered Mentation was noted in 29% and focal neurologic deficit in 19%
		Cerebrospinal fluid examination revealed visually increased pressure (measured
		opening pressure >200 mmH2O in six patients) in 81% glucose < 50 mg/dl (50-70 mg/
		dl) in 55% Protein >40 mg/dl (15-40 mg/dl) in 35% leukocytes count < 20/mm3 (poor
		prognostic sign) in 58% Indian ink staining detected encapsulated yeasts in 71%
		C. neoformans was cultivated in 90% of sample. Highest case fatality rate of the
		disease was observed during the pre HAART era. CONCLUSION: Cryptococcal
		Meningitis is common among patients with immune-suppression. It could be the
		initial manifestation of HIV infection and should be suspected in any potential
		HIV infected patient with neurological symptoms especially headache and fever. As
		"it has highest case fatality rate, early diagnosis and prompt therapy is strongly"
		recommended Better treatment options like boosting their immunity with HAART
		should also be investigated

AB	-	Here we report an unusual case of disseminated cryptococcosis in a patient with
		AIDS. Although typical Cryptococcus neoformans micromorphology was observed in
		"tongue biopsy, cervical lymph node examination revealed atypical histopathologic"
		"findings. These included pseudohyphae, chains of budding yeasts and structures"

PG	-	692-9
AB	-	A female southern right whale (Eubalaena australis) neonate was found stranded on
		the Western Cape coast of southern Africa. Skin samples were taken the same day
		from three different locations on the animal's body and stored at -20 C.
		Isolation through repetitive culture of these skin sections yielded a single
		"yeast species, Candida zeylanoides. Total genomic DNA also was isolated directly"
		from skin samples. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of the internal transcribed
		spacer region of the fungal ribosomal gene cluster revealed the presence of
		"Filobasidiella neoformans var. neoformans, the teleomorphic state of Cryptococcus"
		neoformans. Fungal infections in cetaceans seem to be limited when compared to
		"infections caused by bacteria, viruses and parasites. However, Candida species"
		appear to be the most common type of fungal infection associated with cetaceans.
		To our knowledge this is the first report of a C. zeylanoides infection in a
		"mysticete, as well as the first report of a dual infection involving two"
		opportunistic pathogenic yeast species in a cetacean.

TI	-	Cryptococcoma of a transplanted kidney in a patient presenting with recurrent
		urinary tract infection: a case report.
PG	-	94

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcosis is an important opportunistic infection of organ
		transplant recipients. It is the third most common fungal infection of transplant
		patients and occurs especially in kidney recipients. Cryptococcus neoformans is a
		ubiquitous fungus which infects humans by inhalation of spores. C. gattii has
		more recently been recognised as a pathogen. Infection commonly is disseminated
		"affecting mainly the central nervous system and the lungs. Cryptococcoma, a"
		"localised form of the disease, has been described in various organs. We present a"
		unique case of a cryptococcoma in a transplanted kidney. The lesion was not seen
		on ultrasound or uncontrasted computerised tomography but was detected by
		FDG-PET/CT. CASE PRESENTATION: A 30 year old woman received a deceased donor
		"kidney transplant in 2005. Due to chronic allograft nephropathy in 2014,"
		cyclosporine and azathioprine immunosuppression was changed to tacrolimus and
		mycophenolate. After rapid deterioration of renal function in 2015 due to
		"suspected non-adherence to immunosuppressants, steroid pulses were administered."
		The patient developed severe recurrent bacterial urinary tract infections and
		demonstrated several features of severe immunosuppression. She was treated for
		cytomegalovirus infection and BK virus was demonstrated in the urine. In
		"addition, Kaposi sarcoma of the stomach was diagnosed on endoscopic biopsy. A"
		metabolically-active lesion of the kidney transplant was imaged on FDG-PET/CT
		scan. Biopsy of the lesion demonstrated infection with cryptococcus. Escherichia
		coli with the same antibiotic sensitivity spectrum as that in the urine was
		cultured from the biopsy. Cryptococcus was not cultured from urine at that time
		or from several subsequent specimens. The lesion was not detected by conventional
		imaging. The patient manifested no other evidence of cryptococcosis. The lesion
		responded poorly to treatment with fluconazole. CONCLUSIONS: This is probably the
		first report of a case of a cryptococcoma in a transplanted organ. FDG-PET/CT
		"scan, which is dependent on cellular metabolism, proved useful in visualising the"
		lesion. Clinicians should be aware of this rare presentation of cryptococcosis in
		organ transplant recipients.

TI	-	Cryptococcosis presenting as anterior neck swelling in an immunocompetent man: a
		case report.
PG	-	1130-2
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcosis is caused by the encapsulated opportunistic yeast
		Cryptococcus neoformans. An immunocompromised host is more susceptible to the
		"survival and dissemination of this yeast, which can occur to almost all organs of"
		"the body, especially the central nervous system, lungs, bone marrow,"
		"gastrointestinal tract, retina, and reticuloendothelial system. However, there"
		are few reports of Cryptococcus causing infections ir immunocompetent hosts.
		CASE: A 70-year-old immunocompe tent man presented with swelling in the anterior
		"neck region, which was diagnosed as cryptococcosis by fine needle aspiration"
		"cytology. CONCLUSION: Fine needle aspiration cytology plays a rapid, useful and"
		"important role in the diagnosis of cryptococcosis infection, especially in"
		"clinically unsuspected cases, and helps in timely therapeutic intervention."

AB	-	We report three cases of meningo-encephalitis caused by Cryptococcous neoformans
		var. gattii in apparently immunocompetent children presenting to a provincial
		hospital in Papua New Guinea (PNG) over a nine-month period. After a postmortem
		"diagnosis was made in the first case, a further two were identified quickly using"
		Indian ink staining of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The second case had a
		complicated course and recovered after relapse. The third made a full recovery
		with appropriate antifungal therapy. Despite the fact that an environmental
		"reservoir has not been established, cryptococcal meningo-encephalitis occurs"
		"regularly in PNG. In developing countries such as PNG, a lack of laboratory"
		resources and limited therapeutic options can complicate the management of severe
		"infections such as cryptococcosis. Nevertheless, with inexpensive diagnostic"
		"tests (such as Indian ink staining of CSF), a high index of suspicion and a"
		"pragmatic approach to antifungal therapy, good therapeutic outcomes can be"
		achieved.

TI	-	Cutaneous cryptococcosis: recurrence following oral fluconazole treatment.
PG	-	93-6
AB	-	A case of recurrent cutaneous cryptococcosis in an immunocompromised patient is
		described. The patient presented with a non-healing cutaneous ulcer due to
		infection with Cryptococcus neoformans. Extensive investigation failed to reveal
		any evidence of associated systemic cryptococcosis. Treatment with oral
		fluconazole resulted in complete resolution of the ulcer but after several months
		"a second cutaneous cryptococcal lesion appeared, strongly suggesting"
		dissemination from an underlying systemic focus. This case illustrates the
		hazards associated with making a diagnosis of isolated cutaneous cryptococcosis
		and the necessity for prolonged follow-up of patients who present in this way.

TI	-	Primary cutaneous cryptococcosis and secondary antigenemia in a patient with
		long-term corticosteroid therapy.
PG	-	86-9
AB	-	We report a case of a 71-year-old male who developed severe cellulitis of his
		right forearm and hand after he had an accidental injury from the sharp edge of a
		metal plate of a birdhouse. The patient suffers from chronic asthma and has been
		treated with systemic corticosteroids for years. Culture of aspirates from two
		sites of the wound area revealed growth of Cryptococcus neoformans in one and
		Acinetobacter lwoffii in the other. After combined treatment including
		"antibiotics, antifungal therapy with fluconazole 400 mg/d and surgical"
		"debridement followed by a mesh graft, the patient achieved complete healing of"
		"the wound. Five months after the infection, the patient was still positive for"
		cryptococcal antigen at a titer of 1:64 despite oral treatment with fluconazole
		"50 mg/d, and maintenance therapy with fluconazole 200 mg/d was recommended for 6"
		"months, or longer depending on further results. The clinical and microbiological"
		characteristics of this patient as well as therapeutical and epidemiological
		aspects of primary cutaneous cryptococcosis (PCC) are discussed.

TI	-	Cryptococcosis in ferrets: a diverse spectrum of clinical disease.
PG	-	749-55
AB	-	Cryptococcosis was diagnosed in seven ferrets (five from Australia; two from
		western Canada) displaying a wide range of clinical signs. Two of the ferrets
		lived together. One (5-years-old) had cryptococcal rhinitis and presented when
		the infection spread to the nasal bridge. Its sibling developed cryptococcal
		"abscessation of the right retropharyngeal lymph node 12 months later, soon after"
		developing a severe skin condition. DNA fingerprinting and microsatellite
		analysis demonstrated that the two strains isolated from these siblings were
		indistinguishable. Two ferrets (2- to 3-years-old) developed generalised
		"cryptococcosis: one had primary lower respiratory tract disease with pneumonia,"
		"pleurisy and mediastinal lymph node involvement, while in the other a segment of"
		intestine was the primary focus of infection with subsequent spread to mesenteric
		"lymph nodes, liver and lung. The remaining three ferrets (1.75 to 4-years-old)"
		"had localised disease of a distal limb, in one case with spread to the regional"
		lymph node. Cryptococcus bacillisporus (formerly C. neoformans var gattii)
		accounted for three of the four infections in Australian ferrets where the
		biotype could be determined. The Australian ferret with intestinal involvement
		and the two ferrets from Vancouver had C. neoformans var grubii infections.

PG	-	e160-2
AB	-	Cryptococcosis is an invasive fungal infection that occurs worldwide. Infections
		caused by Cryptococcus (C.) neoformans are commonly associated with
		"immunocompromised patients, while those caused by C. gattii predominantly affect"
		"immunocompetent hosts. However, the latter has also been increasingly reported in"
		immunocompromised patients such as those with HIV. Cutaneous involvement by C.
		"gattii in immunocompetent patients is a rare manifestation, with only a few cases"
		"reported worldwide. C. gattii infection has rarely been reported in Singapore,"
		with all three reported cases presenting as meningitis in immunocompetent
		"individuals. Its natural habitat is the Eucalyptus tree, which is common in"
		Singapore. We report the case of a 37-year-old migrant worker who had primary
		cutaneous infection due to C. gattii after sustaining traumatic inoculation.

AB	-	Cryptococcosis is a disseminated fungal disease typically associated with
		immunosuppression and characterized by high mortality rates. Cryptococcus
		neoformans has been reported to be isolated from blood cultures in around 20% of
		"patients with cryptococcosis, and cryptococcemia has been correlated with poor"
		prognosis. We report a case of fatal C. neoformans fungemia in a neutropenic
		patient with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia treated with alemtuzumab.
		The patient presented with loss of consciousness and died after 5 days of

PG	-	82-90
AB	-	We analyzed the data collected during a nationwide survey of cryptococcosis
		(1985-1993). We first checked the quality of the survey. The stability of its
		completeness (approximately 50%) and its representativity were assessed by the
		capture-recapture method after we cross-checked our data on cryptococcosis (as a
		presenting manifestation of AIDS) against those of the national registry of AIDS.
		"Of the 1,057 cases of cryptococcosis (1,013 patients), 827 (86%) involved"
		patients with AIDS. The increasing number of cases of human immunodeficiency
		virus (HIV)-related cryptococcosis over time paralleled the AIDS epidemic except
		"for a higher male-to-female ratio. Malignancies (32%), organ transplantation"
		"(19%), and corticosteroid therapy (33%) were the main predisposing conditions in"
		163 patients without AIDS. Cryptococcal meningitis more frequently occurred in
		patients with AIDS than in HIV-negative patients (P < 10(-6)). Among the 413
		"isolates available for serotyping, 410 were Cryptococcus neoformans variety"
		neoformans (including 20.5% of serotype D). Three isolates of the variety gattii
		(serotype B) were recovered from patients without AIDS.

AB	-	Cryptococcosis is a well recognized infection in immunocompromised patients.
		Cryptococcal infection primarily involves the lung and is hematogeneously spread
		to other organs. Sometimes it might affect the genitourinary tract. The prostate
		gland is a rare site of primary infection due to cryptococcus neoformans. We
		report a case of granulomatous inflammation in the prostate as a result of
		"crypyococcus neoformans infection in a 70 year old immunocompetent patient, a non"
		"diabetic, which was diagnosed by transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy."

PG	-	369-73
AB	-	The open questions of the persistence of Cryptococcus neoformans in the
		urogenital tract under antimycotic treatment can be examined under optimal
		mycological-diagnostic conditions only. The example of a case of cryptococcosis
		in an AIDS patient diagnosed and treated with itraconazole in the early secondary
		stage of cryptococcosis is used to discuss the problems of the persistence of Cr.
		neoformans involvement in the urogenital tract (prostate). Data from a ten-week
		follow-up study are presented and discussed. The observations made have shown
		"that itraconazole is effective in all regions of the body, with the exception of"
		"the urogenital tract. In addition to clinical examinations, cases treated with"
		itraconazole should be finally subjected to cultural examination of prostatic
		"secretion and/or seminal fluid, to exclude the possible presence of a"
		symptom-free involvement of the prostate by Cr. neoformans.

AB	-	Cryptococcal meningitis was diagnosed in a 71-year-old male diabetic patient with
		"underlying ischaemic heart disease, asthma and bilateral axillo-femoral vascular"
		"grafts. After treatment with fluconazole for 2 months, the patient appeared to be"
		cured. Two years later he presented with an aneurysm of the right graft that was
		resected and replaced with a new graft segment. Cryptococcus neoformans var.
		neoformans was grown from post-operative blood cultures and samples of the
		excised graft. The patient was treated with fluconazole and discharged after 6
		"weeks. Multiple isolates from both episodes had been preserved, and these,"
		"together with isolates from other UK patients, were cultured in duplicate, blind"
		coded and characterised by pyrolysis mass spectrometry (PMS). Duplicate culture
		"and re-isolate sets formed tight clusters, with each patient set clearly"
		distinct. Sets of isolates from the two episodes in this patient formed a single
		tight cluster and were indistinguishable by PMS. These results support the
		contention that C. neoformans infection can be reactivated after being dormant
		for a prolonged period.

PG	-	1460-1
AB	-	We report a case of chronic meningitis due to capsule-deficient Cryptococcus
		neoformans which could not be diagnosed by routine morphological and
		immunological cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination. Repeated CSF examination and
		"culture did not disclose the fungal body, and the cryptococcal antigen tests were"
		always negative. Culture of ventricular fluid showed non-encapsulated cultured
		cells which were stained positively by indirect immunofluorescence using diluted
		sera from another patient diagnosed with cryptococcal meningitis. Inoculation of
		dispersed colonies into mice resulted in encapsulated C neoformans. It is
		important to suspect capsule-deficient C neoformans when the conventional
		diagnostic approaches fail to identify the organism or antigens.

		Disseminated disease is uncommon and very rarely manifests as peritonitis. We
		"report a case of cryptococcal peritonitis in a HIV positive patient, who"
		"presented with distention of abdomen, vomiting, and dyspnoea, where the diagnosis"
		was made on cytological smears of ascitic fluid. The importance of making a quick
		diagnosis utilizing cytological smears is emphasized and the cytological features
		"are demonstrated. Disseminated cryptococcosis, particularly with peritonitis, is"
		an uncommon manifestation of C. neoformans infection. A high clinical suspicion
		and early initiation of therapy is needed to recognize and treat patients
		effectively.

		Zealand.
PG	-	305-9
AB	-	A case of disseminated cryptococcosis in a North Island kiwi (Apteryx australis
		mantelli) caused by Cryptococcus neoformans var. gattii (serotype B) is reported.
		This is the first case of cryptococcosis to be reported in a kiwi and is also the
		first isolation of C. neoformans var. gattii from a veterinary source in New
		Zealand. The kiwi is an example of a ratite bird and as such has a lower body
		"temperature approximating that of a mammal. As a consequence, the kiwi and other"
		ratitis (e.g. emus) would be expected to show an increased susceptibility to
		cryptococcosis compared with other birds. There has been only one other isolate
		of this variety of C. neoformans in New Zealand and this was isolated from the
		sputum of a human male with leukaemia who was from the Gisborne area of the North
		"Island, a region adjacent to Hawkes Bay where the case of kiwi cryptococcosis"
		"occurred. Some months prior to the development of the infection in the bird, a"
		mulch of Eucalyptus leaves/twigs had been spread throughout the kiwi enclosure
		and this is considered to have been the probable source of the yeast. Neither
		Eucalyptus camaldulensis nor Eucalyptus tereticornis were among the species from
		which the mulch material originated and it is suggested another species may be
		the environmental host(s) of C. neoformans var. gattii in New Zealand.

PG	-	478-83
AB	-	Cryptococcosis is an opportunistic infection caused by the yeast-like fungus
		Cryptococcus neoformans. The infection predominantly strikes patients with
		"cell-mediated immunodeficiency, that is, patients with organ transplants,"
		"leukemia, lymphoma, AIDS, and those receiving steroids or immunosuppressants. We"
		describe a patient with skin lesions and anasarca secondary to intestinal
		infection from Cryptococcus neoformans after heart transplantation. We based
		diagnosis on histologic examination of the cutaneous lesions and of the duodenal
		mucosa. This case demonstrates that in immunosuppressed patients with anasarca of
		"unknown origin, a diagnosis of intestinal opportunistic infection also should be"
		considered.

AB	-	"Cryptococcosis is an opportunistic infection, the incidence of which is increased"
		in the immunocompromised patients. Cryptococcus neoformans is an encapsulated
		"fungus that mainly infects the lungs and the central nervous system, possibly"
		involving different organs. Cutaneous cryptococcosis is classified into localized
		"infection, usually occurring after traumatic inoculation (primary cutaneous"
		cryptococcosis) and cutaneous manifestation due to hematogenous dissemination
		"(secondary cutaneous cryptococcosis), mostly in patients with underlying"
		immunosuppression. We report a case of cutaneous cryptococcosis in a patient

AB	-	An unusual case of chronic pulmonary paracoccidiodomycosis and disseminated
		cryptococcosis in a non-HIV infected patient is reported in a 72-year-old
		previously healthy man. A chest radiograph disclosed a bilateral diffused
		interstitial infiltrate involving middle and lower lung fields. Specimen samples
		taken from the tracheal tube revealed yeast-like organisms suggestive of
		Cryptococcus neoformans and Paracoccidiodes brasiliensis. Blood and cerebrospinal
		fluid culture was positive for C. neoformans and the immunodiffusion test against
		paracoccidiodin revealed a precipitation band. The patient died 24 days after the
		admission.

TI	-	Cryptococcal necrotizing fasciitis with multiple sites of involvement in the
		lower extremities.
PG	-	1158-60
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcal necrotizing fasciitis that is localized to the lower
		extremities is very rare. OBJECTIVE: We describe a case of a renal transplant
		recipient who presented with necrotizing fasciitis of the legs caused by
		"Cryptococcus neoformans, a fungus that is rarely associated with this disease."
		METHODS: This is a case report with literature review. RESULTS: The patient was
		"hospitalized, and the site of infection was debrided to the level of the"
		periosteum. Cultures and histopathologic examination of biopsy material revealed
		an invasive deep-seated infection with a fungal organism that was consistent with
		C. neoformans. After 21 days on parenteral amphotericin B (Ambisome; Er-Kim
		"Pharmaceuticals) treatment, the patient was switched to oral itraconazole"
		(Itraspor; Janssen-Cilag Pharmaceuticals) 200 mg/day. He was discharged after 30
		days of hospitalization with his wounds completely healed. He continued on oral
		fluconazole for a total course of 6 weeks. CONCLUSION: Systemic fungal infections
		continue to be an important cause of morbidity and mortality in transplant
		recipients. The insidious nature and atypical manifestations of these infections
		"often delay diagnosis and therapy. In immunosuppressed patients, persistent fever"
		that does not respond to antibacterial therapy should alert the physician to the
		possibility of fungal infection.

AB	-	A 2.5 yr old sexually intact male vizsla was admitted to the Iowa State
		"University Veterinary Teaching Hospital for persistent diarrhea, weight loss, and"
		panhypoproteinemia. Examination revealed an emaciated condition and melena. Two
		masses were palpated in the cranial abdomen. Hematology and serum biochemistry
		"exhibited a regenerative anemia and confirmed the presence of panhypoproteinemia,"
		suggestive of a protein-losing eneteropathy. Distinct areas of thickened
		intestinal wall and enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes were found on abdominal
		ultrasound. Cytology from those nodes showed the presence of suspected
		"Cryptococcus spp., and infection was confirmed utilizing a cryptococcal antigen"
		titer. Medical therapy with lipid-complexed amphotericin B and fluconazole was
		unsuccessful. Two surgical procedures were performed to remove the affected areas
		"of intestine and lymph nodes, but the disease persisted as evidenced by a"
		"persistently elevated cryptococcal antigen titer. Terbinafine was prescribed,"
		which resulted in complete resolution of clinical signs and a steadily decreasing
		cryptococcal antigen titer. Very few cases of intestinal cryptococcosis have been
		"reported. In this case, infection resulted in a protein-losing enteropathy. In"
		"addition, this article describes the use of terbinafine in the treatment of"

		His past medical history revealed that in 1992 he had been evaluated at another

		"done in 1992 showing elevated protein, reduced glucose, and a pleocytosis; his"
		CSF fungal culture and cryptococcal antigen test were negative. He subsequently
		"was lost to follow-up, and although his headaches had resolved, his mental status"
		"had continued to worsen. In 1994 his CSF cryptococcal antigen was positive, and"
		his CSF fungal culture grew C. neoformans. He gradually improved with treatment
		"for cryptococcal meningitis (CM). With the exception of mild memory impairment,"
		in 2003 he and his family thought that his mental status had returned to normal.
		This case emphasizes that: 1) CM should always be kept in the differential
		diagnosis of dementia; 2) CM may be extremely insidious and difficult to
		diagnose; and 3) if one is to rule out unequivocally all possible reversible
		"causes of dementia, one should perform a spinal tap."

		symptomatic suprarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The patient underwent
		repair of his aneurysm using a rifampin-soaked graft with omental wrapping.
		"Intraoperative Gram stains showed yeast organisms, the cultures eventually grew"
		Cryptococcus neoformans with results available 43 days postoperatively. He was
		started on antifungal therapy intraoperatively and will be on lifelong antifungal
		treatment. Our case is the first report of cryptoccocal aortitis presenting as a
		symptomatic AAA; the diagnosis of a true mycotic aneurysm was made
		intraoperatively.

		review of the literature.
PG	-	303-6
AB	-	Cryptococcus neoformans is a dimorphic fungus known to cause disease
		predominately in immuno-compromised patients. It is not uncommon for cryptococcal
		"disease to manifest within the cutaneous tissues of these patients, and it can"
		"have drastically varied presentations, from ulcerated nodules to a more subtle"
		cellulitis. We present a patient who underwent a cardiac transplant and developed
		"a fever and mildly erythematous, indurated plaques on his legs and flank several"
		years later. Skin biopsy revealed cryptococcal panniculitis and C neoformans
		subsequently grew from both the biopsy culture and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
		This case report highlights the varied and subtle presentations of cutaneous
		cryptococcosis in immunocompromised patients and encourages a high index of
		suspicion for this potentially fatal disease in the setting of immunosuppression.

AB	-	Meningitis is a serious disease associated with considerable morbidity and
		mortality. Mixed meningeal infections due to bacteria and fungi are exceptionally
		rare. Here we report a case of meningeal co-infection with cryptococcus
		neoformans and streptococcus pneumoniae in a patient with unknown human
		"immunodeficiency virus status. Because of the rarity of such cases, stringent"
		screening of every cerebrospinal fluid specimen to exclude the presence of
		multiple pathogens is imperative. Assessment of patients for immunodeficiencies
		in case of isolation of an opportunistic organism like cryptococcus is also
		needed.

		hyper-IgM syndrome. A case report.
PG	-	241-4
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Most cases of cryptococcosis are diagnosed when signs of meningitis
		have appeared. We report a case of lymphonodular cryptococcosis that was
		"diagnosed by fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), excisional biopsy of a"
		cervical lymph node and culture of aspirated material. CASE: An 11-year-old boy
		presented with a history of fever and enlarged bilateral cervical lymph nodes of
		two weeks' duration. Past medical history included immunoglobulin replacement for
		hyper-IgM syndrome for the previous eight years. FNAC smears from a cervical
		"lymph node showed numerous yeasts of various sizes, ranging from 5 to 15 microns"
		"in diameter, located in the cytoplasm of multinucleated giant cells and in the"
		"background. In air-dried, Diff-Quik-stained slides, the yeasts stained blue and"
		were surrounded by clear halos. Aspirated material collected in the syringe was
		"cultured, and Cryptococcus neoformans was isolated. CONCLUSION: This case report"
		suggests that a combination of FNAC and culture is a simple and useful method of
		diagnosing fungal infections. Early diagnosis by FNAC makes possible the early
		initiation of treatment.

AB	-	We report the two first cases of human C. gattii meningoencephalitis acquired on
		"the Canadian east coast, from the province of Quebec. Unlike C. neoformans, C."
		gattii is not known to have an established ecological niche on the North American
		east coast. C. gattii has recently been responsible for major outbreaks in
		"British Columbia, Canada, and in the American pacific northwest. However, no"
		human cases acquired in other Canadian provinces have been reported to our
		knowledge. The source of acquisition remains unclear for both patients but since
		"neither had traveled outside of the province of Quebec, we discuss the"
		"possibilities of environmental and animal-associated acquisition, as well as the"
		possible established endemicity in new areas. These cases add to the growing
		reported human and animal cases in areas previously not thought to be endemic for
		C. gattii.

TI	-	Cutaneous cryptococcosis mimicking basal cell carcinoma in a patient with AIDS.
PG	-	43-5
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcosis is an opportunistic infection caused by the
		encapsulated yeast Cryptococcus neoformans. This ubiquitous organism has emerged
		"as a frequent finding in immunosuppressed patients, especially those with"
		"underlying malignancies, organ transplants, and the acquired immune deficiency"
		syndrome (AIDS). Cutaneous manifestations of cryptococcosis occur in 10 to 15% of
		patients having systemic involvement. These skin lesions may simulate a variety
		of different disease entities. METHODS: A case of crytococcosis mimicking a basal
		cell carcinoma is the subject of a case report presentation. RESULTS: A case of
		cutaneous cryptococcosis mimicking basal cell carcinoma occurred in a patient
		"with AIDS, who did not appear to have dissemination, but was treated aggressively"
		to stem possible occult systemic disease. CONCLUSION: Cutaneous crytococcosis may
		mimic other dermatologic disorders.

TI	-	Cerebellar cryptococcoma in an immunocompetent child. Case report.
PG	-	314-7
AB	-	"This is the first report of a cerebellar cryptococcoma in a previously healthy,"
		HIV-negative child. Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungus that
		typically affects patients who are HIV-positive and other patients with
		compromised immune systems. Isolated cryptococcomas of the central nervous system
		"(CNS) have been previously described in immunocompetent adults; however, this is"
		the first report of a cryptococcoma in a child. The patient presented with
		progressive headaches and nausea and was found to have a large cerebellar
		"hemispheric mass. The patient underwent excision of the mass, and analysis of"
		frozen sections suggested the presence of an astrocytic tumor with pilocytic
		features; therefore gross-total resection was performed. Once the definitive
		"diagnosis of a cryptococcal abscess was obtained, medical treatment with"
		antifungal medications led to the resolution of all symptoms and the
		normalization of serum titers. Cryptococcoma is a rare cause of ring enhancing
		"lesions in the cerebellum, even in apparently immunocompetent patients. The"
		authors' experience with this case and the patient's postoperative care lead them
		"to advocate resection of large isolated cryptococcomas of the CNS, especially"
		those situated in the posterior fossa.

		mimicking radiological features of malignancy.
PG	-	263-5
AB	-	A 64-year-old apparently immunocompetent white man developed lung and brain
		lesions of disseminated cryptococcosis. The radiologic features mimicked those of
		lung cancer metastatic to the central nervous system. C. gattii was recovered
		"from cultures of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, brain biopsy, and blood. The same"
		fungus was recovered from pulmonary and brain specimens at autopsy. Serum and
		cerebrospinal fluid cryptococcal antigen tests were diagnostic in our case and
		should be included in the diagnostic evaluation of unexplained pulmonary and
		cerebral lesions. A literature search showed few reports of fungemia by this
		"species of Cryptococcus, contrasting to C. neoformans."

PG	-	171-4
AB	-	"In this case report, we provide a concise review of the pathogenesis, clinical"
		"presentation, key diagnostic findings, and treatment options for Cryptococcus."
		Cryptococcus neoformans is a ubiquitous dimorphic fungus that can potentially be
		"life threatening, especially in immunocompromised hosts. It commonly infects the"
		"respiratory tract or central nervous system. However, skin manifestations can be"
		"a marker of severe and disseminated disease, particularly in individuals at"
		"higher risk, including those patients with AIDS, cancer, long-term corticosteroid"
		"use, and organ transplant recipients. A timely diagnostic workup, including skin"
		"biopsy,blood cultures, and lumber puncture, is crucial since skin lesions may"
		"mimic other infectious processes. In addition, prompt, appropriate antifungal"
		treatment should be initiatedto decrease morbidity and mortality.

AB	-	Cryptococcosis is a worldwide and potentially fatal mycosis documented in wild
		and captive koalas ( Phascolarctos cinereus ) caused by Cryptococcus neoformans .
		"Though mainly a subclinical disease, when the nasal cavity is affected,"
		"epistaxis, mucopurulent nasal discharge, dyspnea, and facial distortion may"
		occur. This report describes a case of cryptococcosis in a koala where unilateral
		exophthalmos was the only evident clinical sign and magnetic resonance imaging
		and computed tomography findings are described. Both advanced imaging techniques
		should be considered as standard and complementary techniques for nasal cavity
		evaluation in koalas.

		"out in order to assess the natural history of cryptococcosis, the epidemiological"
		"trend of this opportunistic infection, the risk factors predictive of death at 10"

		diagnosed in 177 (4.2%) patients and was the AIDS-defining disease in 2.8% of
		cases. Its prevalence decreased significantly over time (from 6.4% in the period
		"1985-1989 to 5.7% in 1990-1993, 3.1% in 1994-1996, and 1.9% in 1997-1999, P"

		significant proportion of the patients (24.2%) presented with extraneural
		"cryptococcosis. In a Cox multivariate analysis, high titres of cerebrospinal"
		fluid antigen (>5000) and drug addiction were predictive of death at 10 weeks. A
		complete clinical and mycological response was achieved in 60.8% of the treated
		"patients, with the highest response rate being observed in those treated with"
		amphotericin plus flucytosine (66.6%). Cryptococcosis relapsed in 12.8% of
		patients on secondary prophylaxis. Autopsy findings demonstrated that
		"cryptococcosis is a disseminated disease, but long-term antifungal treatment may"
		be able to eradicate it in a subgroup of patients.

PG	-	116-20
AB	-	"X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome (XHIM) is a rare primary immunodeficiency disorder,"
		caused by mutations of the gene encoding CD40 ligand (CD40L; CD154). We report
		the clinical manifestations and mutational analysis of the CD40L gene observed in
		"a male patient from a XHIM family. Having hypogammaglobulinemia and elevated IgM,"
		the 3-yr-old boy exhibited the characteristic clinical features of XHIM. The
		"patient suffered from frequent respiratory infections, and chronic enteritis"
		"caused by Cryptosporidium parvum. In addition, a lymph node biopsy and a culture"
		from this sample revealed C. neoformans infection. Activated lymphocytes from the
		patient failed to express CD40L on their surface as assessed by flow cytometry
		and a missence mutation (W140R) was found at the XHIM hotspot in his CD40L cDNA
		to confirm the diagnosis. Genetic analysis of the mother and sister showed a
		"heterozygote pattern, indicating carrier status. To our knowledge, this is the"
		first report on the molecular diagnosis of an XHIM patient in Korea.

		sarcoidosis.
PG	-	462-6
AB	-	We present a case of limited pulmonary cryptococcal infection following exposure
		to pigeon excreta in a patient with sarcoidosis. The pathogenicity of
		Cryptococcus neoformans depends on the interplay between the immune status of the
		host and the virulence of the infecting strain. It can range from asymptomatic
		lung colonization in the immunocompetent host to rapidly progressive meningitis
		in immunocompromised patients. Immunological models of respiratory disease
		emphasize a distinction between infections associated with immune suppression on
		the one hand and diseases such as sarcoidosis believed to involve an excessive
		Th1-mediated immune response on the other. This case exemplifies the complex
		nature of immunological responses in the lung and highlights the importance of
		considering the possibility of co-existent fungal infection in individuals with
		sarcoidosis. Novel immunotherapeutic options for cryptococcal infection are
		discussed.

PG	-	423-8
AB	-	"In Papua New Guinea, Cryptococcus neoformans var. gattii meningitis has a high"
		fatality rate even in immunocompetent patients. Our retrospective study attempted
		"to identify marker of poor prognosis. Of 88 immunocompetent patients, 30 (34.1%)"
		"died, usually soon after admission, and mortality was higher in men (p = 0.025)"
		and older patients (p = 0.039). Death was associated with altered consciousness
		"(p < 0.001), a history of convulsions prior to treatment (p = 0.002) and a"
		maximum systolic blood pressure of > 150 mmHg (p = 0.017). These data suggest
		that death results from raised intracranial pressure and subsequent tentorial
		"herniation. However, CSF opening pressure measured on admission was raised in"
		"29/36 (81%) patients and did not predict outcome. In survivors, relapse was"
		"uncommon and was not predicted by discharge serum cryptococcal antigen titres,"
		which were frequently raised on completion of therapy in asymptomatic patients.
		Mortality may be reduced if efforts are made to lower intracranial pressure in
		those patients who present with markers of poor prognosis.

PG	-	74-8
AB	-	We describe a 68-year-old man with necrotizing glomerulonephritis who presented
		with nephrotic syndrome accompanied by pulmonary cryptococcosis. He developed
		rheumatoid arthritis in July 1999 and was treated with low-dose prednisolone. He
		was admitted to our hospital on November 22 following the appearance of bilateral
		leg edema in October 2000. Laboratory tests at presentation revealed nephrotic
		syndrome with renal impairment. Renal biopsy specimens revealed necrotizing
		"glomerulonephritis with crescent, but immunofluorescence study showed lack of"
		staining for immunoglobulins or complement components. Chest X-ray and CT showed
		"abnormal shadows in the right upper lung field, and Cryptococcus neoformans was"
		isolated in a transbronchial lung biopsy. After the diagnosis of pulmonary
		"cryptococcosis was made, the patient was treated with 200 mg/day fluconazole. The"
		pulmonary abnormal shadows immediately improved and urinary protein excretion
		"dramatically decreased. A second renal biopsy, performed about 2 months after the"
		"first biopsy, showed disappearance of crescent. Electron microscopic examination"
		of the second renal biopsy showed partial effacement of foot processes without
		electron-dense deposits. Our findings suggest that necrotizing glomerulonephritis
		with nephrotic syndrome in this patient represented pauci-immune T-cell-mediated
		injury related to pulmonary cryptococcosis.

		Voriconazole with flucytosine and drainage of the pleural effusion were effective

AB	-	An 82-year-old supplemental oxygen dependent woman with severe COPD presented
		with an eight month history of worsening hoarseness and stridor. Office
		laryngoscopy revealed laryngeal edema and ulcerative masses throughout the
		larynx. In-office biopsies were positive for Cryptococcus neoformans. This report
		"details a novel approach to the treatment of cryptococcal laryngitis, a"
		combination of in-office pulsed-dye laser (PDL) ablation and medical therapy.
		"Despite treatment with oral fluconazole, the recommended treatment for"
		cryptococcal laryngitis the patient continued to be symptomatic with dysphonia
		and throat discomfort. Repeated laryngeal exam demonstrated persistent
		cryptococcal nodules. The patient was subsequently effectively treated with an
		in-office PDL laser. This case demonstrates the efficacy of in-office laser
		"treatment for residual laryngeal Cryptococcus. For patients like this one, who"
		"have failed medical therapy and are unfit for general anesthetic, the in-office"
		laser provides an excellent alternative treatment approach.

TI	-	Risk factors in necrotizing fasciitis: a case involving Cryptococcus neoformans.
PG	-	80-3
AB	-	Necrotizing fasciitis is a destructive soft tissue infection that is most
		typically caused by group A streptococci or a combination of facultative and
		anaerobic bacteria. Patients at risk for the development of necrotizing fasciitis
		often have compromised immune function or poor tissue perfusion. This report
		"describes a case of necrotizing fasciitis caused by Cryptococcus neoformans, a"
		pathogen not previously associated with this primary destructive soft tissue
		infection. The process occurred in a patient at risk for the development of
		opportunistic infection. We briefly review the risk factors for the development
		of necrotizing fasciitis and the typical bacteriologic findings. Cryptococcal
		"infections and their treatment are described. Despite the uncommon pathogen, the"
		treatment of this patient followed established principles-prompt surgical
		intervention and systemic antimicrobial therapy tailored to the offending
		organisms.

AB	-	Cryptococcosis is a fungal infection caused by Cryptococcus neoformans that tends
		to affect immunocompromised individuals. The fungi are mostly acquired by
		"inhalation, which leads to an initial pulmonary infection. Later, other organs -"
		such as the central nervous system and the skin - can be affected by hematogenous
		"spread. In addition, cutaneous contamination can occur by primary inoculation"
		"after injuries (primary cutaneous cryptococcosis), whose diagnosis is defined"
		based on the absence of systemic involvement. The clinical presentation of
		cutaneous forms typically vary according to the infection mode. We report an
		unusual case of disseminated cryptococcosis in an immunocompetent patient with
		cutaneous lesions similar to those caused by primary inoculation. This clinical
		picture leads us to question the definition of primary cutaneous cryptococcosis
		established in the literature.

TI	-	Disseminated infection with Cryptococcus neoformans var neoformans in an 8 years
		immunocompetent girl.
PG	-	85
AB	-	Disseminated cryptococcosis is a rare and often fatal disease in children. The
		majority of cases usually occur in individuals with defective cell-mediated
		"immunity, most commonly due to HIV infection. The authors here in report an"
		"8-year-old girl from Nepal who presented with fever, cough, headache,"
		"lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly and cutaneous lesions. Lymph node biopsy"
		revealed multiple granulomas composed of histiocytes and epitheliold cells along
		"with numerous yeast forms of cryptococcus. Cultures of CSF, sputum and urine"
		"yielded cryptococcus neoformans. Surprisingly,the immune function in terms of"
		"T-cell number, CD4 : CD8 ratio, serum immunoglobulins and HIV serology was"
		"normal. After the diagnosis of disseminated cryptococcosis was established, the"
		patient was treated with 5-fluorocytosine (100 mg/kg/day) for initial two weeks
		and amphotericin B (1 mg/kg/day) for 13 weeks. Patient responded well to the
		"treatment with disappearance of presenting symptoms, cutaneous lesions, and"
		"lymphadenopathy, though she still had hepatosplenomegaly, which also decreased."
		"Unfortunately, she developed loss of vision in 10th week of therapy. The patient"
		was discharged on oral fluconazole (6 mg/kg/day) and no recurrence was found
		during the follow-up period of more than 9 months. This is the first case of
		"disseminated cryptococcosis with no detectable immune deficit, from India."

AB	-	Infections are a serious complication in patients with systemic lupus
		"erythematosus (SLE), and are an important cause of morbidity and mortality. SLE"
		patients are particularly susceptible to infection due to immune suppression from
		underlying disease or treatment. Most infections are due to common bacterial
		organisms. Clinicians also need to be aware of the possibility of polymicrobial
		infections as these may cause diagnostic delay and affect outcomes. We report the
		case of an intra-cerebral coinfection with Burkholderia pseudomallei and
		Cryptococcus neoformans in a 34-year-old woman with SLE. The diagnosis in this
		case was delayed since coinfection was not suspected.

		lady was referred to Institute in view of lung mass not responding to anti-TB
		treatment. Subsequently patient had developed headache. Radiological evaluation
		showed presence of ring enhancing lesion in the occipital region. On evaluation
		"with Fibre-optic bronchoscopy, there was no evidence of malignancy or"
		tuberculosis. Sputum showed presence and growth of Cryptococcus neoformans.
		"Patient's investigations were negative for virus infection, with normal"
		immunoglobulin levels. Her CD4 counts were 129 cells/mm3. Patient was treated
		with injectable antifungals. Patient developed a Caverno-oesophageal fistula
		which was confirmed on endoscopy and radiology. Patient was managed with
		percutaneous jejunal feeding (PEJ). Patient improved symptomatically with CD4
		count of 475 cells/mm3.

AB	-	Cryptococcus neoformans commonly causes opportunistic infections in

		"amphotericin B. The cryptococcoma, however, did not resolve in response to"
		"vigorous antifungal therapy during a period of more than 4 months. Eventually,"
		the cryptococcoma was surgically removed. This case is unusual both for the
		finding of C. neoformans var. gattii outside its apparent endemic area as well as

PG	-	271-4
LID	-	10.1007/s00595-007-3605-6 [doi]
AB	-	A 25-year-old immunocompetent Japanese man was referred to us for investigation
		and treatment of obstructive jaundice. Computed tomography (CT) showed dilatation
		of the bilateral intrahepatic bile ducts and a low-attenuated mass extending
		"along the portal tract, from the hepatic hilum to the periphery, suggestive of"
		"cholangiocellular carcinoma (CCC) with periductal infiltration. However, the"
		culture of bile obtained by percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage revealed
		Cryptococcus neoformans. Microscopic examination of a biopsy specimen of the
		mass-like lesion in the liver revealed fungal organisms encapsulated in
		multinucleated giant cells. A small area of infiltration in the left lung was
		"also detected on chest CT, and a diagnosis of liver and lung cryptococcosis was"
		"made. After 8 months of antifungal therapy, both the liver and lung lesions had"
		vanished and the biliary stricture resolved. Unnecessary surgical intervention
		was avoided by an early and accurate diagnosis and effective antifungal therapy.
		The bile culture was the key to the definitive diagnosis in this case.

AB	-	Cryptococcus neoformans is a ubiquitous organism that often causes opportunistic
		infections in immune-compromised patients. The pulmonary and central nervous
		systems are most commonly affected. Osseous involvement is infrequent and is
		usually associated with disseminated systemic infection. Isolated cryptococcal
		osteomyelitis is exceedingly rare. We report the case of a 56-year-old
		immunocompetent man who presented with isolated cryptococcal osteomyelitis of the
		humerus.

AB	-	"A healthy 27-year-old woman presented, four months after childbirth, ingravescent"
		pain and claudication of the left lower limb. Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the
		lumbosacral and iliac regions showed widespread muscular-skeletal lesions. The
		patient underwent surgery; Cryptococcus neoformans was isolated from surgical
		"samples. Liposomal amphotericin B, fluconazole and itraconazole were"
		"administered. Laboratory findings showed lymphocytopenia, with reduction of CD4+"

TI	-	Evidence of zoonotic transmission of Cryptococcus neoformans from a pet cockatoo
		to an immunocompromised patient.
PG	-	205-8
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Although cryptococcosis has been associated with birds for almost 50
		"years, point sources for infection have not been identified. OBJECTIVE: To"
		document zoonotic transmission of Cryptococcus neoformans. DESIGN: Case report.
		"SETTING: A home in Boston, Massachusetts. PATIENT: A 72-year-old woman who"
		"received a diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis in November 1998. The patient,"
		who had been taking immunosuppressant drugs since undergoing renal
		"transplantation in 1989, owned a pet cockatoo. MEASUREMENTS: Cryptococcus"
		neoformans was isolated from the feces of the cockatoo. Isolates from excreta and
		"from the patient were compared by using biochemical profiles, monoclonal antibody"
		"binding patterns, restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, and"
		karyotyping. RESULTS: The isolates from the patient and the cockatoo had
		"identical biochemical profiles, the same monoclonal antibody immunofluorescence"
		"patterns, and indistinguishable patterns on restriction fragment length"
		polymorphism analysis and karyotyping. CONCLUSIONS: The indistinguishable patient
		and cockatoo isolates strongly suggest that the patient's infection resulted from
		exposure to aerosolized cockatoo excreta. Although the incidence of cryptococcal
		"infection due to such exposure is unknown, it may be prudent to advise"
		immunocompromised patients to avoid pet birds and avian excreta.

PG	-	79-80
LID	-	10.1016/S1995-7645(11)60039-4 [doi]
AB	-	Cryptococcus neoformans has been recognized as a human pathogen over centuries.
		This has achieved new prominence in the recent years as it is an opportunistic
		"fungi causing fatal, deep mycotic infections in immunocompromised states."
		"Although cryptococcus is principally a pathogen of central nervous system, wide"
		variety of other organs may also be involved. Gastrointestinal cryptococcosis is
		rarely reported either as an isolated finding or in a disseminated disease.
		"However, even with the strikingly increased incidence of the disease, occurrence"
		of obvious gastrointestinal symptoms directly attributable to cryptococcosis is
		outstandingly rare. We report a case of gastric cryptococcal infection with
		esophageal herpes as an initial presentation in an AIDS patient.

PG	-	1241-4
AB	-	Cryptococcus neoformans (C. neoformans) var. gattii infection usually occurs in
		"tropical and subtropical areas, and rarely in the northern hemisphere. We report"
		the first Japanese with cryptococcal meningoencephalitis caused by C. neoformans
		var. gattii infection that occurred during a trip to Australia. This agent was
		identified in a cerebellar biopsy specimen by immunohistochemical technique with
		serotype-specific anti-sera. Because the meningitis caused by it did not respond
		"well to conventional therapy, we used an aggressive therapeutic regimen to"
		successfully treat the patient. Even in areas where C. neoformans var. gattii
		"does not exist, this infection should be considered possible as a travel-related"
		infection.

PG	-	319-24
LID	-	10.1007/s10156-008-0618-z [doi]
AB	-	A 23-year-old man with no recent medical history was hospitalized complaining of
		"high fever and cough. In addition to very marked eosinophilia, chest X-ray"
		revealed extensive bronchovascular bundle thickening. Transbronchial lung biopsy
		(TBLB) showed moderate eosinophil infiltration. Cryptococcus neoformans infection
		"was diagnosed, based on blood culture, cerebrospinal fluid culture, urine"
		"culture, and lung biopsy specimens. The eosinophilia was successfully alleviated"
		"by treatment for cryptococcal meningitis. Furthermore, cryptococcal sepsis"
		resolved with amphotericin B and 5-flucytosine treatment. Eosinophilia commonly
		"occurs following chronic Aspergillus infection, but the present case suggests the"
		involvement of Cryptococcus in another mechanism for eosinophilia.

		cryptococcal infections are usually associated with various immunocompromised
		"states, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Because pregnancy"
		"is associated with physiological immunosuppression, cryptococcal pneumonia should"
		"be considered in pregnant women, or women in the postpartum period, who have"
		respiratory symptoms.

AB	-	Cryptococcal infection of the central nervous system (CNS) typically affects
		"patients with HIV infection. In addition, opportunistic infections can also occur"
		during immunosuppressive therapies. Some patients develop cryptococcal
		"meningitis. Cryptococcomas, however, are rarely observed. A 42-year-old patient"
		with sarcoidosis known for 2½ years presented with a cerebral mass lesion
		primarily thought to be CNS sarcoidosis. Stereotactic biopsy and extensive micro-
		and macrobiological investigations revealed a cryptococcoma which had emerged
		from cryptococcal meningitis despite 3 months of treatment. Differential
		diagnosis of cerebral cryptococcoma is difficult due to the unspecific findings
		in the CSF analysis if C. neoformans fails to be detected using Indian ink
		"staining or PCR studies. In this case, stereotactic biopsy and pathohistological"
		examination revealed C. neoformans causing intracerebral mass lesion. Intensive
		treatment with antifungal drugs was followed by remission of all symptoms. In
		"conclusion, cryptococcoma of the CNS represents a very important indication of"
		mass lesions in patients suffering from sarcoidosis and treated with
		corticosteroids.

TI	-	Cutaneous cryptococcosis as a rare manifestation of the immune reconstitution
		syndrome in an HIV-1-infected patient.
PG	-	3-Jan
AB	-	Immune reconstitution syndromes (IRS) in HIV-1-infected patients are associated
		with an exaggerated infl ammatory response against an opportunistic infection
		during highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The most commonly described
		cases of this phenomenon concern mycobacterial (Mycobacterium avium and M.
		"tuberculosis) infections, pneumocystodosis, cryptoccoccal meningitis, and CMV"
		infections. Cutaneous cryptococcosis as IRS is less commonly observed. The case
		of a 45-year-old HIV-1-positive male is reported who developed subcutaneous
		abscesses due to Cryptococcus neoformans infection after four weeks of effective
		HAART following profound immune defi ciency.

PG	-	445-8
AB	-	An adult Blanca-Celtibérica doe originating from a goat herd with a high
		"prevalence of tuberculosis was presented with respiratory signs. At necropsy,"
		this goat had a diffuse and severe mycotic pneumonia associated with the presence
		of Cryptococcus neoformans concomitant with pulmonary focal caseous nodules from
		"which Mycobacterium bovis was isolated. Microscopically, the mycotic lesion was a"
		granulomatous pneumonia with many large foamy macrophages containing
		"intracellular yeast bodies. The extensive mycotic changes, their granulomatous"
		"nature, and the lack of positive response to different immunologic tests for"
		mycobacterial infection suggested an impaired immune status in this animal.

TI	-	Peripheral vestibular disease associated with cryptococcosis in three cats.
PG	-	29-34
AB	-	Peripheral vestibular disease referable to otitis media/interna was the main
		"reason for presentation in three cats with cryptococcosis. In two cats,"
		Cryptococcus neoformans var neoformans was isolated from the tympanic bulla. In
		"the remaining cat, otitis media/interna was considered to be secondary to"
		occlusion of the auditory tube by a nasopharyngeal granuloma associated with a C
		neoformans var gattii infection. This report emphasises the importance of
		maintaining an index of suspicion for a fungal aetiology in cats with signs of
		"otitis media/interna, particularly in countries with a high prevalence of"
		cryptococcosis. The presence of C neoformans may be overlooked with potentially
		fatal consequences where only standard methods for bacterial isolation are used
		to examine samples obtained from the middle ear.

		"amphotericin B or flucytosine. At autopsy, Cryptococcus neoformans was present in"
		"all sampled skeletal muscles, myocardium, and muscularis propria of the"
		gastrointestinal tract but was not identified in either the central nervous
		system or the lungs. A review of the English-language literature failed to
		identify a similar case with such profound myotropism due to Cryptococcus. This
		case demonstrates that cryptococcosis should be considered in the differential
		diagnosis of an immunocompromised host presenting with muscle weakness.

TI	-	A novel presentation of cryptococcal infection in a renal allograft recipient.
PG	-	82-4
AB	-	The population of immunosuppressed patients is growing rapidly because of the HIV
		epidemic and the rapid expansion in transplant medicine. These patients may
		present to a variety of clinical specialties with seemingly innocuous infections.
		We present here the first Irish case of primary cryptococcal cellulitis. The
		patient was a 62-year old renal transplant recipient and was immunosuppressed
		"with Cyclosporine, Azathioprine and Prednisolone. He presented with an apparent"
		bacterial cellulitis on the dorsum of the hand that had failed to respond to a
		3-week course of oral antibiotics. There was no clinical evidence of systemic
		infection. There was tissue necrosis present and the area was debrided
		surgically. Histological examination of debrided tissue revealed necrotic
		granulomata and budding yeast-like organisms. Cryptococcus neoformans was
		cultured from this specimen. The patient was treated with oral fluconazole 400 mg
		daily for 6 weeks with complete healing of the infected area and no evidence of
		recurrence after 12 months of follow up. This case emphasises the need for a high
		index of suspicion for atypical infection in the immunocompromised patient.

TI	-	Cavitating pneumonia after treatment with infliximab and prednisone.
PG	-	638-41
AB	-	Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha antagonists constitute a novel class of
		immunomodulating drugs that are used for the treatment of an increasing number of
		inflammatory disorders. These agents are associated with an increased risk of
		"tuberculosis, but the risk of other infections is less clear. Reported here is"
		the case of a patient who developed cavitary pneumonia after treatment with
		infliximab (monoclonal TNF-alpha antibodies) and corticosteroids for rheumatoid
		arthritis. Cryptococcus neoformans was the only pathogen isolated from
		bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. The patient responded well to fluconazole. The risk
		of infection after treatment with TNF-alpha antagonists and the possible
		causative microorganisms are discussed.

		"The most frequent location is the lumbosacral region. Etiology is diverse,"
		"including inflammatory, infectious and neoplastic disorders. Meningoradiculitis"
		is a rare form of involvement in cryptococcal infection. We describe a case of
		subacute lower limbs flaccid paresis diagnosed as lumbosacral meningoradiculitis
		in view of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inflammatory changes and typical enhancement
		on MRI of lumbar spine. Cryptococcus neoformans was isolated from CSF. Extensive
		screening yielded no immunodeficiencies.

PG	-	279-84
AB	-	Skeletal cryptococcosis is an uncommon infection. Isolated osteomyelitis due to
		Cryptococcus neoformans is quite rare. Only seven cases of skeletal
		cryptococcosis with involvement of vertebrae but no systemic infection have been
		reported. In only one was there paraplegia. Since vertebral cryptococcosis seems
		"not to have been reported previously in Japan, this case of a 50-year-old coal"
		miner successfully treated for paraparesis caused by cryptococcal spondylitis of
		"the ninth, tenth, and 11th thoracic vertebrae is noteworthy. Two decompression"
		operations and combined amphotericin B and flucytosine therapy reduced the
		"patient's paraparesis, and no sign of recurrence was seen for 21 months after the"
		second operation.

TI	-	Current status of cryptococcosis in Canada.
PG	-	73-80
AB	-	"The concurrent use of microscopic, cultural, histopathologic and immunologic"
		"procedures enabled us to diagnose 91 cases of cryptococcosis, belonging to"
		"cutaneous, pulmonary, meningeal and disseminated types, from the time this"
		mycosis was first reported in Canada in 1953 to the present. These cases occurred
		"predominantly in Quebec (43%) followed by Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario,"
		"Saskatchewan, Manitoba, New Brunswick and Newfoundland. It is not known whether"
		any Cryptococcus neoformans infections have occurred elsewhere in Canada. The
		clinical and laboratory findings indicate that infections occurred in debilitated
		as well as nondebilitated individuals. Nearly 25% of the infections were seen in
		individuals having the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in provinces of
		"Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec. In some of the AIDS cases, the"
		latex agglutination (LA) test demonstrated exceptionally high titres of
		"circulating cryptococcal antigen (1:256 to 1:32,768). Cr. neoformans infections"
		"occurred more commonly in males than in females, and there were 11 fatal cases of"
		cryptococcosis. The incidence of Cr. neoformans in Canada is probably higher than
		our data suggest because cryptococcosis is not notifiable in Canada and
		underreporting is likely.

AB	-	Cryptococcus neoformans is a common cause of life-threatening infection.
		"Cutaneous manifestations of Cryptococcus can be primary or secondary, most"
		commonly from immunosuppression. With the global emergence of acquired
		"immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), incidence of cryptococcosis is increasing and"
		now represents a major life-threatening fungal infection in these patients.
		Nonspecific lesions may cause misdiagnosis. Disseminated Cryptocoocus requires
		early clinical diagnosis and effective management to decrease mortality. We
		review a case of cutaneous Cryptococcus as a complication of chronic essential
		dermatitis treated with long-term immunosuppressive agents and discuss updated
		guidelines on the treatment of Cryptococcus.

PG	-	495-7
LID	-	10.5301/HIP.2011.8579 [doi]
AB	-	A case of Cryptococcus neoformans osteomyelitis involving both the femur and rib
		is reported. A 50-year-old male presented with a 1-month history of a
		persistently painful right hip. Radiography revealed an osteolytic area in the
		"subcapital region of the right femoral neck and trochanteric region, and magnetic"
		resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an intramedullary lesion in the peritrochanteric
		region. A Tc99m whole body bone scan showed significantly increased uptake in the
		posterior aspect of the right 7th rib as well as the right femoral region.
		Hemiarthroplasty with a bipolar prosthesis was performed. Because a permeative
		"osteolytic lesion was identified intraoperatively, surgical resection was also"
		performed. A culture from intraoperative specimens yielded C. neoformans. The rib
		infection was not treated surgically. Intravenous fluconazole was administered
		postoperatively. The patient became seronegative for cryptococcal antigen with no
		further illness over the next five years.

TI	-	Cryptococcal peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients: a case report.
PG	-	230-2
AB	-	Peritonitis in patients on chronic peritoneal dialysis remains a major problem.
		"Most commonly this is due to bacterial infection, but fungal peritonitis is also"
		a treatment dilemma. Peritonitis due to Cryptococcus neoformans is an unusual
		"event, with fewer than ten cases reported. This case report documents a case of"
		cryptococcal peritonitis in a diabetic man on prednisone and azathioprine for
		suspected chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. The organism was
		also cultured in the cerebrospinal fluid and urine and high cryptococcal antigen
		titers were found in the blood indicating systemic infection. The peritoneal
		"catheter was removed, immunosuppression was withdrawn and he was treated with"
		systemic antifungal therapy. He died suddenly nine weeks following the diagnosis
		"and at post mortem was found to have evidence of cryptococcosis in lung, spleen"
		and brain. The case demonstrates that cryptococcal peritonitis in patients on
		peritoneal dialysis should prompt a search for systemic infection and may require
		prolonged therapy.

TI	-	Cryptococcal osteomyelitis. Report of a case with aspiration biopsy of a humeral
		lesion with radiologic features of malignancy.
PG	-	815-8
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Osteomyelitis due to Cryptococcus neoformans typically exhibits lytic
		lesions on radiographs. Extensive periosteal reaction is an uncommon feature.
		CASE: A 68-year-old man presented with pain and swelling in the left elbow.
		Radiologic studies exhibited a lytic humeral lesion with extensive periosteal
		"reaction, interpreted as a malignant neoplasm. Fine needle aspiration biopsy"
		(FNA) revealed abundant cryptococcal organisms. CONCLUSION: Cryptococcus is an
		uncommon cause of lytic osseous lesions that may mimic malignant neoplasms.
		Extensive periosteal reaction may support a radiologic diagnosis of primary
		osseous malignancy in rare cases. FNA with examination of Diff-Quik-stained
		slides may be employed for distinguishing cryptococcal osteomyelitis from
		malignant tumors and for prompt identification of the organisms.

		rabbits.
PG	-	85-9
AB	-	A case of cryptococcosis in a dog is reported. The titers of polysaccharide
		antigen in sera were monitored by latex agglutination (LA) tests during and after
		treatment with antifungal therapy. Although the LA titers decreased in response
		"to therapy, it took about 3.5 years to achieve a negative LA test. To model the"
		"persistence of cryptococcal polysaccharides, we examined the clearance of antigen"
		"from the blood of rabbits injected with sterile, cryptococcal capsular"
		polysaccharide isolated from culture supernatant. The distribution half-lives
		were between 2.6 and 3.9 days and the elimination half-lives were between 10.4
		and 39 days. These results suggest that polysaccharide antigen may be stored in
		"tissues. However, we think that slow clearance of antigen cannot explain the"
		"extraordinarily slow clearance found in this dog, and that prolonged survival of"
		Cryptococcus neoformans is a more plausible explanation.

PG	-	507-17
AB	-	Italy is one of the countries participating in a prospective epidemiological
		survey of cryptococcosis set up in July 1997 by the European Confederation of
		"Medical Mycology (ECMM). Over a 30-month period 156 cases, all caused by"
		"Cryptococcus neoformans var. neoformans, were reported by 29 hospitals in 9"
		regions. An ECMM questionnaire was used to report the clinical presentation and
		the diagnostic and treatment approach used. Cryptococcosis was associated with
		HIV infection in 147 cases and was considered indicative of AIDS in 65%. The
		estimated incidence in the Lombardy region was 0.85/100 in the AIDS population.
		One isolate from each of 129 patients was serotyped and genotyped. PCR
		fingerprinting using the primer (GACA)4 proved to be a more reproducible typing
		"method than the slide agglutination test. Genotypes VN1 (serotype D), VN6"
		(serotype A) and VN3-VN4 (serotype AD hybrid strains) occurred in Italy at
		"similar levels nationwide, but VN1 (D) was prevalent in the North. In vitro"
		resistance to antifungals was uncommon.

AB	-	A case of meningitis due to Cryptococcus neoformans var. gattii coincident with
		disseminated Nocardia transvalensis infection is reported. Nocardia infection
		initially progressed despite high-dose antimicrobial therapy. Although a specific
		"immunologic defect could not be defined, in vitro lymphocyte proliferation in"
		response to stimulation with the Nocardia isolate was reduced. It is proposed
		that coinfection with Cryptococcus neoformans may have contributed to the

AB	-	"Disseminated cryptococcal infection occurs mainly in the immunocompromised host,"
		particularly in those with impaired cellular immunity. The treatment outcome
		"depends not only on the duration and choice of antifungal therapy, but also on"
		the activity of the organism to persist in different parts of the body despite
		therapy. We present a case of persistence of cryptococcal infection in the
		parathyroid gland in a kidney transplant recipient. A 38-year-old male renal
		transplant recipient diagnosed to have disseminated cryptococcosis was treated
		"with discontinuation of immunosuppression, amphotericin B, and flucytosine for 2"
		"weeks, and fluconazole subsequently. Dialysis was initiated when graft function"
		deteriorated after discontinuation of immunosuppression. The patient showed no
		clinical signs of active cryptococcal infection on fluconazole therapy. One year
		"after the diagnosis of cryptococcosis, and still on fluconazole, he underwent"
		"parathyroidectomy, for severe secondary hyperparathyroidism. Surprisingly, active"
		cryptococcal infection with necrotizing granulomatous inflammation was
		"demonstrated in the parathyroid, despite being on therapy. This patient"
		illustrates that persistence of fungal infection despite prolonged therapy can
		occur in unusual sites such as the parathyroid and may be a source for future
		recurrence and dissemination.

		carinii pneumonia is presented. Despite treatment with high-dose
		"trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) and prednisone with initial improvement,"
		the patient acutely deteriorated with severe acidosis and died on the 4th day of

		lavage (BAL) and blood culture. As simultaneous presence of more than one
		"opportunistic infection can occur in these patients, systematic workup for other"
		common opportunistic infections must be performed.

TI	-	Pseudocystic form of neurocryptococcosis in pregnancy. Case report.
PG	-	678-82
AB	-	We report a case of neurocryptococcosis which is unique in the literature because
		the patient had a pseudocystic form of the disease during pregnancy and without
		any evidence of AIDS. The clinical picture was that of intracranial hypertension
		and the epidemiological background was highly suggestive of cysticercosis. CT
		"showed multiple round hypodense lesions in the basal ganglia and cerebellum,"
		"without contrast enhancement. Since a scolex was not visible, the diagnosis of"
		neurocysticercosis was considered probable. CSF examination was not performed in
		view of its high risk. The patient had progressive downhill course. Autopsy
		disclosed multiple gelatinous pseudocysts in the cerebral and cerebellar gray
		"matter, containing abundant Cryptococcus neoformans. Meningeal involvement was"
		"minimal. The child was delivered by caesarean section and was free of infection,"
		but died later of hyaline membrane disease. The neuroimaging appearances of this
		rare instance of the pseudocystic form of neurocryptococcosis mimicked closely
		neurocysticercosis and only postmortem examination allowed correct diagnosis. The
		pseudocystic form has so far only been reported in AIDS.

AB	-	Cryptococcal infection is the 4th most common opportunistic infection in patients
		with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Although pleural effusion alone
		"is an unusual presentation, we present a case of cryptococcal pleuritis in an"
		AIDS patient which was initially difficult to discriminate from tuberculous
		pleuritis because of the high level of pleural adenosine deaminase (ADA).
		Cryptococcus neoformans was detected in the culture of the pleural effusion after
		the initiation of antituberculous treatment. High levels of ADA in the pleural
		"fluid can be observed in patients with cryptococcal pleuritis, and longer"
		incubation of pleural fluid should be performed in all patients who present with
		pleuritis associated with a high ADA level as the only significant finding.

		exposure to pet avian excreta.

PG	-	260-4
AB	-	As experience with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome has grown during the
		"last decade, it has become important to recognize interactions between the"
		opportunistic infections and malignancies that complicate the course of patients
		with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Our recent experience as described in
		this paper reveals that Kaposi's sarcoma and cryptococcal infection can associate
		in such a manner. The first reported case of oral Cryptococcus neoformans
		infection within a Kaposi's sarcoma lesion in a patient with acquired
		immunodeficiency syndrome is described. Based on the clinical course of this
		"patient, it is an important consideration that the sarcoma may have harbored and"
		even protected the fungus during systemic amphotericin B therapy.

		cytology.
PG	-	415-6
AB	-	A 54-yr-old female diabetic presented with a febrile illness and respiratory
		distress associated with bilateral alveolar infiltration. The left lobe of the
		thyroid gland was enlarged and failed to concentrate pertechnetate. The patient
		was euthyroid. Cryptococcus neoformans was recognized in a fine-needle aspirate
		and was confirmed by culture; it was also grown in blood culture. Death was
		attributed to the respiratory condition. This report emphasizes the emergence of
		mycotic infections of the thyroid and presents an efficient method for their
		identification.

AB	-	Cryptococcosis is a systemic mycosis usually affecting patients of
		"immunodeficiency i.e. transplants recipients, patients on chemotherapy for"
		neoplastic diseases and in those suffering from human immunodeficiency virus
		infection. We report a 52-year old male suffering from chronic lymphocytic
		leukemia (CLL) on chemotherapy who presented with fever and features of
		prostatism. Cryptococcus neoformans infection (CN) was diagnosed on aspiration of
		a prostatic nodule. Subsequent investigations revealed a disseminated involvement
		by cryptococcus. The case represents an unusual presentation of disseminated
		cryptococcosis.

AB	-	Atypical manifestations of Cryptococcus neoformans disease have been reported in
		patients with HIV-1 infection as part of the spectrum of the immune
		reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). We describe a cryptococcal breast
		abscess in a patient presenting after 11 months of highly active antiretroviral
		therapy (HAART). The arguments for and against the case being a novel
		manifestation of IRIS are discussed. The potential hazards of using CD4 count as
		a surrogate marker of IRIS and the danger of misdiagnosing IRIS as failure of
		HAART are highlighted.

AB	-	We present a case of chronic tonsillitis in a patient with chronic lymphocytic
		"leukemia. Despite empiric radiation and antibiotic therapy, the patient's sore"
		throat and tonsillar enlargement persisted. Excisional biopsy of the involved
		tonsil revealed the presence of Cryptococcus neoformans. Blood cultures also
		yielded cryptococcus. Specific antifungal therapy resulted in cure. To our
		"knowledge, this is the first case report of cryptococcal infection of the tonsil."
		This case illustrates the pitfalls of empiric therapy in an immunosuppressed
		host.

		antifungal therapy: report of a case.
PG	-	153-8
AB	-	A 49-year-old diabetic male had been unsuccessfully treated with antitubercular
		therapy for a granulomatous lesion of the left lung detected elsewhere nine
		months ago. He presented with evidence of meningitis which was found to be due to
		infection with Cryptococcus neoformans. Both the meningeal and lung lesions
		resolved after 6 weeks of combined therapy with amphotericin B and flucytosine.
		The report of the case along with a brief review of the relevant literature is
		presented.

AB	-	We report a case of primary pulmonary cryptococcosis in a post-renal transplant
		patient. A 65-year-old male renal transplant patient was admitted to the hospital
		"with a low grade fever of 1 month, radiologically mimicking tuberculosis (TB)."
		"Broncho-alveolar fluid (BAL) shows capsulated yeast, and Cryptococcus neoformans"
		was grown on culture supported by cytology and histopathological examination.
		Cryptococcal antigen was positive (32-fold) in serum and was negative in
		cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The patient was given amphotericin B and 5-flucytosine
		and clinical improvement was seen on a weekly follow up. The serum cryptococcal
		antigen test might contribute to the early detection and treatment of pulmonary
		cryptococcosis. The results of antifungal susceptibility were aid in selecting
		the drug of choice for treatment.

		TOMOGRAPHY ANGIOGRAPHY.
PG	-	218-220
LID	-	10.1097/ICB.0000000000000703 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: To report an unusual case of cryptococcal choroiditis and highlight the
		"multimodal imaging findings, particularly the choriocapillaris flow voids using"
		optical coherence tomography angiography. METHODS: Retrospective review of the
		clinical course of a single patient with cryptococcal choroiditis. RESULTS: A
		69-year-old man undergoing chemotherapy for T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia
		developed disseminated crytococcal neoformans infection. He developed bilateral
		cryptococcal choroiditis with multiple yellow-white choroidal lesion on
		fundoscopy in both eyes. Multimodal imaging of the choroidal lesions revealed
		flow voids at the level of the choriocapillaris on optical coherence tomography
		angiography that corresponded to hypocyanescent areas on indocyanine green
		angiography when registered and overlaid on the indocyanine green angiography
		images. The superficial and deep capillary plexuses were spared. CONCLUSION: This
		case illustrates that optical coherence tomography angiography was useful in
		demonstrating that the cryptococcal choroidal lesions impaired choriocapillaris
		perfusion but spared the superficial and deep retinal plexuses.

AB	-	Cryptococcuria is a rare manifestation of localized cryptococcal disease. We
		present a case of Cryptococcus neoformans urinary tract infection in an
		immunocompromised host missed by routine laboratory workup. The patient had
		"negative blood cultures, a negative serum cryptococcal antigen (CrAg), and"
		"""non-Candida yeast"" growing in urine culture that was initially dismissed as"
		non-pathogenic. The diagnosis was ultimately made by matrix-assisted laser
		desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) from a
		repeat urine culture after transfer to a tertiary care center. Cryptococcus
		should be considered in the differential of refractory urinary tract infections
		growing non-Candida yeast.

PG	-	116-9
LID	-	10.2478/v10039-009-0014-7 [doi]
AB	-	"Recently, infections caused by cryptococci non-neoformans have been increasingly"
		recognized. Cryptococcus laurentii was previously considered saprophyte and
		"thought to be non-pathogenic to humans. However, in favorable circumstances like"
		"diminished immunity, it seems to be an important pathogen. We present a case of"
		fungaemia caused by Cryptococcus laurentii in a young man with
		membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis on aggressive immunosuppressive therapy.
		We also considered a tick-borne infection because of the endemic area of ticks'
		occurrence. Most cases of fungaemia caused by Cryptococcus laurentii were
		successfully treated with fluconazole. We still observed septic fever and
		positive microbiological blood tests after 3 weeks of treatment with fluconazole
		"in our patient. Therefore, among the others, a computer tomography of abdomen was"
		"done, which revealed an inflammatory (presumably mycotic) focus near right lobe"
		"of the liver. Accordingly, we started treatment with itraconazole. Controlled"
		microbiological blood tests after 5 weeks of itraconazole therapy were negative.
		"Until now, only one case of fungaemia caused by Cryptococcus laurentii with use"
		of itraconazole was reported. Such an unusual fungal infection needs guidelines
		"dealing with earlier diagnosis, treatment and prophylaxis to protect"
		immunocompromised hosts.

AB	-	Cryptococcus neoformans is the most common cause of meningitis amongst adult
		Africans with HIV/AIDS. The widespread use of fluconazole may lead to the
		emergence of isolates with reduced susceptibility. We studied C. neoformans
		isolates from HIV-infected patients with cryptococcal meningitis. Genotyping and
		"antifungal testing were performed to assess the genetic diversity, occurrence of"
		mixed infections and in vitro activity of antifungal agents. Isolates were
		recovered from cerebrospinal fluid prior to systemic antifungal treatment. Six
		isolates were studied for each sample (a total of 114 isolates from 19 patients).
		Serotyping was performed via LAC 1 and CAP 64 gene amplification and genotyping
		"was performed using phage M13 core, (GACA)4 and (GTG)5 primers and restriction"
		"polymorphism analysis of the URA5 gene. Susceptibilities for amphotericin B,"
		"flucytosine, fluconazole, voriconazole and posaconazole were tested by the"
		Sensititre YeastOne® method. All strains were identified as C. neoformans var.
		grubii serotype A. We identified nine major genotypes. Up to two genotypes were
		identified in the same sample. None of the isolates were resistant to the studied
		"drugs. However, 13 of 114 strains exhibited a reduced susceptibility to"
		fluconazole and 13 of 114 strains exhibited a reduced susceptibility to
		flucytosine. No correlation was found between the genotype and susceptibility.
		This study confirms the prevalence of C. neoformans serotype A in Cameroon. Two
		genotypes may be responsible for a single episode of cryptococcosis. The
		possibility of mixed infection and diminished susceptibility to fluconazole or
		flucytosine must be considered for the management of cryptococcosis.

AB	-	Cryptococcal meningitis is an uncommon and severe infection that tends to affect
		immunocompromised hosts worldwide and in the United States. Annually it is
		"estimated that there are 200 000 cases of cryptococcal meningitis, with the most"
		"recent estimate of 3400 cases per year in the United States alone. However,"
		"despite the low incidence, 1-year mortality is estimated at 20% to 30% even with"
		long-term consolidation antifungal therapy. A 37-year-old man presented to the
		"emergency department with headaches, dysarthria, hallucinations, and acute"
		"worsening of altered mental status, and he was found to have increased"
		"intracranial pressure, cerebrospinal fluid leukocytosis, and few encapsulated"
		yeasts consistent with Cryptococcus neoformans meningitis in addition to
		radiologic evidence consistent with a cryptococcoma of the lungs. This report
		highlights the occurrence of Cryptococcus neoformans meningitis in a presumed
		immunocompetent host. The clinician should be aware of sources of minor
		"immunosuppression, as they may contribute to development of Cryptococcus"
		neoformans meningitis. Mortality in this condition remains high due to subacute
		presentations and delayed diagnosis in non-immunocompromised patients.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical features and outcomes of cryptococcal
		meningitis (CM) in HIV-negative patients with and without lung infections.
		METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of HIV-negative patients
		with CM admitted to two university hospitals in Southwest China over the past 5
		"years. RESULTS: Seventy-one patients were included, of whom 35 (49.3%) had lung"
		"disease. Compared with patients without lung infection, CM patients with lung"
		"infection tended to be male and younger (≤30 years), experienced more fever, less"
		vomiting and fewer central nervous system symptoms; more often had low white
		"blood cell (WBC) counts (<20 × 10(6)/L), and fewer often had ethmoid sinusitis,"
		"maxillary sinusitis, paranasal sinusitis, and otitis media. Cryptococcus"
		"neoformans isolates from these patients were sensitive to itraconazole,"
		"voriconazole, fluconazole, and amphotericin B but resistant to flucytosine. CM"
		patients with lung infection had higher mortality at discharge compared with
		patients without lung infection (8.6% vs. 0%). Multivariable analyses showed that
		a WBC count <20 × 10(6)/L was significantly associated with poor treatment
		"outcome (odds ratio 0.01, 95% confidence interval 0-0.83). CONCLUSION:"
		HIV-negative CM patients with lung infections tended to be male and younger.
		"Fever, fewer central nervous system symptoms, and WBC counts <20 × 10(6)/L were"
		characteristic of this patient group.

AB	-	We describe a case of meningitis due to Cryptococcus neoformans var gattii in an
		AIDS patient. The reasons for the observed predominance of C. neoformans var
		neoformans infections in AIDS patients living in areas endemic for the gattii
		variety are not understood thus far. Treatment with fluconazole resulted in poor
		clinical and mycological response. In vitro sensitivity testing of the fungus
		"revealed high minimal inhibitory concentrations, suggesting fluconazole"
		resistance. Treatment with amphotericin B was successful.

AB	-	Upper genital tract infection by Cryptococcus neoformans has not previously been
		"reported. We describe such a case, in order to alert clinicians to the existence"
		of this rare infection. A 34-year-old woman with AIDS presented with chronic
		"menorrhagia, fever, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Despite blood transfusions and"
		"hormonal therapy, her vaginal bleeding could not be controlled and she became"
		hemodynamically unstable. Total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral
		"salpingo-oophorectomy were performed, at which time granulomatous peritonitis and"
		prominent myometrial blood vessels were found. Histologic examination revealed
		cryptococcal infection of all upper genital organs. This case demonstrates that
		"disseminated cryptococcosis may involve the upper genital tract in women, and may"
		be associated with profuse vaginal bleeding.

LID	-	608886
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cushing's disease is associated with an increased risk of pulmonary
		"fungal infection, which could be a relative contraindication for pituitary"
		adenoma excision surgery. CASE: We report a case of a patient with Cushing's
		disease and pulmonary Cryptococcus neoformans. A 48-year-old woman was admitted
		to our hospital because of moon face and edema. Laboratory and radiological
		findings suggested a diagnosis of Cushing's disease and pulmonary cryptococcus
		infection. Fluconazole 400 mg per day was administered intravenously and
		continued orally for 3 months. Both cryptococcus infection and hypercortisolism
		relieved and transsphenoidal resection was performed. CONCLUSION: Cushing's
		disease can be effectively treated with fluconazole to normalize cortisol
		concentration prior to pituitary surgery. Fluconazole is an alternative treatment
		especially in Cushing's disease patients with cryptococcal pneumonia.

TI	-	Cryptococcal meningitis with malaria. A case report.
PG	-	15-7
AB	-	"Cryptococcal meningitis is an uncommon infection globally, including Nigeria."
		This systemic fungal infection often is associated with immunodeficiency. The
		most common causes of meningitis in Nigeria in the 2-3 year age group are the
		malaria parasites and bacteria. The concomitant infections of Cryptococcal
		neoformans and Plasmodium falciparum are uncommon. We present here the report of
		a case of fatal cryptococcal meningitis with malaria infection in a 2 year old
		child from Nigeria (one of the malaria endemic regions of the world). This case
		emphasizes the importance of doing a combination of fungal and bacterial cultures
		as well as looking for malarial parasites in the determination of etiological
		agents of meningitis in any hospital in Africa. We suggest that cerebrospinal
		fluid from meningitis cases must be cultured using Sabouraud dextrose agar and
		any growth on the agar must be examined using Indian ink.

AB	-	Cryptococcus neoformans is the leading cause of cryptococcosis in HIV-infected
		"subjects worldwide. Treatment of cryptococcosis is based on amphotericin B,"
		"flucytosine, and fluconazole. In Zimbabwe, little is known about antifungal"
		susceptibility of Cryptococcus. Sixty-eight genotyped Cryptococcus isolates were
		"tested for antifungal profiles. Amphotericin B, isavuconazole, and voriconazole"
		showed higher activity than other triazoles. Fluconazole and flucytosine were
		"less effective, with geometric mean MICs of 2.24 and 2.67mg/L for C. neoformans"
		"AFLP1/VNI, 1.38 and 1.53mg/L for C. neoformans AFLP1A/VNB/VNII and AFLP1B/VNII,"
		"and 1.85 and 0.68mg/L for Cryptococcus tetragattii, respectively. A significant"
		difference between flucytosine geometric mean MICs of C. neoformans and C.
		tetragattii was observed (P=0.0002). The majority of isolates (n=66/68; 97.1%)
		had a wild-type MIC phenotype of all antifungal agents. This study demonstrates a
		favorable situation with respect to the tested antifungals agents. Continued
		surveillance of antifungal susceptibility profiles is important due to the high
		burden of cryptococcosis in Africa.

PG	-	677-81
AB	-	This report describes a rare combined infection of Cryptococcus neoformans and
		Mycobacterium tuberculosis that manifested as a solitary pulmonary nodule in a
		nonimmunocompromised patient. Transthoracic needle aspiration biopsy was
		"initially nondiagnostic, and histopathologic and culture confirmation of the"
		diagnosis was eventually attained after wedge resection of the nodule. An
		extensive review of the English literature failed to reveal any reported cases of
		such a combined infection with a similar clinical presentation. The variable
		morphologic features of C. neoformans in tissue sections and the protean
		histologic features of pulmonary cryptococcosis can lead to diagnostic
		"difficulties, as illustrated by this case."

PG	-	1018-1022
LID	-	10.2146/ajhp170708 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: A case report of fatal disseminated cryptococcosis in a patient treated
		with eculizumab is presented along with a review of literature suggesting a
		possible etiologic mechanism. SUMMARY: A 23-year-old man with a history of
		minimal change nephrotic syndrome was hospitalized for acute kidney injury and
		abdominal pain and swelling. He was found to have disseminated pneumococcal
		"disease, including peritonitis, bacteremia, and pulmonic endocarditis. The"
		"patient developed evidence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, leading to a"
		"diagnosis of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, and was started on eculizumab."
		The patient initially improved but developed septic shock 18 days after the first
		"dose of eculizumab. All subsequent blood, respiratory, and intraabdominal"
		cultures grew Cryptococcus neoformans. Twenty-eight days after the initial dose
		"of eculizumab, the patient died. Autopsy findings demonstrated disseminated"
		"cryptococcosis, with infection noted in lung, myocardial, kidney, and liver"
		tissues. Considering the complement-dependent nature of host defenses against
		Cryptococcus species and available evidence regarding C. neoformans pathogenicity
		"from studies of murine models, it was hypothesized that the patient's"
		cryptococcosis and death were secondary to administration of eculizumab and
		consequent blockage of the C5 component of the complement cascade. Eculizumab is
		known to predispose recipients to infections with encapsulated organisms;
		"however, this was believed to be the first reported case of infection with an"
		encapsulated yeast possibly due to eculizumab use. Patients receiving eculizumab
		should be monitored closely for invasive cryptococcal infections. CONCLUSION: A
		23-year-old man developed fatal disseminated cryptococcosis after treatment with
		eculizumab.

		"magnetic resonance (MR) imaging one month after the onset, but no leptomeningeal"
		enhancement was detected in the affected sulci on T1-weighted MR imaging. The
		sulcal hyperintensity on FLAIR imaging developed in the bilateral temporal and
		occipital lobes 2 months after the onset. CSF findings obtained by lumbar
		"puncture were within the normal range except for pressure. However, neurological"
		deterioration and reconfirmation of C. neoformans in CSF indicated recurrent
		cryptococcal inflammation. The sulcal hyperintensity on FLAIR imaging may
		indicate a high CSF protein concentration in the subarachnoid space. Such
		cerebral sulcal hyperintensity is an unusual MR imaging finding of cryptococcal
		"meningoencephalitis, and may be an early sign of procrastinating process or"
		recurrent inflammation even if the findings of CSF obtained by lumbar puncture
		are normal.

PG	-	59-64
AB	-	Infection with Human Immunodeficiency Virus is widespread in Malawi and
		cryptococcal meningitis is a common problem in those with AIDS. A review of
		microbiology laboratory records in Lilongwe and Blantyre between July 1991 and
		January 1993 identified 31 patients with cryptococcal meningitis. Diagnosis was
		based on a positive India ink stain of CSF and/or culture of Cryptococcus
		neoformans. There were 16 men (median age 38 years) and 15 women (median age 28
		years) in the investigation. The median duration of symptoms was 2 weeks. The
		"clinical presentation was varied, the most frequent features being headache"
		"(97%), neck stiffness (74%), fever (61%) and altered consciousness (58%). CSF WBC"
		"count, glucose and protein concentrations were non-specific. Most patients could"
		not afford anti-cryptococcal chemotherapy and their median survival time after
		diagnosis was 4 days. Patients who could afford such treatment survived for up to
		several months. Diagnosis is useful for prognostic reasons and may save patients
		unnecessary treatment if tuberculous meningitis is the alternative diagnosis.
		Cryptococcal antigen detection tests may improve diagnostic accuracy. The problem
		of cryptococcal meningitis is likely to become increasingly common as HIV
		infection becomes more widespread.

		from Kamuzu Central Hospital in Lilongwe retrospectively analyzed laboratory
		"records to determine the clinical features, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings,"
		"treatment, and outcome of 31 patients with cryptococcal meningitis admitted to"
		"the hospitals between July, 1991, and January, 1993. Cryptococcal meningitis is a"
		common manifestation of cryptococcosis in people with AIDS. It has become
		prevalent in Malawi in the last 5 years. The incidence of cryptococcal meningitis
		cases among medical admissions at both hospitals was 0.1%/year. The median ages
		"of the 16 men and 15 women were 38 and 28 years, respectively. Symptoms lasted"
		"from 1 day to 5 months (median, 2 weeks). The leading signs and symptoms included"
		"headache (97%), neck stiffness (74%), fever (61%), altered consciousness (58%)."
		The records revealed nonspecific readings for CSF white blood cell count and
		glucose and protein concentrations. 81% of the cases did not receive antifungal
		chemotherapy because they could not afford it. None of these untreated patients
		survived longer than 30 days after diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis. Most
		"died within the 1st 4 days. In fact, the median survival time after diagnosis for"

		"prognoses and keeps them from prescribing unnecessary treatment, especially if"
		tuberculosis meningitis is the other diagnosis. As the prevalence of AIDS
		"increase in Malawi, so should cryptococcal meningitis."

LID	-	10.1093/infdis/jiw007 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcal meningitis remains a significant cause of death among
		human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV)-infected persons in Africa. We aimed to
		"better understand the pathogenesis and identify immune correlates of mortality,"
		particularly the role of monocyte activation. METHODS: A prospective cohort study
		"was conducted in Cape Town, South Africa. Patients with a first episode of"
		"cryptococcal meningitis were enrolled, and their immune responses were assessed"
		"in unstimulated and stimulated blood specimens, using flow cytometry and cytokine"
		"analysis. RESULTS: Sixty participants were enrolled (median CD4(+) T-cell count,"
		34 cells/µL). Mortality was 23% (14 of 60 participants) at 14 days and 39% (22 of
		57) at 12 weeks. Nonsurvivors were more likely to have an altered consciousness
		and higher cerebrospinal fluid fungal burden at presentation. Principal component
		"analysis identified an immune signature associated with early mortality,"
		characterized by monocyte deactivation (reduced HLA-DR expression and tumor
		"necrosis factor α response to lipopolysaccharide); increased serum interleukin 6,"
		"CXCL10, and interleukin 10 levels; increased neutrophil counts; and decreased"
		T-helper cell type 1 responses. This immune signature remained an independent
		predictor of early mortality after adjustment for consciousness level and fungal
		burden and was associated with higher serum titers of cryptococcal
		glucuronoxylomannan. CONCLUSIONS: Cryptococcal-related mortality is associated
		"with monocyte deactivation and an antiinflammatory blood immune signature,"
		possibly due to Cryptococcus modulation of the host immune response. Validation
		in other cohorts is required.

		"amphotericin B, flucytosine and posaconazole: two case reports."
PG	-	465-8
AB	-	Cryptococcus neoformans CNS infection frequently affects HIV-infected patients
		"and is often lethal, despite antifungal therapy. The most recent treatment"
		guidelines for Cryptococcal meningitis recommend therapy with lyposomal
		"amphotericin B and possible association with flucitosine. However, clinical"
		"response rates in HIV-infected patients are not satisfactory, with a persistent"
		high mortality rate and long term therapy is affected by a high risk of major
		"side effects. Posaconazole, the latest broad-spectrum azole, with both in vitro-"
		"and in vivo-documented potent activity against C. neoformans, clearly showed no"
		"antagonism with amphotericin B, echinocandins or flucytosine and it has both in"
		vitro and in vivo agonistic activity with flucytosine against C. neoformans. We
		report two cases of successful salvage therapy based on the addition of
		posaconazole to a standard treatment based on liposomal amphotericin B and
		Flucytosine. In addition we used posaconazole also in a maintenance therapeutic
		regimen with no evidence of recurrences in the follow up of these patients. Our
		report confirms that posaconazole has clinical activity in the CNS against C.
		neoformans infection. In addition posaconazole showed no antagonism with any
		"other currently available antifungal agent, and was in fact synergistic to some"
		"of them (flucytosine); consequently, it seems to be an ideal candidate for"
		antimicrobial combination salvage therapies. Finally posaconazole represents a
		good alternative to parenteral therapy and an ideal candidate for long-term
		maintenance therapy due to its competent toxicity profile and oral
		bioavailability.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Meningitis remains an important cause of morbi-mortality in adults in
		sub-Saharan Africa. Data on the etiological investigation of meningitis in adults
		in Mozambique is limited and most studies were conducted in southern Mozambique.
		Identification of the etiology of meningitis in adults are crucial to guide
		"prevention and treatments strategies. In this study, we determine the burden of"
		fungal and bacterial meningitis among adults at the three largest hospitals in
		Mozambique. METHOD: We performed analysis of data from the routine sentinel
		surveillance system for meningitis in Mozambique from January 2016 to December
		2017. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected from eligible adults (≥18
		years old) who met World Health Organization (WHO) case definition criteria for
		Meningitis. All samples were tested by cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) lateral flow
		"assay (LFA), culture and triplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay"
		and all patients were tested for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) using the
		national algorithm for HIV testing. RESULTS: Retrospective analysis of 1501 CSF
		samples from adults clinically suspected of meningitis revealed that 10.5%
		(158/1501) were positive for bacterial and fungal meningitis. Of these 158
		"confirmed cases, the proportion of Cryptococcal meningitis and pneumococcal"
		"meningitis was38.6% (95% CI: 31.0% to 46.7%) and 36.7% (95% CI: 29.2% to 44.7%),"
		respectively. The other bacterial agents of meningitis identified include
		"Neisseria meningitidis (8.9%; 14/158), Escherichia coli (6.3%; 10/158),"
		"Haemophilus influenzae (5.1%; 8/158) and S. aureus (4.4%; 7/158), which represent"
		"(24.7%; 39/158) of the total confirmed cases. CONCLUSION: Altogether, our"
		findings show a high burden of Cryptococcal meningitis among adults in
		"Mozambique, especially in people living with HIV, followed by pneumococcal"
		meningitis. Our findings suggest that rollout of CrAg Lateral Flow Assay in the
		health system in Mozambique for early detection of cryptococcus neoformans is
		necessary to improve overall patient care.

AB	-	We report a case of Cryptococcus neoformans pulmonary infection complicated by
		empyema in a 79-year-old man with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treated with
		R-CHOP and ibrutinib. A literature review identified 25 cases of cryptococcal
		pleural disease published since 1980. Most cases were caused by the C. neoformans
		species in immunocompromised hosts with an exudative pleural effusion and
		lymphocyte-predominant infiltrate. The cryptococcal antigen test was often
		positive when pleural fluid and serum were tested. The outcome was favourable in
		most cases with antifungal therapy and either thoracocentesis or surgical
		"resection. We also identified 40 cases of opportunistic infections, most commonly"
		"aspergillosis, cryptococcosis and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, in patients"
		treated with ibrutinib. In vitro studies indicate Bruton tyrosine kinase
		inhibition impairs phagocyte function and offer a mechanism for the apparent
		association between ibrutinib and invasive fungal infections.

AB	-	"OBJECTIVE: Cryptococcal meningitis carries a high mortality, and survivors are"
		left with considerable neurologic sequelae and marked disability. We lack a clear
		understanding of the pathogenesis of neurologic sequelae and description of
		stroke features in this population. We aim to describe clinical and radiographic
		features and predictors of stroke in a cohort of patients with cryptococcal
		meningitis. METHODS: We collected key information on patients diagnosed with
		cryptococcal meningitis at the University of Colorado Hospital between 2000 and
		"2018 (n = 42). Of those, 32 had neuroimaging studies available. Bivariate and"
		risk ratio estimates regression models were performed to identify predictors of
		stroke. RESULTS: We found a 26% ischemic stroke complication rate in individuals
		"with cryptococcal meningitis. Most strokes were acute (75%), lacunar (100%),"
		"multiple (88%), bilateral (63%), and involving the basal ganglia (75%). Presence"
		"of malignancy (38% versus 8%, P = .085) was higher in stroke in individuals with"
		"cryptococcal meningitis, although not statistically significant. Every unit"
		decrease in hemoglobin and serum sodium were predictors for 1.35 and 1.14 times
		"increase in the risk of ischemic stroke, respectively. The presence of"
		"hyponatremia carried a RR of 5.7 (95% confidence interval, 1.7-34, P = .005)."
		Cryptococcal meningitis lead to death in 19% of patients and a considerable rate
		of neurologic sequela among survivors. CONCLUSIONS: Cryptococcal meningitis
		"carries a high risk of lacunar stroke, particularly in the basal ganglia."
		Cryptococcal meningitis-associated stroke is common and frequently associated
		with neurologic disability among survivors. We need to understand the possible
		"role of malignancy, anemia, and hyponatremia in the onset of ischemic stroke."

		disease emerges from a latent infection delivered via hematogenous and/or
		lymphatic dissemination from a primary lung infection in immunocompromised
		individuals. A 32-year-old human immunodeficiency virus-positive male was
		admitted for headache and vomiting. He was diagnosed with meningitis due to
		Cryptococcus neoformans and sputum tested positive for Pneumocystis. Six months
		"later, he presented with a slightly crusted yellowish brown plaque and 2 similar"
		but smaller papules with telangiectasia near the right angle of the mouth. Biopsy
		of the area featured histiocytes expanded by foamy cytoplasm as in a xanthoma
		except that the vacuoles were coarser. Special stains ultimately demonstrated the
		characteristic disks of Pneumocystis accompanied by a minor component of budding
		yeasts (Cryptococcus) in the same fields. This case illustrates the utility of
		"adequate special stains in recognizing a mixed cutaneous infection, particularly"
		"in human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients, when microscopy presents an"
		odd xanthoma-like lesion.

		of medication in 18 cases reported in Japan.
PG	-	455-63
AB	-	A case of localized cutaneous cryptococcosis successfully treated with oral
		"itraconazole is reported. The patient, a 63-year-old Japanese housewife, had had"
		an erythematous and partly eroded lesion in the area of her right earlobe for
		about 10 months. No findings suggesting a primary focus of Cryptococcus infection
		"were found in the lung, central nervous system or other internal organs. The"
		isolate obtained from the lesion was identified as Cryptococcus neoformans based
		on the demonstration of encapsulated blastospores and its biological
		characteristics. The clinical course shifted toward healing in parallel with a
		decreased serum level of anticryptococcal antibody after initiation of treatment
		with oral itraconazole in a dose of 100 mg once daily. The treatment was
		discontinued after 13 weeks. There were neither subjective nor objective side
		"effects. Furthermore, this paper reviews the medications employed in 18 cases"
		with cutaneous cryptococcosis reported in Japan during the nearly 40-year period
		between 1952 and 1989.

LID	-	708837
AB	-	The hyper IgM syndromes are a rare group of primary immunodeficiency. The
		"X-linked Hyper IgM syndrome (HIGM), due to a gene defect in CD40L, is the"
		commonest variant; it is characterized by an increased susceptibility to a narrow
		spectrum of opportunistic infection. A few cases of HIGM patients with
		Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis (CM) have been described in the literature.
		Herein we report the case of a young male diagnosed in infancy with HIGM who
		developed CM complicated by a post-infectious inflammatory response syndrome
		"(PIIRS), despite regular immunoglobulin replacement therapy and appropriate"
		antimicrobial prophylaxis. The patient was admitted because of a headache and CM
		was diagnosed through detection of Cryptococcus neoformans in the cerebrospinal
		"fluid. Despite the antifungal therapy resulting to negative CSF culture, the"
		patient exhibited persistent headaches and developed diplopia. An analysis of
		"inflammatory cytokines on CSF, as well as the brain MRI, suggested a diagnosis of"
		"PIIRS. Therefore, a prolonged corticosteroids therapy was started obtaining a"
		complete resolution of symptoms without any relapse.

		cases demonstrated by immunocytochemistry.
PG	-	168-73
AB	-	We report two cases in which immunocytochemistry demonstrated simultaneous
		infections within a single biopsy specimen obtained from each of two
		immunocompromised patients in whom multiple organism infection was not suspected.
		"Using a rapid immunocytochemical technique, Pneumocystis carinii and Cryptococcus"
		neoformans were demonstrated in a transbronchial lung biopsy from the first
		patient; Candida and cytomegalovirus were demonstrated in an endoscopic biopsy of
		the esophagus from the second patient. Routine hematoxylin and eosin as well as
		special stains failed to establish the presence of more than one infectious agent
		in either case. Mycology cultures ultimately confirmed the presence of
		"Cryptococcus in the first case, but cultures were not performed in the second"
		case due to the scant amount of tissue obtained from the biopsy. The results
		indicate that concurrent infection by more than one opportunistic organism in
		immunocompromised patients can easily remain unrecognized. The use of
		immunocytochemistry may thus provide an important adjunct to routine and special
		stains or specific cultures.

PG	-	864-7
AB	-	Fungal infections of prosthetic dialysis fistulae are rare. We report the first
		case of infection of a polytetrafluoroethylene dialysis access graft with the
		yeast Cryptococcus neoformans. Therapy with antifungal agents alone failed to
		cure the infection and significant improvement was observed only when all
		prosthetic material was surgically removed. This case emphasizes the potential
		for fungal infection of prosthetic dialysis fistulae and the importance of
		removal of intravascular foreign material in conjunction with antifungal therapy

AB	-	Cryptococcus is a cosmopolitan fungus with tropism for the nervous system and a
		higher prevalence of infection in immunosuppressed patients. Neurological
		compromise caused by this microorganism mainly debuts as a meningeal syndrome
		"(headache, fever, neck stiffness) with predominant encephalic involvement. In"
		this report we present the rare case of a non-HIV patient with flaccid paralysis
		and peripheral nerve involvement due to crytpococcal meningitis. This is a
		"53-years-old woman, with a past-medical history of diabetes, who presented with"
		"dysarthria, unilateral peripheral facial paralysis, asymmetric ascending"
		"quadriparesis, generalized hyporeflexia and urinary retention. Neuroimaging was"
		initially reported as negative for vascular or demyelinating diseases.
		"Electrophysiological studies were performed, and acute flaccid paralysis of"
		undetermined etiology was defined as a temporal clinical diagnosis. Cerebrospinal
		fluid molecular analysis confirmed the presence of Cryptococcus neoformans var.
		"gatti; posteriorly, antifungal treatment with amphotericin B and fluconazole was"
		started. Polyneuroradiculopathy symptoms significantly improved over the
		"in-hospital stay. In conclusion, spinal cord and peripheral nerve involvement by"
		Cryptococcus is an infrequent cause of acute flaccid paralysis that should be
		considered in the differential diagnosis even in HIV-negative patients.

PG	-	343-6
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcus neoformans is a very important cause of fungal
		meningitis in immunosuppressed patients OBJECTIVE: To describe a case of
		cryptococcal meningoencephalitis in an HIV/AIDS patient from the University of
		Ilorin Teaching Hospital. METHODS: An 18 -year -old male student presented with
		"cough, weight loss, and fever. He was clinically assessed and had full laboratory"
		investigations including cerebrospinal fluid CSF and then started on
		chemotherapy. Both the clinical and neurological evaluation of the patient was
		described along with the laboratory analyses of his CSF. Outcome of how he was
		managed was also reported. RESULTS: Cryptococcus neoformans presented as an AIDS
		defining fungal infection for the first time in this 18 year old undergraduate
		who was infected probably from transfusion of unscreened blood He had advanced
		HIV infection (CD4+ count of 29 cells/ul) and severe cryptococcal
		"meningoencephalitis. He was unsuccessfully managed with fluconazole, a second"
		"choice drug for this condition, amphotericin B being not available. CONCLUSION:"
		Nigerians should have access to effective blood transfusion services at all
		public and private hospitals across the country. The National Essential Drug list
		should be expanded to include drugs such as amphotericin B which hitherto were
		considered exotic.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Leukopenia, a rare adverse effect of Fingolimod therapy, paves the"
		"way for opportunistic infections. In this study, we reported rare fingolimod"
		associated cryptococcal meningitis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 39-year-old woman with
		RRMS was referred to the emergency department. The patient's major complaints
		"were headache, fever, weakness, and progressive loss of consciousness within the"
		last two days prior to the referral. The patient had a history of hospitalization
		"due to RRMS [two times]. In the second hospitalization, interferon Beta-1a was"
		"replaced with Fingolimod. Using polymerase chain reaction, Cryptococcus"
		neoformans was detected in CSF. Liposomal amphotericin B and fluconazole [800 mg
		"per day] were started. Six weeks later, the patient was discharged without any"
		major complaints. CONCLUSION: Albeit fingolimod associated cryptococcal
		"meningitis is a rare event, Fingolimod therapy in patients with MS should be"
		performed cautiously. Regular follow-ups may give rise to a timely diagnosis of
		probable fingolimod associated cryptococcal meningitis. Fingolimod therapy can
		"lead to lymphocytopenia and various infections. We, therefore, suggest that"
		intermittent blood lymphocyte counts as well as monitoring of clinical
		manifestations among MS patients treated with Fingolimod to avoid additional
		neurological and physical disabilities in these patients.

		retrospective study from Thailand.
PG	-	133-9
AB	-	Twenty-four consecutive patients with central nervous system cryptococcosis
		(C.C.) have been studied retrospectively. In contrary to many reports from
		America or Europe only two patients suffered from an underlying
		immunocompromising disease. All patients were treated uniformly by amphotericin B
		and 5-fluorocytosin. They were monitored closely and dose-adjustment was done
		according to laboratory data. None of the patients died. Sixteen were available
		for a six-month post-treatment follow-up: seven had various degrees of
		neurological long-term sequelae whereas nine had no complaints and neurological
		examination was without abnormal findings. Our series is compared with others
		both from tropical and non-tropical countries. In accordance with all but one
		larger series from the tropics the relatively good prognosis and extremely rare
		occurrence of C.C. in immunocompromised persons is noted. Since different
		varieties of Cryptococcus neoformans have been shown to exist in different
		"climate zones, this might be one of the possible explanations for the lack of"
		preceding immune-compromising conditions in persons suffering from C.C. in the
		tropics and the benign course of disease.

AB	-	Disseminated cryptococcosis is an uncommon occurrence in immunocompetent
		populations and occurs mainly in immunocompromised patients. The first case of
		cryptococcus meningitis and skin lesions in a 4-year-old confirmed HIV negative
		"boy who presented with fever, meningism and skin lesions is reported. On"
		"examination the child was confused, uncooperative, and had neck stiffness and"
		"raised skin lesions. A septic screen, including skin scraping, was performed; the"
		child was treated with penicillin and ceftriaxone for suspected meningococcal
		"meningitis. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) had normal protein, glucose and"
		chloride levels; yeasts were observed on Gram stain from the CSF and skin
		scraping. The India ink stain and Cryptococcus neoformans latex agglutination
		"test on the CSF were both positive. Bacterial culture of the skin biopsy, CSF and"
		blood culture specimens was negative. The child was treated with amphotericin B
		"based on preliminary results, and had a gradual recovery with no neurological"
		sequelae. The child continued oral fluconazole.

AB	-	An 8-year-old HIV-positive antiretroviral therapy-naive child developed severe
		headache and generalized lymphadenopathy. The serum cryptococcal antigen (CRAG)
		"test was positive, the histology on the lymph node biopsy revealed budding yeast"
		"cells, and Cryptococcus neoformans was isolated on culture of his cerebrospinal"
		fluid. He was treated with intravenous amphotericin B followed by oral
		fluconazole with a good response. Therefore cryptococcal lymphadenitis should be
		considered in the differential diagnosis of children presenting with
		lymphadenopathy and a positive serum CRAG.

TI	-	Cryptococcus neoformans population diversity and clinical outcomes of
		HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis patients in Zimbabwe.
PG	-	1281-1288
LID	-	10.1099/jmm.0.000354 [doi]
AB	-	HIV and cryptococcal meningitis co-infection is a major public health problem in
		most developing countries. Cryptococcus neoformans sensu stricto is responsible
		for the majority of HIV-associated cryptococcosis cases in sub-Saharan Africa.
		"Despite the available information, little is known about cryptococcal population"
		diversity and its association with clinical outcomes in patients with
		HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis in sub-Saharan Africa. In a prospective
		"cohort, we investigated the prevalence and clinical outcome of"
		Cryptococcusneoformans sensu stricto meningitis among HIV-infected patients in
		"Harare, Zimbabwe, and compared the genotypic diversity of the isolates with those"
		collected from other parts of Africa. Molecular typing was done using amplified
		fragment length polymorphism genotyping and microsatellite typing. The majority
		of patients with HIV-associated Cryptococcusneoformans sensu stricto meningitis
		in this cohort were males (n=33/55; 60.0 %). The predominant Cryptococcus
		neoformans sensu stricto genotype among the Zimbabwean isolates was genotype
		"AFLP1/VNI (n=40; 72.7 %), followed by AFLP1A/VNB/VNII (n=8; 14.6 %), and"
		AFLP1B/VNII was the least isolated (n=7; 12.7 %). Most of the isolates were
		"mating-type α (n=51; 92.7 %), and only four (7.3 %) were mating-type a. Overall"
		"in-hospital mortality was 55.6 % (n=30), and no difference between infecting"
		genotype and clinical outcome of patient (P=0.73) or CD4+ counts (P=0.79) was
		observed. Zimbabwean Cryptococcusneoformans sensu stricto genotypes demonstrated
		"a high level of genetic diversity by microsatellite typing, and 51 genotypes"
		"within the main molecular types AFLP1/VNI, AFLP1A/VNB/VNII and AFLP1B/VNII were"
		identified. This study demonstrates that Cryptococcusneoformans sensu stricto in
		Zimbabwe has a high level of genetic diversity when compared to other regional
		isolates.

AB	-	Cryptococcus neoformans variety gattii (C. gattii) causes infection in
		predominantly immunocompetent individuals. The majority of cases present with
		headache due to meningitis and its natural history normally follows an indolent
		course. We report a fatal case of fulminant cryptococcaemia culminating in severe
		intracranial hypertension due to C. gattii. Such cases of fulminant disease are
		rare and highlight a number of important therapeutic and diagnostic
		"considerations. We discuss the atypical nature of this patient's illness, the"
		major complications of C. gattii meningitis and the role of computed tomography
		(CT) in preventing serious sequelae from lumbar puncture. The management of
		intracranial hypertension (ICH) in critically ill patients is also reviewed.

TI	-	Epidemiological trends of cryptococcosis in Italy: Molecular typing and
		susceptibility pattern of Cryptococcus neoformans isolates collected during a
		20-year period.
PG	-	963-971
LID	-	10.1093/mmy/myx152 [doi]
AB	-	In the present study clinical data and isolates from cases of cryptococcosis
		"recorded during clinical surveys carried out in Italy from 1997 to 2016, were"
		investigated. Molecular typing and antifungal susceptibility testing were
		performed in order to delineate the epidemiological trend of cryptococcosis in
		Italy and to define wild-type population for four different antifungal compounds.
		"During the studied period, a total of 302 cases collected from 32 centers of 11"
		Italian regions were recorded. Analysis of clinical data showed a significant
		increase of frequency (from 7% to 38%) of cryptococcosis in human
		immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative patients primarily with hematologic
		malignancies and solid organ transplantations. The prevalence of the molecular
		"types has significantly changed during the study period, showing an increase of"
		"VNIII isolates from 11% to 41% in HIV-negative patients, and a decrease of VNIV"
		isolates from 36% to 16%. Antifungal susceptibility testing allowed us to
		"calculate the epidemiological cut-off for flucytosine (1 mg/l), fluconazole (8"
		"mg/l), itraconazole (0.5 mg/l), and voriconazole (0.25 mg/l). Most of the"
		isolates were wild-type strains. Comparison of the MIC distributions according to
		molecular types showed that VNIV isolates had lower MICs for fluconazole and
		itraconazole than the VNI and VIII isolates. The current study emphasizes that
		the epidemiology of cryptococcosis in Italy has significantly changed over the
		last decades.

TI	-	Cryptococcus gattii: A dilemma in diagnosis and treatment in sub-Saharan Africa
		an area with high HIV prevalence.
PG	-	71-3
AB	-	Sub-Saharan Africa contributes at least 70% of the global cryptococcal
		meningoencephalitis cases each year and the majority of cases are caused by the
		Cryptococcus neoformans species. We present a case of meningoencephalitis due to
		Cryptococcus gattii in an 18 year old apparently immunocompetent male patient
		from Zimbabwe.

TI	-	Disseminated cryptococcosis in an AIDS patient with unusual clinical
		presentation.
PG	-	179-81
AB	-	Disseminated cryptocococcosis is a rare and often fatal disease. Here in we
		report an unusual fatal case of disseminated cryptococcosis. The patient
		presented with a past history of postmenopausal bleeding with loss of
		"consciousness, altered mental status, few seizures and a low grade fever. Lumbar"
		"puncture revealed elevated pressure, lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein"
		and markedly reduced glucose level. Cryptococcus neoformans was isolated from
		cerebrospinal fluid and blood. Serological assay revealed the presence of human
		immunodeficiency virus. The patient was treated with antifungal agents
		intravenously without any signs of improvement and the patient passed away after
		two weeks of therapy. This is the first case report of disseminated
		cryptococcosis in an AIDS patient suffering from cryptoccoccal vaginitis.

		patients--a report of two cases.
PG	-	80-2
AB	-	Cryptococcus neoformans is the leading cause of meningitis in patients with
		Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and is associated with high mortality
		"rate. Presenting symptoms include fever, nausea and vomiting, altered mentation,"
		headache and meningismus. Cryptococcal meningitis is not infrequently complicated
		by raised intracranial pressure and visual sequelae (sometimes by blindness). In
		"patients who survive the infection, the most debilitating outcome appears to be"
		visual impairment or blindness. Management of impending visual complication
		combines medical and surgical treatment modalities. We report two cases of
		cryptococcal meningitis associated with visual impairment.

TI	-	Causes of death among patients with HIV in Singapore from 1985 to 2001: results
		from the Singapore HIV Observational Cohort Study (SHOCS).
PG	-	289-95
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To investigate the major primary and contributory causes of death
		among HIV patients in Singapore. DESIGN: A retrospective observational cohort
		study of all adult patients seen at the national referral centre for HIV in
		Singapore between 1985 and 2001. METHODS: Data were extracted from the patients'
		records by 10 trained health care workers. AIDS-defining conditions were
		"established using predefined criteria. For each case, a single principal cause of"
		death and up to three contributory causes were identified. RESULTS: A total of
		"1504 patients aged 17 years or over were seen before the end of 2001, of whom 504"
		have died. The most frequent principal causes of death were Mycobacterium avium
		"(17.5%), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (9.7%), pneumonia (cause unknown) (6.5%) and"
		Cryptococcus neoformans (6.7%). Three hundred and eighteen patients (63.1%) died
		from an AIDS-defining condition. CONCLUSIONS: The causes of death were similar to
		"those found in Western cohorts, except that disseminated M. avium was a more"
		frequent cause of death.

TI	-	Cryptococcus neoformans meningoencephalitis in African children with acquired
		immunodeficiency syndrome.
PG	-	54-6
AB	-	BACKGROUND: The number of children with AIDS in Africa is high. Such children may
		"be at risk for cryptococcal meningoencephalitis, but data are scarce regarding"
		this disease in our population. METHODS: We examined records of HIV-infected
		children (< or =16 years) diagnosed with cryptococcal meningoencephalitis in
		"Harare, Zimbabwe, between 1995 and 2000. To elucidate features unique to"
		"pediatric disease, the children were compared with adult patients with"
		HIV-associated cryptococcal meningoencephalitis. RESULTS: Thirteen children
		"presented to our institution with headache (85%), nuchal rigidity (69%), vomiting"
		"(46%), impaired mental status (38%), convulsions (38%) and focal neurologic signs"
		(23%). The mean duration of symptoms before diagnosis was 9 days. Cerebrospinal
		"fluid examination revealed normal white blood cell counts in 64%, protein value"
		in 67% and glucose concentration in 57% of patients. Children were more likely
		"than adults to have seizures (38% vs. 11%, P = 0.02) and normal cerebrospinal"
		"fluid protein (67% vs. 10%, P < 0.01). The in-hospital mortality was 43%."
		Convulsions (P = 0.05) and impaired mental status (P < 0.01) were associated with
		increased mortality CONCLUSIONS: Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis in African
		"children presents acutely or subacutely, can have a fulminant picture and is"
		consistent with progressive meningoencephalitis.

TI	-	Cryptococcus meningoencephalitis in AIDS: parenchymal and meningeal forms.
PG	-	129-33
AB	-	CT and MRI in one case of Cryptococcus neoformans infection showed
		contrast-enhancing parenchymal lesions resembling granulomata or abscesses. After
		"an initial phase without contrast enhancement, the full extent of the lesions was"
		visible within 2 weeks of presentation. The enhancing masses were assumed to
		represent intracerebral cryptococcomas. Despite evidence of massive meningeal
		"infection on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination, no radiological signs of"
		"meningitis, invasion of the Virchow-Robin spaces or ventriculitis could be"
		demonstrated. With antimycotic treatment the contrast enhancement disappeared and
		"cystic, partly calcified lesions remained. Recurrence of meningeal infection"
		without radiological correlates was apparent in this stage. In a second case of
		"proven cryptococcus meningitis, dilation of Virchow-Robin spaces or cysts in the"
		adjacent parenchyma were the main abnormalities on MRI. Enhancing masses were not
		detected. These cases may represent two different reactions of the
		immunocompromised hosts to infection with C. neoformans: widening of the
		perivascular spaces as a correlate of the more typical meningeal infection and
		enhancing parenchymal lesions as a sign of further invasion from the CSF spaces.
		"Enhancement of cryptococcomas, indicating an inflammatory response in the"
		"surrounding brain, is not typical in patients with impairment of immune function."

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcosis is a systemic infection caused by Cryptococcus
		"neoformans, and cryptococcal meningitis can occur in patients with late-stage"
		human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and other forms of immunosuppressive
		status. This study was designed to compare clinical features and laboratory
		findings of cryptococcal meningitis in HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients.
		"METHODS: From January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2009, all patients aged more than"
		18 years hospitalized at National Taiwan University Hospital with a diagnosis of
		"cryptococcal meningitis were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: In total, 88"
		patients with cryptococcal meningitis were identified and 37 (42%) were HIV
		"infected. Cryptococcal meningitis occurred in young (mean, 38 vs. 60; p < 0.001)"
		"and male (97% vs. 63%, p < 0.001) populations more frequently among HIV-positive"
		"group with higher Charlson comorbidity score (mean, 7 vs. 4; p < 0.001), higher"
		"initial complaint of cough (36% vs. 16%; p = 0.032), lower cerebrospinal fluid"
		"(CSF) white count (mean, 26 vs. 86; p = 0.024), lower total protein of the CSF"
		"(mean, 88 vs. 149; p = 0.012), higher percentage of serum latex agglutination"
		"cryptococcal antigen titer exceeding 1:512 (77% vs. 50%; p = 0.026), more"
		"extraneural involvement (70% vs. 49%; p = 0.046), more cryptococcemia (68% vs."
		"35%; p = 0.003), and higher proportion of normal brain images (44% vs. 13%;"
		p = 0.003) than HIV-negative group. The all-cause mortality rates on Day 30 and
		"Day 90 were 23.9% and 31.8%, respectively. The independent risk factors for Day"
		"30 mortality were altered mental status, extraneural involvement, absence of"
		"lymphocyte predominance, and absence of leptomeningeal enhancement (odds ratio:"
		"7.84, 9.71, 0.22, and 0.07, respectively; 95% confidence interval): 2.03-30.27,"
		"2.01-46.94, 0.06-0.80, and 0.01-0.49, respectively). Those for Day 90 mortality"
		"were serum white count more than 11,000/μL, higher Charlson comorbidity score,"
		"and absence of normal brain images (odds ratio: 5.39, 1.40, and 0.09,"
		"respectively; 95% confidence interval: 1.22-23.72, 1.11-1.76, and 0.01-0.78,"
		respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The clinical features of cryptococcal meningitis
		"between HIV and non-HIV patients have some divergences, including age, sex,"
		"underlying diseases, CSF parameters, extraneural site involvement, fungemia, and"
		"so on. We also identified risk factors for mortality of this disease. However,"
		the mortality of cryptococcal meningitis was not different in HIV-positive and
		HIV-negative patients in terms of Day 30 and Day 90 mortality.

AB	-	Cryptococcal meningitis is the most important opportunistic fungal infection with
		"a high mortality in HIV-patients in less developed regions. Here, we report a"
		case of cryptococcal meningitis in a 49-year-old HIV-positive female due to
		"Cryptococcus neoformans (serotype A, mating-type alpha, genotype AFLP1/VNI) in"
		"Sari, Iran. In vitro antifungal susceptibility tests showed MICs of isavuconazole"
		"(0.016 μg ml(-1) ), voriconazole (0.031 μg ml(-1) ), posaconazole (0.031 μg"
		"ml(-1) ), itraconazole (0.063 μg ml(-1) ), amphotericin B (0.125 μg ml(-1) ) and"
		"fluconazole (8 μg ml(-1) ). Despite immediate antifungal therapy, the patient"
		died 4 days later due to respiratory failure. Cryptococcal infections have been
		infrequently reported from Iran and therefore we analysed all published cases of
		cryptococcosis in Iran since the first reported case from 1969.

TI	-	Relevance of intracranial hypertension control in the management of Cryptococcus
		neoformans meningitis related to AIDS.
PG	-	1073-7
AB	-	PURPOSE: To evaluate the relationship between intracranial hyperpressure (HICP)
		and mortality in patients with cryptococcal meningitis related to AIDS (CMRA).
		METHODS: This was an observational retrospective study. Patients were treated
		according to the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations during
		"the evaluation period (days 0, 3, 5 and after hospitalization). High intracranial"
		pressure (HICP) was defined as ICP values of C250 mm H20. The correlation between
		HICP and mortality at each of the three time points considered was investigated.
		Statistical analysis on the descriptive parameters and on the probability of a
		"""death"" event (odds ratio, OR) at each of those three time points was performed"
		using the statistical software program Epidata. RESULTS: Eighty patients were
		"included in this study, of whom 53 (66.25 %) were male. The average age of the"
		patients was 37.5 ± 8.1 (range 22–55) years. The median CD4?lymphocyte cell count
		"was 35 (range 0–367) cells/ml. Among the entire patient cohort, 53 patients had a"
		"favorable outcome, and the mortality rate was 33.75 %. At baseline (day 0), 57"
		"subjects (71.5 %) presented HICP, and these patients had a higher mortality rate"
		"than those with a normal ICP, but the difference did not reach statistical"
		"significance[OR 1.65, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.56–4.84]. On day 3, 41 of"
		"the patients presented HICP, and HICP at this timepoint was significantly"
		"associated with an increased risk of mortality (OR 4.35, 95 % CI 1.56–12.09). On"
		"day 5, 35(43.5 %) patients presented HICP, and HCIP at this time point was also"
		"significantly associated with higher mortality (OR 7.23, 95 % CI 2.53–20.14)."
		CONCLUSION: The results of this study confirm an association between HICP and
		mortality in patients with CMRA and indicate that the control of ICP during the
		first 5 days of hospitalization is more important than managing HICP only at
		baseline.

PG	-	1003

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Although antiretroviral therapy (ART) has greatly improved the
		"prognosis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients globally,"
		"opportunistic infections (OIs) are still common in Chinese AIDS patients,"
		especially cryptococcosis. CASE PRESENTATION: We described here two Chinese AIDS
		patients with cryptococcal infections. Case one was a fifty-year-old male. At
		"admission, he was conscious and oriented, with papulonodular and umbilicated skin"
		"lesions, some with ulceration and central necrosis resembling molluscum"
		contagiosum. The overall impression reminded us of talaromycosis: we therefore
		"initiated empirical treatment with amphotericin B, even though the case history"
		"of this patient did not support such a diagnosis. On the second day of infusion,"
		"the patient complained of intermittent headache, but the brain CT revealed no"
		"abnormalities. On the third day, a lumbar puncture was performed. The cerebral"
		"spinal fluid (CSF) was turbid, with slightly increased pressure. India ink"
		"staining was positive, but the cryptococcus antigen latex agglutination test"
		"(CrAgLAT: IMMY, USA) was negative. Two days later, the blood culture showed a"
		"growth of Cryptococcus neoformans, and the same result came from the skin"
		"culture. We added fluconazole to the patient's treatment, but unfortunately, he"
		died three days later. Case two was a sixty-four-year-old female patient with
		"mild fever, productive cough, dyspnea upon movement, and swelling in both lower"
		limbs. The patient was empirically put on cotrimoxazole per os and moxifloxacin
		"by infusion. A bronchofibroscopy was conducted with a fungal culture, showing"
		growth of Cryptococcus laurentii colonies. Amphotericin B was started thereafter
		but discontinued three days later in favor of fluconazole 400 mg/d due to
		worsening renal function. The patient became afebrile after 72 h of treatment
		with considerable improvement of other comorbidities and was finally discharged
		with continuing oral antifungal therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Our cases illustrate that
		cryptococcal disease is an important consideration when treating
		immunocompromised individuals such as AIDS patients. Life threatening meningitis
		or meningoencephalitis caused by C. neoformansmay still common in these
		"populations and can vary greatly in clinical presentations, especially with"
		"regard to skin lesions. Pulmonary cryptococcosis caused by C. laurentii is rare,"
		but should also be considered in certain contexts. Guidelines for its earlier
		"diagnosis, treatment and prophylaxis are needed."

PG	-	816-9
AB	-	A 53-year-old woman experienced progressive general weakness and lumbago in the 2
		years prior to a physical examination which disclosed cushingoid manifestations
		and a skin ulcer on the back of her right knee joint. Her plasma cortisol
		"concentration ranged from 24.7 to 31.1 microg/dl, with an ACTH level <5 pg/ml."
		Urinary excretions of 17-hydroxycorticosteroid (17-OHCS) and 17-ketosteroid
		"(17-KS) were 20.5 mg/day and 5.1 mg/day, respectively, and urinary cortisol was"
		also increased (421 microg/day). Cortisol was not suppressed after the
		"administration of 8 mg dexamethasone. Abdominal ultrasound sonography, computed"
		"tomography (CT) scan, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies demonstrated a"
		"left adrenal tumor and further, a chest X-ray examination showed a cavitary"
		lesion containing a fungus ball-like mass in the left lower lung field. The serum
		cryptococcal antigen titer was positive at 1:128 and a bronchoalveolar lavage
		fluid culture yielded a growth of Cryptococcus neoformans. A biopsy specimen of
		"the skin ulcer also suggested cryptococcosis. As a result, a left adrenectomy was"
		"performed, and the excised specimen was shown to be an adenoma consisting of"
		compact cells with abundant pigmentation (black adenoma). A diagnosis of
		"functioning black adenoma of the adrenal gland, complicated with pulmonary and"
		cutaneous cryptococcosis was made.

TI	-	Cryptococcal disease presenting as cellulitis.
PG	-	666-72
AB	-	Three immunocompromised patients presented with cellulitis as the primary
		manifestation of cryptococcal disease. Two were recipients of cadaveric renal
		transplants who were receiving immunosuppressive drug therapy. The other patient
		had profound lymphopenia and severe hypoalbuminemia due to intestinal
		lymphangiectasia. All had failed to respond to empiric therapy for presumed
		bacterial cellulitis before results of skin biopsy or aspiration were available
		for the correct diagnosis to be made. With administration of systemic antifungal
		"therapy, two patients survived. Although other forms of cryptococcal involvement"
		"of the skin are not rare, cellulitis is seldom considered to be a cutaneous"
		manifestation of the disease. Our cases and a review of the English-language
		literature indicate that Cryptococcus neoformans must be included in the
		differential diagnosis of cellulitis in immunocompromised patients and that the
		presence of cryptococcal cellulitis suggests disseminated cryptococcal disease.
		Prompt diagnosis and treatment may dramatically reduce mortality.

AB	-	Cryptococcal meningitis is a critical illness affecting 0.2% to 5% solid-organ
		transplant recipients with a 40% to 50% mortality. We report the case of a
		"48-year-old lung transplant recipient, who, 15 months after a right lung graft,"
		kept parakeets and developed meningitis due to Cryptococcus neoformans.
		Immunosuppressive treatment was based on a quadruple sequential immunosuppressive
		"therapy that included induction therapy with thymoglobulin, followed by"
		"corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and mycophenolate mofetil. Antifungal"
		susceptibility testing of Cryptococcus neoformans showed resistance to
		flucytosine and intermediate sensitivity to fluconazole. Initial treatment
		"adhered to international guidelines; however, the patient could not tolerate an"
		effective double-antifungal therapy during the first 2 months of treatment.
		Despite this delayed treatment for an aggressive infection in an
		"immunocompromised patient, the patient survived without relapse and received"
		maintenance treatment with fluconazole during the course of 3 years.
		Administration of calcineurin inhibitors as immunosuppressive treatment may
		"partly explain this outcome, as this therapeutic class is known to protect from"
		severe forms of cryptococcal meningitis.

OAB	-	This is the first report from Ethiopia of a case of cryptococcal meningitis in a
		patient with AIDS. A 20-year-old woman was admitted to Tikur Anbessa Hospital in
		"January 1990 with complaints of generalized pruritic skin lesions of six months,"
		"and headache, fever, and poor appetite of three months duration. The headache and"
		"low-grade intermittent fever were accompanied by nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and"
		"progressive weight loss, without diarrhea. She had had multiple sex partners."
		"Upon admission, after being bedridden for two weeks, she appeared acutely ill and"
		"restless. Her temperature was 39.5 degrees Celsius, and she had oral thrush."
		"There was no lymphadenopathy. Widespread, irregular erythematous and whitish"
		macular patches (3 x 5 to 8 x 10 sq. cm in size) with peripheral scaling and tiny
		"vesicles were found on the skin, pubic and perineal regions. She had neck"
		"stiffness, but was conscious and well-oriented. Hemoglobin (Hb) was 10.5 g%; the"
		white cell count (WBC) was 3400/cu. mm; the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)
		"was 92 mm/hr; the platelet count was 175,000/mm; and blood films were negative"
		for hemoparasites. Urinalysis showed 3+ albumin and many pus cells and red
		"cells/HPF. Urine culture was negative, and the VDRL test was nonreactive. Lumbar"
		"puncture, which was performed upon arrival, showed clear cerebrospinal fluid"
		"(CSF), with normal protein and glucose levels and no cells. CSF culture showed"
		"yeast cells, and an India ink preparation was positive for Cryptococcus"
		neoformans. Blood taken for bacterial culture grew yeast cells. Renal and liver
		"function tests, and chest x-rays were normal. A potassium hydroxide (KOH)"
		preparation from a skin snip showed rounded yeast cells. ELISA and Western blot
		tests were both positive. The patient was given supportive treatment and
		"amphotericin B (0.6 mg/kg daily). Although the fever decreased, the patient's"
		"general condition did not improve. She complained of headache, photophobia,"
		"nausea, and vomiting. Lumbar puncture was repeated eight days after the start of"
		treatment; CSF culture and India ink preparations were negative. Urea nitrogen
		"(BUN) repeated two weeks later was normal. Four weeks after admission, the"
		patient suddenly vomited massive amounts of fresh blood and died before
		transfusion could be given. A discussion follows regarding the clinical
		"manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of this disease, particularly in AIDS"
		"patients, with a review of the literature."

AB	-	BACKGROUND: The meningitides are rare but well-identified complications in
		patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). AIMS: To determine the clinical
		"characteristics, risk factors, prevalence and outcomes of the meningitides"
		(septic and aseptic) in patients with SLE. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January
		"1988 to December 2006, we identified patients with SLE and septic or aseptic"
		meningitis. RESULTS: We identified 25 episodes of meningitis in 23 patients with
		"SLE, from a total of 1,411 SLE patients (1.63%); in 15 out of 25 episodes, a"
		"microorganism was identified. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Listeria monocytogenes"
		"and Criptococcus neoformans represented the main microorganisms. In 10 episodes,"
		"aseptic meningitis was diagnosed. Lymphopenia, steroid use, chronic damage and"
		systemic activity of SLE were frequent in both kinds of meningitis. Although the
		"clinical presentation did not differ significantly, patients with septic"
		meningitis had more residual neurological deficits (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS:
		Meningitis was observed in about 1.6% of the patients with SLE; in 40% of the
		"cases, no microorganism could be isolated. A residual neurological deficit was"
		more common in patients with septic meningitis.

		antigen titer during the course of treatment. Although the initial deterioration
		"was temporarily improved by placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, he"

		analysis shows an increased cryptococcal antigen titer.

AB	-	The prostate gland is a rare site of primary infection due to Cryptococcus
		"neoformans; however, it may serve as a site of its sequestration after an occult"
		or treated disseminated infection. Serum prostate specific antigen may correlate
		"with the severity of prostatic inflammation, but its role as a diagnostic and"
		prognostic marker is unclear. We report the first case of primary cryptococcal
		prostatitis in a renal transplant recipient. The diagnosis was established based
		"on asymmetrically enlarged prostate gland, markedly elevated serum PSA levels,"
		"cryptococcal fungemia, an ultrasound-guided prostatic biopsy that demonstrated"
		cryptococcal fungal elements and growth of C. neoformans on culture. The patient
		was successfully treated with a prolonged course of fluconazole and remained
		"disease-free for more than 28 months of follow-up. In addition, we present a"
		review of the published literature since 1946 and discuss possible correlation
		with PSA levels.

TI	-	Case report: vitamin D-mediated hypercalcemia in fungal infections.
PG	-	71-6
AB	-	Hypercalcemia has been well described in a variety of neoplastic and
		granulomatous diseases. One mechanism for this hypercalcemia is via the excess
		"production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D from extra-renal sources. The authors"
		describe an AIDS patient infected with Cryptococcus neoformans who had suggestive
		evidence of vitamin D-mediated hypercalcemia. He had an elevated serum
		"1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D value, a normal 25-hydroxyvitamin D value, and low values"
		for parathyroid hormone and parathyroid hormone-related peptide. Most previously
		reported cases of hypercalcemia associated with fungal infections did not include
		"sufficient evidence to implicate a role for excess 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D"
		"production, except for two case reports involving patients with hypercalcemia"
		with infections due to Pneumocystis carinii and Candida albicans. The authors'
		patient's hypercalcemia resolved during treatment of his underlying infection.
		Patients with hypercalcemia or in whom hypercalcemia develops during a
		disseminated fungal infection should have vitamin D metabolites measured as part
		of their work-up.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: We present a case of meningitis caused by Cryptococcus neoformans
		"var. grubii in a 46-year old non-HIV-infected patient with multiple sclerosis,"
		treated with dimethyl fumarate monotherapy. We identified no other risk factors
		for developing cryptococcal meningitis. The patient presented with a slowly
		"progressive headache during preceding weeks and acute onset of confusion, nausea"
		and vomiting. Clinical examination revealed intermittent disorientation without
		focal neurological symptoms. A lumbar puncture showed an opening pressure of >
		50cmH(2)O. Diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis was made after culture of
		Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii of cerebrospinal fluid. CONCLUSION: This case
		emphasizes clinicians should bear in mind the possibility of cryptococcal
		meningitis in patients treated with dimethyl fumarate.

PG	-	187-189
AB	-	Cryptococcosis is a systemic mycosis with a chronic or subacute progression
		caused by the inhalation of dehydrated yeasts or basidiospores. The causative
		agents are C. gattii and C. neoformans. The latter is more commonly associated
		with cellular immunodeficiency and is not rare in patients with Acquired
		Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). Cryptococcosis is common in pregnant women with
		"AIDS; however, it is uncommon for the placenta to be affected, with few reported"
		cases in the literature. We present the case of a pregnant woman with AIDS who
		"had placental and pulmonary cryptococcosis associated with fungemia, with a"
		satisfactory clinical outcome obtained after therapy.

TI	-	Cryptococcal peritonitis: report of a case and review of the literature.
PG	-	1618-22
AB	-	We describe a patient diagnosed with AIDS and cirrhosis who had recently suffered
		"a self-limited and non-specific esophageal ulceration. After this, he was"
		"hospitalized because of an oral bleeding with fatal evolution, and Cryptococcus"
		neoformans was isolated from ascitic fluid during a routine paracenteses. We have
		"reviewed the literature and, since 1963, only another 10 cases of cryptococcal"
		"peritonitis have been reported. A liver disease and not the AIDS (surprisingly,"
		our case is the only report of cryptococcal peritonitis in a subject having both
		diseases) was the most common underlying disease (72.7%) and was associated with
		the worst prognosis (only one patient survived). An oral or upper
		gastrointestinal bleeding was the most common associated circumstance although
		"recent steroid or antibiotic therapy has been also reported. Finally, diagnosis"
		was delayed in many patients. The reasons for these delays are discussed.

PG	-	846

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcal meningitis is most commonly found in HIV-infected
		"patients. In HIV-negative patients, its low incidence can lead to prolonged time"
		to diagnosis. Detailed case reports of chronic cryptococcal meningitis are
		"scarce, but could provide clues for earlier diagnosis in this patient category."
		CASE PRESENTATION: A 60-year old man presented June 2015 with intermittent
		headaches for several months without any fever. Initial work-up showed a
		"leukocytosis, raised CSF opening pressure and raised leukocytes and protein in"
		the CSF. An MRI revealed leptomeningeal contrast enhancement and cerebellar
		"oedema. While malignancy and various infectious causes were excluded, the patient"
		"had a spontaneous clinical and radiological recovery. One year later, the patient"
		"returned with complaints of headaches. Also, cerebellar oedema and leptomeningeal"
		"contrast enhancement had recurred. Eventually in March 2017, the novel"
		"cryptococcal antigen lateral flow assay (CrAg LFA) was positive on CSF, and one"
		colony of Cryptococcus neoformans was cultured from CSF. The patient was treated
		with the standard antifungal regimen which resulted in resolution of his
		"headaches. In retrospect, the cryptococcal antigen test was already positive on a"
		"serum sample from June 2015. Interestingly, post-treatment immunological analysis"
		revealed both a low mannose-binding lectin (MBL) concentration and low naïve CD4
		counts. CONCLUSIONS: We present a patient with cryptococcal meningitis in an
		HIV-negative patient with low MBL and low naïve CD4 count suffering a chronic
		relapsing meningo-encephalitis with relatively mild symptoms for around 2 years.
		"In patients with an unexplained meningo-encephalitis such as this case, early"
		performance of CrAg LFA on serum and/or CSF is an inexpensive and rapid method to
		reduce time-to diagnosis.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Clinicians may be less inclined to consider a diagnosis of
		cryptococcal meningitis in people without HIV infection or transplant-related
		immunosuppression. This may lead to a delay in diagnosis particularly if
		disseminated cryptococcal disease mimics cerebral septic emboli in injection drug
		use (IDU) leading to a search for endocarditis or other infectious sources.
		"Though, IDU has been described as a potential risk for disseminated cryptococcal"
		disease. CASE PRESENTATIONS: We present two cases of cryptococcal meningitis in
		IDU without HIV or other obvious immune deficits. Both patients presented with at
		least 2 weeks of headache and blurred vision. They developed central nervous
		"system (CNS) vasculitis, one of which mimicked septic cerebral emboli, but both"
		resulted with poor neurologic outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: IDU likely induces an
		underappreciated immune deficit and is a risk factor for developing cryptococcal
		"meningitis. This diagnosis, which can mimic cerebral septic emboli through"
		"involvement of a CNS vasculitis, should be considered in the setting of IDU."

AB	-	"INTRODUCTION: Zanubrutinib is a second generation, irreversible small-molecule"
		Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTK) approved for the treatment of
		"Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, mantle cell lymphoma, and marginal zone"
		"lymphoma. As a class, BTKs have been linked with an increased risk of respiratory"
		infections in clinical trials. CASE REPORT: We describe a 75-year-old patient who
		"presented with generalized weakness, fevers, dyspnea, and dry cough four months"
		after starting zanubrutinib therapy for Waldenström's macroglobulinemia. He was
		subsequently diagnosed with pneumonia. Septic work-up led to diagnosis of
		"disseminated cryptococcal infection, complicated by fungal pneumonia and"
		"meningitis. MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOME: Zanubrutinib was held on admission, and the"
		patient was started on combination oral and intravenous antifungal therapy.
		"Despite clearance of fungemia, aggressive resuscitation, and appropriate"
		"antimicrobial therapy, respiratory status deteriorated requiring intubation. His"
		"condition progressed to septic shock, multiorgan failure, and demise."
		DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: We report herein a case of fatal disseminated
		cryptococcosis in the setting of zanubrutinib use for Waldenström's
		"macroglobulinemia. At the time of diagnosis, his Waldenström's macroglobulinemia"
		was in a partial response. The mechanism by which Bruton tyrosine kinase
		inhibitors (BTKs) lead to invasive fungal infections in these patients remains to
		be explored. T- and B-cell immune defects accompanying low-grade B-cell lymphomas
		may contribute to the severity of these infections.

TI	-	Cryptococcal pleuritis developing in a patient on regular hemodialysis.
PG	-	229-33
AB	-	A 64-year-old male on regular hemodialysis who was a human T lymphotrophic virus
		Type I (HTLV-I) carrier developed cryptococcal pleuritis. The initial
		manifestations of the present case were a persistent cough and the accumulation
		of unilateral pleural effusion. A culture of the pleural fluid of the patient
		grew cryptococcus neoformans and a test for antigens against cryptococcus
		"neoformans in the pleural fluid was also positive, therefore, cryptococcal"
		pleuritis was diagnosed. Pleural cryptococcosis per se is rare and it is
		extremely rare for a dialysis patient to develop pleural cryptococcosis. To our
		"knowledge, only a few cases of cryptococcal pleuritis have so far been reported"
		"in patients on dialysis. Furthermore, an isolated occurrence of cryptococcal"
		"pleuritis with no cryptococcal pulmonary parenchymal lesions, as was seen in the"
		"present case, is rare because cryptococcal pleuritis is usually associated with"
		underlying cryptococcal pulmonary parenchymal lesions. Patients on chronic
		dialysis are susceptible to developing pleural effusion from many etiologies such
		"as congestive heart failure, infection (tuberculosis, bacterial, viral,"
		"parasitic, fungal), collagen vascular disease, drug reaction, metastasis, or"
		uremia itself. Cryptococcal pleuritis developing in a dialysis patient is
		"extremely rare, but physicians should consider cryptococcal infection as a"
		possible cause when pleural effusion develops in a dialysis patient and no other
		"cause is identified, as occurred in the present case."

PG	-	33-5

AB	-	Cryptoccus neoformans meningitis (CNM) is an opportunistic infection that
		"typically occurs in immunosuppressed patients. Subjects affected by sarcoidosis,"
		"a systemic granulomatous disease of unknown cause, are predisposed to CNM because"
		of the impairment of cell-mediated immunity and because of the chronic
		corticosteroid therapy they frequently receive. Here we report the case of a
		38-year-old man who developed CNM as the first clinical manifestation of
		sarcoidosis. The patient developed CNM even though he was apparently
		immunocompetent and was not on therapy with either corticosteroid or cytotoxic
		drugs.

AB	-	Cryptococcus neoformans is the most frequent cause of fungal meningitis in
		humans. Cryptococcus affects people of all ages and has a worldwide distribution.
		It is the fourth most common infection in AIDS (CD4 counts <100/mm(3)). Cases
		also occur in patients with other forms of immunosuppression and in apparently
		immunocompetent individuals. Chronic high-dose steroid may precipitate such an
		immunocompromised state and thus create susceptibility to fungal infections. In
		"our case, we describe a 14-year-old boy who was on steroids for tubercular"
		meningitis for a period of 8 weeks after which he developed cryptococcal
		meningitis. Attention is drawn to the increasing number of reported cases of this
		disease which have been associated with steroid therapy and this possibility
		should be remembered when investigating patients with tubercular meningitis
		especially if they are being treated with steroids.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Knowing the epidemiology of acute meningitis may guide physicians
		"to promptly administer appropriate empirical therapy, thereby minimizing"
		"morbidity and mortality. We aimed to determine the etiology, clinical"
		"manifestations, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings, and outcomes of patients with"
		acute meningitis. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study among a
		total 89 adult (age ≥15 years) patients with acute meningitis. RESULTS: Among
		"them, 48 (53.9%) patients were men; the median age (interquartile range; IQR) was"
		49 (32.1-63.8) years. The most common coexisting conditions were HIV infection
		"(30%), prednisolone therapy (16.9%), and diabetes mellitus (15.7%). Common"
		"clinical presentations were fever (74%), headache (70.8%), and confusion (31.5%)."
		"Causes of acute meningitis were Cryptococcus neoformans (37%), bacteria (31.5%),"
		"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (27%), and viruses (4.5%). In multivariate logistic"
		"regression, predicting factors of acute bacterial meningitis were higher white"
		blood cells (WBCs) in a complete blood count [odds ratio (OR) 1.01 per increase
		"of 100 cells/mm(3); 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-1.02, p = 0.031], no HIV"
		"infection (OR 0.08; 95% CI 0.01-0.72, p = 0.023), and higher serum sodium (OR"
		"1.13; 95% CI 1.01-0.23, p = 0.029). Overall, the median (IQR) duration of"
		"hospitalization was 23 (11-29) days. A total 26 (29%) patients had complications,"
		"such as septic shock, hydrocephalus, seizure, and brain edema. The in-hospital"
		"mortality rate was 7.9%. CONCLUSIONS: In this setting, the most common cause of"
		acute meningitis in adults was cryptococcosis followed by tuberculosis. Awareness
		of local epidemiology and patients' risk factors are important to initiate
		appropriate antimicrobial therapy.

OAB	-	2 AIDS patients are described who had cryptococcal meningitis accompanied by
		"increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and visual complications, a finding thought"
		to be relatively rare in AIDS. Of the 2-6% of AIDS patients who develop
		"cryptococcal meningitis, many have disseminated and recurrent infections. The 1st"
		"case was a 45-year old Ugandan woman who presented with stiff neck, and right"
		VIth cranial nerve palsy. She was treated with amphotericin B and flucytosine
		"with some improvement, but on the 9th day she awoke with headache, drowsiness,"
		"and total blindness, although no papilledema. Her CSF pressure was 40 cm H20. She"
		"recovered after a month of intravenous chemotherapy and acetazolamide, but"
		remained blind. Her sudden blindness was thought to be due to bilateral optic
		"nerve infarction. The 2nd case was a 32-year old male homosexual, admitted with"
		"headache, vomiting, confusion, and drowsiness. He had stiff neck, and a CSF of 40"
		"cm containing Cryptococcus neoformans. He was given amphotericin B, flucytosine,"
		and has CSF drained every other day. On day 21 papilledema was seen in the right
		"eye, and acetazolamide was started to lower CSF pressure. This patient recovered"
		without loss of vision. 3 published series of cryptococcus meningitis in AIDS
		"patients remarked about the low incidence of raised ICP, while 1 reported 9 of 27"
		with neurological and ophthalmic complications. The visual complications and
		increased ICP in these patients was thought to be due to inflammatory
		arachnoiditis or direct cryptococcal infiltration.

LID	-	10.1111/neup.12046 [doi]
AB	-	Cryptococcal meningitis is rarely complicated by immune-mediated
		"leukoencephalopathy, but the precise pathomechanism is uncertain. A 72-year-old"
		Japanese man treated with prednisolone for Sweet disease developed a subacute
		"progression of meningitis, which was considered as neuro-Sweet disease. A"
		treatment by methylprednisolone rapidly improved CSF findings with a remarkable
		"decrease in lymphocyte numbers in the blood, but the patient's consciousness"
		still worsened after the cessation of the treatment. The patient developed
		cryptococcal meningitis and MRI showed abnormal intensities predominantly in the
		cerebral deep white matter along with the recovery of lymphocyte numbers in the
		"blood, which resulted in death. A postmortem examination of the brain revealed"
		"degenerative lesions, especially at the cerebral white matter and cortex adjacent"
		to the leptomeninges abundantly infiltrated by Cryptococcus neoformans. In the
		"affected cerebral deep white matter, perivascular infiltration of lymphocytes was"
		"prominent in coexistence with reactive astrocytes and vascular proliferation, but"
		these findings were not observed in the subcortical and cortical lesions.
		Cryptococcus neoformans was not present within the brain parenchyma. This is the
		first report of a case suggesting that cryptococcal meningitis can accompany
		lymphocytic inflammation predominantly in cerebral deep white matter as a
		possible manifestation of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Correlates of immune protection in patients with human
		immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated cryptococcal meningitis are poorly
		defined. A clearer understanding of these immune responses is essential to inform
		rational development of immunotherapies. METHODS: Cryptococcal-specific
		peripheral CD4(+) T-cell responses were measured in 44 patients with
		HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis at baseline and during follow-up.
		"Responses were assessed following ex vivo cryptococcal mannoprotein stimulation,"
		using 13-color flow-cytometry. The relationships between cryptococcal-specific
		"CD4(+) T-cell responses, clinical parameters at presentation, and outcome were"
		investigated. RESULTS: Cryptococcal-specific CD4(+) T-cell responses were
		"characterized by the production of macrophage inflammatory protein 1α, interferon"
		"γ (IFN-γ), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). Conversely, minimal interleukin 4"
		and interleukin 17 production was detected. Patients surviving to 2 weeks had
		significantly different functional CD4(+) T-cell responses as compared to those
		who died. Patients with a response predominantly consisting of IFN-γ or TNF-α
		"production had a 2-week mortality of 0% (0/20), compared with 25% (6/24) in those"
		without this response (P = .025). Such patients also had lower fungal burdens (10
		"400 vs 390 000 colony-forming units/mL; P < .001), higher cerebrospinal fluid"
		"lymphocyte counts (122 vs 8 cells/μL; P < .001), and a trend toward faster rates"
		of clearance of infection. CONCLUSIONS: The phenotype of the peripheral CD4(+)
		T-cell response to Cryptococcus was associated with disease severity and outcome
		in HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis. IFN-γ/TNF-α-predominant responses were
		associated with survival.

		Indian blood donors.
PG	-	360-74
AB	-	"Cryptococcosis, particularly cryptococcal meningitis (CM), has become an"
		increasing problem globally in the AIDS era. In the present investigation we have
		made an effort for the first time to study Indian cases (100) both HIV-positive
		"(23 cases, male, mostly Indian professional blood donors, PBDs') confirmed by an"
		ELISA test and Western Blot but asymptomatic for CM and HIV-negative (77:49 male
		and 28 female) asymptomatic or symptomatic. These subjects were patients from the
		"Lucknow hospitals admitted during the period between February, 1991 to February,"
		"1994, for suspected cryptococcosis or CM. Of those cases, 10% were positive for"
		cryptococcosis or CM. Meningoencephalitis was the dominant clinical manifestation
		in four (HIV-negative) cases of CM. CT scanning of the head of those cases
		revealed a noncommunicating hydrocephalus due to aqueductal stenosis (in 2 cases)
		and a communicating hydrocephalus with granuloma (by MRI) in another case. The
		latex agglutination test (LAT) of the sera was positive for Cryptococcus antigen
		"in 6 (26%) of the (HIV-positive) patients and 4 (5%), of the HIV-negative cases."
		"In the cases of CM, there was a lower antigen titre in CSF than in the"
		pronase-treated sera. The LAT was found to be useful in diagnosis of
		"cryptococcosis, especially in asymptomatic cases. The CSF of CM-positive cases"
		"revealed low levels of glucose, reduced cell count and high proteins. Among the"
		"HIV-negative cases, the onset of meningitis in 4 cases was preceded by the"
		"presence of encapsulated budding yeast cells in CSF India ink smear, or"
		cryptococci in a direct urine smear in one case. The CSF culture of 3 cases was
		"positive for mucoid Cryptococcus neoformans, showing brown colour effect (BCE) on"
		"Staib agar (syn. Guizotia abyssinica creatinine agar, bird seed agar). The"
		isolated yeast strains were identified as C. neoformans var. neoformans by
		physiological tests. The pathogenicity test of strains revealed virulence to
		BALB/c mice evidenced by a high mortality of mice and significantly (p < 0.05)
		"high CN burden (> 4-5 mean log(10) cfu), in the brain followed by other visceral"
		"organs (lung, liver, spleen, kidney and heart). The in-vitro susceptibility (MIC"
		mu gmL(-1)) of strains.

AB	-	Cryptococcosis is a major opportunistic mycosis which has meningitis as its most
		frequent clinical presentation and can be fatal in the absence of antifungal
		"therapy. The aetiological agents are Cryptococcus neoformans, which affects"
		"mainly immunocompromised subjects, and C. gattii, the aetiologic agent for"
		cryptococcosis in healthy individuals. A recent outbreak of cryptococcosis on
		"Vancouver Island, Canada, raised the level of concern about the epidemiology of"
		"this disease. In Brazil, between 1980 and 2002, six per cent of AIDS patients had"
		cryptococcosis in course at the time of diagnosis. To identify the profile of
		"cryptococcal meningitis patients in Rio Grande do Sul (RS), Brazil, a retroactive"
		study was realized using data from patients registered at Laboratório Central de
		Saúde Pública IPB-LACEN/RS from 2000 to 2005. Most of the patients were men
		"(77.12%), Caucasian (83.5%), median age between thirty and thirty-nine years old"
		(46.24%) and HIV positive (95%).

TI	-	Evaluation of Serum Cryptococcal Antigen Testing Using Two Novel Semiquantitative
		Lateral Flow Assays in Persons with Cryptococcal Antigenemia.
LID	-	10.1128/JCM.02046-19 [doi]
LID	-	e02046-19
AB	-	Early cryptococcal disease can be detected via circulating antigen in blood
		"before fulminant meningitis develops, when early antifungal therapy improves"
		survival. Two semiquantitative cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) lateral flow assays
		"(LFAs) have been developed, but their diagnostic performance has not been"
		defined. Cryopreserved serum samples from HIV-infected Ugandans obtained as part
		of a prospective CrAg-screening cohort were tested in duplicate for CrAg by the
		CrAgSQ (IMMY) and CryptoPS (Biosynex) lateral flow assays. Case-controlled
		diagnostic performance was measured using the FDA-approved CrAg LFA (IMMY) as a
		"reference standard via McNemar's test. Of 99 serum samples tested, 57 were CrAg"
		"positive (CrAg(+)) by the CrAg LFA reference standard. By CrAgSQ, 57 were read as"
		"positive, with 98% sensitivity (56/57; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.91 to"
		"0.99) and 98% specificity (41/42; 95% CI, 0.88 to 0.99) (McNemar's, P = 0.99)."
		"The sample with a false-negative result by CrAgSQ (n = 1) had a titer of <1:5,"
		while the sample with a false-positive result (n = 1) yielded a 1+ result. By
		"CryptoPS, 52 samples were read as positive, with 88% sensitivity (50/57; 95% CI,"
		"0.76 to 0.95) and 95% specificity (40/42; 95% CI, 0.84 to 0.99) (McNemar's,"
		P = 0.18). The CryptoPS false-negative results included samples with titers of
		"<1:5 (n = 1), 1:5 (n = 5), and 1:20 (n = 1), while samples with false-positive"
		results by CryptoPS (n = 2) yielded Positive results. The CryptoPS assay missed
		35% (7/20) of samples with CrAg LFA titers of ≤1:20. The new semiquantitative
		CrAg LFAs allow rapid estimation of titer levels in easy-to-perform platforms.
		The CrAgSQ demonstrated better qualitative sensitivity and specificity than the
		CryptoPS compared to the reference standard. The exact grading of the CrAgSQ
		"results has some subjectivity, with interreader variability; however, qualitative"
		reads were generally concordant for both assays.

AB	-	Cryptococcus gattii is a species that has received more recognition in the recent
		past as distinct from Cryptococcus neoformans. C gattii is known to cause
		meningeal disease in both immunocompetent and immunosuppressed hosts. Patients
		may be clinically asymptomatic until immunosuppressive conditions occur such as
		corticosteroid treatment or an HIV infection. HIV-associated cryptococcal
		infections are most often due to C neoformans. C gattii is found in a minority.
		Speciation and subtyping of Cryptococcus are not always accomplished. In many
		"parts of the world, there is no availability for speciation of Cryptococcus."
		Travel history may provide a clue to the most probable species. This case
		demonstrates a case of C gattii meningitis with a multiplicity of complications.
		"These include advanced HIV disease secondary to nonadherence, immune"
		"reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, and superior sagittal sinus thrombosis. The"
		patient represented diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas over time. Headache was
		"the primary symptom in cryptococcal meningitis, immune reconstitution"
		"inflammatory syndrome, and superior sagittal sinus thrombosis. All are discussed"
		in detail as potential etiologies for the primary disease. Isavuconazonium is a
		relatively new broad-spectrum antifungal azole that was used as salvage therapy.

TI	-	"Immune dysfunction in HIV-seronegative, Cryptococcus gattii meningitis."
PG	-	e165-8
AB	-	The pathophysiology of meningitis caused by Cryptococcus gattii in apparently
		immunocompetent individuals remains unclear. We measured multiple cytokines in
		"CSF from a HIV-seronegative, apparently immunocompetent, Thai patient with C."
		"gattii meningitis, over the first 2 weeks of antifungal therapy. Levels of"
		"proinflammatory IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 were very low compared to patients"
		with HIV-related Cryptococcus neoformans meningitis and of IL-10 very high. While
		"patients with C. gattii meningitis may be a heterogeneous group, these data"
		suggest in this case a maladapted immune response to cryptococcal exposure had
		allowed progression to clinical cryptococcal disease.

PG	-	260-3
AB	-	Cryptococcus neoformans is the most common cryptococci causing infection in
		humans. Non-neoformans cryptococci have generally been regarded as saprophytes
		and rarely reported as human pathogens. We report a probable case of Cryptococcus
		laurentii meningitis in a HIV-infected patient and reviewed the literature on
		risk factors and treatment of this infection in humans. This patient was
		successfully treated with amphotericin B followed by fluconazole. Awareness of
		"the emerging antifungal-resistant C. laurentii strains, as reported in the"
		"literature, should be emphasized, especially in immunocompromised patients."

AB	-	Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungal infection affects
		predominately the central nervous system in HIV patients and patients with other
		immunocompromised states. It has rarely been described in immunocompetent
		patients. It is a serious infection with a high of mortality rate. We describe a
		case of a 48-year-old patient diagnosed with lupus nephritis treated with
		corticosteroids and mycophenolate mofetil who developed central nervous
		cryptococcosis complicated by septicemia. She died despite the use of
		"antifungals. Cryptococcal infection is an uncommon, but often a fatal"
		complication of systemic lupus erythematosus. Timely diagnosis and effective
		antifungal therapy could improve its prognosis.

AB	-	We report the case of a 72-year-old man with a history of Parkinson's Disease who
		"presented with a history of falls, cognitive impairment and depressed mood."
		Neurological examination revealed moderate rigidity and bradykinesia. Alterations
		to his anti-Parkinsonian medication resulted in improvements in his mobility but

TI	-	Pulmonary cryptococcosis coexisting with central type lung cancer in an
		immuocompetent patient: a case report and literature review.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Pulmonary Cryptococcosis is a common fungal infection mainly caused
		by Cryptococcus neoformans/C.gattii species in immunocompromised patients. Cases
		of pulmonary cryptococcosis in patients with normal immune function are
		increasingly common in China. Clinical and radiographic features of pulmonary
		"cryptococcosis are various and without obvious characteristics, so it is often"
		misdiagnosed as pulmonary metastatic tumor or tuberculosis. When coexisting with
		"malignant lung tumors, it was more difficult to differentiate from metastatic"
		"lung cancer, although the coexistence of pulmonary cryptococcosis and central"
		type lung cancer is rare. Reviewing the imaging manifestations and diagnosis of
		the case and the relevant literature will contribute to recognition of the
		disease and a decrease in misdiagnoses. CASE PRESENTATION: A 72-year-old
		immunocompetent Han Chinese man had repeated dry cough for more than half a year.
		"CT examination of chest showed an irregular mass at the left hilum of the lung,"
		"and two small nodules in the right lung, which were considered as the left"
		"central lung cancer with right lung metastasis. However, the patient was"
		diagnosed with pulmonary cryptococcosis coexisting with central type lung cancer
		"based on the results of laboratory examination, percutaneous lung biopsy,"
		"fiberoptic bronchoscopy, and surgical pathology. The patient underwent surgical"
		resection of the left central type lung cancer and was placed on fluconazole
		treatment after a positive diagnosis was made. Five years after the lung cancer
		"surgery, the patient had a recurrence, but the pulmonary cryptococcus nodule"
		disappeared. CONCLUSION: Our case shows that CT findings of central type lung
		"cancer with multiple pulmonary nodules are not necessarily metastases, but may be"
		coexisting pulmonary cryptococcosis. CT images of cryptococcosis of the lung were
		"diverse and have no obvious characteristics, so it was very difficult to"
		distinguish from metastatic tumors. CT-guided percutaneous lung biopsy was a
		simple and efficient method for identification.

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: Acute meningitis and encephalitis (AME) are common diseases with the
		"main pathogens being viruses and bacteria. As specific treatments are different,"
		it is important to develop clinical prediction rules to distinguish aseptic from
		"bacterial or fungal infection. In this study we evaluated the incidence rates,"
		"seasonal variety and the main etiologic agents of AME, and identified factors"
		that could be used to predict the etiologic agents. METHODS: A population-based
		"AME syndrome surveillance system was set up in Guigang City, Guangxi, involving"
		12 hospitals serving the study communities. All patients meeting the case
		definition were investigated. Blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid were tested for
		bacterial pathogens using culture or RT-PCR and serological tests for viruses
		using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Laboratory testing variables were
		grouped using factor analysis. Multinomial logistic regression was used to
		"predict the etiology of AME. RESULTS: From May 2007 to June 2012, the annual"
		"incidence rate of AME syndrome, and disease specifically caused by Japanese"
		"encephalitis (JE), other viruses, bacteria and fungi were 12.55, 0.58, 4.57, 0.45"
		"and 0.14 per 100,000 population, respectively. The top three identified viral"
		"etiologic agents were enterovirus, mumps virus, and JE virus, and for"
		"bacteria/fungi were Streptococcus sp., Cryptococcus neoformans and Staphylococcus"
		sp. The incidence of JE and other viruses affected younger populations and peaked
		from April to August. Alteration of consciousness and leukocytosis were more
		"likely to be caused by JE, bacteria and fungi whereas CSF inflammation was"
		associated with bacterial/fungal infection. CONCLUSIONS: With limited predictive
		"validity of symptoms and signs and routine laboratory tests, specific tests for"
		"JE virus, mumps virus and enteroviruses are required to evaluate the immunization"
		impact and plan for further intervention. CSF bacterial culture cannot be omitted
		in guiding clinical decisions regarding patient treatment.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: The elderly, and especially those with an immuno-compromised status,"
		are vulnerable to infectious diseases. The purpose of this study was to examine
		the clinical characteristics and therapeutic outcomes of cryptococcal meningitis
		(CM) in elderly patients in Taiwan. METHODS: Ninety-nine adult patients with CM
		"were identified during a 15-year study period (2002-2016), of whom 38 elderly (≥"
		"65 years) patients (16 men and 22 women, median age 72.9 years; range"
		65-86 years) were included for analysis. The clinical characteristics and
		therapeutic outcomes of these patients were analyzed and compared to non-elderly
		"adult patients (< 65 years) with CM. RESULTS: Among the 38 patients, diabetes"
		"mellitus was the most common underlying condition (15), followed by adrenal"
		"insufficiency (7), malignancy (6), hematologic disorders (5), chronic obstructive"
		"pulmonary disease (5), autoimmune diseases (3), liver cirrhosis (3) and acquired"
		"immunodeficiency syndrome (1). Altered consciousness (29), fever (21) and"
		headache (17) were the leading clinical manifestations. Positive cerebrospinal
		fluid and blood cultures for Cryptococcus (C.) neoformans were found in 26 and 9
		"patients, respectively. There were significant differences in gender, altered"
		consciousness and recent cerebral infarction between the elderly and non-elderly
		"groups. The elderly group had a high mortality rate (36.8%, 14/38), and the"
		presence of cryptococcemia was the most significant prognostic factor.
		CONCLUSIONS: This study offers a preliminary view of the clinical characteristics
		of CM in the elderly. The results suggest that elderly patients (≥ 65 years) are
		more vulnerable to CM than adults aged < 65 years. Compared to the non-elderly
		"group, the elderly group had female predominance, higher rates of altered"
		consciousness and recent cerebral infarction as the clinical presentation. The
		presence of cryptococcemia was a significant prognostic factor in the elderly
		"group. This study is limited by the small number of patients, and further"
		large-scale studies are needed to better delineate this specific infectious
		syndrome.

AB	-	Cryptococcal meningitis is an uncommon but often fatal complication of systemic
		lupus erythematosus (SLE). We report on a 13-year-old girl with SLE using
		"high-dose prednisolone for several months, presented to us with low grade fever,"
		"intermittent vomiting and headache. Physical examination, including papilloedema"
		"and meningeal irritation, was unremarkable. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)"
		cryptococcal antigen titer was 1: 128 by latex agglutination method. CSF culture
		yielded Cryptococcus neoformans. We used amphotericin B deoxycholate (a
		cumulative dose of 1.95 gm) and fluconazole (200 mg day-1) for 6 weeks. Clinical
		"response was good. Then, we continued fluconazole 200 mg per qd as suppressive"
		therapy for thirty-four months. There were no neurological sequelae or relapse
		after 20-month follow-up. Timely diagnosis and effective antifungal therapy could
		improve the prognosis of cryptococcal meningitis in SLE patients.

PG	-	30-3
AB	-	A 28-year-old patient with AIDS was found at autopsy to have disseminated
		"cryptococcal infection involving the lungs, spleen, lymph nodes, kidneys,"
		"gastrointestinal tract, thyroid, bone marrow, and liver. Despite widespread organ"
		dissemination the patient did not have clinical or pathological evidence of
		meningitis. Microscopic examination of the brain showed cryptococci limited to
		the brainstem and basal ganglia; microglial nodules with multinucleate giant
		"cells, a histological hallmark of HIV-1 encephalitis, were shown to contain"
		Cryptococcus neoformans. This feature may suggest a form of synergism between
		HIV-1 and Cryptococcus neoformans. This case demonstrates an unusual form of
		cryptococcal neurotropism with limited CNS involvement.

AB	-	Cryptococcosis is a life-threatening fungal infection caused by the Cryptococcus
		neoformans/Cryptococcus gattii species complex. Most cases are recorded in
		patients suffering from HIV/AIDS (human immunodeficiency virus/acquired
		"immunodeficiency syndrome). However, this infection also occurs in non-HIV"
		patients with a proportion of 10-30% of all cases. The study aimed at the
		clinical and molecular characterization of non-HIV patients diagnosed with
		cryptococcosis at the Tropical Medicine Foundation (FMT-HVD) from July 2016 to
		June 2019. Medical records of respective patients were analyzed to describe the
		"course of cryptococcosis in non-HIV patients. In addition, multi-locus sequence"
		typing (MLST) was applied to identify the sequence types of the isolated
		"Cryptococcus strains, to perform phylogenetic analysis, and to evaluate the"
		isolates' genetic relationship to global reference strains. Antifungal
		"susceptibility profiles to amphotericin B, fluconazole, and itraconazole were"
		"assessed by broth microdilution. From a total of 7 patients, 4 were female, the"
		age range varied between 10 and 53 years (median of 36.3 years). Cryptococcal
		meningitis was the common clinical manifestation (100%). The period between onset
		of symptoms and confirmed diagnosis ranged from 15 to 730 days (mean value of
		"172.9 days), and the observed mortality was 57.1%. Of note, comorbidities of the"
		"assessed cryptococcosis patients comprised hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and"
		intestinal tuberculosis. Genotyping applying PCR-RFLP of the URA5 gene identified
		"all clinical isolates as C. gattii genotype VGII. Using MLST, it was possible to"
		"discriminate the sequence types ST20 (n = 4), ST5 (n = 3), and the newly"
		"identified sequence type ST560 (n = 1). The antifungals amphotericin B,"
		"fluconazole, and itraconazole showed satisfactory inhibitory activity"
		(microdilution test) against all C. gattii VGII strains.

LID	-	e0119090
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcus neoformans is a ubiquitous environmental fungus that can
		"cause life-threatening meningitis and fungemia, often in the presence of acquired"
		"immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), liver cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, or other"
		"medical conditions. To distinguish risk factors from comorbidities, we performed"
		"a hospital-based, density-sampled, matched case-control study. METHODS: All"
		new-onset cryptococcal meningitis cases and cryptococcemia cases at a university
		hospital in Taiwan from 2002-2010 were retrospectively identified from the
		computerized inpatient registry and were included in this study. Controls were
		selected from those hospitalized patients not experiencing cryptococcal
		"meningitis or cryptococcemia. Controls and cases were matched by admission date,"
		"age, and gender. Conditional logistic regression was used to analyze the risk"
		factors. RESULTS: A total of 101 patients with cryptococcal meningitis (266
		"controls) and 47 patients with cryptococcemia (188 controls), of whom 32 patients"
		"had both cryptococcal meningitis and cryptococcemia, were included in this study."
		Multivariate regression analysis showed that AIDS (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] =
		"181.4; p < 0.001), decompensated liver cirrhosis (aOR = 8.5; p = 0.008), and"
		cell-mediated immunity (CMI)-suppressive regimens without calcineurin inhibitors
		(CAs) (aOR = 15.9; p < 0.001) were independent risk factors for cryptococcal
		"meningitis. Moreover, AIDS (aOR = 216.3, p < 0.001), decompensated liver"
		"cirrhosis (aOR = 23.8; p < 0.001), CMI-suppressive regimens without CAs (aOR ="
		"7.3; p = 0.034), and autoimmune diseases (aOR = 9.3; p = 0.038) were independent"
		"risk factors for developing cryptococcemia. On the other hand, diabetes mellitus"
		and other medical conditions were not found to be risk factors for cryptococcal
		"meningitis or cryptococcemia. CONCLUSIONS: The findings confirm AIDS,"
		"decompensated liver cirrhosis, CMI-suppressive regimens without CAs, and"
		autoimmune diseases are risk factors for invasive C. neoformans diseases.

		"infection, with a variable clinical presentation. Diagnosis and treatment of this"
		entity are challenging. CASE DESCRIPTION: A cryptococcal VPS infection occurred
		in a human immunodeficiency virus-infected patient with an excellent
		"immunovirologic status, with an abdominal mass as the only clinical sign at"
		presentation. Microbiologic diagnosis was confirmed when Cryptococcus neoformans
		was isolated in 4 cerebrospinal fluid samples on different days. The patient was
		treated with dual antifungal therapy (liposomal amphotericin B plus flucytosine).
		"The VPS was initially externalized and then removed. At 12-month follow-up, the"
		"patient remained asymptomatic, and no replacement VPS was required. CONCLUSIONS:"
		This is the first reported case of cryptococcal VPS infection in a patient with
		human immunodeficiency virus infection. Clinical outcome was excellent after dual
		antifungal therapy plus device withdrawal. Diagnosis and treatment of this entity
		remain a challenge for clinicians.

AB	-	We present a case of a 59-year-old woman with Chagas disease who received a
		"kidney transplant. At month 44 post-transplantation, the patient presented with"
		diarrhea that had persisted for 2 months. Colonoscopy showed a colon ulcer and
		"differential diagnoses included cytomegalovirus, bacteria, or parasite infection;"
		drug-related diarrhea; Crohn's disease; celiac disease; and malignancy. The ulcer
		tissue was positive for Cryptococcus neoformans. Successful treatment consisted
		of amphotericin B for 8 days and oral fluconazole (800 mg daily) for 3 months.
		"This case illustrates that a colonic ulcer, although rare, could be"
		cryptococcosis.

		setting: analysis of diagnostic delays.
PG	-	799-803
LID	-	10.1093/qjmed/hcu077 [doi]
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Cryptococcal meningitis is a rare disease in Europe, resulting in"
		delayed recognition and slower initiation of specific treatment. AIM: To analyse
		the time-to-treatment and the factors that delay the diagnosis and treatment in
		the low-prevalence setting of a European centre. DESIGN: Retrospective review
		METHODS: We reviewed full medical records of all adult patients with cryptococcal
		"meningitis referred to an HIV centre in Berlin, Germany in 10-year period between"
		1st of October 2003 and 31st of September 2013. Multivariant statistics with
		bootstrap-resampling were performed. RESULTS: We identified 19 patients with a
		diagnosis of HIV-related cryptococcal meningitis (0.55% of all consecutive
		HIV-infected patients). In almost half of our patients the diagnosis was not
		considered initially on admission to the secondary care centre and the first
		"diagnostic clue being an accidental positive blood, cerebrospinal fluid or"
		bronchoalveolar lavage culture growing Cryptococcus neoformans. The median
		time-to-treatment was 5 days (range: 1-16). Known positive HIV status accelerated
		"the time-to-diagnosis (p < 0.05) by a median of 1.89 days, whereas the CSF cell"
		count ≤ 10/µl delayed diagnosis by a median time of 1.93 days (p < 0.1).
		CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic delays could be avoided by encouraging practising
		physicians (i) to consider cryptococcal meningitis in immunosuppressed
		HIV-infected patients irrespective of neurological symptoms; (ii) to test for
		"India ink, cryptococcal antigen and fungal cultures in immunosuppressed"
		HIV-infected patients with normal CSF; (iii) to consider a possibility of
		underlying HIV infection in patients with unknown HIV status presenting with
		meningitis; and (iv) to consider early targeted HIV testing in persons at risk
		according to locally validated criteria.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Cryptococcal meningitis is a severe infection among
		"immunosuppressed individuals, with a high mortality rate. Although amphotericin B"
		"is the first-choice drug for treatment, its use is restricted when adverse"
		effects are clinically problematic. The usefulness of intraventricular infusion
		of antifungal drugs through Ommaya reservoirs for cryptococcal meningitis
		treatment has been unconfirmed. We evaluated the efficacy of intraventricular
		infusion of amphotericin B through Ommaya reservoirs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We
		retrospectively analyzed 10 consecutive patients with cryptococcal meningitis who
		were refractory to systemic administration of antifungal drugs. RESULTS: Fever or
		"nausea occurred in most patients. However, no patient complained of serious"
		complications such as renal toxicity. Seven patients recovered completely or
		"partially, whereas three patients died. CONCLUSIONS: To establish the efficacy of"
		the intraventricular infusion of antifungal drugs through Ommaya reservoirs for
		"cryptococcal meningitis, a prospective investigation should be designed to"
		compare those treated according to the updated guidelines and those treated with
		antifungal drugs through the Ommaya reservoirs.

PG	-	e133-6
AB	-	The diagnosis of brain death requires the presence of unresponsiveness and a lack
		"of receptivity, the absence of movement, breathing and brain stem reflexes, as"
		well as a state of coma in which the cause has been identified. We report a case
		"of brain death that was diagnosed based on clinical neurological examinations,"
		and supported by the absence of cerebral blood flow on magnetic resonance
		angiography and electroencephalography demonstrating the characteristic absence
		of electrical activity. Thorough clinical examination and repeated imaging of the
		brain revealed no apparent clinical cause or mechanism of brain death. We
		"proceeded with organ donation of the deceased's liver and corneas. However,"
		postmortem revealed Cryptococcus neoformans meningoencephalitis as the cause of
		irreversible coma.

PG	-	328

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcus neoformans is saprophytic encapsulated yeast. Infection
		is acquired by inhalation of the organism and could be asymptomatic or limited to
		"the lungs, specially in the immunocompetent host. Cryptococcal meningitis is a"
		serious opportunistic infection among post transplant recipients. Cranial nerve
		"palsies and ophthalmoplegia are well known complications of this disease, but"
		bilateral complete ophthalmoplegia is a very rare presentation. CASE
		"PRESENTATION: A Sri Lankan young male, who is a post kidney transplant recipient,"
		presented with bilateral complete ophthalmoplegia and subsequently was diagnosed
		to have cryptococcal meningitis based on Indian ink stain and culture of
		cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). His magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed bilateral
		multiple nodular lesions in both basal ganglia and thalami. Brainstem imaging was
		normal. CONCLUSIONS: Cryptococcal meningitis is a serious fungal infection in
		post transplant patients. It should be suspected in any immunocompromised patient
		"with fever, headache and focal neurological signs. Bilateral thalamic lesions,"
		inflammation and invasion of the cranial nerves and raised intracranial pressure
		were thought to be possible mechanisms resulting in bilateral complete
		ophthalmoplegia in this patient.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) is one of the most common opportunistic
		infections caused by Cryptococcus neoformans in human immunodeficiency virus
		"(HIV)-infected patients, and is complicated with significant morbidity and"
		"mortality. This study retrospectively analyzed the clinical features,"
		"characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of first-diagnosed HIV-associated CM"
		after 2-years of follow-up. METHODS: Data from all patients (n = 101) of
		HIV-associated CM hospitalized in Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center from
		September 2013 to December 2016 were collected and analyzed using logistic
		regression to identify clinical and microbiological factors associated with
		"mortality. RESULTS: Of the 101 patients, 86/99 (86.9%) of patients had CD4 count"
		"<50 cells/mm, 57/101 (56.4%) were diagnosed at ≥14 days from the onset to"
		"diagnosis, 42/99 (42.4%) had normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cell counts and"
		"biochemical examination, 30/101 (29.7%) had concomitant Pneumocystis (carinii)"
		jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) on admission and 37/92 (40.2%) were complicated with
		"cryptococcal pneumonia, 50/74 (67.6%) had abnormalities shown on intracranial"
		"imaging, amongst whom 24/50 (48.0%) had more than one lesion. The median time to"
		"negative CSF Indian ink staining was 8.50 months (interquartile range, 3.25-12.00"
		months). Patients who initiated antiretroviral therapy (ART) before admission had
		a shorter time to negative CSF Indian ink compared with ART-naïve patients (7 vs.
		"12 months, χ = 15.53, P < 0.001). All-cause mortality at 2 weeks, 8 weeks, and 2"
		"years was 10.1% (10/99), 18.9% (18/95), and 20.7% (19/92), respectively."
		"Coinfection with PCP on admission (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 3.933; 95%"
		"confidence interval [CI], 1.166-13.269, P = 0.027) and altered mental status"
		"(AOR, 9.574; 95% CI, 2.548-35.974, P = 0.001) were associated with higher"
		mortality at 8 weeks. CONCLUSION: This study described the clinical features and
		outcomes of first diagnosed HIV-associated CM with 2-year follow-up data. Altered
		mental status and coinfection with PCP predicted mortality in HIV-associated CM.

TI	-	Myeloradiculitis caused by Cryptococcus neoformans infection in a patient with
		ulcerative colitis: a neuropathological study.
PG	-	236-8
AB	-	Meningitis is the most common feature of cryptococcal infection of the nervous
		system. We herein describe the case of a 48-year-old man with fulminant
		"cryptococcal myeloradiculitis, whose initial symptoms were impotence, dysuria and"
		weakness of the lower extremities. He had been administered prednisolone and
		azathioprine for 7years for ulcerative colitis before onset of myeloradiculitis.
		He finally developed meningoencephalitis and died 2 months after onset despite
		treatment with amphotericin B and flucytosine. Post-mortem examination revealed
		numerous infiltrations of cryptococci in the spinal roots as well as in the
		meninges and subarachnoid space. Inflammatory cells and cryptococci had
		"infiltrated the vessel walls in the spinal cord, and this was accompanied by"
		"necrotizing myelopathy. Myeloradiculitis is rare in cryptococcal infection, and"
		this is the first case report to demonstrate direct cryptococcal infection in the
		spinal roots. Cryptococcal infection should be considered while managing
		"myeloradiculopathy of unknown etiology, especially in immunocompromised patients."

TI	-	Clinical evaluation of the antifungal effect of sertraline in the treatment of
		cryptococcal meningitis in HIV patients: a single Mexican center experience.
PG	-	25-30
LID	-	10.1007/s15010-017-1059-3 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: Cryptococcal meningitis is a potentially fatal fungal infection
		"associated with a significant attributable morbidity and mortality, especially"
		among HIV/AIDS patients. The first-line therapy for the treatment of this
		clinical entity is the combinatory therapy of amphotericin B plus flucytosine.
		"However, the high cost, toxic effects, and limited repertoire of effective"
		antifungal drugs have led to the investigation of novel molecules. This is a
		"prospective, double-blinded, and randomized study performed in a Mexican tertiary"
		care center to evaluate the antifungal activity of sertraline in the treatment of
		"cryptococcal meningitis in HIV patients. METHODS: During June 2015-December 2016,"
		patients were recruited and included in one of two study groups: group A was
		"given standard antifungal treatment plus sertraline 200 mg/day, while group B was"
		given standard antifungal plus placebo. Lumbar punctures were performed on days
		"0, 7, and 14 of the study, and cryptococcal antigenemia and quantitative fungal"
		culture in cerebrospinal fluid at each time point were evaluated to measure the
		rate of fungal clearance. RESULTS: The fungal loads and cryptococcal antigenemia
		"titers showed a marked tendency to decrease by day 14 in both groups. Otherwise,"
		group B exhibited a slightly higher nonstatistical rate of fungal clearance
		(-0.2868 ± 0.08275 log CFU/ml/day) than group A (-0.2496 ± 0.08340 log
		CFU/ml/day). CONCLUSIONS: A statistical difference between study groups was not
		found. This is the first study in Latin America that reports the experience of
		using sertraline as an adjuvant in the antifungal management of cryptococcal
		meningitis in HIV patients.

AB	-	Cryptococcosis occurs most often in immunocompromised people. The cutaneous
		"features of cryptococcosis include papules, pustules, nodules, subcutaneous"
		"swelling, abscesses, molluscum contagiosum-like or tumour-like lesions,"
		"cellulitis, blisters, ulcers and very rarely, necrotizing fasciitis (NF). NF is a"
		destructive soft-tissue infection that is most typically caused by group A
		streptococci or by a combination of facultative and anaerobic bacteria. We
		"present the case of a 55-year-old woman with pemphigus vegetans, who developed"
		cryptococcal NF in the legs. She had been treated with immunosuppressants
		including plasmapheresis and pulse therapy with steroid and cyclophosphamide.
		Cryptococcal NF localized to the legs is very rare. Because diagnosis and
		"treatment of cryptococcal infection is often delayed, clinicians should be aware"
		of the possibility of cryptococcal infection when antibacterial therapy is not
		effective in an immunocompromised patient.

AB	-	Cryptococcal meningitis is a fungal infection that is most commonly thought of as
		"an opportunistic infection affecting immunocompromised patients, classically"
		patients with Human Immunodeficiency (HIV) infection. It is associated with a
		variety of complications including disseminated disease as well as neurologic
		"complications including intracranial hypertension, cerebral infarcts, vision loss"
		and other neurologic deficits. It is diagnosed by lumbar puncture with CSF
		"studies, including fungal culture and cryptococcal antigen testing. We present a"
		case of cryptococcal meningitis and fungemia in a previously healthy male patient
		who presented after multiple emergency department visits with persistent
		"headache. After multiple visits, he underwent a lumbar puncture consistent with"
		"cryptococcal infection, and he was admitted to the hospital for initiation of"
		antifungal therapy. His workup revealed no known underlying condition leading to
		immune compromise.

TI	-	Pneumonia and pleural effusion due to Cryptococcus laurentii in a clinically
		proven case of AIDS.
PG	-	275-8
AB	-	Non-neoformans cryptococci were previously considered to be saprophytes and
		nonpathogenic to humans. Cryptococcus laurentii is frequently used as a
		"biological means to control fruit rot. Interestingly, C laurentii has recently"
		been reported to be a rare cause of infection in humans. The authors report a
		case of pulmonary cryptococcosis caused by C laurentii in a diabetic AIDS patient
		who was on antituberculosis and antiretroviral treatments. The sputum smear
		revealed capsulated yeast cells that were identified as C laurentii. Repeated
		pleural fluid culture revealed growth of C laurentii. Both respiratory samples
		were negative for acid-fast bacilli. Moraxella catarrhalis and Klebsiella
		"pneumoniae were also found in the sputum, but not in the pleural fluid. The"
		patient had a good response to oral fluconazole therapy at 600 mg/day for five
		weeks and was then discharged. The present article is the first to report on the
		rare pulmonary involvement of C laurentii in the Indian HIV population. These
		unusual forms of cryptococci create a diagnostic predicament in the rapid
		diagnosis of pulmonary cryptococcosis. A high degree of suspicion and improvement
		of techniques for culture and identification will contribute to the early
		diagnosis and treatment of unusual fungal infections.

		disseminated nocardiosis and cryptococcal meningitis in a 67-year-old man who was
		diagnosed with ANCA-associated vasculitis and treated with corticosteroids. Upon
		"admission, the initial manifestations of the disease included subcutaneous tumors"
		and multiple lesions in the brain and lungs. Nocardia farcinica was identified in
		a culture of the aspirated pus. The patient was successfully treated for
		"disseminated nocardiosis with antibiotics. However, three months after discharge,"
		he was hospitalized with complaints of nuchal pain. Cryptococcus neoformans was
		identified on a culture of the cerebrospinal fluid. Anti-fungal treatment
		resulted in the remission of cryptococcal meningitis.

AB	-	Cryptococcal meningitis is an opportunistic infection predominantly affecting
		immunocompromised patients but rarely can affect the immunocompetent. We describe
		a 53-year-old Caucasian man who presented complaining of a 2-week history of
		severe bilateral eye pain and diplopia. His only known risk factor was that he
		lived in a horse farm and recently shot bats and pigeons in his barn. He visited
		an outside hospital during this time without a diagnosis established. After
		"further deliberation, we obtained a lumbar puncture (LP) which revealed an"
		opening pressure (OP) of 27 cm H(2)O. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and fungal
		cultures confirmed the presence of Cryptococcus neoformans The patient was
		diagnosed with C. neoformans-mediated meningoencephalitis and was initiated on
		the appropriate induction anti-fungal therapy. This case emphasises the need for
		clinicians to remain vigilant and consider cryptococcal meningitis in
		immunocompetent individuals even when classic symptoms of meningitis are absent.

AB	-	Cryptococcal meningitis has become the largest cause for the death of infectious
		diseases in the central nervous system infectious disease worldwide. Most
		"patients with cryptococcal meningitis have AIDS, autoimmune diseases, hematologic"
		"malignancies, and some other relevant diseases. It is mainly caused by infection"
		with Cryptococcus neoformans or Cryptococcus gattii. Although the relationship
		"between cryptococcal meningitis and autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus"
		"erythematosus, has been recognized, little has been studied about it."
		"Furthermore, with the use of glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants, the"
		incidence of cryptococcal meningitis is increasing year by year. Cryptococcal
		"meningitis accounts for 15% of HIV-related deaths globally, compared with little"
		research on HIV-negative cryptococcal diseases. A 54-year-old female patient with
		gingival bleeding was admitted to the Department of Neurology at the Second
		Xiangya Hospital of Central South University. The patient subsequently developed
		"a series of central nervous system symptoms such as headache, ischemic stroke,"
		"and epilepsy. The number of thrombocytes was at 4×10(9)/L, antinuclear antibody"
		"was (+), antihuman globulin was (++), globulin IgG anticardiolipin antibody IgG,"
		"IgA, and IgM was positive, lupus anticoagulant was strong positive, antibody"
		against β2 glycoprotein 1 IgM >841 AU/mL with elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
		"pressure. The CSF India ink staining was positive, CSF was cultured cryptococcus"
		neoformans. Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and cryptococcal neoformans
		"meningitis were diagnosed. After active antifungal therapy and control of APS,"
		"the patient still had a serial of complications including high CSF pressure,"
		"persistent positive India ink staining, refractory electrolyte disturbance,"
		"hemolytic anemia recurs, heart failure, and finally death. No cases of the"
		"combination of the two diseases have been reported, and this case of cryptococcal"
		meningitis with APS may provide a new direction to the diagnosis and treatment
		for this kind of disease.

AB	-	Cryptococcosis is a cosmopolitan but rare opportunistic mycosis which is usually
		caused by Cryptococcus neoformans. Although the most common and worrisome disease
		"manifestation is meningoencephalitis, pulmonary cryptococcosis has the potential"
		"to be lethal. The diagnosis of cryptococcal pneumonia is challenging, given its"
		non-specific clinical and radiographic features. Respiratory failure leading to
		acute respiratory distress syndrome as a consequence of cryptococcal disease has
		been infrequently addressed in the literature. We herein present a case of
		disseminated cryptococcal infection leading to acute respiratory distress
		"syndrome, refractory shock, and multiorgan dysfunction as the initial clinical"
		manifestation in a patient who was newly diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency
		syndrome.

AB	-	This article presents two cases of opportunistic mycoses (OMs) of the central
		"nervous system (CNS) caused by Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus nidulans,"
		respectively. The patients were hospitalised in local hospitals between 2009 and
		"2011 because of unspecific symptoms (fever, headache, and/or weight lost)."
		Duration of symptoms varied from 4 days to over 2 weeks. The patients were
		treated with antibiotics and symptomatically. OM was not suspected in any of
		them. The patients became critically ill with symptoms of CNS involvement and
		were transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the University Hospital for
		Infectious diseases (UHID) in Zagreb. None of the patients belonged to the
		"high-risk population for developing OMs. They were not HIV-infected, had no"
		"transplantation of bone marrow or solid organ, and were not on severe"
		immunosuppressive chemotherapy. Fungi were isolated from cerebrospinal fluid
		"(CSF) samples and, in one patient, from aspirate of cerebral abscess. Isolation"
		and mycological identification of all fungal isolates and in vitro antifungal
		susceptibility testing of these isolates were done at the Reference Centre for
		Mycological Diagnostics of Systemic and Disseminated Infections (RCMDSDI) in
		Zagreb. The patient with cryptococcal meningitis was treated with amphotericin B
		and fluconazole and the patient with cerebral aspergilloma with voriconazole.

PG	-	168-73
AB	-	Two cases of cryptococcal meningitis occurring in immunocompetent men are
		described. The first case involves a farmer in whom cryptococcal meningitis was
		"rapidly diagnosed using direct microscopy, latex antigen tests and culture of"
		"cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In the second case, initial mycological tests on CSF"
		(direct microscopy and culture) were repetitively negative and latex antigen
		tests gave unconvincing results. The patient was started on triple
		"antituberculosis therapy, on which he improved immediately; therapy was continued"
		"for 1 year with the patient remaining well. However, within 1 week of stopping"
		"therapy, he had to be readmitted with neurological signs and symptoms. Culture of"
		CSF this time yielded Cryptococcus neoformans and the antigen test was
		consistently positive. These are the first reported cases of cryptococcal
		meningitis in immunocompetent patients in Malta.

AB	-	A study was done to investigate the occurrence of Cryptococcus neoformans
		infection in patients admitted to Tikur Anbessa Hospital. Cryptococcus neoformans
		is an important opportunistic fungal pathogen in immunocompromised patients. The
		"study was done over a period of 18 months, from October 1998 to April 2000."
		"During this period, a total of 1088 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens were sent"
		"to the bacteriology laboratory in Tikur Anbessa Hospital, out of which 275 were"
		subjected for India ink examination. Out of these 19 (7%) were India ink
		positive. Additionally one lymph node aspirate was also India ink positive. All
		these specimens were culture positive for Cryptococcus neoformans. The medical
		records of these patients were retrospectively reviewed and all presenting
		clinical symptoms were recorded. In this group of patients with meningitis the
		"most common presenting were fever and headache. In addition, at the time of"
		"admission, 75% of the patients had other opportunistic infections, such as oral"
		"candidiasis, herpes zoster and Pneumocystis carini pneumonia. The mortality rate"
		was high even in patients with appropriate therapy. All the isolates were
		identified as C. neoformans var. neoformans. The variety gatti was not isolated
		in this study.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Fingolimod (Gilenya®), a first-in-class sphingosine-1-phosphate"
		receptor modulator is approved for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple
		sclerosis. Fingolimod-induced selective immunosuppression leads to an increased
		"risk of opportunistic infections such as cryptococcosis. So far, a total of 8"
		cases of fingolimod-related cryptococcal meningoencephalitis have been published.
		CASE PRESENTATION: A 49-year-old female with relapsing-remitting multiple
		"sclerosis presented with cephalgia, fever, confusion and generalized weakness."
		She had been on fingolimod therapy for the past 5.5 years. Clinical examination
		suggested meningoencephalitis and laboratory findings showed an IgG(2)
		"deficiency. Initially no pathogen could be detected, but after 4 days"
		Cryptococcus neoformans was found in the patient's blood cultures leading to the
		"diagnosis of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis. After antimycotic therapy, her"
		symptoms improved and the patient was discharged. CONCLUSION: MS patients on
		immunomodulatory  therapy are at constant risk for opportunistic infections.
		"Cephalgia, fever and generalized weakness in combination with fingolimod-induced"
		lymphopenia should be considered a red flag for cryptococcosis.

TI	-	Deafness and blindness in a renal transplant recipient with cryptococcal
		meningitis.
PG	-	72-5
AB	-	Infections are a major determinant of outcome in kidney transplantation.
		Opportunistic pathogens are common in kidney recipients and several organs can be
		affected. Central nervous system infection in transplant recipients is a medical
		emergency. There is limited information in the literature concerning
		post-transplantation cryptococcal infection. Deafness and blindness are not
		classic findings. We report a case of meningocerebral cryptococcosis complicated
		by deafness and blindness after kidney transplantation. Physicians need to
		consider the possibility of Cryptococcus neoformans when symptoms persist despite
		empiric antimicrobial therapy.

		system impairments were detected. CONCLUSIONS: This episode of very infrequent
		concurrent infections should emphasize the need to maintain an elevated clinical
		"suspicion for opportunistic infections and tuberculosis, even in the absence of"
		an obvious immunodeficiency and related epidemiological clues.

AB	-	"OBJECTIVES: We describe the clinical, mycological, immunological, and genetic"
		characteristics of six HIV-negative patients presenting with invasive
		cryptococcosis. METHODS: Patients with cryptococcosis without any of the
		"classical risk factors, such as HIV infection, followed at Cayenne Hospital, were"
		prospectively included. An immunologic and genetic assessment was performed.
		"RESULTS: Five male patients and one female patient, 5 adults and one child, were"
		investigated. All presented a neuromeningeal localization. Cryptococcus
		neoformans var. gattii and C. neoformans var. grubii were isolated in two and
		"three patients, respectively, whereas one patient could not be investigated."
		"Overall, we did not observe any global leukocyte defect. Two patients were found"
		with high levels of circulating autoantibodies against Granulocyte
		"macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and none had detectable levels of"
		autoantibodies against Interferon gamma (IFN-γ) Sequencing of STAT1 exons and
		flanking regions performed for four patients was wild type. CONCLUSION: To better
		"understand cryptococcosis in patients with cryptococcosis but otherwise healthy,"
		further explorations are needed with repeated immune checkups and strain
		virulence studies.

		programme.
PG	-	259-71
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-012-9551-x [doi]
AB	-	The increasing diversity of opportunistic fungi causing serious invasive fungal
		infections (IFI) has been documented. Accurate identification (ID) is important
		"in guiding therapy, determining prognosis for IFIs and in epidemiological"
		surveys. We assessed the utility of PCR-based methods for the ID of yeasts and
		"moulds that either were uncommon, failed conventional ID, or represented unusual"
		"biochemical or phenotypic profiles of common species. Among 1,790 viable fungal"
		"clinical isolates received during the SENTRY Program in 2010, 322 strains from 40"
		study sites had ID confirmed by molecular methods. Isolates were previously
		identified in participant institutions. Yeasts that were not confirmed by
		"morphology on CHROMagar, growth at 45 °C (Candida albicans/dubliniensis), or"
		assimilation of trehalose (C. glabrata) as well as non-Candida yeasts and all
		moulds were amplified and sequenced using primers amplifying one or more of the
		"following genes: ITS, 28S, β-tubulin (Aspergillus spp.), TEF (Fusarium spp.), IGS"
		(Trichosporon spp.). The isolates selected for molecular ID included 149 isolates
		"of Candida species, 77 of Aspergillus species, 73 non-Candida yeasts, and 23"
		"other moulds (a total of 41 different species). Overall, the ID determined by the"
		submitting site was confirmed for 189 isolates (58.7 %): Aspergillus spp. (64.1 %
		correct); Candida spp. (60.1 % correct); non-Candida yeasts (58.9 % correct);
		non-Aspergillus moulds (30.4 % correct). Species with high levels of concordance
		"between conventional and molecular ID included A. fumigatus (95.0  %), C."
		"lusitaniae (100 %), C. dubliniensis (92.3 %), C. kefyr (100 %), and C. neoformans"
		(90.2 %). Only 50.0 % of isolates of C. albicans and 59.1 % of C. glabrata
		selected due to unusual phenotypic or biochemical features were found to be
		correctly identified by the submitting site. Molecular methods for the
		identification of fungal pathogens are an important adjunct to the conventional
		identification of many less common clinically relevant yeasts and moulds
		including species of Candida with unusual or erroneous phenotypic or biochemical
		profiles. Molecular confirmation of fungal identification is essential in
		epidemiological surveys such as SENTRY.

TI	-	CNS cryptococcoma in an HIV-positive patient.
PG	-	131-3
AB	-	This is the first case of brain cryptococcoma in an AIDS patient reported in
		Argentina. The patient was a 28-year-old white heterosexual man with AIDS who
		"presented with altered mental status, seizures, visual hallucinations, headache,"
		and fever without significant focal neurological deficit. He had a lumbar
		"puncture, and was treated for cryptococcal meningitis. Subsequent brain CT"
		scanning and MRI disclosed a mass lesion in the occipital lobe. Histopathological
		"examination of biopsy was compatible with cryptococcoma, and tissue culture"
		revealed Cryptococcus neoformans. Resolution of the mass and edema resulted after
		"treatment with intravenous amphotericin B for six weeks, which was followed with"
		maintenance oral fluconazole. Intracranial mass is an uncommon complication in
		"AIDS patients with cryptococcosis, and cryptococcoma should be considered as"
		differential diagnosis of brain mass lesion in these patients. The etiologic
		"diagnosis is necessary because central nervous system (CNS) toxoplasmosis,"
		"lymphoma, and tuberculoma can produce similar clinical syndromes and MRI or CT"
		"findings to cryptococcoma. Also, these pathologies may coexist with meningeal"
		cryptococcosis.

TI	-	Discontinuation of highly active antiretroviral therapy leads to cryptococcal
		meningitis/choroiditis in an AIDS patient.
PG	-	438-45
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic pathogen that can
		manifest in immunocompromised patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
		Prevention of cryptococcosis and other opportunistic diseases is an objective in
		the management of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. The goal
		of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is to reduce the viral loads and
		enhance CD4 counts in HIV-infected patients. These 2 mechanisms keep HIV-infected
		"patients healthier and enhance their immune systems, thus reducing and often"
		preventing opportunistic infections such as ocular cryptococcal infections.
		Discontinuation of HAART can lead to ocular opportunistic infections such as
		cryptococcal choroiditis. CASE REPORT: Presented here is a case of a patient who
		"was treated successfully with HAART of stavudine (D4T), abacavir (Ziagen),"
		"ritonavir (Norvir), and saquinavir (Invirase). His last CD4 count before HAART"
		"was discontinued was 131 cells/mm(3), and viral load was less than 50 copies/mL."
		He discontinued his HAART regimen for 2 years and presented to the emergency room
		"with complaints of a severe headache with neck pain, lightheadedness, nausea,"
		"disorientation, and unsteady gait. Lumbar puncture results showed cryptococcal"
		"infection, and the patient was admitted for the treatment of cryptococcal"
		meningitis with amphotericin B and 5-flucytosine. Cryptococcal choroiditis was
		"diagnosed after treatment of the meningitis. After resolution, his resultant"
		visual acuities were 10/350 in the right eye and 10/600 in the left eye. He is on
		a maintenance dose of antifungal therapy and has been reinitiated on HAART of
		abacavir/zidovudine/lamivudine (Trizivir) and lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra).
		CONCLUSION: This case exemplifies the importance of HAART in the prevention of
		"opportunistic infections, cryptococcal meningitis/choroiditis in particular. Eye"
		care professionals can play a role in encouraging patients to comply with their

OAB	-	This report presents the first case described in the English literature of dual
		infection with Cryptococcus neoformans and Streptococcus pneumoniae in the
		"cerebrospinal fluid of an AIDS patient. The patient was a 32-year-old,"
		HIV-positive South African woman who had been diagnosed with disseminated
		tuberculosis 5 months prior to the index admission. Her chief complaints at
		"presentation were abdominal pain, chronic diarrhea, and vaginal discharge,"
		suggesting a diagnosis of pneumonia and pelvic inflammatory disease. Persistence
		of confusion led to a lumbar puncture; gram-positive and budding yeasts were
		observed and subsequent India-ink staining revealed capsulated yeast typical of
		"C. neoformans. S. pneumoniae and C. neoformans were cultured 24 and 48 hours,"
		"respectively, after incubation. The woman died within 24 hours of hospital"
		"admission, precluding further investigation. It is presumed that this woman"
		"already had disseminated cryptococci at the earlier presentation, but was"
		"incorrectly diagnosed as having tuberculosis. The finding of pneumococci, in the"
		"absence of inflammatory cells in cerebrospinal fluid, suggests the terminal event"
		was fulminant pneumococcal meningitis in the setting of chronic cryptococcal
		meningitis. This case supports the importance of performing both the Gram- and
		India-ink stains and cryptococcal antigen test on cerebrospinal fluid specimens
		"from immunocompromised patients, even when biochemical and cellular parameters"
		are normal.

		case is the first reported pediatric idiopathic CD4(+) T-lymphocytopenia case
		with cryptococcal meningitis that was successfully treated by the addition of
		rIL-2 therapy to antifungal therapy.

		central nervous system. METHODS: We assessed the potential of
		ventriculoperitoneal shunting (VPS) in preventing mortality due to uncontrollable
		intracranial hypertension (ICH) in 15 patients with acquired immunodeficiency
		syndrome (AIDS)-related cryptococcal meningitis. RESULTS: After 2 weeks of
		antifungal therapy consisting of amphotericin B deoxycholate with or without
		"fluconazole, patients with persistent ICH underwent VPS, despite having"
		"persistent Cryptococcus neoformans infection. In 12 patients, the uncontrollable"
		ICH was resolved by VPS. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cryptococcal
		meningoencephalitis who have ICH must be considered for VPS even with positive
		cerebrospinal fluid cultures.

PG	-	388-396
LID	-	10.1111/tmi.13539 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To give an overview of the recently reported literature on the
		aetiologies of meningitis and encephalitis in western sub-Saharan Africa.
		METHODS: We conducted a scoping review following PRISMA guidance on published
		meningitis and encephalitis cases in the 16 countries of the United
		Nations-defined western sub-Saharan African region as identified in cohort
		"studies, case series, and case reports, published 01/01/2000-08/01/2020, and"
		"available in four databases in August 2020 with an abstract in English, French or"
		Italian. RESULTS: There were 38 distinct pathogens identified from 91 cohort
		"studies' data and 48 case reports or case series' data. In cohort-level data, the"
		"majority of cases were caused by Neisseria meningitidis (71.5%), Streptococcus"
		pneumoniae (17.6%) and Haemophilus influenzae (7.3%). In case report- and case
		"series-level data, 40.5% of patients were <18 years old, 28.6% were female, and"
		28.6% were known to be immunocompromised. The case fatality rate was 39.3%. The
		most commonly reported pathogens among immunocompetent patients were Salmonella
		"species (13 cases) and Ebola virus (9 cases), and the most commonly reported"
		pathogen among immunocompromised patients was Cryptococcus neoformans (18 cases).
		Most cohort cases (52.3%) derived from Niger followed by Burkina Faso (28.6%).
		"Most cases from single reports or series were reported from Nigeria (21.4%), Mali"
		(20.2%) and Burkina Faso (19.0%). CONCLUSIONS: Given the small number of
		"pathogens reported, our findings underscore the need to better screen, diagnose"
		and monitor populations in western sub-Saharan Africa for additional CNS
		"pathogens, including those posing significant outbreak risks."

TI	-	Subarachnoid small vein occlusion due to inflammatory fibrosis-a possible
		mechanism for cerebellar infarction in cryptococcal meningoencephalitis: a case
		report.
PG	-	157
LID	-	10.1186/s12883-017-0934-y [doi]
LID	-	157
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis (CM) causes cerebral infarction,"
		"typically, lacunar infarction in the basal ganglia. However, massive cerebral"
		infarction leading to death is rare and its pathophysiology is unclear. We report
		"a case of CM causing massive cerebellar infarction, which led to cerebral"
		herniation and death. CASE PRESENTATION: A 56-year-old man who suffered from
		dizziness and gait disturbance for one month was admitted to our hospital and
		subsequently diagnosed with a cerebellar infarction. He had a past medical
		history of hepatitis type B virus infection and hepatic failure. Although the
		findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imitated an arterial infarction of
		"the posterior inferior cerebellar artery, an accompanying irregular peripheral"
		"edema was observed. The ischemic lesion progressed, subsequently exerting a mass"
		effect and leading to impaired consciousness. External and internal decompression
		surgeries were performed. Cryptococcus neoformans was confirmed in the surgical
		"specimen, and the patient was diagnosed with CM. In addition, venule congestion"
		in the parenchyma was observed with extensive fibrosis and compressed veins in
		the subarachnoid space. The patient died 26 days after admission. Autopsy
		revealed that pathological changes were localized in the cerebellum. CONCLUSION:
		"C. neoformans can induce extensive fibrosis of the subarachnoid space, which may"
		compress small veins mechanically inducing venule congestion and massive cerebral
		"infarction. In such cases, the clinical course can be severe and even rapidly"
		fatal. An atypical pattern of infarction on MRI should alert clinicians to the
		possibility of C. neoformans infection.

TI	-	Cryptococcal meningitis in an HIV negative patient with systemic sarcoidosis.
PG	-	928-30
AB	-	A case of Cryptococcus neoformans meningitis is described in an HIV negative
		patient with undiagnosed systemic sarcoidosis. The patient presented with signs
		of meningitis together with generalised lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly.
		Cryptococcal meningitis was diagnosed on lumbar puncture. She was treated with
		intravenous amphotericin B but died within two weeks of admission. Necropsy
		"revealed lesions in the lungs, liver, spleen, lymph nodes, small intestine, and"
		bone marrow consistent with sarcoidosis. Microscopically the lesions contained
		non-caseating epithelioid cell granulomas typical of sarcoidosis. No Schaumann or
		Hamazaki-Wesenberg bodies were identified. Cryptococcus neoformans meningitis is
		generally associated with immunosuppressive disorders. As T cell abnormalities
		"have been described in sarcoidosis, this could have been a case of opportunistic"
		"infection. Although rare, sarcoidosis merits consideration in patients with"
		cryptococcal disease in the absence of HIV infection.

TI	-	Emergence of amphotericin B-resistant Cryptococcus laurentii meningoencephalitis
		shortly after treatment for Cryptococcus neoformans meningitis in a patient with
		AIDS.
PG	-	227-32
AB	-	A unique occurrence of two subsequent episodes of HIV-associated Cryptococcus
		neoformans followed by C. laurentii meningoencephalitis (successfully cured with
		fluconazole after demonstrated amphotericin B resistance) is presented and
		discussed. The available literature reported only two cases of HIV-associated C.
		"laurentii infection to date, while a concurrent infection by C. neoformans and C."
		laurentii has been reported only once in a patient without HIV disease. The
		absence of prior descriptions of documented central nervous system infection by
		C. laurentii in non-HIV-infected patients is emphasized as well as the
		unpredictable in vitro and in vivo antifungal susceptibility of this
		"non-neoformans Cryptococcus spp., and its apparent prevalence in hospitalized"
		"patients who received prior antifungal treatments. All epidemiologic, diagnostic,"
		"clinical, and therapeutic implications are discussed on the basis of the evolving"
		characteristics of opportunism in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy
		(HAART).

PG	-	e348-50
LID	-	10.1016/j.ijid.2009.04.012 [doi]
AB	-	Fluconazole resistance among Cryptococcus neoformans is unusual in
		post-transplantation patients. Voriconazole is a triazole agent with good
		antifungal activity but also with drug-drug interactions because of potent
		inhibition of the P450 enzyme system. The interaction with immunosuppressive
		"agents, especially calcineurin inhibitors, is of concern in post-transplantation"
		patients. We report the first case of fluconazole-resistant cryptococcal
		meningitis in a kidney transplant recipient successfully treated with
		"voriconazole, but complicated with a raised serum concentration of tacrolimus and"
		hyponatremia after co-administration. A 43-year-old man with a history of renal
		"transplantation and on long-term immunosuppressive agents, including"
		"mycophenolate and tacrolimus, suffered from recurrent cryptococcal meningitis. He"
		was treated with amphotericin B-liposome for 24 days because of fluconazole
		"resistance. However, cryptococci were still found in the cerebrospinal fluid;"
		oral voriconazole was substituted. Six days after co-administration of
		"voriconazole and tacrolimus, the trough concentration of tacrolimus markedly"
		increased and hyponatremia developed. A culture of the CSF did not yield growth
		of Cryptococcus. Conditions improved after the cessation of tacrolimus for three
		days followed by reducing the dosage of voriconazole and tacrolimus. When
		"voriconazole is initially added, the dosage of tacrolimus should be reduced."
		"Close monitoring of tacrolimus concentration and its adverse effects, including"
		"nephrotoxicity, hyperglycemia, hyperkalemia, and hyponatremia, are mandatory."

AB	-	A rare case of 70-year-old woman with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma who
		developed multifocal choroiditis from a dissemination of Cryptococcus neoformans
		is reported. Ophthalmologic examination revealed multiple yellowish choroidal
		lesions in the posterior pole of both eyes. Sequential optical coherence
		tomographic images disclosed the involvement of the choroid and the consecutive
		changes in its architecture during the course of treatment. The recognition of
		these ocular manifestations may be important for the rapid diagnosis of
		C. nerformans-disseminated diseases. Rapid diagnosis and prompt therapy with
		intravitreal injection as well as systemic fosfluconazole and liposomal
		amphotericin B led to clinical improvement of intraocular cryptococcosis.

TI	-	Determinants of mortality in a combined cohort of 501 patients with
		HIV-associated Cryptococcal meningitis: implications for improving outcomes.
PG	-	736-45
LID	-	10.1093/cid/cit794 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND:  Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) is a leading cause of death in
		individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Identifying factors
		associated with mortality informs strategies to improve outcomes. METHODS:  Five
		hundred one patients with HIV-associated CM were followed prospectively for 10
		"weeks during trials in Thailand, Uganda, Malawi, and South Africa. South African"
		patients (n = 266) were followed for 1 year. Similar inclusion/exclusion criteria
		were applied at all sites. Logistic regression identified baseline variables
		independently associated with mortality. RESULTS:  Mortality was 17% at 2 weeks
		"and 34% at 10 weeks. Altered mental status (odds ratio [OR], 3.1; 95% confidence"
		"interval [CI], 1.7-5.9), high cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fungal burden (OR, 1.4"
		"per log10 colony-forming units/mL increase; 95% CI, 1.0-1.8), older age (>50"
		"years; OR, 3.9; 95% CI, 1.4-11.1), high peripheral white blood cell count (>10 ×"
		"10(9) cells/L; OR, 8.7; 95% CI, 2.5-30.2), fluconazole-based induction treatment,"
		and slow clearance of CSF infection were independently associated with 2-week
		"mortality. Low body weight, anemia (hemoglobin <7.5 g/dL), and low CSF opening"
		pressure were independently associated with mortality at 10 weeks in addition to
		"altered mental status, high fungal burden, high peripheral white cell count, and"
		"older age. In those followed for 1 year, overall mortality was 41%. Immune"
		reconstitution inflammatory syndrome occurred in 13% of patients and was
		"associated with 2-week CSF fungal burden (P = .007), but not with time to"
		"initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART). CONCLUSIONS:  CSF fungal burden,"
		"altered mental status, and rate of clearance of infection predict acute mortality"
		"in HIV-associated CM. The results suggest that earlier diagnosis, more rapidly"
		"fungicidal amphotericin-based regimens, and prompt immune reconstitution with ART"
		are priorities for improving outcomes.

TI	-	Use of cerebrospinal fluid lactic acid concentration in the diagnosis of fungal
		meningitis.
PG	-	429-34
AB	-	A patient with a several year history of normal pressure hydrocephalus was found
		to have an infection owing to Cryptococcus neoformans. Cryptococcal infection was
		not suspected until typical cells were observed in a Wright's stained smear of
		cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). A review of past medical findings in this patient
		showed elevated CSF values for lactic acid and protein. This case prompted us to
		review the use of lactic acid as an indicator of fungal meningitis and compare it
		"to other more commonly used nonspecific indicators of fungal meningitis, notably"
		"the concentrations of glucose and protein, and the number of leukocytes in CSF."
		"In our institution, all 10 culturally proven cases of fungal meningitis, for"
		"which the lactic acid concentration in the CSF was available, were found to have"
		an elevated lactic acid concentration (range 3.2 to 13.3 mmol per L vs normal
		range 0.8 to 2.8 mmol per L). No other nonspecific indicator was elevated in all
		10 patients. In view of the poor sensitivity of stained smear or wet preparations
		"and cultures, when less than five ml of CSF are used for culture, an elevated"
		lactic acid value in a patient with or without signs of meningitis should raise
		the suspicion of fungal infection.

		in a Patient with HTLV-1 Associated Adult T- Cell Leukemia/Lymphoma: Occam's
		Razor Blunted.
PG	-	81-3
AB	-	Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is usually preceded by infection with human
		T-cell lymphotropic virus I (HTLV-I). Patients with ATLL frequently get
		"opportunistic infections of the lungs, intestines, and central nervous system."
		Pneumocystis pneumonia is commonly known as an AIDS defining illness. Grocott's
		methenamine silver stain of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples obtained via
		bronchoscopy remain the gold standard for diagnosis. Pulmonary cryptococcosis is
		seen in patients with T-cell deficiencies and a diagnosis is made by culture of
		"sputum, BAL, or occasionally of pleural fluid. We present the second case of"
		coinfection with these two organisms in a patient with ATLL who was successfully
		"treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, corticosteroids, and fluconazole. We"
		illustrate the need for high clinical vigilance for seeking out an additional
		"diagnosis, especially in immunocompromised patients if they are not improving"
		despite receiving appropriate treatment.

AB	-	The importance of humoral immunity for resistance to Cryptococcus neoformans is
		uncertain. A case-controlled study of the human antibody response to C.
		neoformans comparing the serum antibody profiles of human immunodeficiency virus
		(HIV)-infected persons who did (HIV+/CM+) or did not (HIV-infected controls)
		develop cryptococcal meningitis (CM) and HIV-uninfected persons with samples
		obtained from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study was performed. Total
		"immunoglobulin concentrations were determined, and the specificity, isotype, and"
		idiotype expression of antibodies to C. neoformans capsular glucuronoxylomannan
		"were analyzed by ELISA. Compared with the HIV+/CM+ group, the HIV-infected"
		"control group had significantly lower levels of total IgM, IgA, and antibodies"
		expressing a certain VH3 determinant. The HIV-infected control group manifested
		an increase in immunoglobulin levels with a decrease in CD4 lymphocytes. The
		findings suggest a possible association between reduced expression of certain
		immunoglobulin subsets and HIV-associated CM.

AB	-	"Cryptococcus neoformans infections occur mostly in immunodeficient individuals,"
		being the most common opportunistic fungal central nervous system (CNS) infection
		"in HIV seropositive patients. Moreover, other conditions affecting host immunity,"
		"such as hematologic malignancies, organ transplantation and immunosuppressive"
		drugs are implicated as risk factors. The authors present a case of a 48-year-old
		male with Hodgkin Lymphoma for 26 years and submitted to several lines of
		"treatment, diagnosed with cryptococcal meningitis while on therapy with"
		brentuximab. The patient presented with positive cerebral spinal fluid (CSF)
		cryptococcal antigen plus positive blood cultures. He was put under induction
		"antifungal treatment with liposomal amphotericin B and flucytosine, as well as"
		corticosteroid therapy with dexamethasone with headache improvement and a
		favorable clinical evolution. There are no reported cases of cryptococcal
		"meningoencephalitis under CD30-directed monoclonal antibody. Furthermore, this"
		case illustrates the risk of Cryptococcus neoformans infection in
		"immunocompromising conditions other than HIV, underlining the need of considering"
		this differential diagnosis when physicians face an opportunistic neuroinfection.

TI	-	A cryptic cause of cryptococcal meningitis.
PG	-	451-2
AB	-	Cryptococcus neoformans commonly causes opportunistic infection in
		"immunocompromised patients, especially in patients with AIDS. The CD4+"
		"T-lymphocyte count is measured in patients with HIV infection, because it signals"
		an increased risk of opportunistic infection and a decline in immunological
		function. We report a case of cryptococcal meningitis in a patient with
		persistently low CD4+ cell counts without evidence of HIV infection. The
		patient's underlying immunocompromised state was attributed to idiopathic CD4+
		"T-lymphocytopenia (ICL), a recently described syndrome characterized by"
		depletions in the CD4+ T-cell subsets without evidence of HIV infection.
		Immunodeficiency can exist in the absence of laboratory evidence of HIV
		"infection, highlighting the importance of evaluating T-cell subsets in patients"
		who present with unusual infections.

LID	-	10.1016/j.riam.2015.09.001 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Fungal infections have been commonly diagnosed in individuals with
		"advanced HIV disease. Cryptococcosis, pneumocystosis, and histoplasmosis are the"
		most frequent systemic mycoses in people suffering from HIV/AIDS. CASE REPORT: We
		report a case of multiple fungal infections in an advanced AIDS-patient. A
		"33-year-old HIV-positive man from Brazil was hospitalized due to diarrhea,"
		"dyspnea, emaciation, hypoxemia, extensive oral thrush, and a CD4+ T lymphocyte"
		count of 20cells/mm(3). Honeycombed-structures consistent with Pneumocystis
		jirovecii were observed by direct immunofluorescence in induced sputum.
		Cryptococcus neoformans was recovered from respiratory secretion and
		cerebrospinal fluid cultures. Histopathology of the bone marrow also revealed the
		presence of Histoplasma capsulatum. Molecular assays were performed in a sputum
		sample. Nested-PCR confirmed the presence of P. jirovecii and H. capsulatum; qPCR
		multiplex was positive for C. neoformans and H. capsulatum. With the treatment of
		antifungal drugs the patient progressed satisfactorily. CONCLUSIONS: The
		diagnosis of several systemic mycoses demonstrates the vulnerability of advanced
		"AIDS-patients. Thus, the detection of AIDS cases in the early stages of infection"
		"is necessary for a prompt and adequate introduction of HAART therapy, and the use"
		of prophylaxis to control opportunistic infections.

LID	-	10.1007/s11046-011-9423-9 [doi]
AB	-	Rituximab-related late-onset neutropenia (R-LON) is an adverse event associated
		with rituximab. A 65-year-old woman presented with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
		of the kidney without bone marrow involvement. She was treated with 4 cycles of
		"CHOP chemotherapy consisting of doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and"
		"prednisolone at 4-week intervals. Rituximab was also administrated of the second,"
		"third, fourth CHOP cycles. She developed a high fever of 38°C, nausea, and severe"
		neutropenia following the four cycles of R-CHOP chemotherapy. Her leukocyte count
		"was 160/μl without neutrophils. Initially, a blood and pleural fluid and"
		cerebrospinal fluid cultures were positive for Cryptococcus neoformans. Once she
		became asymptomatic following treatment with fluconazole and neutropenia was
		"recovered with lenograstim, she had neck stiffness and admitted soon."
		Cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) culture was positive for Cryptococcus neoformans.
		Treatment with amphotericin B(AMPH-B) and flucytosine(5-FC) was initiated as
		"diagnosis of cryptococcus meningitis. Lenograstim was administrated for 9 months,"
		"and amount of dose was 9,750 μg. Cryptococcosis with malignant lymphoma is rare"
		"disease, and previously 17 cases were reported. Of note, mortality of"
		disseminated cryptococcosis with malignant lymphoma is 54%. The more and more
		rituximab is widely used; the cases of severe infection in R-LON may increase.

LID	-	10.1177/0956462414563630 [doi]
AB	-	We report a case of a symptomatic relapse of HIV-related cryptococcal
		meningoencephalitis eight years after the first diagnosis on the background of
		immune reconstitution. The findings as well as the clinical course suggests a
		combination of smouldering localised infection and enhanced inflammatory reaction
		related to immune restoration due to antiretroviral therapy. A combination of
		antifungal and anti-inflammatory therapy resulted in clinical and radiological
		improvement. Our case challenges the concept that immune reconstitution
		inflammatory syndrome and microbiological relapse are dichotomous entities.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: The coexistence of neuromeningeal cryptococcosis and Kaposi's sarcoma
		is not surprising in a patient with human immunodeficiency virus infection and a
		"low CD4 count, although it is rarely described. However, we describe such an"
		association in a patient with human immunodeficiency virus infection and a
		relatively high CD4 count. CASE PRESENTATION: A 41-year old Cameroonian woman
		presented to our hospital with subacute occipital headaches associated with
		"photophobia, blurred vision, phonophobia, projectile vomiting, and tonic"
		"seizures. In her past history, there was an human immunodeficiency virus"
		"infection known for 12 years, for which she had been taking (with good"
		compliance) tenofovir-lamivudine-efavirenz-based antiretroviral therapy for the
		"same period of time. One month before the consultation, gastric Kaposi's sarcoma"
		"had been diagnosed, justifying the treatment with doxorubicin she had received. A"
		clinical examination was unremarkable. A computed tomography scan of her brain
		"was normal, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed Cryptococcus neoformans."
		Her CD4 count was 353/mm(3). Orally administered antifungal treatment with
		fluconazole (1200 mg/day) and flucytosine (1500 mg × 4/day) was started
		"immediately, but she died on the sixth day of this treatment. CONCLUSION: This"
		clinical case shows that the coexistence of neuromeningeal cryptococcosis and
		gastric Kaposi's sarcoma is possible in all patients with human immunodeficiency
		"virus infection, regardless of CD4 count."

PG	-	37-44
AB	-	The charts of 114 consecutive patients with chronic meningitis admitted to a
		"general hospital in Bangkok, Thailand, between 1993 and 1999 were retrospectively"
		reviewed. The most common causative agents were Cryptococcus neoformans (54%) and
		Mycobacterium tuberculosis (37%). HIV and other underlying diseases had a major
		impact on the presentation of chronic cryptococcal meningitis patients. Compared
		"to HIV-negative cryptococcal meningitis patients (21%), HIV-positives (79%) had a"
		"significantly lower incidence of focal signs (p = 0.02), hydrocephalus (p = 0.03)"
		"and seizures (p = 0.001) during hospital stay, furthermore, a lower leucocyte"
		"level, a significantly higher glucose level (p = 0.02) and a lower protein level"
		(p = 0.03) in the first cerebrospinal fluid examination. Of the 43 patients with
		"chronic tuberculous meningitis, only 3 were HIV positive. Focal neurologic"
		deficits were found more frequently in tuberculous meningitis patients (p =
		0.001) when compared to cryptococcal meningitis patients without HIV. Cerebral
		infarction on cerebral CT was indicative of tuberculous meningitis. Cryptococcal
		meningitis patients with HIV infection had a worse outcome compared to non-AIDS
		"patients. Advanced stage of the disease on admission, decreased level of"
		consciousness prior to and on the admission day and raised intracranial pressure
		above 40 cm H(2)O at any given time were predictive of a poor outcome in
		tuberculous meningitis patients.

AB	-	"Cryptococcosis, a significant opportunistic infection, has become a global"
		concern since the advent of immunosuppressive chemotherapy or in immunodeficient
		patients. Host responses range from a harmless colonization to disseminated
		disease. An accurate or definitive diagnosis in patients with cryptococcal
		meningitis is often delayed because of the similar clinical presentation and
		biochemical or cerebrospinal fluid findings to those of a variety of infectious
		"and non-infectious aetiologies, most of which are also especially prevalent in"
		"developing countries. Rarely, patients with cryptococcal meningitis can develop"
		immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) when initiated on combination
		antiretroviral therapy (cART) the diagnosis which is often missed and can be
		"fatal. Due to the similar presentation of infection and IRIS, it is often"
		confused with the relapse of cryptococcal meningitis. We report a case of
		paradoxical recurrent meningitis in response to the initiation of cART in a
		patient diagnosed with cryptococcal meningitis and propose that the recurrent
		symptoms resulted from a therapy-induced reconstitution of the immune response
		against residual Cryptococcus neoformans.

PG	-	473-6
LID	-	10.1111/tid.12216 [doi]
AB	-	Disseminated Cryptococcus disease occurs in patients with defective T-cell
		immunity. Cryptococcal meningitis following autologous stem cell transplant (SCT)
		"has been described previously in only 1 patient, 4 months post SCT and while off"
		antifungal prophylaxis. We present a unique case of Cryptococcus meningitis
		"pre-engraftment after autologous SCT, while the patient was receiving fluconazole"
		prophylaxis. A 41-year-old man with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma underwent autologous
		"SCT. Post-transplant prophylaxis consisted of fluconazole 400 mg daily,"
		"levofloxacin 500 mg daily, and acyclovir 800 mg twice daily. On day 9 post"
		"transplant, he developed fever and headache. Peripheral white blood cell count"
		(WBC) was 700/μL. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed lesions
		consistent with meningoencephalitis. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed
		"a WBC of 39 with 77% lymphocytes, protein 63, glucose 38, CSF pressure 20.5 cmH2"
		"O, and a positive cryptococcal antigen. CSF culture confirmed Cryptococcus"
		neoformans. The patient was treated with liposomal amphotericin B 5 mg/kg
		"intravenously daily, and flucytosine 37.5 mg/kg orally every 6 h. He was switched"
		"to fluconazole 400 mg daily after 3 weeks of amphotericin therapy, with"
		sterilization of the CSF with negative CSFCryptococcus antigen and negative CSF
		culture. Review of the literature revealed 9 cases of cryptococcal disease in
		recipients of SCT. Median time of onset was 64 days post transplant. Only 3
		meningitis cases were described; 2 of them after allogeneic SCT. Fungal
		prophylaxis with fluconazole post autologous SCT is recommended at least through
		"engraftment, and for up to 100 days in high-risk patients. A high index of"
		"suspicion is needed to diagnose and treat opportunistic infections, especially in"
		the face of immunosuppression and despite adequate prophylaxis. Infection is
		"usually fatal without treatment, thus prompt diagnosis and therapy might be life"
		saving.

		"amphotericin B, 4.0mg/L for fluconazole and 0.12mg/L for voriconazole. Evaluation"

		fungus isolated from the blood and cerebrospinal fluid of the child was able to
		"disseminate, reaching the spleen, lungs and brain, where it caused significant"
		macroscopic alterations in the size and texture of each organ. Treatment of
		infected mice with amphotericin B reduced the fungal load in the spleen and

TI	-	Cryptococcal meningitis and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome in a
		pediatric patient with HIV after switching to second line antiretroviral therapy:
		a case report.
PG	-	68

LID	-	68
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcal meningitis (CCM) is a common and deadly disease among
		HIV-infected patients. Notable about CCM is its association with the immune
		reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). Though it has been posited a switch
		"from first to second-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) can induce CCM IRIS, a"
		case presentation of CCM IRIS has not been published. CASE PRESENTATION: A
		"10-year-old, HIV-infected girl who initially presented with severe headache and"
		"new-onset seizures, with cerebrospinal fluid that returned antigen, India Ink,"
		"and culture positive for Cryptococcus neoformans. Notably, 8 weeks prior to"
		"seizures, she had switched from first line to second-line ART"
		(abacavir-lamivudine-efavirenz to zidovudine-lamivudine-lopinavir/ritonavir) due
		"to virologic failure, with a viral load of 224,000 copies/milliliter. At time of"
		"seizures and 8 weeks on second-line ART, her viral load had reduced to 262"
		"copies/milliliter. Her hospital course was prolonged, as she had ongoing"
		headaches and developed bilateral cranial nerve VI palsies despite clearance of
		Cryptococcus from cerebrospinal fluid on antifungal therapy and therapeutic
		"lumbar punctures. However, symptoms stabilized, and she was discharged with oral"
		fluconazole. Cranial nerve palsies resolved 10 weeks post discharge and she has
		remained disease free. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a case of CCM IRIS in a
		10-year-old HIV infected child after changing to second-line ART. This case
		provides evidence that screening for cryptococcal antigenaemia prior to switch
		from first-line to second-line ART could be an important measure to prevent
		cryptococcal disease.

TI	-	Olfactory pathways in three patients with cryptococcal meningitis and acquired
		immune deficiency syndrome.
PG	-	195-9
AB	-	"The olfactory mucosa, bulbs and tracts were examined for the presence of"
		Cryptococcus neoformans in 3 patients with the acquired immune deficiency
		syndrome (AIDS) and cryptococcal meningitis. Two of them had antibodies against
		HIV-1 and one had positive serology for HIV-2. Cryptococci were seen in the
		subarachnoid space around olfactory tracts and bulbs and in the submucosal
		"olfactory nerve fascicles. In one case, olfactory nerve fascicles from the lamina"
		propria were also affected. Olfactory epithelium and respiratory mucosa were not
		involved. We suggest that Cryptococcus reached the olfactory nerve fascicles
		through the olfactory pathways for cerebrospinal fluid drainage which might serve
		as a source of latent cryptococcal infection.

TI	-	Chronic meningitis in immunocompromised adult Ethiopians visiting Tikur Anbessa
		Teaching Hospital and Ye'huleshet Clinic from 2003-2004.
PG	-	43-8
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Chronic meningitis is inflammation of the meninges where signs and
		symptoms develop and last for at least four weeks without alleviation. Little is
		known about the current etiology and incidence of the disease in adults living in
		developing countries. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to elucidate the
		most common etiologies of chronic meningitis in adult Ethiopian patients and give
		an aid in the empiric therapy. METHODOLOGY: A total of 53 adult patients (median
		age 32 years) having chronic meningitis and who were admitted at Tikur Anbessa
		"Teaching Hospital and Ye'huleshet Clinic, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia were recruited"
		"between 2003 and 2004. Of the 53 patients, bacteriological, molecular and"
		immunological investigations were done for 52 of the study participants to detect
		"Cryptococcus neoformans, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Toxoplasma gondii, Brucella"
		and Neisseria meningitides infections. RESULTS: Forty eight of the participants
		were HIV positive and 15% (8/52) of the CSF were positive with Cryptococcal latex
		"antigen detection test; in addition, M. tuberculosis DNA was detected using PCR"
		from CSF ofpatients infew of the patients. Multiple infections were observed in
		studyparticipants with < 0.1 to 1 CD4 to CD8 ratio. CONCLUSION: Chronic
		"meningitis mostly occurred in HIV infected patients, where most of the infections"
		were attributed to Cryptococcus neoformans whereas M. tuberculosis appeared
		secondary.

TI	-	Cryptococcus neoformans-reactive and total immunoglobulin profiles of human
		immunodeficiency virus-infected and uninfected Ugandans.
PG	-	1168-76
AB	-	We determined total and Cryptococcus neoformans glucuronoxylomannan
		(GXM)-reactive antibody repertoires of human immunodeficiency virus
		"(HIV)-infected and HIV-uninfected Ugandans in a retrospective, case-control study"
		of participants in a randomized controlled trial of pneumococcal vaccination. The
		study included 192 adults: 48 who subsequently developed cryptococcal meningitis
		"(CM); (HIV+ CM+); 2 individuals who matched them in CD4+ T-cell level, stage of"
		"HIV disease, and age but did not develop CM (HIV+ CM-); and 48 HIV-uninfected"
		individuals. Total serum immunoglobulin concentrations and titers of
		"immunoglobulin M (IgM), IgG, and IgA to GXM, pneumococcal polysaccharides, and"
		antibodies expressing certain V(H)3 idiotypes were determined with banked sera
		obtained before the development of cryptococcosis for HIV+ CM+ subjects. The
		results showed that HIV-infected subjects had significantly lower levels of IgM
		to GXM but higher levels of total immunoglobulin and IgG and IgA to GXM than
		those of HIV-uninfected subjects. HIV-infected subjects with a history of
		"pneumonia had higher levels, and those with a history of herpes zoster had lower"
		levels of GXM-binding antibodies than subjects with no history of either disease.
		Minimal to no cross-reactivity was demonstrated between antibodies to GXM and
		polysaccharides in a pneumococcal vaccine. No significant differences between the
		"antibody repertoires of HIV+ CM+ and HIV+ CM- subjects were identified, but among"
		"subjects without a history of pneumonia, there was a trend towards lower"
		V(H)3-positive antibody levels among HIV+ CM+ than among HIV+ CM- subjects. Our
		findings demonstrate an association between previous infectious diseases and
		differences in the total and GXM-reactive antibody repertoires of HIV-infected
		subjects and suggest the question of whether certain microbes modulate subsequent
		antibody responses to GXM deserves further study.

		with pulmonary cryptococcosis.
PG	-	e5-8
AB	-	We report a case of pulmonary cryptococcosis in a 21-year-old Italian female
		smoker with no apparent immune disorder. In this study we demonstrated that: (i)
		patient's neutrophils and monocytes manifested a significant reduction of killing
		activity against Cryptococcus neoformans as well as Candida albicans; (ii) the
		suppression was more pronounced in monocytes than in neutrophils; (iii)
		"neutrophils and monocytes showed a significant impairment of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta,"
		and nitric oxide production. These results suggest that the apparent
		immunocompetent host with pulmonary cryptococcosis could have specific defects in
		natural immune system mechanisms.

TI	-	Invasive fungal infections in Chile: a multicenter study of fungal prevalence and
		susceptibility during a 1-year period.
PG	-	333-9
AB	-	During the first year of an ongoing surveillance program of invasive fungal
		infections (IFI) a total of 130 patients (56% male) with fungal strains isolated
		from blood and other sterile sites were reported from 13 hospitals in Chile.
		"Significant yeast isolates were obtained from 118 patients, and molds affected 12"
		"patients. The main patient groups affected were neonates, children less than 1"
		year old and adults aged 50-79 years. All fungal bloodstream infections (BSI)
		were due to yeasts; 79 patients (61%) were affected. The main risk factors
		"recorded were antibiotic therapy (76%), stay in the intensive care unit (ICU)"
		(70%) and presence of a central venous catheter (65%). Nosocomial infections were
		"represented in 83.5% of BSI. Overall, Candida albicans (40.8%), C. parapsilosis"
		"(13.1%), C. tropicalis (10%) and Cryptococcus neoformans (10%) were the most"
		common species. Aspergillus fumigatus (3.1%) was the most frequent mold. C.
		"albicans (48.1%) and C. parapsilosis (17.7%), were the most frequent agents"
		"recovered from blood. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Trichosporon mucoides, two"
		"emerging pathogens, were also isolated. All yeasts tested were susceptible to"
		amphotericin B with minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) < or = 1 microg/ml.
		Resistance to itraconazole (MIC > or = 1 microg/ml) and fluconazole (MIC > or =
		"64 microg/ml) was observed in 4 and 6% of cases, respectively. C. glabrata was"
		"the least susceptible species, with 50% of isolates resistant to itraconazole and"
		"33% resistant to fluconazole, with one strain showing combined resistance."
		Reduction of BSI requires greater adherence to hand-washing and related infection
		control guidelines.

AB	-	The Mycology Department of the Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Infecciosas
		"""Dr. C. Malbrán"", conducted the Second National Multicenter Survey on Fungemia"
		due to Yeasts in Argentina. The aim was to obtain updated data of the frequency
		of the causative species encountered and their in vitro susceptibility to seven
		antifungal agents. Yeast species were identified by micromorphological and
		biochemical studies. Antifungal susceptibility testing was performed by the
		reference microdilution method E.Def 7.1 of the European Committee on Antibiotic
		Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST). A total of 461 viable yeasts were identified.
		"The most frequent species were: Candida albicans (38.4 %), Candida parapsilosis"
		"(26 %), Candida tropicalis (15.4 %) and Candida glabrata (4.3 %). Other uncommon"
		"species, such as Candida viswanathii (0.6 %), Candida haemulonii (0.4 %), Candida"
		inconspicua (0.2 %) and Candida fermentati (0.2 %) were also isolated. Among the
		"Candida spp., 5.4 % and 1.6 % were resistant to fluconazole and voriconazole,"
		respectively. Itraconazole and caspofungin were the most efficient agents against
		"all Candida spp. tested (MIC < 1 mg/l). For anidulafungin, 21.6 % of C."
		parapsilosis showed a MIC value of 4 mg/l. Fluconazole was less active against
		"53.1 % of Cryptococcus neoformans (MIC > 8 mg/l), 75 % of Trichosporon spp., and"
		"100 % of Rhodotorula spp., Geotrichum candidum, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The"
		global percentage of mortality was 20 %. The presence of uncommon species
		reinforces the need for performing continuous laboratory surveillance in order to
		"monitor possible changes, not only in the epidemiological distribution of"
		"species, but also in the resistance to antifungal drugs."

TI	-	Microevolution of Serial Clinical Isolates of Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii
		and C. gattii.
LID	-	10.1128/mBio.00166-17 [doi]
LID	-	e00166-17
AB	-	The pathogenic species of Cryptococcus are a major cause of mortality owing to
		severe infections in immunocompromised as well as immunocompetent individuals.
		"Although antifungal treatment is usually effective, many patients relapse after"
		"treatment, and in such cases, comparative analyses of the genomes of incident and"
		"relapse isolates may reveal evidence of determinative, microevolutionary changes"
		"within the host. Here, we analyzed serial isolates cultured from cerebrospinal"
		fluid specimens of 18 South African patients with recurrent cryptococcal
		meningitis. The time between collection of the incident isolates and collection
		"of the relapse isolates ranged from 124 days to 290 days, and the analyses"
		"revealed that, during this period within the patients, the isolates underwent"
		several genetic and phenotypic changes. Considering the vast genetic diversity of
		"cryptococcal isolates in sub-Saharan Africa, it was not surprising to find that"
		the relapse isolates had acquired different genetic and correlative phenotypic
		"changes. They exhibited various mechanisms for enhancing virulence, such as"
		"growth at 39°C, adaptation to stress, and capsule production; a remarkable"
		amplification of ERG11 at the native and unlinked locus may provide stable
		resistance to fluconazole. Our data provide a deeper understanding of the
		microevolution of Cryptococcus species under pressure from antifungal
		chemotherapy and host immune responses. This investigation clearly suggests a
		"promising strategy to identify novel targets for improved diagnosis, therapy, and"
		prognosis.IMPORTANCE Opportunistic infections caused by species of the pathogenic
		yeast Cryptococcus lead to chronic meningoencephalitis and continue to ravage
		"thousands of patients with HIV/AIDS. Despite receiving antifungal treatment, over"
		"10% of patients develop recurrent disease. In this study, we collected isolates"
		of Cryptococcus from cerebrospinal fluid specimens of 18 patients at the time of
		their diagnosis and when they relapsed several months later. We then sequenced
		and compared the genomic DNAs of each pair of initial and relapse isolates. We
		also tested the isolates for several key properties related to cryptococcal
		virulence as well as for their susceptibility to the antifungal drug fluconazole.
		These analyses revealed that the relapsing isolates manifested multiple genetic
		and chromosomal changes that affected a variety of genes implicated in the
		pathogenicity of Cryptococcus or resistance to fluconazole. This application of
		comparative genomics to serial clinical isolates provides a blueprint for
		identifying the mechanisms whereby pathogenic microbes adapt within patients to
		prolong disease.

TI	-	Cryptococcal meningitis in patients with glioma: a report of two cases.
PG	-	51-3
LID	-	10.1007/s11060-008-9581-x [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: We describe two patients with high-grade glioma
		undergoing treatment with corticosteroids and chemotherapy who presented with
		cryptococcal meningitis and sepsis. This report of two cases highlights the
		importance of examining the efficacy of prophylactic antibiotic and/or antifungal
		regimens in this patient population due to their increased risk of opportunistic
		infections. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 73-year-old man with a history of
		"glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), on dexamethasone and status post radiation therapy"
		"and two cycles of temozolamide, presented with decreased level of consciousness"
		for 24 h and was found to have cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood cultures
		positive for Cryptococcus neoformans. A 33-year-old man with a history of
		"anaplastic astrocytoma, on dexamethasone and status post radiation therapy, four"
		"cycles of temozolomide and two cycles of Lomustine (CCNU), presented with"
		"headache, dizziness and photophobia and was found to have CSF and blood cultures"
		positive for Cryptococcus neoformans. INTERVENTION: Both patients were treated
		with an initial regimen of amphotericin B and flucytosine for a minimum of two
		weeks and switched to fluconazole for 6 months to 1 year of treatment.
		CONCLUSION: Patients with high-grade glioma treated with long-term corticosteroid
		therapy and chemotherapy are at increased risk of developing opportunistic
		infections. The two patients reported here developed cryptococcal meningitis and
		sepsis. Prophylactic regimens with either fluconazole or itraconazole currently
		exist that effectively decrease the incidence of both cryptococcal infections.
		Further investigations into the risk:benefit ratio of primary prophylactic
		therapy in this patient population may prove beneficial.

AB	-	A 55-year-old HIV-infected patient on antiretroviral treatment with
		Ritonavir-boosted Tipranavir as part of HAART developed intracranial haemorrhage
		during the acute phase of cryptococcal meningitis. CT scan and MRI confirmed the
		intracranial haemorrhage. Positive cryptococcal antigen and cultures of both
		blood and CSF confirmed the diagnosis of meningitis caused by Cryptococcus
		"neoformans. There was no evidence of any bleeding disorder, use of aspirin or"
		antiplatelet agents. The patient was treated with Liposomal Amphotericin B for
		cryptococcal meningitis. No special treatment was needed for the intracranial
		"haemorrhage, but Tipranavir was discontinued and replaced by Kaletra and"
		Saquinavir. Intracranial haemorrhage could be related to Tipranavir and
		cryptococcal meningitis was a predisposing factor. Headache stopped 3 days after
		"starting antifungal treatment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first"
		reported case of intracranial haemorrhage related to Tipranavir treatment after
		"the end of the ""RESIST"" studies and the only one related to meningitis."

		cryptococcosis.
PG	-	619-23
LID	-	10.2146/ajhp070203 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: A case of torsades de pointes associated with fluconazole use is
		described. SUMMARY: A 68-year-old woman with a history of hypertension treated
		with 2.5 mg of indapamide for 16 months sought medical treatment after having two
		falls 1 month apart. A computed tomography scan and subsequent magnetic resonance
		imaging of the brain revealed a lesion in the left pons and middle cerebellar
		peduncle. Biopsy of the pontine lesion revealed large yeast forms and
		subsequently revealed Cryptococcus neoformans var. gattii. The patient was
		initially treated with conventional amphotericin B and flucytosine for six weeks.
		"The first week of therapy was complicated by hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and an"
		"episode of atrial fibrillation that was managed with electrolyte replacement,"
		"commencement of metoprolol, and switching from conventional amphotericin B to"
		"amphotericin B lipid complex. After six weeks, liposomal amphotericin was"
		discontinued and high-dose oral fluconazole was initiated. Six days after
		"beginning fluconazole therapy, the patient had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure"
		"and suffered cardiopulmonary arrest. Postresuscitation, an electrocardiogram"
		demonstrated a corrected Q-T interval of 556 msec. Recurrent episodes of torsades
		de pointes were also recorded postarrest. Fluconazole was discontinued at this
		"time, and liposomal amphotericin B was resumed. Neurologic and"
		electroencephalographic assessment conducted 48 hours postarrest revealed that
		"significant neurologic damage had been sustained. Supportive care was withdrawn,"
		and the patient died two days later. A postmortem examination revealed no
		coronary artery disease or hemorrhagic transformation of the pontine
		cryptococcoma. CONCLUSION: Treatment with high-dose fluconazole was the probable
		cause of torsades de pointes in a patient with risk factors for this condition.
		The benefits and risks of using fluconazole should be carefully weighed for
		patients with risk factors for Q-T interval prolongation.

AB	-	We report a rare case of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis in which antifungal
		therapy was monitored by measuring the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of the
		antifungal drugs. A 78-year-old man with diabetes mellitus being treated with
		oral agents. He had no history of human immunodeficiency virus infection. The
		"patient showed abnormal behavior and fever (>38°C) on November 20, 2009, and was"
		admitted for disturbance of consciousness on November 24. CSF examination showed
		"an increased cell count, and a yeast-like fungus, suggesting cryptococcal"
		"meningoencephalitis, was observed by India ink staining. Initial treatment was"
		liposomal amphotericin B (L-AMB) plus flucytosine. Cryptococcus neoformans was
		"isolated by CSF culture on day 2. MIC was 0.25 μg/ml for amphotericin B (AMPH-B),"
		"4 μg/ml for flucytosine, 4 μg/ml for fluconazole (FLCZ), and 0.03 μg/ml for"
		"voriconazole (VRCZ). Despite treatment, his disturbance of consciousness"
		"persisted. The CSF level of AMPH-B was ≤0.05 μg/ml on day 8. Therefore, L-AMB was"
		switched to fosfluconazole. The CSF level of FLCZ was sufficient (22.6 μg/ml) on
		"day 25, but there was a decrease in glucose and the fungus could still be"
		"detected in CSF smears. Consequently, FLCZ was switched to VRCZ. On day 47, CSF"
		"level of VRCZ was 1.97 μg/ml, exceeding its MIC, so treatment was continued. On"
		"day 77, the patient was generally lucid, and CSF smears did not detect any fungi."
		"The patient was then transferred for rehabilitation. On day 84, voriconazole was"
		"discontinued, with no evidence of fungal recurrence."

PG	-	892-8
LID	-	10.1177/0961203313496342 [doi]
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Infections are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in
		patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Invasive fungal infections
		"(IFI) comprise a group of diseases caused by Cryptococcus, Histoplasma,"
		Aspergillus and Candida. Few studies of IFI have been published in patients with
		SLE and associated factors have not been completely defined. OBJECTIVES: The
		objectives of this paper are to estimate the frequency of IFI in admitted
		"patients with SLE in our hospital, to determine the risk factors associated with"
		"IFI in our patients with SLE, and to compare IFI group with a control group (SLE"
		"without IFI). METHODS: The medical charts of patients with IFI (EORTC/MSG, 2008)"
		"and SLE (ACR, 1997) admitted to our hospital from June 2001 until June 2012 were"
		"reviewed. To identify factors associated with IFI, we developed a case-control"
		study (SLE + IFI vs SLE alone) in a one to three ratio adjusted for sex and age
		and hospitalization for other reasons. Comparison was made of demographic
		"characteristics, duration of disease and disease activity previous to IFI"
		"diagnosis, especially three months before fungal infection. We defined severe"
		activity as SLEDAI ≥ 8. Infection by fungi of the genus Candida was considered
		only in its disseminated form. RESULTS: Ten cases of IFI were identified in 208
		patients with SLE admitted between June 2001 and June 2012. We included 40
		"patients with SLE (10 with IFI and 30 controls). Of the SLE-IFI patients, eight"
		"were women and the average age was 27.5 years (range, 19-42 years). Fungal"
		"isolation: eight Cryptococcus neoformans, one Histoplasma capsulatum and one"
		"Candida albicans. Sites affected: five in peripheral blood, five in central"
		"nervous system (CNS), four in skin/soft tissue and one in pleura. Mortality was"
		"40% (p = 0.002), with Cryptococcus neoformans being the most common fungus. The"
		SLE disease activity was severe in 70% of infected patients and no significant
		difference with the control group was found (p = 0.195). We also found no
		"association with leukopenia, lymphopenia, hypocomplementemia,"
		hypogammaglobulinemia or anti-DNA positivity; neither with meprednisone doses
		>20 mg/day or intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy before fungal
		infection. The use of immunosuppressive therapy with azathioprine showed a
		significant association (p = 0.017). Cyclophosphamide (p = 0.100) or
		mycophenolate mofetil (p = 0.256) did not show similar results. CONCLUSION: The
		frequency of IFI in hospitalized SLE patients in our hospital was 4.8%.
		Cryptococcus neoformans was the most common etiologic agent and was primarily
		responsible for the deaths in this cohort. These data are consistent with
		publications in East Asia rather than North America where Candida spp. is more
		"common. Unlike other publications, previous immunosuppression with azathioprine"
		was the only risk factor associated with the development of the infection.
		Invasive fungal infection should be suspected in hospitalized patients with SLE
		and immunosuppression with CNS or atypical cutaneous manifestation of SLE in
		order to start appropriate treatment early and obtain better outcome.

AB	-	Despite the medical advances and interventions to improve the quality of life of
		"those in intensive care, people with cancer or severely immunocompromised or"
		"other susceptible hosts, invasive fungal diseases (IFD) remain severe and"
		"underappreciated causes of illness and death worldwide. Therefore, IFD continue"
		to be a public health threat and a major hindrance to the success of otherwise
		"life-saving treatments and procedures. Globally, hundreds of thousands of people"
		"are affected every year with Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus,"
		"Cryptococcus neoformans, Pneumocystis jirovecii, endemic dimorphic fungi and"
		"Mucormycetes, the most common fungal species causing invasive diseases in humans."
		These infections result in morbidity and mortality rates that are unacceptable
		and represent a considerable socioeconomic burden. Raising the general awareness
		"of the significance and impact of IFD in human health, in both the hospital and"
		"the community, is hence critical to understand the scale of the problem and to"
		raise interest to help fighting these devastating diseases.

PG	-	320-3
LID	-	10.3109/13693786.2010.516457 [doi]
AB	-	This study presents a 7-year retrospective analysis of seasonal variations in the
		prevalence of Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii and Cryptococcus gattii in
		decayed wood inside trunk hollows of 518 trees belonging to 20 species in
		"north-western India during 2000-2007. Of the 1,439 wood samples investigated, 406"
		(28.2%) were found to be positive for the Cryptococcus neoformans species complex
		which included 247 samples from which C. neoformans var. grubii was recovered and
		171 which yielded C. gattii. While both of the pathogens were isolated through
		"all the seasons, the overall prevalence of C. neoformans var. grubii was"
		"significantly higher (17.2%) than that of C. gattii serotype B (11.9%, P <"
		"0.0001), indicating that decayed wood was as good, if not better, a natural"
		habitat of C. neoformans var. grubii as that of C. gattii. The highest recovery
		"of both yeasts was in the autumn, followed by that in the summer. For C. gattii,"
		the lowest prevalence occurred during the winter and for C. neoformans var.
		grubii during the rainy season. The low prevalence of C. gattii during winter is
		"similar to that reported from Bogota, Colombia, where C. gattii had a low"
		population density in bark samples but it was not found in decayed wood of trunk
		hollows investigated during the period of January and February. The prevalence of
		C. neoformans var. grubii was significantly lower in the rainy season than in the
		other portions of the year. This finding is similar to the reported low isolation
		frequency (4%) of C. neoformans var. grubii from chicken feces in the rainy
		season in northern Thailand. Further investigations are warranted to determine
		the clinical significance of seasonal variations in the prevalence of C.
		neoformans var. grubii and C. gattii in decayed trunk wood of various trees in
		climatically divergent regions of India.

LID	-	10.1016/S0929-6646(09)60041-3 [doi]
AB	-	"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: To study the clinical features, diagnostic processes, timing"
		of antibiotic administration and outcomes of patients with severe
		"community-acquired septic meningitis at an emergency department (ED), who"
		required intensive care unit (ICU) admission. METHODS: From January 1993 to
		"December 2005, the medical records of patients admitted to the ICU with a"
		diagnosis of community-acquired septic meningitis were reviewed. The clinical
		"characteristics, including causative pathogens, treatment course, and outcomes"
		"were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 40 patients were included, with"
		an overall in-hospital mortality rate of 77.5%. The most common pathogen was
		"Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=20, 50%), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=6,"
		"15%), and Cryptococcus neoformans (n=5, 12.5%). There was a mean duration of 8.9"
		hours between ED arrival and initiation of antibiotic therapy. Effective
		antibiotics were administered for a mean period of 23.8 hours after arrival. Time
		delay from ED arrival to ICU admission was correlated with time delay of
		"effective antibiotics administration, head computed tomography, and cerebrospinal"
		"fluid study (r=0.32, 0.47, and 0.53, respectively; p=0.05, 0.006, and 0.001,"
		respectively). Earlier ICU admission was demonstrated in survivors as compared
		"with those who died (11.1 vs. 38.0 hours, p=0.01). CONCLUSION: Severe septic"
		meningitis remains a disease with high mortality and morbidity. Expeditious
		diagnostic processes with early appropriate antibiotic treatment and ICU
		admission at the ED are important in improving the quality of care and patient
		outcome.

PG	-	409-17
AB	-	"Clinical isolates of Cryptococcus neoformans, whole blood, cerebrospinal fluid,"
		bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with positive cryptococcal antigen
		"latex-agglutination test, and spiked clinical material from healthy individuals,"
		were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers amplifying C.
		neoformans URA5 gene sequences. To test compatibility of different DNA extraction
		"protocols with the PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assay, a"
		"commercial DNA extraction kit (XTRAX; Gull Laboratories, UT, USA) was used"
		alongside with the hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method on spiked
		biological fluids. Both methods extracted DNA from spiked clinical samples
		containing C. neoformans (8 +/- 2 cells ml(-1)) and generated amplification
		products suitable for restriction enzyme analysis. Alu I digestion differentiated
		the two varieties of C. neoformans. Three distinct RFLP patterns were obtained
		"upon restriction with MspI corresponding to serotypes A, AD and B, C and D. URA5"
		"PCR followed by RFLP analysis, coupled with a sensitive in-house or commercially"
		"available DNA extraction method from clinical samples, could be successfully"
		incorporated into rapid routine diagnostic strategies. It could also provide an
		expeditious tool for epidemiology-based population genetics studies.

AB	-	This study presents a two-year retrospective analysis of the work done during
		2003-2005 on the distribution population density and isolation frequency of
		Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii and Cryptococcus gattii recovered from
		"different parts of Eucalyptus tree spp., at Jabalpur Madhya Pradesh, Central"
		"India. Of the 1000 samples collected from bark, flowers, fruits, buds and leaves"
		"of Eucalyptus trees E. terreticornis and E. camaldulensis, 32 (3.2%) were found"
		to be positive for C.n var. grubii and 28 (2.8%) for C. gattii respectively.
		"While both the pathogens were isolated through all the seasons, no significant"
		difference was found in prevalence of the two species (P>0.05) from different
		Eucalyptus tree samples. For C. neoformans var. grubii the highest isolation
		"frequency of the pathogen was in spring followed by autumn, summer, winter and"
		"rainy season. For C. gattii, highest isolation frequency of the pathogen was in"
		"summer, followed by autumn, spring, winter and rainy season. Significant"
		difference was seen in the isolation frequency of C. neoformans var. grubii and
		"C. gattii during autumn and rainy season (P<0.01), spring and rainy season"
		(P<0.001) and summer and rainy season (P<0.001). Population density and isolation
		frequency of the both pathogens were significantly lower in rainy season. Bark of
		the Eucalyptus tree yielded the highest frequency of C. neoformans var. grubii
		"followed by flower, fruits, buds and debris. Trees located in the densely"
		populated area of the city yielded highest frequency of the pathogens followed by
		trees located in sparsely populated area on the outskirt of the city and areas
		near the river Narmada. Further comprehensive study is suggested to assess the
		overall impact of seasonal prevalence in the isolation frequency and population
		density of both the pathogens and their clinical significance across climatically
		divergent region of India.

PG	-	100-5
AB	-	An indirect immunoperoxidase method capable of identifying an opportunistic
		"fungus, Trichosporon beigelii, in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue has"
		been developed. The authors studied autopsy materials from 19 patients with
		"various fungal infections, including 3 patients with disseminated T. beigelii"
		"infection, 8 patients with localized or systemic candidiasis, 4 patients with"
		"invasive aspergillosis, 2 patients with pulmonary mucormycosis, and 2 patients"
		with systemic cryptococcosis. T. beigelii could be successfully visualized in
		tissue sections from all three patients with this infection and a patient with
		systemic candidiasis who was found to have concomitant infection by T. beigelii.
		"The capsule of Cryptococcus neoformans was also stained, indicating the presence"
		of cross-reactive antigen between T. beigelii and C. neoformans. C.
		neoformans-absorbed antiserum was reactive with T. beigelii but not with other
		"fungi, including C. neoformans."

LID	-	10.1016/j.riam.2010.12.002 [doi]
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Fungal infections have increased in critical care patients, causing"
		high morbidity and mortality. AIMS: Describe the frequency and responsible fungal
		species involved in bloodstream fungal infection from 2001 to 2007 in tertiary
		care level hospitals belonging to a surveillance network in Colombian cities.
		METHODS: Data were collected from a microbiology surveillance network based on 27
		hospital laboratories in five Colombian cities. Data were entered into a Whonet®
		version 5.4 database. Fungemia data were analyzed according to location
		(Intensive care unit -ICU- vs. non-ICU services). Frequency over time was also
		described. RESULTS: Fungal infections corresponded to 4.1% of all bloodstream
		infections. Candidemia represented 3.7% and 5.2% of all isolates in non-ICU and
		"ICU services, respectively. Over 99% of the isolates were yeasts, and Candida"
		"albicans was the most frequently isolated organism in and out of the ICU, showing"
		"a decreasing trend in the last few years. In the adult ICU and non-ICU services,"
		"the second organism most frequently isolated was C. tropicalis, while C."
		"parapsilopsis was the most frequent in the pediatric and neonatal ICU, also"
		showing an overall decreasing trend. Cryptococcus neoformans was the fourth
		"mycotic organism most frequently identified. CONCLUSIONS: In Colombia,"
		epidemiology of fungal infections seems to be changing. C. albicans is the
		"principal agent causing bloodstream fungal infection, but an increase of"
		non-albicans species has been observed as well as high frequency of C.
		neoformans.

LID	-	e25712
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass
		spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) for yeast identification is limited by the
		requirement for protein extraction and for robust reference spectra across yeast
		species in databases. We evaluated its ability to identify a range of yeasts in
		comparison with phenotypic methods. METHODS: MALDI-TOF MS was performed on 30
		reference and 167 clinical isolates followed by prospective examination of 67
		clinical strains in parallel with biochemical testing (total n = 264).
		Discordant/unreliable identifications were resolved by sequencing of the internal
		transcribed spacer region of the rRNA gene cluster. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Twenty
		"(67%; 16 species), and 24 (80%) of 30 reference strains were identified to"
		"species, (spectral score ≥2.0) and genus (score ≥1.70)-level, respectively. Of"
		"clinical isolates, 140/167 (84%) strains were correctly identified with scores of"
		"≥2.0 and 160/167 (96%) with scores of ≥1.70; amongst Candida spp. (n = 148),"
		"correct species assignment at scores of ≥2.0, and ≥1.70 was obtained for 86% and"
		"96% isolates, respectively (vs. 76.4% by biochemical methods). Prospectively,"
		"species-level identification was achieved for 79% of isolates, whilst 91% and 94%"
		"of strains yielded scores of ≥1.90 and ≥1.70, respectively (100% isolates"
		identified by biochemical methods). All test scores of 1.70-1.90 provided correct
		"species assignment despite being identified to ""genus-level"". MALDI-TOF MS"
		"identified uncommon Candida spp., differentiated Candida parapsilosis from C."
		"orthopsilosis and C. metapsilosis and distinguished between C. glabrata, C."
		nivariensis and C. bracarensis. Yeasts with scores of <1.70 were rare species
		such as C. nivariensis (3/10 strains) and C. bracarensis (n = 1) but included
		4/12 Cryptococcus neoformans. There were no misidentifications. Four novel
		species-specific spectra were obtained. Protein extraction was essential for
		"reliable results. CONCLUSIONS: MALDI-TOF MS enabled rapid, reliable"
		identification of clinically-important yeasts. The addition of spectra to
		databases and reduction in identification scores required for species-level
		identification may improve its utility.

AB	-	Invasive yeast infections cause significant morbidity and mortality. Surveillance
		for the infection is necessary to detect trends in species distribution and
		antifungal resistance. We performed this retrospective study of yeast infection
		"at Jinling Hospital, Nanjing in China, from year of 2010 to 2012. A total of 341"
		yeast isolates were obtained from patients with invasive infections in the
		"period. Among these isolates, Candida spp. comprised of the highest percentage of"
		"yeast strains (91.8 %), followed by Cryptococcus neoformans (5.9 %) and other"
		non-Candida yeast strains (2.3 %). Bloodstream isolates made up 41.3 % of yeast
		"strains and the isolates from CVC made up 17.3 %. Among Candida spp., C. albicans"
		was the most common species identified from non-blood clinical specimens (42.9
		"%), but appeared in only 20.8 % of blood isolates (P < 0.001). C. tropicalis was"
		the most prevalent Candida species in the blood samples (28.5 %). Candida spp.
		"was mainly isolated from specimens of the ICU patients, while C. neoformans was"
		mainly isolated from specimens in medical wards. Resistance to FLC occurred in
		"3.7 % of C. albicans, 9.9 % of C. tropicalis, 74.0 % of C. glabrata, and 4.4 % of"
		"C. parapsilosis. Most (>92 %) isolates of C. albicans, C. tropicalis, C."
		"parapsilosis, and C. neoformans strains were susceptible to VRC; However, 26.7 %"
		of isolates of C. glabrata were VRC resistant.

		fungal pathogens isolated from cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) of in-patients with
		meningitis at Muhimbili Medical Centre (MMC) in Dar es Salaam and to ascertain
		the laboratory results (based on microscopy and culture) using the latex
		agglutination technique. DESIGN: A retrospective study based on laboratory
		records of CSF samples investigated between November 1999 and June 2000 and a
		cross-sectional study involving investigation of 60 freshly collected CSF samples
		by conventional (microscopy and culture) and antigen detection by latex

		"Salaam, Tanzania. INVESTIGATIONS: Information from laboratory records,"
		"bacteriological examination of CSF by microscopy, culture and agglutination"
		"techniques. RESULTS: According to records, a total of 1144 CSF samples were"
		"investigated between November 1999 and June 2000, of which two hundred and twenty"
		two specimens (19.4%) had a positive bacterial or fungal culture. Fifty five of

		"were Streptococcus pneumoniae, 12(21.8%) were Cryptococcus neoformans, and nine"
		(16.4%) were Haemophilus influenzae type b. The remaining 14 (25%) isolates
		"included three group B streptococci, three Klebsiella spp, two E. coli, two"
		"Staphylococcus aureus, two Pseudomonas spp, one Moraxella and one Salmonella"
		group B. For adults a total of 167 positive cultures were reported and 163
		"(97.6%) of the isolates were Cryptococcus neoformans, two (1.2%) were Pseudomonas"
		spp. and two were S. aureus. There was good agreement between conventional
		microscopy and culture with the latex agglutination technique in the
		"identification of CSF pathogens. CONCLUSION: In children, S. pneumonia, and"
		bacteria in general constituted the majority of isolates. Adult cases of
		"meningitis were almost exclusively due to C. neoformans. Overall, C. neoformans"
		appears to be the most common isolate among meningitis cases. Based on LAT
		"results, our routine diagnostic methods seem to be adequate in the identification"
		of the common CSF pathogens.

AB	-	Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) is now widely used in therapy of multiple
		"diseases in children, by removing the plasma with pathogenic agents from"
		"patients. However, adverse reactions may limit its application.A retrospective"
		cohort study of 435 hospitalized children treated with 1201 plasma exchange
		procedures between January 2013 and July 2018 were enrolled.Complications
		occurred in 152 procedures (12.7%); 90 procedures (7.5%) had ≥2 complications. No
		"death occurred. The most common complications were pruritus and urticaria (7%),"
		followed by hypertension (1.92%) and hypotension (1.17%). One child had an
		"outbreak of disseminated cryptococcosis neoformans infection, another child"
		"developed anaphylactic shock, and 3 children presented toxic epidermal necrolysis"
		after TPE. The incidence of pruritus and urticaria was higher in children of the
		6∼15 year group (P < .05) compared with other age groups. There was no
		significant difference in the incidence of hypertension and hypotension in
		"children at different ages and weights (P > .05). Compared with other diseases,"
		anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (anti-NMDA) receptor encephalitis led to a higher
		incidence of complications in children (P < .05).The results suggest that TPE is
		"a relatively safe procedure for children, and most of the complications are mild."
		"The most common complication is pruritus and urticaria. However, serious"
		complications such as toxic epidermal necrolysis and infection should still be
		taken seriously.

PG	-	205-10
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To determine whether cytopathic changes due to cytomegalovirus (CMV)
		in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients are prognostic. STUDY DESIGN:
		Three-month mortality was compared in three groups: 36 patients with positive CMV
		"cytology, 38 with negative cytology but culture positive, and 40 with no evidence"
		"of CMV. Bronchoalveolar lavage, Papanicolaou-stained cytocentrifuge smears were"
		"quantitated using an average of two slides per case. Additionally, coinfection"
		with Pneumocystis carinii and Cryptococcus neoformans was evaluated. RESULTS:
		There was a statistically significant increase in mortality at three months in
		CMV cytology-positive patients versus those with no evidence of CMV. Ten patients
		"had quantitative CMV counts of less than 2, with a median survival of 3.0 months"
		"(range, 0.3-13.0); seven patients had counts of 2 or 3, with a median survival of"
		"5.5 months (0.4-13.5); and 11 patients had CMV counts greater than 3, with a"
		median survival of 7.2 months (0.3-14.0). There was no significant difference
		between the groups. Coinfection was P Carinii (12) or C neoformans (2) showed no
		difference from patients without coinfection (chi2 = 0.81). CONCLUSION: The
		"presence of CMV cytopathic changes is associated with poorer survival, but an"
		increased number of CMV-infected cells is not related to higher mortality.

		"Canada). DESIGN: Retrospective study. ANIMALS: 1 pink-fronted cockatoo, 2"
		"ferrets, 20 cats, and 15 dogs. PROCEDURE: A presumptive diagnosis of"
		"cryptococcosis was made on the basis of serologic, histopathologic, or cytologic"
		"findings, and a definitive diagnosis was made on the basis of culture or"
		immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: No breed or sex predilections were
		"detected in affected dogs or cats. Eleven cats had neurologic signs, 7 had skin"
		"lesions, and 5 had respiratory tract signs. None of 17 cats tested serologically"
		for FeLV yielded positive results; 1 of 17 cats yielded positive results for FIV
		"(western blot). Nine of 15 dogs had neurologic signs, 2 had periorbital"
		"swellings, and only 3 had respiratory tract signs initially. Microbiologic"
		culture in 15 cases yielded 2 isolates of Cryptococcus neoformans var grubii
		(serotype A) and 13 isolates of C. neoformans var gattii (serotype B); all
		organisms were susceptible to amphotericin B and ketoconazole. Serologic testing
		had sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 98%. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL
		RELEVANCE: Serologic titers were beneficial in identifying infection in animals
		"with nonspecific signs, but routine serum biochemical or hematologic parameters"
		were of little value in diagnosis. Most animals had nonspecific CNS signs and
		represented a diagnostic challenge. Animals that travel to or live in this region
		and have nonspecific malaise or unusual neurologic signs should be evaluated for
		cryptococcosis.

PG	-	31-4
AB	-	To evaluate the role of fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) in diagnosis of
		"fungal infections, a retrospective analysis of 26 cases of fungal infection is"
		described. The spectrum of various fungi encountered on cytologic microscopy of
		"aspirated material and fungal culture was as follows: Aspergillus sp (16 cases),"
		"Cryptococcus neoformans (six cases), Mucorales (one case), Candida sp (one case),"
		"Phialophora parasiticus (one case), Sporothrix schenkii and Cladosporium sp (the"
		"last two isolated from a single case). In majority (71%) of cases, fungal"
		infection was not clinically suspected but was picked up on cytologic material in
		all the cases. An accurate diagnosis based on morphology could be made in 21
		"cases (80%). Predisposing factor was found in three patients, two of them had"
		diabetes mellitus and one was on immunosuppression. HIV serology was negative in
		seven cases tested. Commonest tissue reaction (75%) was foreign body giant cells
		with foamy macrophages and variable amount of necrosis. Although FNAB is helpful
		"in the rapid diagnosis of fungal infections, culture is essential for more"
		accurate identification.

TI	-	Invasive Cryptococcal Meningitis Presenting as a Skull Base Mass in An
		Immunocompetent Host: A Case Report.
PG	-	e31-e35
LID	-	10.1055/s-0039-1687886 [doi]
AB	-	Introduction  Encephalitis due to Cryptococcus neoformans has been seen almost
		"exclusively in patients with severe compromise of their immune systems, such as"
		acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Fungal sinusitis with frank invasion
		through the cranial base and subsequent seeding of the central nervous system is
		"rare, but should be considered in the differential of patients presenting with"
		meningitis and sinus/skull base lesions even without obvious immune compromise.
		Improvements in diagnostic testing has increased the ability to correctly
		identify and new antimicrobials have allowed a condition that once carried a high
		morbidity and mortality to be managed with better outcomes. We present our
		treatment algorithm for successful management of an immunocompetent patient with
		extensive fungal encephalitis due to erosion through the skull base. Case
		Description  The patient is a 59-year-old male presenting unresponsive with
		sphenoid mass erosive of the skull base and symptoms of meningitis and
		encephalitis due to C. neoformans . Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at
		"presentation demonstrated extensive diencephalic invasion, and a sphenoid mass"
		with erosion of the skull base. Lumbar puncture (LP) confirmed elevated opening
		"pressure of 45 cm H2O, and cultures confirmed infection with C. neoformans . He"
		underwent operative sinonasal debridement followed by placement of an external
		ventricular drain for management of hydrocephalus. He was treated aggressively
		with a combination of both intravenous (IV) amphotericin B daily and intrathecal
		amphotericin B via the ventriculostomy thrice weekly. By the 2nd week of
		"treatment, patient regained consciousness. After 4 weeks of therapy,"
		"cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures turned negative, and the external ventricular"
		drain (EVD) was converted to a ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) to manage chronic
		postinfectious hydrocephalus. We also placed a contralateral Ommaya reservoir to
		permit continued weekly intrathecal amphotericin B without violation of the shunt
		"valve. With each instillation, the shunt was set to its highest setting to"
		"minimize CSF egress for 6 hours then reset to its ""drainage"" setting. After an"
		"additional 6 weeks of outpatient therapy, intrathecal therapy was discontinued."
		"We continued CSF surveillance via Ommaya sampling monthly. At 9-month follow-up,"
		he has remained clinically stable without evidence of recurrent infection. He has
		"residual mild cognitive deficits, but is living semiindependently with his"
		"brother. Conclusions  Fungal sinusitis is uncommon, especially in those without"
		significantly compromised immune systems. Invasive fungal meningitis resulting in
		meningitis and encephalitis is even rarer. The condition carries high morbidity
		and mortality that can only be mitigated with a multidisciplinary effort by
		"neurosurgery, otolaryngology, and infectious disease specialists. While there are"
		"no clear treatment guidelines, we present an approach that may permit longer term"
		independent survival.

		from Southern China: Clinical features and associated factors.
PG	-	731-744
LID	-	10.1111/jdi.13183 [doi]
AB	-	AIMS/INTRODUCTION: A retrospective study was carried out to investigate the
		clinical characteristics and associated factors for invasive fungal disease in
		patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Demographic and
		clinical data were recorded. Associated factors were analyzed by logistic
		regression analysis. RESULTS: Invasive fungal disease was diagnosed in 120
		"patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (prevalence, 0.4%). Yeast infection"
		"(56/120, 46.7%), including candidiasis (31/56, 55.4%) and cryptococcosis (25/56,"
		"44.6%), was the most common. The urinary tract was mainly involved in candidiasis"
		"(12/31, 38.7%). More than half of the cryptococcosis (16/25, 64.0%) presented as"
		"pneumonia. Mold infection accounted for 40.8% of the cases, and predominantly"
		"involved the lung (34/49, 69.4%). A total of 15 (12.5%) patients had mixed fungal"
		"infection. Candida albicans (24/111, 21.6%), Cryptococcus neoformans (19/111,"
		"17.1%) and Aspergillus fumigatus (14/111, 12.6%) were the leading agents."
		"Co-infection occurred in 58 (48.3%) patients, mainly presenting as pneumonia"
		caused by Gram-negative bacteria. The inpatient mortality rate of invasive fungal
		disease was 23.3% (28/120). Glycated hemoglobin levels were higher in
		"non-survivors than survivors (8.8 ± 2.5 vs 7.7 ± 2.1%, P = 0.02). Anemia"
		"(adjusted odds ratio, 3.50, 95% confidence interval 1.95-6.27, P < 0.001),"
		"hypoalbuminemia (adjusted odds ratio, 5.42, 95% confidence interval 3.14-9.36,"
		"P < 0.001) and elevated serum creatinine (adjusted odds ratio, 2.08, 95%"
		"confidence interval 1.07-4.04, P = 0.03) were associated with invasive fungal"
		disease in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. CONCLUSIONS: Invasive fungal
		disease is a life-threatening complication in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients.
		"C. a albicans, C. neoformans, and A. fumigatus are the leading agents. Prolonged"
		hyperglycemia results in unfavorable outcomes. Correction of anemia and
		hypoalbuminemia might improve prognosis.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to determine the incidence, etiology,"
		"clinical characteristics, and outcomes of renal transplant recipients diagnosed"
		and treated for central nervous system (CNS) infection at our institution.
		METHODS: We analyzed data from all renal transplant recipients between January
		2007 and December 2019 that were diagnosed and treated for CNS infections at our
		"institution. RESULTS: Of 1374 patients who received renal allografts, 13 were"
		"diagnosed with CNS infections (9 males), with a mean age of 53.5 years. Patients"
		were diagnosed with CNS infections between 2 months and 11 years after the
		"transplantation. Causative agents included JC virus, Streptococcus pneumoniae,"
		"Cryptococcus neoformans, Herpes zoster virus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis,"
		"Listeria monocytogenes, and West Nile virus. One patient had concomitant Nocardia"
		and Neisseria infection. Immunosuppression was reduced in all patients. The
		patient with JC encephalitis and the patient with concomitant Neisseria and
		Nocardia meningitis died. One patient was returned to dialysis. Other patients
		recovered with differing levels of neurologic sequelae. CONCLUSION: Central
		"nervous system infections in renal transplant recipients are rare. However, they"
		are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. A high level of
		awareness is needed: neurological symptoms may be nonspecific and caused by
		"non-infectious conditions related to the underlying disease, or side-effects of"
		immunosuppressive drugs.

TI	-	Gastroduodenal Cryptococcus in an AIDS Patient Presenting With Melena.
PG	-	26-28
AB	-	Gastrointestinal cryptococcosis is extremely rare with only a few case reports
		found in the literature and involvement primarily identified post-mortem. This is
		a case of 54-year-old man with a 20-year history of poorly controlled human
		immunodeficiency virus presented with constitutional symptoms along with melena.
		Diagnostic work up with esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed 4 irregular ulcers in
		"the stomach notable for red-pigmented lesions within the ulcers, erythematous"
		mucosa in the antrum and patchy friable mucosa in the duodenum. H&E staining and
		Mucicarmine staining showed findings consistent with C. neoformans. Blood culture
		and cerebrospinal fluid studies also revealed C. neoformans. Cryptococcus
		neoformans is an AIDS defining illness that most commonly presents as
		meningoencephalitis and pneumonitis. Key management principles includes:
		induction of antifungal therapy followed by consolidation and maintenance;
		management of elevated intracranial pressure and immune reconstitution
		"inflammatory syndrome. Although the organism can infect nearly all organs,"
		gastrointestinal involvement is rarely described. Our case highlights the fact
		that gastrointestinal C. neoformans infection can be associated with upper
		gastrointestinal symptoms and may be the initial presentation of disseminated
		cryptococcosis.

		transplant recipients: a multicenter retrospective study. Italian Study Group of
		Fungal Infections in Thoracic Organ Transplant Recipients.
PG	-	112-6
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Fungal infections (FI) after solid organ transplantation (Tx) remain
		a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Aspergillus and Candida account for
		more than 80% of FI. METHODS: One thousand nine hundred and sixty-three patients
		"undergoing thoracic organ Tx [1,852 heart and 111 lung (35 heart-lung Tx, 30"
		"double-lung Tx, 46 single-lung Tx)] in 12 Italian Centers between November 1985"
		and January 1997 were included in the study. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients (41
		heart Tx - 2.2%; 9 heart-lung Tx - 25.7%; 1 single-lung Tx - 2.2%) developed 53
		invasive FI at a median of 58 days (range 6-2479) after Tx. Aspergillosis was the
		most frequent FI in our series accounting for 64.1% (34/53) of all FI [A
		"fumigatus, n=29 (85.3%); A nidulans, n=2 (5.9%); A niger, n=2 (5.9%); A terreus,"
		"n=1 (2.9%)]; 30 (88.2%) patients developed invasive lung aspergillosis, 2 (5.9%)"
		"a tracheobronchitis, 1 (2.9%) a skin infection, and 1 (2.9%) a sternal wound"
		"infection. Twelve patients (22.6%) developed candidiasis [C albicans, n=8"
		"(66.6%); C krusei, n=1 (8.3%); C glabrata, n=1 (8.3%); C parapsilosis, n=1"
		"(8.3%); C sake, n=1 (8.3%)]. There were seven episodes (58.3%) of candidemia, two"
		"(16.7%) esophagitis, two (16.7%) gastritis, and one (8.3%) tracheobronchitis."
		Mortality was 29.4% for patients developing aspergillosis and 33.3% for those
		"experiencing candidiasis. Furthermore, four patients developed the following: one"
		"C neoformans meningitis, one Sporothrix cyanescens pneumonia, one Rhizopus spp."
		"tracheobronchitis, and one Trichosporon beigelii disseminated infection. Three"
		additional patients were diagnosed affected by deep mould infection by histology
		"alone. CONCLUSIONS: Deep-seated FI were relatively rare in our series, although"
		their mortality rate is still very high.

TI	-	Association of fungal infection and increased mortality in liver transplant
		recipients.
PG	-	426-30
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive fungal infection is associated with increased morbidity and
		mortality following orthotopic liver transplantation (OLTx). Understanding the
		risk factors associated with fungal infection may facilitate identification of
		high-risk patients and guide appropriate initiation of antifungal therapy.
		OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of fungal
		"infections, identify the most common fungal pathogens, and determine the risk"
		factors associated with fungal infections and mortality in OLTx recipients.
		METHODS: Medical records from 96 consecutive OLTx in 90 American veterans (88
		"males, 2 females; mean age 48 years, range 32 to 67) performed from January 1994"
		to December 1997 were retrospectively reviewed for fungal infection in the first
		120 days after transplantation. Infection was defined by positive cultures from
		"either blood, urine (<105 CFU/mL), cerebrospinal or peritoneal fluid, and/or deep"
		tissue specimens. Superficial fungal infection and asymptomatic colonization were
		"excluded from study. All patients received cyclosporine, azathioprine, and"
		prednisone as maintenance immunosuppressive therapy. Fungal prophylaxis consisted
		"of oral clotrimazole (10 mg) troches, five times per day during the study period."
		RESULTS: Thirty-five patients (38%) had documented infection with one or more
		"fungal pathogens, including Candida albicans (25 of 35; 71%), C torulopsis (7 of"
		"35; 20%), C tropicalis (2 of 35; 6%), non-C albicans (2 of 35; 6%), Aspergillus"
		"fumigatus (4 of 35; 11%), and Cryptococcus neoformans (1 of 35; 3%). The crude"
		"survival for cases with or without fungal infection was 68% and 87%, respectively"
		(P <0.0001). The median intensive care unit stay and overall duration of
		hospitalization were significantly longer for patients with fungal infection (P
		<0.01). The mean time interval from transplantation to the development of fungal
		infection was 15 days (range 4 to 77) with a mean survival time from fungal
		infection to death of 21 days (range 3 to 64). Fungal infections occurred
		significantly more often in patients with renal insufficiency (serum creatinine

		"organisms isolated from CSF included: Cryptococcous neoformans (8 patients),"
		"Coccidioides immitis (3 patients), and Aspergillus versicolor (1 patient)."
		Histopathology of seven biopsy cases revealed groups of pigmented golden-brown
		"fungal forms in three cases; three cases showed septate fungi, two of which had"

		monophora (1 patient) and Scedosporium apiospermum (2 patients). Five of the
		seven fungal organisms isolated from tissue biopsies were dematiaceous fungi.
		"Twelve patients died after a period of a few weeks to months, two were lost to"

		infections in our cohort were more common in patients post-transplant and with
		"hematologic malignancies. In our series, rare dematiaceous fungi are emerging"
		agents for cerebral mycosis. The outcome of CNS fungal infections is poor despite

LID	-	10.1099/jmmcr.0.003608-0 [doi]
LID	-	e003608
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Cryptococcus neoformans is an encapsulated budding yeast that is a
		"common cause of opportunistic infections, rarely giving rise to cellulitis,"
		vasculitis or fasciitis. Necrotizing fasciitis caused by C. neoformans is a rare
		but serious problem in post-transplant immunosuppression. CASE PRESENTATION: We
		report a case of cryptococcal necrotizing fasciitis in the left adductor longus
		of a patient on immunosuppressive therapy. The patient's medical history was
		significant for orthotopic heart transplant secondary to cardiac and systemic
		amyloidosis (AL type) with subsequent cardiac biopsy demonstrating mild rejection
		(grade 1R). A thigh muscle biopsy demonstrated numerous encapsulated fungi in the
		fascia and no evidence of myositis. Cryptococcal antigen was subsequently
		identified in the patient's serum and cerebrospinal fluid. The patient progressed
		"to involvement of the central nervous system, left biceps femoris and skin of the"
		left lower leg by fluconazole-resistant C. neoformans. CONCLUSION: This case
		illustrates a rare initial presentation of disseminated fluconazole-resistant C.
		neoformans as an isolated necrotizing fasciitis of the thigh. Necrotizing fungal
		fasciitis should be considered in immunosuppressed patients with clinical
		findings of either myositis or cellulitis of a lower extremity.

TI	-	Intravitreal Voriconazole for the Treatment of Cryptococcus neoformans Endogenous
		Endophthalmitis.
PG	-	319-322
LID	-	10.31486/toj.19.0043 [doi]
AB	-	Background: Cryptococcus neoformans is an encapsulated yeast that can cause
		"fungemia and, in rare instances, lead to endogenous fungal endophthalmitis. No"
		standard of care has been established to treat fungal endophthalmitis when
		systemic antifungal treatment fails to resolve the intraocular infection.
		Intravitreal voriconazole has been used for the treatment of fungal
		"endophthalmitis caused by a broad range of fungal pathogens, and a limited number"
		of reports have shown the efficacy of using intravitreal voriconazole for C
		neoformans endophthalmitis. We report a case of endogenous fungal endophthalmitis
		caused by C neoformans that was responsive to intravitreal voriconazole. Case
		Report: A previously healthy 57-year-old male diagnosed with primary
		neuroendocrine lung tumor developed endogenous endophthalmitis from C neoformans.
		The endophthalmitis was resistant to intravenous amphotericin B treatment but was
		responsive to intravenous fluconazole in one eye and was apparently more
		responsive to intravitreal voriconazole in the other eye. Conclusion:
		Intravitreal voriconazole should be considered for the treatment of cryptococcal
		endophthalmitis.

AB	-	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cryptococcosis is a known opportunistic infection.
		Thymomas are known to cause immune dysregulation. We describe an atypical case of
		cutaneous cryptococcosis in a patient with acquired T cell immunodeficiency that
		has been found to be secondary to a type B3 thymoma with progression to
		carcinoma. CASE REPORT: A 63-year-old male presented with a chronic skin lesion
		confirmed as Cryptococcus neoformans on biopsy and an incidental mediastinal mass
		found during infectious work-up for the notable cluster of differentiation 4
		(CD4)+ lymphopenia. This led to the diagnosis of a type B3 thymoma requiring
		resection. The cryptococcal lesion was treated successfully with azole therapy.
		CONCLUSION: C. neoformans is an opportunistic infection rarely associated with
		isolated T cell immunodeficiency due to thymomas. A multidisciplinary approach
		and understanding of the pathogenicity of cryptococcus and the immunological
		effect of thymic dysfunction are paramount to diagnosis and treatment.

		"system, and dermatological infections, especially in an immunocompromised"
		"patient. This is a case report of a patient, who was presumptively"
		immunocompetent that developed isolated cryptococcemia while being treated for
		coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) infection. We report a case of a 59-year-old
		"Hispanic man with a past medical history of hypertension, well-controlled"
		"diabetes mellitus, and class I obesity who was admitted for severe acute"
		respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) and subsequently was
		diagnosed with cryptococcal fungemia. The patient received 21 days of
		"dexamethasone and during this period, blood and fungal cultures grew C."
		"neoformans. The patient was alert and oriented, did not have focal neurological"
		"deficits or meningeal irritation signs; nonetheless, a lumbar puncture was"
		"attempted, but not successful. He was treated with intravenous amphotericin B for"
		"two weeks, followed by oral fluconazole for six weeks. Repeat blood cultures"
		"demonstrated clearance and he improved clinically. In conclusion, this case"
		report describes the possibility of an association between the use of
		dexamethasone in COVID-19 patients and the development of cryptococcal fungemia.
		"In the review of literature, rare case reports worldwide have discussed this"
		topic. This is clinically challenging as the emergence of opportunistic
		infections in these debilitated hosts can be detrimental. Maintaining a high
		clinical suspicion for this opportunistic infection while treating COVID-19
		patients is necessary to prevent further mortality associated with this pandemic.

TI	-	Rare Hepatic Cryptococcosis Mimicked Metastatic Liver Cancer and Confirmed by
		Metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing in an Immunocompetent Patient: A Case
		Report.
PG	-	5753-5758
LID	-	10.2147/IDR.S381730 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcus neoformans (C. neoformans) is commonly presented in
		immunocompromised individuals and causes cryptococcosis mostly in the respiratory
		and/or central nervous system. Liver cryptococcosis is exceedingly rare and
		sometimes difficult to diagnose through conventional assays. CASE PRESENTATION:
		The present study reports a rare case of liver cryptococcosis characterized by
		increased serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) level and intrahepatic
		multiple nodules without other symptoms in an immunocompetent woman. Her cancer
		family history and imaging examinations initially suspected metastatic liver
		"malignancy. But no sign of the malignant tumor was found after endoscopy,"
		"18-fluorine fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography,"
		and liver biopsy. The histopathology of the liver biopsy specimen indicated
		chronic inflammatory granuloma and then infectious diseases were suspected.
		"However, traditional microbiologic testing failed to identify any potential"
		"pathogen. Eventually, metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) was applied"
		to identify the definite diagnosis of liver cryptococcosis by acquiring the
		"genome sequence of C. neoformans. Fortunately, after 6-month diagnostic"
		"anti-fungal therapy of fluconazole, the liver nodules effectively faded away and"
		the serum CA19-9 level gradually regressed to the normal range. CONCLUSION: We
		identified a rare case of hepatic cryptococcosis by mNGS in an immunocompetent
		patient. When conventional methods have difficulties in the diagnosis of a
		"specific pathogen, mNGS has the advantage of early and accurate identification of"
		potential pathogens from the specimen.

		"Cryptococcus grubii, C. neoformans, and infrequently by C. gattii. [1], [2]"
		Infection occur in patients with immunosuppression or with intact immunity.
		"Dissemination mostly occurs in the lungs and meninges, but also the skin, bones"
		"and the prostate, with very high mortality rates reported for cryptococcal"
		"meningitis ranging from 27% to nearly 100%. [2], [3]. CASE PRESENTATION: We"
		"report the case of a healthy, immunocompetent male presenting with a six-month"
		"history of weight loss, a chronic cough, recent-onset haemoptysis and a lung"
		"mass. The differential diagnosis included pulmonary Tuberculosis, bacterial or"
		fungal pneumonia and lung carcinoma. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with
		"disseminated C. gattii, which remains very rare. Risk factors for this infection"
		"included a distant history of cigarette smoking, as well as travel to central"
		Africa for a recreational trip several months prior. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION:
		Fungal infections should be considered in any patient presenting with respiratory
		"or neurological symptoms suggestive of Tuberculosis, pneumonia or lung carcinoma,"
		regardless of immunocompetency. Our case highlights the importance of taking a
		"thorough travel history in all patients, as the differential diagnosis would need"
		to include atypical pathogens that could be endemic in the area of travel. It
		also highlights the significant morbidity associated with cryptococcosis and
		drug-related toxicities and the methods to prevent complications.

		of literature.
PG	-	253-261
LID	-	10.4254/wjh.v12.i5.253 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcosis is a fungal infection caused by the yeast-like
		encapsulated basidiomycetous fungus of the Cryptococcus neoformans (C.
		neoformans) species complex. These fungi are ubiquitous in soil and bird
		"droppings, and infection by them is an important global health concern,"
		"particularly in immunosuppressed patients, such as organ transplant recipients"
		and those infected by the human immunodeficiency virus. The fungus usually enters
		"the body through the respiratory tract, but extremely rare cases of infection"
		acquired by transplantation of solid organs have been reported. CASE SUMMARY: We
		"report a case of disseminated cryptococcosis in a liver transplant recipient,"
		"diagnosed 2 wk after the procedure. The patient initially presented with fever,"
		"hyponatremia and elevated transaminase levels, manifesting intense headache after"
		a few days. Blood cultures were positive for C. neoformans. Liver biopsy showed
		numerous fungal elements surrounded by gelatinous matrix and sparse granulomatous
		formations. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed multiple small lesions
		"with low signal in T2, peripheric enhancement and edematous halo, diffuse through"
		the parenchyma but more concentrated in the subcortical regions. Treatment with
		"amphotericin B for 3 wk, followed by maintenance therapy with fluconazole, led to"
		complete resolution of the symptoms. The recipients of both kidneys from the same
		"donor also developed disseminated cryptococcosis, confirming the transplant as"
		"the source of infection. The organ donor lived in a rural area, surrounded by"
		"tropical rainforest, and had negative blood cultures prior to organ procurement."
		"CONCLUSION: This case highlights the risk of transmission of fungal diseases,"
		"specifically of C. neoformans, through liver graft during liver transplantation."

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) may be caused by several species of
		Cryptococcus. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a fatal case of CM in a HIV-positive
		patient from Ivory Coast infected by Cryptococcus neoformans VNI and
		Cryptococcusdeuterogattii. Isolates were recovered from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
		prior to systemic antifungal treatment. Six isolates were studied (the entire
		culture plus five isolated colonies from it). Serotyping was performed via LAC 1
		and CAP 64 gene amplification. Genotyping was performed using restriction
		"fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the URA5 gene, (GACA)(4),"
		(GTG)(5) and M13 PCR fingerprinting. URA5-RFLP analysis identified the original
		"culture with two different molecular type combinations. However, URA5-RFLP"
		profiles of the five colonies isolated from the original sample revealed two
		different species. Four colonies were identified as C.deuterogattii and the last
		isolate as C.neoformans VNI. The in vitro susceptibility profile was determined
		using the standard method according to the CLSI M27-A3 protocol. The isolates
		"were susceptible to the tested antifungals (fluconazole, flucytosine and"
		amphotericin B). Treatment with fluconazole (1200  mg day(-1)) was initiated;
		"however, the patient died 17 days after the onset of antifungal therapy."
		CONCLUSION: This is the first reported case of mixed infection with C. neoformans
		and C.deuterogattii in a HIV-positive patient.

TI	-	First report of Cryptococcus neoformans var. gattii serotype B from Greece.
PG	-	419-22
AB	-	A plethora of cases of Cryptococcus neoformans infections have been recorded
		worldwide in immunocompromised individuals. The number of such cases showed a
		steady rise before 1981 and increased dramatically thereafter due to the AIDS
		"epidemic. A similar pattern has been seen in Greece but, so far, infections"
		appear to have been caused by C. neoformans var. neoformans. This paper describes

AB	-	Pulmonary infections from the environmental fungus Cryptococcus gattii (C.
		"gattii) are notable for cryptococcomas, which are usually solitary and can be"
		very large. As with infections with Cryptococcus neoformans (C. neoformans)
		"patients can have concomitant cryptococcal meningitis; however, unlike for C."
		"neoformans, infections with C. gattii often occur in immunocompetent patients."
		The highest published incidence of C. gattii infection has been in the Indigenous
		Australian population of Arnhem Land in the tropical north of the country. More
		recently C. gattii has been responsible for outbreaks of cryptococcosis in the
		Pacific Northwest of Canada and the United States of America (USA). A previously
		healthy Indigenous male from Arnhem Land presented with pulmonary cryptococcosis
		with chest imaging showing >50 bilateral lung nodules. This unusual occurrence
		was attributed to probable inhalation of fungal elements from prior use of a
		high-pressure leaf blower to clear eucalyptus and other debris in a remote bush
		camp.

TI	-	Lung disease features in Brazilian children with HIV infection before HAART era.
PG	-	360-8
AB	-	Lower respiratory tract diseases are major causes of morbidity and mortality in
		HIV infected children. We studied the lung disease features associated with AIDS
		"in children and adolescents, in an era of ineffective antiretroviral therapy,"
		"between January 1996 and October 1998. This prospective, descriptive,"
		longitudinal and historical medical chart review included 48 vertically HIV
		"infected patients, receiving mono or double antiretroviral therapy, who had"
		developed pulmonary disease. Those who presented acute pneumonia were classified
		into group 1; radiological changes for >or=3 months into group 2; those from
		group 1 and 2 who underwent lung biopsy into group 3. A rapidly progressive
		clinical course was found in 70.7% of the children and 37.5% younger than 6
		months old. Bacterial pneumonia was diagnosed in all patients. High resolution
		chest computer tomographic scans (HRCT) from 27 patients showed a reticulonodular
		"pattern in 8, ground-glass in 3, reticular in 3, nodular in 3, airspace"
		"consolidation in 3, mediastinal adenopathy in 3, pulmonary air cystic in 2 and"
		air-trapping in 1. In five patients the HRCT were normal. Histopathology
		"revealed: lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis in 5 patients, pulmonary lymphoid"
		"hyperplasia in 9, tuberculosis in 1, interstitial pneumonia in 1, diffuse"
		alveolar damage in 1. Two patients had Cryptococcus neoformans and Mycobacterium
		tuberculosis. We conclude that lung diseases were the major risk factor for high
		"morbidity, and an invasive diagnostic procedure may clarify the main cause for"
		similar radiologic images of infectious and non-infectious processes.

TI	-	Etiology and risk factors of meningitis in patients admitted at a Central
		Hospital in Harare.
PG	-	11-May
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To determine etiology and risk factors of meningitis in patients
		admitted a tertiary referral Hospital in Harare. DESIGN: Cross-Sectional Study.
		SETTING: Urban Referral Health Facility. SUBJECTS: Patients suspected of having
		Meningitis admitted at Parirenyatwa Hospital were consecutively consented and
		recruited into the study until sample size accrual. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
		Prevalence of pathogens associated with Meningitis. Risk factors of meningitis.
		RESULTS: Two Hundred and Ninety Six (296) clinically suspected meningitis
		"patients were recruited into the study, 51.7 %( n=115) were male. Meningitis was"
		"confirmed in 20.6% (n=61) cases with the following pathogen proportions, C."
		"neoformans - 45.9 %( n=28), S. pneumoniae – 27.9 % (n=17), TBM – 4.9 %( n=3),"
		probable viral meningitis – 6.6% (n=4 and other bacteria- 14.8% (n=9). Patients
		from crowded households were also more likely to suffer from meningitis than
		those from sparsely populated households (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The use of Latex
		agglutination increases the proportion of detected pathogens both fungal and
		bacterial when used in conjunction with CSF gram stain and culture. Cryptococcus
		neoformans and S. pneumoniae are the leading causes of meningitis in patients
		admitted at Parirenyatwa Hospital.

TI	-	Molecular analysis of pericardial fluid: a 7-year experience.
PG	-	1942-6
AB	-	AIMS: Aetiological investigations of pericardial effusion are often negative. We
		evaluate the interest of systematic analysis of fluid in order to diminish the
		number of pericarditis classified as idiopathic. METHODS AND RESULTS: We
		"performed a systematic analysis of pericardial fluid and biopsy specimens, using"
		"cultures and molecular analyses for the identification of bacteriological,"
		"fungal, and viral agents, as well as histopathological examination of 106"
		pericardial fluid samples. The aetiological diagnosis was determined clinically
		"and by non-invasive procedures in 40 and nine patients, respectively. In the"
		"remaining 57 patients, 14 neoplasias and 17 infections were diagnosed. Molecular"
		"procedures identified seven viral (Enterovirus, Herpes simplex virus, and"
		"Epstein-Barr virus in four, two, and one of the cases, respectively), one fungal"
		"(Cryptococcus neoformans), and nine bacterial infections. Four of these bacteria"
		were not diagnosed by culture because of prior antibiotics treatment
		"(Mycobacterium tuberculosis in two cases, Streptococcus pneumoniae in one case,"
		and Actinomyces neuii in one case). The aetiology remained undetermined in 26
		patients. CONCLUSION: The systematic use of molecular techniques permitted a
		significant increase in aetiological diagnoses of punctured pericardial effusions
		"when compared with cultures (39.5 vs. 13.9%, respectively; P<0.01). It is"
		particularly beneficial for patients with a previous antibiotic regimen or
		suspicion of tuberculosis.

AB	-	Routine identification of fungal pathogens from positive blood cultures by
		"culture-based methods can be time-consuming, delaying treatment with appropriate"
		antifungal agents. The GenMark Dx ePlex investigational use only blood culture
		identification fungal pathogen panel (BCID-FP) rapidly detects 15 fungal targets
		simultaneously in blood culture samples positive for fungi by Gram staining. We
		aimed to determine the performance of the BCID-FP in a multicenter clinical
		study. Blood culture samples collected at 10 United States sites and tested with
		BCID-FP at 4 sites were compared to the standard-of-care microbiological and
		"biochemical techniques, fluorescence in situ hybridization using peptide nucleic"
		acid probes (PNA-FISH) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of
		flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Discrepant results were analyzed by
		bi-directional PCR/sequencing of residual blood culture samples. A total of 866
		"clinical samples, 120 retrospectively and 21 prospectively collected, along with"
		725 contrived samples were evaluated. Sensitivity and specificity of detection of
		"Candida species (C. albicans, C. auris, C. dubliniensis, C. famata, C. glabrata,"
		"C. guilliermondii, C. kefyr, C. krusei, C. lusitaniae, C. parapsilosis, and C."
		"tropicalis) ranged from 97.1 to 100% and 99.8 to 100%, respectively. For the"
		"other organism targets, sensitivity and specificity were as follows: 100% each"
		"for Cryptococcus neoformans and C. gattii, 98.6% and 100% for Fusarium spp., and"
		"96.2% and 99.9% for Rhodotorula spp., respectively. In 4 of the 141 clinical"
		"samples, the BCID-FP panel correctly identified an additional Candida species,"
		undetected by standard-of-care methods. The BCID-FP panel offers a faster
		turnaround time for identification of fungal pathogens in positive blood cultures
		"that may allow for earlier antifungal interventions and includes C. auris, a"
		highly multidrug-resistant fungus.

AB	-	Cryptococcus. Neoformans (C. neoformans) is an encapsulated heterobasidiomycetous
		fungus responsible for opportunistic infections worldwide in immunocompromised
		patients. Clinical presentation ranges from asymptomatic respiratory tract
		colonization to disseminated infection in any human body part. The central
		nervous system (CNS) and pulmonary diseases garner most of the clinical
		attention. Secondary cutaneous cryptococcosis is an uncommon manifestation seen
		as a sentinel sign commonly in disseminated cryptococcal infection. Primary
		cutaneous cryptococcosis (PCC) is a rare manifestation seen in both
		immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients. It is a discrete infection with
		"different epidemiological trends. Immunosuppressive therapy (corticosteroids,"
		tacrolimus) predisposes a patient to acquire this clinical entity. We present a
		case of an elderly Caucasian male on fingolimod for relapsing-remitting multiple
		sclerosis with nonhealing scalp lesions for four years. He was a referral to our
		healthcare center for the presence of fungal elements seen on a scalp biopsy
		fungal stains. Final cultures returned positive for C. neoformans susceptible to
		"fluconazole (MIC = 8 μg/mL). The CD4 count was 13 cells/uL, and workup for CNS"
		and disseminated cryptococcal infection were negative. Fingolimod is an
		"immunomodulator that acts on sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors, affecting the"
		lymphocytes. Pubmed literature review revealed few case reports (< 5) with PCC in
		"patients on fingolimod. To our knowledge, ours is the first case with scalp"
		"cryptococcosis, with the lowest CD4 count while being on fingolimod. No"
		randomized controlled trial data exist for the treatment of PCC. Therapy
		initiated with oral luconazole for six months with significant improvement at
		three months.

AB	-	"Cryptococcosis is an invasive systemic mycosis caused by Cryptococcus, a genus of"
		yeast. Causative organisms for human cryptococcosis include Cryptococcus
		neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii. Disease due to C.neoformans is conventionally
		"seen in patients with underlying immunosuppression, whereas"
		C.gattii-related infection is usually seen in immunocompetent people. The fact
		that the infection can occur among otherwise healthy individuals underscores the
		importance of having a necessary understanding of the pathophysiology and
		clinical and radiological presentations of the disease. We report a case of
		disseminated pulmonary and central nervous system (CNS) cryptococcosis in an
		apparently immunocompetent individual with unusual radiological findings
		necessitating probing for alternative diagnoses. We have attempted to supplement
		and revise the existing data on the radiological manifestations of C.gattii.

LID	-	10.1159/000512289 [doi]
AB	-	"Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic germ, usually causing infections in"
		immunocompromised patients. The main sources of infection with C. neoformans are
		"excrement from birds, decomposing wood, fruit, and vegetables. Primary cutaneous"
		"cryptococcosis (PCC) is a clinical entity, differing from secondary cutaneous"
		cryptococcosis and systematic infection. We report the case of an immunocompetent
		60-year-old woman with PCC due to C. neoformans in her right thumb. She reported
		an accidental injury caused by a rose thorn while she was gardening. Clinical
		examination showed the presence of an erythematous ulcerated nodule with elevated
		"borders, suppuration, and central necrosis. Skin histology examination showed"
		"cutaneous and subcutaneous fibrinoid necrosis with bleeding, abscess,"
		"neutrophil-rich cellular infiltration, and the presence of PAS-, Grocott- and"
		mucin-positive spores. The mycological culture showed milky and creamy colonies
		of C. neoformans after 3 days. As there was no previous history of pulmonary
		"cryptococcosis, we diagnosed PPC. We treated the patient surgically with accurate"
		"debridement of nonvital tissues in the right thumb. In addition, we started"
		"itraconazole treatment 100 mg twice daily for 6 months, which led to rapid"
		clinical improvement without relapse. PCC is a rare infection that can present
		"with quite unspecific clinical pictures including acneiform lesions, purpura,"
		"vesicles, nodules, abscesses, ulcers, granulomas, pustules, draining sinuses, and"
		cellulitis. Prolonged systemic antifungal therapy is necessary in order to get a
		healing result without relapse. We summarize all the cases of PCC in
		immunocompetent patients published so far in the literature.

		cohort study.
PG	-	2309-16
LID	-	10.1097/QAD.0b013e3283320de8 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: Indonesia has a concentrated but rapidly growing HIV epidemic. We
		"examined the effect of HIV on causative organisms, clinical features and"
		prognosis of adult meningitis. DESIGN: A prospective cohort study. METHODS: All
		adult patients at a referral hospital who underwent cerebrospinal fluid
		examination for suspected meningitis were examined for HIV and included in a
		prospective cohort study. Microbiological testing was done for common bacterial
		"pathogens, mycobacteria and fungi. Patients were followed for at least 6 months,"
		and logistic regression models were used to identify risk factors for mortality.
		"RESULTS: Among 185 patients who mostly presented with subacute meningitis, 60%"
		were male and the median age was 30 years. HIV infection was present in 25% of
		"the patients; almost two-thirds were newly confirmed, and all presented with"
		"severe immunosuppression (median CD4 cell count 13/microl, range 2-98). One-third"
		of HIV-infected patients had cryptococcal meningitis whereas two-thirds suffered
		"from tuberculosis. After 1 month, 41% of patients had died. HIV infection was"
		strongly associated with 1-month mortality (adjusted odds ratio 12.15; 95%
		confidence interval 3.04-15.72) and death during extended follow-up (hazard ratio
		2.48; 95% confidence interval 1.97-5.74). CONCLUSION: Although HIV is still
		"uncommon in the general population in Indonesia, its prevalence among adult"
		meningitis cases already seems high. Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Cryptococcus
		"neoformans are the main causes of meningitis in this setting, and mortality is"
		"very high, especially in HIV-infected patients. Our data suggest that adult"
		meningitis cases in Indonesia should be screened routinely for HIV infection.
		Further studies are needed to address the high mortality.

		the fourth lumbar vertebra. The result of periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and Gomori's
		methenamine silver (GMS) staining of the tissue sample matched cryptococcal
		"infection, but multiple culture was negative. Eventually, C. neoformans var."

		might be an excellent option to obtain the most accurate diagnosis in clinical
		practice.

AB	-	"Despite the widespread use of highly active antiretroviral therapy, cryptococcal"
		meningoencephalitis has emerged as the second leading cause of infectious
		morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected patients worldwide. It presents usually

TI	-	Metastatic infection caused by hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumonia and

PG	-	3812-3820
LID	-	10.12998/wjcc.v7.i22.3812 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) used to affect mainly people
		"with compromised immunity or weakened by other infections, but recent emergence"
		of hypervirulent strains has increased infections even in healthy individuals.
		"These infections include liver abscess, pneumonia, bacteremia, meningitis,"
		"necrotizing fasciitis, and endophthalmitis. Although metastatic infection by"
		"hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (hvKP) is increasingly recognized, co-infection with"
		Cryptococcus neoformans (C. neoformans) meningitis in immunocompetent hosts is
		"rare but fatal. So, it is necessary to determine the risk factors, complications,"
		and comorbidity of this disease. CASE SUMMARY: This report describes a
		"58-year-old man with hvKP pulmonary abscess, bacteremia, and meningitis,"
		accompanied by fatal Cryptococcus meningitis. This patient presented with fever
		for 1 wk and drowsiness for 3 d. Laboratory findings revealed pulmonary abscess
		"and bacteremia of K. pneumoniae. He was given intravenous antibiotic therapy, and"
		"the infection was under control for about 1 wk. However, his condition"
		deteriorated rapidly because of metastatic purulent meningitis. Although hvKP and
		"C. neoformans were isolated and confirmed, the patient died of spontaneous"
		respiratory and cardiac arrest caused by cerebral hernia. CONCLUSION: HvKP has
		emerged as a cause of metastatic infections in immunocompetent hosts.
		polymicrobial co-infections should be taken into consideration when metastatic
		infection is present.

AB	-	Case summary We report a clinical case of blepharitis due to Cryptococcus
		neoformans yeasts in a 2-year-old stray cat from northern Portugal (Vila Real)
		without concurrent naso-ocular signs. Ophthalmological examination revealed
		mucopurulent discharge from an open wound in the right upper and lower lids.
		"Slit-lamp biomicroscopy showed a normal anterior segment, and intraocular"
		pressure was within the normal reference interval. No fundoscopic alterations
		were detected in either eye by direct and indirect ophthalmoscopic examination.
		Cytological examination of an appositional smear showed numerous polymorphic
		"neutrophils and macrophages, together with spherical yeast cells compatible with"
		Cryptococcus species. Molecular analysis by means of PCR and restriction fragment
		length polymorphism identified C neoformans genotype VNI. The cat was treated
		"with itraconazole, and amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, combined with a"
		commercial ear ointment and an imidacloprid/moxidectin spot-on application for
		bilateral parasitic otitis caused by Otodectes cynotis. One month after
		"treatment, the clinical signs were completely resolved. Localised cutaneous"
		"lesions, as in the present case, probably result from contamination of"
		cat-scratch injuries with viable encapsulated yeasts. Relevance and novel
		"information This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first clinical report of"
		feline blepharitis due to C neoformans without concurrent naso-ocular signs. The
		"current findings, together with those from recent reports of the infection in"
		"domestic animals, should alert the veterinary community both in Portugal and in"
		Europe to this underdiagnosed disease.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: Meningitis and encephalitis are neurological emergencies requiring
		rapid diagnosis and treatment. The performance of the FilmArray®
		"Meningitis/Encephalitis (ME) panel, a multiplex polymerase chain reaction test,"
		and conventional methods for diagnosing meningitis and encephalitis was compared.
		METHODS: This retrospective study assessed 20 patients diagnosed with meningitis
		or encephalitis according to clinical symptoms and laboratory examination
		findings between January 2018 and December 2019. The results of the FilmArray® ME
		panel were compared with those of conventional methods. RESULTS: Pathogens were
		identified in 11 (55%) patients using the FilmArray® ME panel and in nine (45%)
		patients using conventional methods. The test identified herpes simplex virus
		"type 1 in two patients, herpes simplex virus type 2 in one, varicella-zoster"
		"virus in four, Streptococcus pneumoniae in three, and Cryptococcus neoformans in"
		"one. Furthermore, additional pathogens were detected (n = 1, S. pneumoniae and"
		"n = 1, varicella-zoster virus). The median times to pathogen identification were"
		2 hours using the FilmArray® ME panel and 96 hours with conventional methods.
		CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity of the FilmArray® ME panel for rapidly detecting the
		"most common pathogens was similar to that of conventional methods. Hence, this"
		method could decrease the time to definitive diagnosis and treatment initiation.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcus is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that leads to
		life-threatening infections. Cryptococcal infections are mainly reported in HIV
		patients and less commonly encountered in non-HIV immunocompromised host.
		Cryptococcus neoformans (C. neoformans) is the most common Cryptococcus species
		"causing diseases in humans which can be presented as pulmonary, meningitis,"
		"cutaneous, and/or disseminated cryptococcosis. Case Presentation. A 12-year-old"
		"female girl from Cairo, Egypt, presented to the pediatric hospital with signs of"
		systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). She had an aggressive lupus nephritis course
		"for which corticosteroids, mycophenolate mofetil, and cyclophosphamide were"
		"prescribed, and the child gradually improved and was discharged. Two months"
		"later, the patient exhibited skin lesions involved both in her legs, massive"
		ulcers were developed and extended rapidly through the entire legs followed by
		"deterioration in her conscious level, and signs of meningitis were documented."
		Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination and microbiological workup were
		"confirmatory for C. neoformans infection, and mental and motor functions were"
		rapidly deteriorated. Treatment with amphotericin B in addition to supportive
		treatment and close follow-up of the patient's medical condition result in
		obvious clinical improvement and patient discharge with minimal residual weakness
		"in her legs after almost a one-month duration. After six months, the patient was"
		"brought to the emergency department complaining of repeated attacks of seizures,"
		"a lumbar puncture was performed, and culture results were again confirmatory for"
		C. neoformans. An intensive course of antifungal therapy was prescribed which was
		"successful, evident by resolution of the signs and symptoms of infection in"
		addition to negative culture results and negative sepsis biomarkers. The child
		"clinically improved, but unfortunately, gradual optic nerve degeneration and"
		brain cell atrophy as a sequel of severe and longstanding cryptococcal infection
		resulted in her death after almost one year from her first attack. CONCLUSION:
		Cryptococcal infection among non-HIV patients is a rare disease but can result in
		advanced medical complications which may be fatal. The disease should be
		suspected to be reliably diagnosed. Cryptococcus infection can be presented as a
		"skin lesion which, if not treated properly at an earlier time, can result in"
		dissemination and life-threatening consequences. Amphotericin B can be used
		effectively in cryptococcosis management in the settings where flucytosine is not
		available. Signs of cryptococcal meningitis can be manifested again after a
		period of remission and clinical cure which signifies the latency of Cryptococcus
		in the central nervous system. The second activation of Cryptococcus after its
		latency is usually life-threatening and mostly fatal.

PG	-	232-5
LID	-	10.1258/ijsa.2007.007191 [doi]
AB	-	Fever of unknown origin (FUO) is a common presentation for patients with advanced
		human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and acquired immune deficiency
		"syndrome (AIDS). We prospectively followed 72 patients, consecutively admitted to"
		a Thai regional hospital with FUO and HIV infection to identify aetiologies and
		mortality in the era of available antiretroviral therapy (ART). Aetiologies of
		"FUO were identified in 67 patients (93%), of whom 61(85%) had an infectious"
		aetiology. The most common infectious aetiologies were Mycobacterium tuberculosis
		"(n=30; 42%), Cryptococcus neoformans (n=17; 24%), Pneumocystis jiroveci (n=9;"
		"13%), Toxoplasma gondii (n=5; 7%), and salmonella bacteraemia (n=5; 7%). Nineteen"
		patients (26%) had co-infection with two or more pathogens. The median CD4 count
		"was 120 cells/mm(3) (range, 1-581 cells/mm(3)), and the all-cause mortality was"
		"22% (n=16). By multivariate analysis, inadequate antimicrobial treatment was the"
		"sole predictor of mortality (aOR=4.9; 95% CI=1.2-21.9; P=0.02). Overall, 58 of 72"
		patients (81%) had an opportunistic infection suggesting that guideline use of
		ART and prophylactic strategies remain unmet needs that will benefit individuals
		and populations with HIV/AIDS in Thailand.

AB	-	To determine the etiology of bloodstream infections (BSIs) in hospitalized
		"patients >/=15 years old in Thailand, prospectively enrolled, consecutive febrile"
		(>/=38 degrees C) patients were admitted to one hospital during February-April
		"1997. After a patient history was taken and a physical examination was performed,"
		blood was obtained for comprehensive culture and human immunodeficiency virus
		"(HIV) testing. Of 246 study patients, 119 (48%) had BSIs, and 182 (74%) were"
		infected with HIV. The 2 most common pathogens were Cryptococcus neoformans and
		"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (30 and 27 patients, respectively). HIV-positive"
		patients were more likely than HIV-negative patients to have mycobacteremia
		"(57/182 vs. 0/64, P<. 0001), fungemia (38/182 vs. 2/64, P<.001), or polymicrobial"
		"BSIs (19/182 vs. 0/64, P<.002). Clinical predictors of BSIs included HIV"
		"infection, chronic diarrhea, lymphadenopathy, or splenomegaly. Mortality was"
		higher among patients with than those without BSIs (P<. 001). Cohort-based
		microbiologic studies are critically important to diagnose emerging pathogens and
		to develop algorithms for empirical treatment of BSIs in developing countries.

TI	-	Complications of corticosteroid therapy in patients with the acquired
		immunodeficiency syndrome and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.
PG	-	38-43
AB	-	We retrospectively studied the acute toxicity of corticosteroid therapy in 23
		episodes of PCP occurring in the setting of AIDS and determined the incidence of
		HIV-related complications following these and 16 other contemporaneous episodes
		of AIDS-related PCP treated with antimicrobials alone. The mean duration of
		corticosteroid therapy was 5.4 days and the mean total dose was 660 mg of
		methylprednisolone. Cryptococcus neoformans and Listeria monocytogenes infection
		each occurred once within one month of therapy in corticosteroid-treated
		patients; no other noteworthy acute corticosteroid toxicity was noted. Since all
		"patients with imminently lethal PCP received corticosteroids, we could not assess"
		the effect of these agents on acute mortality. After six months the rates of new
		AIDS-related diagnoses and of post-hospitalization mortality were equivalent in
		the two groups. We also have critically reviewed the available literature
		regarding this use of corticosteroids.

		"upper lobe and right hilar, with evidence of narrowing of the right upper lobe"
		bronchus. PET-CT scans showed the mass in the bronchus with the high mSUVs. A
		biopsy specimen was taken from the mass by lung puncture biopsy and showed
		cryptococcus infection. Culture of lung tissue was C. neoformans. The serum was
		"positive for cryptococcal antigen, with a titer of more than 1(:)1,280. He was"
		successfully treated using amphotericin B liposome. This case is worth discussing
		because it was cryptococcosis presenting as endobronchial obstruction that is
		often considered tumor.

PG	-	e33490

LID	-	e33490
AB	-	Cryptococcal neoformans (C. neoformans) and varicella-zoster (VZV) meningitis are
		"opportunistic infections that are primarily seen in immunocompromised patients,"
		"including those with HIV, cancer, or receiving transplants. Despite treatment,"
		"infection in immunocompromised patients can be lethal, including those with"
		T-cell dysfunction or deficiency. Whether innate immunodeficiencies also
		"predispose to these infections remains less clear. Here, we report a case of"
		disseminated C. neoformans and VZV meningitis in a young male with idiopathic
		hypereosinophilic syndrome and hypocomplementemia and no history of HIV
		"infection, malignancy, or transplant. The patient presented with a pulsating"
		"headache, myalgia, joint pain, insomnia, night sweats, and subjective fever,"
		along with clusters of vesicular lesions on his neck and back. A lumbar puncture
		and an MRI of the brain confirmed C. neoformans and VZV meningitis. Vesicular
		"skin lesions proved to be VZV, and blood culture confirmed fungemia, suggesting"
		disseminated disease. We investigated his medical history further to determine
		the underlying cause of his prior hypereosinophilia and current meningitis. The
		"patient had idiopathic hypereosinophilia with high IgE levels, low complement"
		"levels, high rheumatoid factor levels, and an intermittent rash dating back two"
		"years, which had been treated intermittently with prednisone and hydroxyurea,"
		with the most recent admission three weeks prior to this admission. Prior to
		"admission, the patient had a peak absolute eosinophil count of 18.6 x10(3)/uL."
		The patient was discharged on a daily dose of 60 mg of prednisone without
		"hydroxyurea. In further evaluating his immune status, we found he was"
		"HIV-negative, with a normal CD4 count and high IgE. We also tested lymphocyte"
		"subsets and proliferation, which showed a low CD16/56 level, suggesting possibly"
		reduced natural killer (NK) cell quantity. The patient responded well to
		"acyclovir, amphotericin, and flucytosine therapy. After follow-up cerebrospinal"
		"fluid (CSF) and blood cultures were negative, the patient was discharged with"
		fluconazole as maintenance therapy.

TI	-	Neuroinfection survey at a neurological ward in a Brazilian tertiary teaching
		hospital.
PG	-	1021-5
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: This study was undertaken to characterize the neuroinfection profile
		in a tertiary neurological ward. INTRODUCTION: Neuroinfection is a worldwide
		"concern and bacterial meningitis, tetanus and cerebral malaria have been reported"
		"as the commonest causes in developing countries. METHODS: From 1999 to 2007, all"
		"patients admitted to the Neurology Ward of Hospital das Clínicas, São Paulo"
		University School of Medicine because of neuroinfection had their medical records
		"reviewed. Age, gender, immunological status, neurological syndrome at"
		"presentation, infectious agent and clinical outcome were recorded. RESULTS: Three"
		hundred and seventy four cases of neuroinfectious diseases accounted for 4.2% of
		ward admissions and the identification of infectious agent was successful in 81%
		"of cases. Mean age was 40.5 + 13.4 years, 63.8% were male, 19.7% were"
		immunocompromised patients and meningoencephalitis was the most common clinical
		presentation despite infectious agent. Viruses and bacteria were equally
		"responsible for 29.4% of neuroinfectious diseases; parasitic, fungal and prion"
		"infections accounted for 28%, 9.6% and 3.5% respectively. Human immunodeficiency"
		"virus (HIV), herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1), Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Treponema"
		"pallidum, Taenia solium, Schistosoma mansoni, Cryptococcus neoformans and"
		Histoplasma capsulatum were the more common infectious pathogens in the patients.
		"Infection mortality rate was 14.2%, of which 62.3% occurred in immunocompetent"
		patients. CONCLUSION: Our institution appeared to share some results with
		developed and developing countries. Comparison with literature may be considered
		as quality control to health assistance.

TI	-	Pseudomeningitis again. Association with cytocentrifuge funnel and Gram-stain
		reagent contamination.
PG	-	456-8
AB	-	"OBJECTIVE: To report an ""epidemic"" of pseudomeningitis related to cytocentrifuge"
		"funnel and Gram-stain reagent contamination, and our evaluation and responses."
		"DESIGN: Investigation was stimulated by the recognition of Gram-stained,"
		"smear-positive, culture-negative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens."
		"Cytofunnels, glass slides, Gram-staining reagents, and an automated Gram-staining"
		apparatus were subjected to repeated staining and culture. Control stains and
		cultures using fetal bovine serum (simulated CSF) were performed for comparison.
		"SETTING: The clinical microbiology laboratory of Parkland Memorial Hospital, a"
		large acute-care teaching hospital. SPECIMENS: Cerebrospinal fluid specimens were
		submitted to the clinical microbiology laboratory in the course of routine
		patient care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Gram's stains and cultures of test and
		"control preparations. RESULTS: Most of the smear-positive, culture-negative,"
		original CSF specimens contained Gram-positive bacilli or Gram-negative bacilli.
		"Smears of cytofunnels revealed similar organisms, and cultures revealed Bacillus"
		species. Cytofunnels from several lots were culture-positive. Glass slides were
		not contaminated. Of 25 CSF specimens stained during the initial week of
		"investigation, 23 were negative by culture and two grew Cryptococcus neoformans"
		(from acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients). Control stains and cultures
		of simulated CSF were negative. Gram-stain reagents were frequently
		"smear-positive, and cultures repeatedly yielded Flavimonas oryzihabitans from the"
		crystal violet well of an automated Gram-staining apparatus. These latter
		contaminants could not be eliminated consistently. INTERVENTIONS: No alternative
		sources of cytofunnels were found. The Gram-staining apparatus was cleaned and
		reagents changed frequently. Cytocentrifugation and use of automated Gram
		staining was discontinued for CSF and other normally sterile fluids. The
		laboratory staff was repeatedly educated about the problem. CONCLUSIONS:
		Contamination of cytocentrifuge funnels and an automated Gram-staining apparatus
		"contributed to an ""epidemic"" of pseudomeningitis. The problem was corrected by"
		education of the laboratory staff and by altered management of CSF and other
		sterile body fluid specimens.

TI	-	Pulmonary infection in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients in Taiwan.
PG	-	123-7
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Pulmonary infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in
		human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. METHODS: We conducted a
		retrospective analysis of the pathogens causing pulmonary infection in 272
		HIV-infected patients admitted to a university hospital from January 1993 through
		December 1998. RESULTS: A total of 158 (58%) patients had pulmonary
		"complications, all but two of whom had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)."
		"There were 156 episodes of pulmonary infection, involving 124 patients. The most"
		common pulmonary infection was Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP): 66 patients
		"had 77 episodes of PCP, all of which occurred in patients with CD4+ lymphocyte"
		"counts below 0.2 x 10(9)/L (200/microL). Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), diagnosed"
		"in 47 patients, was the second most common pulmonary infection. Twenty TB"
		patients had open TB. HIV-infected patients who were immigrants from Southeast
		"Asia (9/23, 39%) had a higher risk of developing pulmonary TB than nonimmigrants"
		"(38/249, 15%) (p = 0.004). Only one of 17 episodes of community-acquired"
		bacterial pneumonia was caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Less common
		"opportunistic pulmonary pathogens included cytomegalovirus (5 cases), Aspergillus"
		"species (3), Cryptococcus neoformans (3), Mycobacterium avium complex (2),"
		"Penicillium marneffei (1), Nocardia species (1), and Rhodococcus equi (1)."
		CONCLUSIONS: PCP and pulmonary TB are the two leading pulmonary infections in
		Taiwanese HIV/AIDS patients. These findings should be taken into consideration
		when developing management strategies and public health policies.

TI	-	Dysbiosis of gut fungal microbiota is associated with mucosal inflammation in
		Crohn's disease.
PG	-	513-23
LID	-	10.1097/MCG.0000000000000035 [doi]
AB	-	GOALS: We aim to characterize the fungal microbiota in the intestinal mucosa and
		feces in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). BACKGROUND: Fungi represent a
		diverse microbial community in the human intestine and might play a role in the
		"pathogenesis of CD; however, little is known about the structure and composition"
		of the fungal microbiota especially adhering to the intestinal mucosa in CD
		patient. STUDY: Nineteen patients with active CD and 7 healthy individuals were
		recruited in this study. The mucosa-associated and fecal fungal microbiotas in CD
		patients were analyzed using culture-independent community fingerprint
		techniques. RESULTS: The fungal richness and diversity were significantly
		elevated in the inflamed mucosa compared with the noninflamed mucosa. The
		"predominant fungal composition in the inflamed mucosa was strikingly altered,"
		"mainly characterized by expansion in the proportions of Candida spp., Gibberella"
		"moniliformis, Alternaria brassicicola, and Cryptococcus neoformans. The fecal"
		fungal community was perturbed in CD patients as accompanied by increased fungal
		"diversity and prevalence in Candida albicans, Aspergillus clavatus, and C."
		neoformans. The species richness and diversity of the mucosal fungal community
		"were associated with the expression of TNF-α, IFN-γ, or IL-10 (P<0.05). The"
		diversity of the fecal fungal microbiota positively correlated with serum
		C-reactive protein and CD activity index (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study first
		demonstrates that the fungal microbiota in the inflamed mucosa is distinguishable
		from that of the noninflamed area. Shifts of gut fungal microbiota composition
		may be associated with mucosal inflammation and disease activity of CD. Our data
		would provide novel insights into understanding the potential of gut fungal
		microbiota in the pathogenesis of CD.

		and diagnosis.
PG	-	489-500
AB	-	Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is an important cause of morbidity and mortality
		after solid organ transplantation. CMV infection after kidney transplantation was
		confirmed in 19 (54.3%) out of 35 patients. 16 of these (84.2%) developed CMV
		disease. CMV infection was diagnosed based on a fourfold or greater increase of
		"anti-CMV IgG antibody titre, detection of CMV-IgM antibodies and/or virus"
		"isolation. Primary infection was observed in 3 patients, reactivation in 9 and an"
		"undefined type of infection in 7. In most patients (63%), infection was diagnosed"
		"in the first 2 months, and in 3 patients, after 3, 5 and 9 years following kidney"
		"transplantation. The most frequent symptoms of CMV disease were fever (58%),"
		"pneumonitis (26.3%) and enterocolitis (15.8%). In 53% of the patients, CMV"
		infection co-occurred with other pathogens such as Candida albicans. Cryptococcus
		"neoformans, bacteria or viruses (HBV, HCV, HSV). Treatment with polyvalent"
		"globulin (Sandoglobin) or hyperimmune globulin (Cytotect), in combination with"
		"ganciclovir in 7 patients, resulted in a regression of CMV disease."

LID	-	979086
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Community-acquired central nervous system infections (CA-CNS
		"infections) have the characteristics of acute onset and rapid progression, and"
		"are associated with high levels of morbidity and mortality worldwide. However,"
		"there have been only limited studies on the etiology of this infections. Here,"
		"metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS), a comprehensive diagnosis method,"
		facilitated us to better understand the etiology of CA-CNS infections. METHODS:
		We conducted a single-center retrospective study between September 2018 and July
		2021 in which 606 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected from suspected
		"CNS infectious patients for mNGS testing, and all positive samples were included"
		"in this analysis. RESULTS: After the exclusion criteria, a total of 131"
		"mNGS-positive samples were finally enrolled. Bacterial, viral, fungal, parasitic,"
		"specific pathogen and mixed infections were accounted for 32.82% (43/131), 13.74%"
		"(18/131), 0.76% (1/131), 2.29% (3/131) and 6.87% (9/131), respectively. A total"
		"of 41 different pathogens were identified, including 16 bacteria, 12 viruses, 10"
		"fungi, and 1 parasite and 3 specific pathogens. The most frequent infecting"
		"pathogens are Epstein-Barr virus (n = 14), Herpes simplex virus 1 (n = 14),"
		"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (n = 13), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 13), and"
		Cryptococcus neoformans (n = 8). Some difficult-to-diagnose pathogen infections
		"were also detected by mNGS, such as Streptococcus suis, Pseudorabies virus,"
		"Bunyavirus, Orientia tsutsugamushi and Toxoplasma gondii. CONCLUSION: In this"
		"study, mNGS identified a wide variety of pathogens of CA-CNS infections and many"
		of which could not be detected by conventional methods. Our data provide a better
		understanding of the etiology of CA-CNS infections and show that mNGS represents
		a comparative screening of CSF in an unbiased manner for a broad range of human
		pathogens.

AB	-	Meningoencephalitis is a syndrome of multiple etiologies associated with
		important morbidity and mortality. It may be caused by various infectious agents
		"(viruses, bacteria, parasites and fungi). Establishing the etiology of"
		meningoencephalitis is crucial for early and specific treatment. Molecular assays
		such as the multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) offer an alternative in
		diagnosing central nervous system infections. This study aimed to describe the
		performance of an automated multiplex molecular test from patients with suspected
		"meningitis and meningoencephalitis in a tertiary referral complex in Medellin,"
		"Colombia. Thus, a prospective study was performed in 638 cerebrospinal fluid"
		samples from January 2017 to July 2019. Molecular detections were carried out by
		"means of the FilmArray® Meningitis/Encephalitis (M/E) Panel from bioMérieux,"
		"France, and by conventional tests. Univariate analyses for microbiological and"
		demographic characteristics were performed. Accuracy of the bacterial/fungal PCR
		"assay compared to cultures was also performed. Among patients, 57.7% were male,"
		the median age was 24 (IQR: 6 - 47) years old. The overall positivity was 15.2%
		"(97 detections) and viruses were detected in 45.5% of the samples, bacteria in"
		43.5% and fungi in 10.8%. The most frequent etiological agents were:
		"Streptococcus pneumoniae (16%), Cryptococcus neoformans/gatti (11.3%) and Herpes"
		simplex virus (10.3%). Four double detections were found. Almost half of positive
		detections were in patients under 15 years old. This molecular approach is
		"reliable and easily implantable into a laboratory routine, increasing the"
		"capacity of detection of bacterial and viral causative agents of meningitis,"
		possibly playing a relevant role in the clinical context.

AB	-	Case of 59-year-old male with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and a number
		"of comorbidities, who has developed meningoencephalitis caused by Cryptococcus"
		neoformans var. grubii with polyarteritis nodosa diagnosed during
		"hospitalization, was presented. Before evidence of meningoencephalitis, the"
		patient was being treated with ketoconazole and low doses of fluconazole
		(200 mg/day) for alleged candidiasis. The dosage was increased (800 mg/day)
		following laboratory diagnosis of C. neoformans based on positive latex
		agglutination test and biochemical identification of encapsulated yeast isolated
		"from the blood and CSF. Later, the yeast identification was confirmed by"
		"sequencing analysis. Owing to inadequate clinical response, fluconazole therapy"
		was switched to voriconazole (400 mg/day) and later to intravenous amphotericin B
		"(1.0 mg/kg per day). Despite of a temporary stabilization and improvement, which"
		"correlated with decline of cryptococcal antigen titers (from 1:1024 to 1:8),"
		"after 6 weeks, the patient's underlying condition deteriorated due to severe"
		pancolitis and serious nosocomial bacterial infections. The patient died of
		multiorgan failure several days later. Our case demonstrates a possible
		connection between the development of life-threatening cryptococcosis and an
		autoimmune vasculitis disease and emphasizes that the outcome of the management
		"of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis is highly dependent on early diagnosis,"
		"adequate treatment, including dosage, and last but not least control of"
		underlying disease and risk factors.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis (CM), is a highly fatal fungal"
		"infection of the central nervous system (CNS), affecting not only"
		"immunocompromised patients, but also apparently immunocompetent patients. CM is"
		"mainly caused by Cryptococcus neoformans (C. neoformans), while viral hepatitis B"
		"(HBV) tends to be a rare inducement. According to the literature, the most common"
		"cerebral area affected by CM was frontal lobe, while infratentorial lesions were"
		"rare, especially those complicated with cerebellar infarction. METHODS: This"
		study capitally analyzed the clinical data of an elderly female suffering from
		"infratentorial CM complicated with cerebellar infarction, with a history of"
		"chronic HBV. RESULTS: The patient suffered from the symptoms of dizziness,"
		"insanity, low-grade fever, and high cranial pressure throughout the course of the"
		"disease. Her MRI findings were hydrocephalus and infratentorial lesions,"
		including bilateral cerebellums and meningeal enhancement. The pathogene was
		"Cryptococcus revealed by both the cytology and ink stain of cerebrospinal fluid,"
		and was confirmed to be C. neoformans by the Next generation sequencing (NGS).
		"After 12 days of intravenous amphotericin B (AMB) treatment, the patient"
		"developed oliguria, and 3 days after the termination of AMB treatment, the renal"
		function recovered. Brain MRI reexamination after the treatment showed that the
		"diffused lesions in the cerebellum were significantly decreased, and acute"
		infarction occurred on the left cerebellum although it was asymptomatic. The
		"patient took fluconazole 400mg per day after discharge, without complaints during"
		the follow-up two months later. CONCLUSION: C. neoformans infection may be a
		possible pathogeny in chronic HBV patients with meningoencephalitis. Cerebellar
		"infarction might be a complication of CM, therefore MRI is supposed to be"
		"re-examined during antifungal therapy. Additionally, monitoring renal function"
		"plays a vital role after AMB treatment, and renal function may recover after"
		termination.

		highly active antiretroviral therapy.
PG	-	399-406
AB	-	BACKGROUND: There is little systematic information regarding the immune
		reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). OBJECTIVE: To determine the
		"incidence, risk factors, and long-term outcome of IRIS in HIV-infected patients"
		receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) who were coinfected with
		one of three common opportunistic pathogens. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort
		identified through a city-wide prospective surveillance program. METHODS: A
		retrospective chart review was performed for 180 HIV-infected patients who
		"received HAART and were coinfected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium"
		"avium complex, or Cryptococcus neoformans between 1997 and 2000. Medical records"
		"were reviewed for baseline demographics, receipt and type of HAART, response to"
		"antiretroviral therapy, development of IRIS, and long-term outcome. RESULTS: In"
		"this cohort, 31.7% of patients who received HAART developed IRIS. Patients with"
		IRIS were more likely to have initiated HAART nearer to the time of diagnosis of
		"their opportunistic infection (P < 0.001), to have been antiretroviral naive at"
		"time of diagnosis of their opportunistic infection (P < 0.001), and to have a"
		more rapid initial fall in HIV-1 RNA level in response to HAART (P < 0.001).
		CONCLUSIONS: IRIS is common among HIV-infected persons coinfected with M.
		"tuberculosis, M. avium complex, or C. neoformans. Antiretroviral drug-naive"
		patients who start HAART in close proximity to the diagnosis of an opportunistic
		infection and have a rapid decline in HIV-1 RNA level should be monitored for
		development of this disorder.

PG	-	247
LID	-	10.1186/1471-2334-13-247 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: The incidence of fungaemia has been increasing worldwide. It is
		important to distinguish non-Candida fungaemia from candidaemia because of their
		different antifungal susceptibilities. The aims of this study were to investigate
		the clinical characteristics of non-Candida fungaemia and identify the clinical
		factors that differentiate it from candidaemia. METHODS: We investigated the
		clinical manifestations and mortality of non-Candida fungaemia in Kyoto
		University Hospital from 2004 to 2009. RESULTS: There were 110 episodes of
		fungaemia during the study period. There were 11 renal replacement therapy
		"episodes of fungaemia due to non-Candida yeasts (10.0%), including 6 episodes"
		"with Cryptococcus neoformans, 4 with Trichosporon asahii, and 1 with Kodamaea"
		"ohmeri, in addition to 99 episodes of candidaemia (90.0%). The presence of"
		collagen disease [odds ratio (OR) 9.00; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.58-51.4;
		P=0.01] or renal replacement therapy (OR 15.0; 95% CI 3.06-73.4; P<0.01) was
		significantly more common in non-Candida fungaemia patients than in candidaemia
		patients. Prior colonisation by the species may be a predictor of non-Candida
		fungaemia. Non-Candida fungaemia had a higher mortality than candidaemia (54.5%
		"versus 21.2%, P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Although Candida species frequently cause"
		"fungaemia, we should also be aware of non-Candida yeasts because of their high"
		"mortality, particularly among high-risk patients, such as those with collagen"
		disease and those under renal replacement therapy. Prior colonisation by the
		causative organisms may be an important predictor of non-Candida fungaemia.

		(HIV) infection in Taiwan.
PG	-	690-7
AB	-	To understand the etiology and clinical outcome of bacterial and fungal sepsis in
		"patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in Taiwan, we"
		conducted a prospective study of nonmycobacterial bacteremia and fungemia in
		HIV-infected patients with fever who were admitted to a university hospital in
		"Taiwan during a 42-month period. Of 210 patients, 41 (19.5%) had a total of 52"
		"episodes of sepsis due to nonmycobacterial bacteria or fungi, or both (15.5% of"
		336 episodes of fever). All but one patient had acquired immunodeficiency
		"syndrome (AIDS), and the mean CD4 lymphocyte count was 29/microL (range,"
		0-321/microL). A total of 57 pathogens (39 bacteria and 18 fungi) were isolated
		from blood; polymicrobial sepsis due to both bacteria and fungi occurred in four
		episodes. Nontyphoid Salmonella (NTS) was the most common cause of
		"community-acquired bacteremia (24/30, 80%). Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia was"
		diagnosed in three episodes while Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia was found
		in only one. Cryptococcus neoformans was the most common cause of fungemia and
		"was responsible for 12 episodes, while fungemia due to Penicillium marneffei and"
		"Histoplasma capsulatum, two emerging fungi in Taiwan, were diagnosed in four"
		"cases and one case, respectively. Nine episodes, eight of bacteremia and one of"
		"candidemia, were nosocomial. The overall in-hospital mortality was 29%, and"
		"nosocomial sepsis was associated with a higher mortality rate (56%, p = 0.02)."
		The mean duration of survival after recovery from initial sepsis was 426 days. We
		conclude that NTS bacteremia was the most common cause of sepsis in patients with
		advanced HIV infection in Taiwan and clinicians caring for such patients should
		watch for emerging fungal infections. Nosocomial sepsis was associated with a
		high mortality rate. The mean survival duration after recovery from sepsis of our
		patients was short.

		teaching hospital in Ghana.
PG	-	28
LID	-	10.1186/1476-0711-11-28 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Meningitis is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in
		"low-resource settings. In sub-Saharan Africa, the meningitis belt has been"
		characterized by particularly high and seasonal incidences of bacterial
		meningitis extending throughout life. Despite the progress being made in treating
		"the condition, the mortality rates continue to be high, ranging between 2% and"
		"30% globally. In Ghana, the mortality rate of meningitis has been estimated to"
		range from 36% to 50%. However little information is available on the pathogens
		contributing to meningitis and their antimicrobial susceptibilities. Updated
		information is essential to adjust the recommendations for empirical treatment or
		prevention of meningitis which could have immense implications for local and
		global health. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed laboratory records of all
		patients suspected of bacterial meningitis who underwent a lumbar puncture from
		"January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2010. Data were retrieved from laboratory record"
		books and double entered into a Microsoft(®) excel spreadsheet. RESULTS: Records
		"of 4,955 cerebrospinal fluid samples were analysed. Of these, 163 (3.3%, 95%CI:"
		"2.8% to 3.8%) were confirmed meningitis and 106 (2.1%, 95%CI: 1.7% to 2.6%) were"
		probable meningitis cases. Confirmed meningitis cases were made up of 117 (71.8%)
		"culture positive bacteria, 19 (11.7%) culture positive Cryptococcus neoformans"
		and 27(16.6%) Gram positive bacteria with negative culture. The most prevalent
		"bacteria was Streptococcus pneumoniae 91 (77.7%), followed by E.coli 4 (3.4%),"
		"Salmonella species 4 (3.4%), Neisseria meningitidis 3 (2.5%), Pseudomonas species"
		"3(2.5%) and others. Pneumococcal isolates susceptibility to penicillin,"
		"chloramphenicol and ceftriaxone were 98.9% (95%CI: 94.0% to 100.0%), 83.0%"
		(95%CI: 73.4% to 90.1%) and 100.0% (95%CI: 95.8% to 100.0%) respectively.
		CONCLUSION: Streptococcus pneumoniae is an important cause of meningitis among
		all age groups and its susceptibility to penicillin and ceftriaxone still remains
		very high. Ghanaians of all ages and possibly other developing countries in the
		meningitis belt could benefit from the use of the pneumococcal vaccine. Other
		bacterial and fungal pathogens should also be considered in the management of
		patients presenting with meningitis.

		lymphadenopathy in AIDS patients.
PG	-	400-4
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To analyse the causes of abdominal lymphadenopathy in AIDS patients
		"and evaluate the performance success rate, diagnostic yielding rate and safety of"
		ultrasound (US)-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA). MATERIAL AND METHOD: Medical
		records of HIV seropositive with abdominal lymphadenopathy who underwent
		percutaenous US-guided FNA from August 1997 to January 2002 were retrospectively
		"reviewed. Records of clinical and ultrasonographic findings, numbers of FNA"
		"performed, numbers of obtained specimen, laboratory results and postoperative"
		problems were analysed. Performance success is defined as obtaining a specimen
		while diagnostic yielding is performance success with laboratory result. RESULTS:
		FNA was done 72 times in 71 patients obtaining specimens in 68 cases (performance
		success rate = 94.4%) with positive laboratory result in 63 cases (diagnostic
		yielding rate = 87.5%). The culture gave results in 56 cases; M. tuberculosis
		"(TB) = 36, TB with other organisms = 5, Mycobacterium avium complex = 2,"
		"Nontuberculous mycobacterium = 10, C. neoformans = 1, Salmonella with positive"
		"fungal stain = 1, E. coli with P. mirabilis = 1. Five cases had positive AFB"
		without culture specimen and one revealed positive AFB stain but negative
		"culture. Lymphoma was found in only one case. No postoperative hemorrhage,"
		peritonitis or perforated bowel in patient or needle stick injury to medical
		staff was reported. CONCLUSION: Abdominal lymphadenopathy at Bamrasnaradura
		Hospital is mostly caused by TB and the second most common is nontuberculous
		mycobacterium. Percutaneous FNA under US guidance could yield definite diagnosis
		"with a high performance success rate, high diagnostic yielding rate and was safe."

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Opportunistic infections are common in organ transplant recipients.
		"After 6 months of transplantation, patients have the highest risk of"
		opportunistic infections such as cryptococcosis. CASE PRESENTATION: The report
		"presents the case of a 36-year-old female renal transplant recipient, with"
		"complaints of few subcutaneous painful and warm nodules and large, warm,"
		"erythematous, nontender plaques on the mildly edematous right leg and ankle."
		Incisional biopsy of the subcutaneous nodule over the leg showed panniculitis
		"with small- to medium-sized vasculitis associated with round yeast forms, and"
		culture of the fragments revealed C. neoformans var. grubii. CONCLUSIONS: This
		article also reviews in brief the treatment of this rare complication. Reviewing
		the literature showed that since the cryptococcal cutaneous lesions are often
		"nonspecific, the clinical picture solely is not enough to construct a definite"
		diagnosis and there must be a high clinical suspicion.

LID	-	10.1093/mmy/myu082 [doi]
AB	-	"In a retrospective study, we investigated 52 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded"
		(FFPE) samples from cats with histologically confirmed cutaneous and subcutaneous
		mycoses to determine if the pathogens could be identified by molecular methods.
		Aim of the study was to obtain a deep understanding of the spectrum of infectious
		"agents, which, as we hypothesized, was not available by histopathology alone."
		Detection of feline and fungal DNA was achieved in 92.3% and 94.2% of the
		"samples, respectively. Most of the subcutaneous infections in cats were caused by"
		"Alternaria spp. (63.5%), followed by Cryptococcus neoformans (7.7%), Histoplasma"
		"capsulatum (5.8%), Sporothrix spp. (3.8%), Aspergillus vitricola, Aureobasidium"
		"pullulans, Exophiala attenuata, Fusarium oxysporum, Lecythophora cateniformis,"
		"Microsporum canis, and Phialophora sp. (1.9% each). The results from molecular"
		identification indicate that correct identifications of the fungal pathogens by
		histology alone were rarely possible. The spectrum of fungal pathogens identified
		after DNA extraction from FFPE samples was much broader than that expected by
		classical histopathology. This was especially noted in alternariosis in that the
		micromorphological pattern in tissue was misleading and could be confused with

LID	-	1002
AB	-	Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis is a leading of morbidity and mortality in
		"immunocompromised individuals worldwide. However, there are few documented cases"
		in immunocompetent patients. We present a rare case of disseminated Cryptococcus
		"with progression to meningoencephalitis in an immunocompetent patient, with a"
		possible atypical presentation. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and
		electroencephalogram to rule out brain metastasis were negative. Lumbar puncture
		resulted positive for Cryptococcus neoformans antigen at titers of 1:2048 and a
		detailed history later revealed occupational exposure to bird dander by cleaning
		"floors and cages. Diagnosis is challenging, with delays often resulting in"
		increased morbidity and mortality. Cerebrospinal fluid and serum Cryptococcus
		antigen play a key role in both diagnosis and determining treatment efficacy.
		"Furthermore, current treatment guidelines are used for immunocompromised"
		"individuals. Due to the significant side effects of these medications, further"
		research is needed to determine the optimal treatment duration for
		immunocompetent patients to minimize the need for unnecessary therapy.

LID	-	e3707
AB	-	Cryptococcal infections are caused by encapsulated fungi Cryptococcus gattii and
		C. neoformans. Inhalation commonly causes innocuous colonization but may cause
		meningitis or disseminated disease via hematogenous spread. Cryptococcosis occurs
		most commonly in immunocompromised patients including those with acquired
		"immunodeficiency syndrome, meningoencephalitis or disseminated disease. However,"
		cryptococcosis can occur as asymptomatic isolated pulmonary nodules in
		immunocompetent patients. Here we present a unique retrospective case report of a
		"55-year-old immunocompetent man who presented with pleuritic chest pain,"
		"productive cough, dyspnea on exertion, chills, night sweats, and weight loss. A"
		computed tomography scan of his chest revealed multiple ground-glass opacities
		throughout both lung fields. The results of his autoimmune evaluation and human
		immunodeficiency virus tests were negative. A biopsy obtained through
		video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery revealed mucicarmine staining capsules
		"confirming Cryptococcus, requiring treatment with amphotericin, flucytosine, and"
		fluconazole. This case highlights the rarely studied presentation of symptomatic
		diffuse pulmonary cryptococcal infection in an immunocompetent patient requiring
		treatment.

		adenocarcinoma: Three case reports.
PG	-	6444-6449
LID	-	10.12998/wjcc.v8.i24.6444 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Pulmonary cryptococcosis (PC) is an invasive fungal disease caused
		mainly by Cryptococcus (C.) neoformans or C. gattii. It may be present in
		immunocompetent or immunocompromised patients. The radiographic features of PC
		"vary, and the most common computed tomography manifestation is the presence of"
		solitary or multiple pulmonary nodules or masses distributed in the outer zone of
		the lung field. The appearance of nodular or mass-like PC on computed tomography
		"scans resembles that of primary or metastatic lung cancers, and differential"
		diagnosis is sometimes difficult. The coexistence of PC and malignant tumors is
		rarely observed. CASE SUMMARY: This paper reports three cases of PC combined with
		"lung adenocarcinoma diagnosed by video-assisted thoracic surgery lung biopsy,"
		which were successfully managed by early diagnosis and treatment. CONCLUSION: The
		present case report might serve as a reminder not to neglect PC coexisting with
		adenocarcinoma. Early diagnosis and treatment lead to a better prognosis.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Meningitis and encephalitis (ME) are central nervous system (CNS)
		"infections mainly caused by bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasites"
		"that result in high morbidity and mortality. The early, accurate diagnosis of"
		pathogens in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and timely medication are associated
		"with better prognosis. Conventional methods, such as culture, microscopic"
		"examination, serological detection, CSF routine analysis, and radiological"
		"findings, either are time-consuming or lack sensitivity and specificity. METHODS:"
		"To address these clinical needs, we developed an advanced fragment analysis"
		"(AFA)-based assay for the multiplex detection of 22 common ME pathogens,"
		"including eight viruses, 11 bacteria, and three fungi. The detection sensitivity"
		of each target was evaluated with a recombinant plasmid. The limits of detection
		of the 22 pathogens ranged from 15 to 120 copies/reaction. We performed a
		retrospective study to analyze the pathogens from the CSF specimens of 170
		clinically diagnosed ME patients using an AFA-based assay and compared the
		"results with culture (bacteria and fungi), microscopic examination (fungi),"
		"polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Mycobacterium tuberculosis), and Sanger"
		sequencing (virus) results. RESULTS: The sensitivity of the AFA assay was 100%
		"for 10 analytes. For Cryptococcus neoformans, the sensitivity was 63.6%. The"
		overall specificity was 98.2%. The turnaround time was reduced to 4-6 hours from
		"the 3-7 days required using conventional methods. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the"
		"AFA-based assay provides a rapid, sensitive, and accurate method for pathogen"
		detection from CSF samples.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to highlight the importance of
		cryptococcosis as one of the most common fungal infections of the central nervous
		"system, stressing the consideration of a cryptococcoma within the list of"
		differential diagnosis of intraventricular masses in immunocompetent hosts. CASE
		DESCRIPTION: We present the case of an immunocompetent 41-year-old female from
		Philippines with an intraventricular cryptococcoma due to Cryptococcus
		"neoformans, mimicking an intraventricular primary brain tumor, who had"
		hydrocephalus. She was approached as having a neoplastic lesion and underwent
		surgical resection plus third ventriculostomy through endoscopy. Later in her
		"evolution, we realized the infectious nature of the lesion, and antifungal"
		"systemic therapy was initiated. In the end, she needed the placement of a"
		ventriculoperitoneal shunt to maintain a good neurologic status. Despite all our
		"efforts, she had a fatal outcome due to various complications. CONCLUSION: Our"
		"case is the first intraventricular cryptococcoma due to C. neoformans, as far as"
		"we know, to be reported in English, German, or Spanish literature. Our report"
		stresses the importance to consider this kind of infection in immunocompetent
		"patients, to raise the level of suspicion of this diagnosis, and to know the"
		complications and management options.

TI	-	Invasive fungal infections in liver transplant recipients.
PG	-	110-6
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: We sought to assess the incidence of invasive fungal infections and
		identify the risk factors and outcome of invasive fungal infections in liver
		transplant recipient. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was made of
		408 patients who received a liver transplant between January 1990 to December
		"2012 at Baskent University in Ankara, Turkey. Only 305 of 408 patients were"
		"included. Demographic and clinical findings were reviewed, and these findings"
		were compared between patients with or without invasive fungal infections.
		RESULTS: Ten of 408 liver transplant patients (2.5%) developed invasive fungal
		infections. Aspergillus was the most common cause of invasive fungal infections
		"(n=8), followed by Candida (n=1), and Cryptococcus neoformans (n=1). Pulmonary"
		"involvement was dominant in all patients (n=10), and only 1 patient had"
		disseminated fungal infection (cryptococcosis). The mean time from transplant to
		invasive fungal infection diagnosis was 32 ± 19.2 days. Most patients with
		invasive fungal infection (9/10) died. Mean survival time between diagnosis of
		fungal infection and death was 24.2 ± 27.3 days in all 10 patients. Fungal
		infections occurred significantly more frequently in patients with older
		"transplant age, diabetes mellitus, cytomegalovirus infection, renal"
		"insufficiency. In addition, other risk factors included long stays in the"
		"surgical intensive care unit, the overall length of stay in hospital, and having"
		preoperative high creatinine level. CONCLUSIONS: Invasive fungal infections were
		associated with increased morbidity and mortality among liver transplant
		"recipients, with Aspergillus spp. being the most common pathogen in our series."
		"Because of its high mortality rate, it is important to follow up transplant"
		patients for the development of invasive fungal infections.

		cryptococcosis in a HIV-infected patient.
LID	-	10.7196/AJTCCM.2019.v25i4.002 [doi]
AB	-	Pulmonary cryptococcosis is a fungal infection caused by inhalation of
		Cryptococcus gattii and/or C. neoformans spores. It mostly affects HIV-infected
		patients. This is a case report of a severely immunocompromised HIV-infected
		"patient, presenting with respiratory symptoms and atypical chest X-ray features"
		for pulmonary cryptococcosis. A serum cryptococcal latex antigen test is positive
		in a majority of HIV-infected patients with pulmonary cryptococcosis. This case
		report demonstrates the occurrence of a false negative serum cryptococcal latex
		"antigen test, becoming positive with the development of an unmasking immune"
		reconstitution syndrome (after antiretroviral therapy was commenced). This also
		resulted in the characteristic cryptococcal lung cavities observed on computed
		tomography chest images. Duration of fluconazole therapy should be
		"individualised, and serial chest imaging (e.g. chest X-ray) should be performed"
		to monitor treatment response.

AB	-	"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the spectrum, antibiotic-resistant pattern, risk"
		"factors, and outcomes of infection in patients hospitalized with systemic lupus"
		erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: We collected the clinical and microbiological data
		from hospitalized patients with SLE with infection between June 2005 and June
		"2015, and then conducted retrospective analyses. RESULTS: Among our sample of"
		"3815 hospitalized patients, 1321 (34.6%) were diagnosed with infection. The"
		majority (78.3%) of infection occurred within 5 years of SLE onset. Bacterial
		"infection was predominant (50.6%), followed by viral infection (36.4%) and fungal"
		infection (12.5%). The lungs (33.7%) and upper respiratory tracts (26.3%) were
		most commonly affected. Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) were predominant over
		gram-positive bacteria (178 isolates vs 90 isolates). The most frequently
		"isolated bacteria were Escherichia coli (24.6%), followed by Acinetobacter"
		baumannii (13.4%) and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (13.4%).
		Multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains were detected in 26.9% of bacterial isolates.
		"The most common fungus was Candida spp. (99 episodes), followed by Aspergillus"
		(24 episodes) and Cryptococcus neoformans (13 episodes). The overall mortality
		rate for this cohort was 2.2%; 48 patients died of infection. Factors associated
		with bacterial and viral infection were higher Systemic Lupus Erythematosus
		"Disease Activity Index, renal involvement, thrombocytopenia, accumulated dose of"
		"glucocorticoids (GC), and treatment with cyclophosphamide (CYC). Renal"
		"involvement, accumulated dose of GC, and treatment with CYC were associated with"
		fungal infection. CONCLUSION: Infection was the leading cause of mortality in
		patients hospitalized with SLE. There were some notable features of infection in
		"Chinese patients including early onset, higher proportion of respiratory tract"
		"involvement, predominance of GNB with emergence of MDR isolates, and a variety of"
		pathogens.

AB	-	Pneumonia is one of the most common causes of morbidity in bottlenose dolphins
		Tursiops truncatus. To better understand associations of pneumonia with
		"demographics, microbiology, pathology, and histopathology, a retrospective study"
		on 42 dolphins from the US Navy Marine Mammal Program dolphin population was
		conducted (1980 to 2010). A total of 21 (50%) of the dolphins evaluated had
		pneumonia confirmed by histopathology. Bacterial and fungal pneumonia was present
		"in 42.9 and 28.6% of cases (9 and 6 cases), respectively, with Staphylococcus"
		"aureus as the most common confirmed pathogen (4 cases, 19%). Other pathogens"
		"identified as the cause of pneumonia were Cryptococcus neoformans, Erysipelothrix"
		"rhusiopathiae, Histoplasma capsulatum, parainfluenza virus, Proteus species,"
		"Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus zooepidemicus. Neither sex nor age was"
		a predictor of pneumonia. While many of the infections involved disseminated
		"disease, lungs were consistently the most severely affected organs. The present"
		study demonstrates the high susceptibility of dolphins to respiratory infections.
		"Areas that warrant further investigation include eosinophilic pneumonia, chronic"
		"infections, co-infections, and metabolic or iron-storage diseases. There is a"
		continuing need to improve the early diagnosis and effective treatment of
		pneumonia in dolphins.

TI	-	Meningitis admitted to a military hospital: a retrospective case series.
PG	-	1223-6
AB	-	Meningitis is a common admission diagnosis. No case series or descriptive studies
		"on meningitis have recently been published. Additionally, no recent data exist on"
		meningitis in the U.S. Military Health System. We reviewed charts of adult
		patients admitted to Naval Medical Center San Diego between January 2004 and
		December 2008 with an admission diagnosis of meningitis. Charts were excluded if
		"they did not meet our case definition of meningitis, if missing data, or if"
		meningitis was nosocomial or iatrogenic. We reviewed results of cerebrospinal
		"fluid cultures during this period. We compared rates and characteristics, and"
		outcomes of bacterial and aseptic meningitis. Two hundred twenty-one cases met
		"our criteria. Of these, 208 were aseptic. Cerebrospinal fluid polymerase chain"
		reaction testing was positive for enteroviruses and herpes simplex viruses in 42
		"(20.2%) and 17 (8.2%) cases, respectively. Of culture/polymerase chain"
		"reaction/serologically positive cases, the pathogens were Neisseria meningitidis"
		"(3), Streptococcus pneumoniae (3), viridans streptococci (2), Cryptococcus"
		"neoformans (2), Coccidioides immitis (2), and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (1)."
		Three patients had poor outcomes: one died from S. pneumoniae and two had
		"long-term neurologic deficits. Meningitis is a common admission diagnosis, but"
		serious virulent pathogens are uncommon and adverse outcomes are rare.

PG	-	449-454
LID	-	10.1007/s11596-019-2058-7 [doi]
AB	-	Central nervous system (CNS) infections are associated with high mortality rates.
		The clinical presentation of many CNS infections by different pathogens is
		"difficult to distinguish, but the definite diagnosis of the etiology is critical"
		for effective therapy and prognosis. The aim of this study was to explore the
		etiology of CNS infections with definite diagnoses based on data from a clinical
		"microbiology laboratory in Tongji Hospital, a teaching hospital in China,"
		obtained over a six-year period. We conducted a retrospective study on all
		cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens submitted to our clinical microbiology
		"laboratory from September, 2012 to December, 2018. The etiology of CNS infections"
		"caused by Cryptococcus neoformans, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and common bacteria"
		was analyzed. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted on all isolates.
		The results showed that 1972 cases of CNS infections were identified from 18 300
		"CSF specimens. Common bacterial meningitis (BM), cryptococcal meningitis (CM) and"
		"tuberculous meningitis (TM) accounted for 86.3% (677/785), 9.4% (74/785) and 4.3%"
		(34/785) respectively of cases over the six-year period. BM was the most common
		"among the different age groups, followed by CM. Of the TM cases, 44.1% (15/34)"
		"were distributed within the age group of 15-34 years, whereas for CM cases, 52.7%"
		"(39/74) occurred within the 35-54-year age group, and the age distribution of BM"
		"cases was fairly even. Among the bacterial pathogens isolated, Staphylococcus"
		"epidermidis was the most common, accounting for 12.5% (98/785), followed by"
		"Acinetobacter baumannii (ABA) and Staphylococcus aureus (SAU), accounting for"
		11.8% (93/785) and 7.6% (60/785) respectively. The resistance rates to
		"antibiotics were >75%, with the exception of the resistance rate of ABA to"
		"tegafycline, which was <3%. More than 60% of SAU strains displayed resistance to"
		"penicillin, oxacillin, ampicillin/sulbactam, cefazolin, cefuroxime, gentamycin,"
		"tobramycin, erythromycin and levofloxacin, whereas more than 90% of SAU strains"
		"showed susceptibility to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, tegafycline, vancomycin,"
		"teicoplanin and linezolid. For C. neoformans, the susceptibility rates to"
		"amphotericin B, 5-fluorocytosine, fluconazol and voriconazole were >95%. Analysis"
		of samples from patients with CNS infection in a clinical microbiology laboratory
		at a teaching hospital in China over a six-year period indicated that the most
		common etiological agents were the bacteria ABA and SAU. The antibiotic
		"resistance levels of ABA were found to be high and of concern, whereas isolates"
		of C. neoformans were found to be sensitive to antifungal antibiotics.

PG	-	204-8
LID	-	10.1159/000440948 [doi]
AB	-	We present a case of refractory Cryptococcus neoformans meningoencephalitis in an
		immunocompetent woman. Her clinical symptoms did not improve with 6 months of
		"antifungal therapy, and MRI abnormalities, indicating severe meningeal and"
		"cerebral inflammation, persisted despite a decreasing cryptococcal antigen titer."
		"The patient continued to deteriorate despite antifungal therapy, and her"
		condition clearly improved following treatment with adjunctive corticosteroid. We
		postulate that the paradoxical antifungal therapy-related clinical deterioration
		"was due to an immune response to cryptococcal organisms, which responded to"
		corticosteroids. These observations provide rationale for a further evaluation of
		corticosteroids in the management of select cases of C. neoformans central
		nervous system infection.

TI	-	Parasitic infections associated with HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean.
PG	-	129-37
AB	-	This review article seeks to highlight the significance for the Caribbean of
		"major parasitic infections associated with AIDS, encourage awareness of these"
		"opportunistic parasites, and promote familiarity with appropriate diagnostic"
		techniques and their clinical relevance. Specific agents considered include
		Pneumocystis carinii; Toxoplasma gondii; the enteric coccidians Cryptosporidium
		"spp., Isospora belli, and Cyclospora cayetanensis; the hemoflagellates Leishmania"
		spp. and Trypanosoma cruzi; the fungi Histoplasma capsulatum and Cryptococcus
		neoformans; the nematode Strongyloides stercoralis; and the mite Sarcoptes
		"scabiei. These disease agents can be divided into two groups, the"
		"immune-regulated ""endogenous"" parasites (the protozoans P. carinii and T. gondii,"
		and possibly the roundworm S. stercoralis) and intracellular parasites (including
		"the enteric coccidia, hemoflagellates, and fungi). Both in the Caribbean and"
		"elsewhere, the endogenous parasites (particularly P. carinii and T. gondii) are"
		"the most troublesome for AIDS patients, partly because they are likely to be"
		transmitted and establish a benign immunoregulated presence early in the
		"subject's life. Indeed, health management programs for AIDS patients often"
		"routinely include P. carinii prophylaxis, since nearly all such patients who"
		survive long enough are expected to experience an episode of acute P. carinii
		"infection. In contrast, there is no known epidemiologic association between AIDS"
		"and strongyloidiasis in the Caribbean, and the prevalence there of potentially"
		opportunistic hemoflagellates such as Leishmania spp. and Trypanosoma cruzi is
		relatively low.

		Undetermined Significance and Polycythemia Vera: A Case Report and Review of the
		Literature.
PG	-	e12458
LID	-	10.7759/cureus.12458 [doi]
LID	-	e12458
AB	-	Cryptococcosis is a life-threatening opportunistic infection caused by
		Cryptococcus gattii and Cryptococcus neoformans. It affects both immunocompetent
		and immunosuppressed hosts. Disseminated cryptococcal infection is rare in
		"immunocompetent patients, but the cryptococcal disease's neurological sequelae"
		may be more prominent in this group. We present a case of a 58-year-old male
		patient with medical comorbidities of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined
		significance (MGUS) and polycythemia vera. The patient presented with gradual
		worsening of mental status over one week. He was found to have Cryptococcus
		neoformans meningoencephalitis and fungemia. The patient received two weeks of
		liposomal amphotericin B (LAmB) and flucytosine with excellent clinical response.
		"He was discharged on high dose fluconazole, and he returned to the hospital in"
		one week with new-onset hemiplegia and cryptococcomas on imaging. Prolonged
		intravenous (IV) treatment of six weeks duration resulted in significant clinical
		improvement and disease-free state at two years follow-up. This article aims to
		stress the importance of individualized prolonged IV treatment with liposomal
		amphotericin B and flucytosine despite good initial response in patients with
		polycythemia vera and MGUS. This is the first reported case of cryptococcal
		"disease, to the best of our knowledge, in a patient with MGUS and the third case"
		of cryptococcal infection in patients with polycythemia vera in a non-HIV
		non-transplant state. Prolonged individualized IV treatment should be considered
		"in immunocompetent patients with the above conditions, as this condition, if not"
		"adequately treated and relapses, lead to high morbidity and mortality."

TI	-	Fungaemia due to rare yeasts in a tertiary care university centre within 18
		years.
PG	-	488-493
LID	-	10.1111/myc.13072 [doi]
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Fungaemia due to rare yeasts has been recognised as an emerging,"
		"clinically relevant, but less investigated condition. Intrinsic resistance or"
		reduced susceptibility of these species to echinocandins or fluconazole remains
		as a challenge in empirical treatment. OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical
		"characteristics, administered antifungal agents, outcomes of patients with rare"
		yeasts other than Candida (RY-OTC) fungaemia and determine the antifungal
		susceptibility profiles of the isolates. PATIENTS AND METHODS: RY-OTC fungaemia
		between January-2001 and December-2018 were retrospectively evaluated. Antifungal
		susceptibility tests were performed according to CLSI M27-A3. RESULTS: We
		"identified 19 patients with fungaemia due to 20 RY-OTC (8 Trichosporon asahii, 4"
		"Cryptococcus neoformans, 4 Saprochaete capitata, 3 Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, 1"
		Trichosporon mucoides) with an incidence of 2.2% among 859 fungaemia episodes.
		Haematological malignancy was the most common (42%) underlying disorder. In 6
		"patients, RY-OTC fungaemia developed as breakthrough infection while receiving"
		"echinocandins, amphotericin B or fluconazole. Amphotericin B, fluconazole or"
		voriconazole were the drugs of choice for the initial treatment of breakthrough
		"fungaemia. Among patients without previous exposure to antifungals, the most"
		"common empirical treatment was an echinocandin (50%), followed by fluconazole"
		(42%) and amphotericin B (8%). Overall mortality was 47%. Worse outcome was most
		"common among patients receiving echinocandins (83% vs 25%, P < .05). Voriconazole"
		and posaconazole showed the highest in vitro activity against all the isolates
		tested. Amphotericin B MICs were relatively higher and the degree of activity of
		fluconazole and itraconazole was variable. CONCLUSIONS: Early recognition of
		RY-OTC and knowledge about their susceptibility patterns remain crucial in
		initial treatment pending susceptibility data of isolates.

AB	-	The Biofire® Film Array Meningitis Encephalitis (FAME) panel can rapidly diagnose
		common aetiologies but its impact in Colombia is unknown. A retrospective study
		of adults with CNS infections in one tertiary hospital in Colombia. The cohort
		was divided into two time periods: before and after the implementation of the
		"Biofire® FAME panel in May 2016. A total of 98 patients were enrolled, 52 and 46"
		"were enrolled in the Standard of Care (SOC) group and in the FAME group,"
		respectively. The most common comorbidity was human immunodeficiency virus
		infection (47.4%). The median time to a change in therapy was significantly
		"shorter in the FAME group than in the SOC group (3 vs. 137.3 h, P < 0.001). This"
		"difference was driven by the timing to appropriate therapy (2.1 vs. 195 h, P <"
		0.001) by identifying viral aetiologies. Overall outcomes and length of stay were
		no different between both groups (P > 0.2). The FAME panel detected six
		aetiologies that had negative cultures but missed identifying one patient with
		Cryptococcus neoformans. The introduction of the Biofire FAME panel in Colombia
		has facilitated the identification of viral pathogens and has significantly
		reduced the time to the adjustment of empirical antimicrobial therapy.

PG	-	407-10
AB	-	Opportunistic infections caused by fungi are common in human immunodeficiency
		virus (HIV)-infected patients. We focused on severe infections as indicated by
		detectable fungemia. Medical charts available for patients having positive blood
		cultures with fungi at the University of Geneva Hospital were retrospectively
		"(1989 to 2000) reviewed. Of 328 patients with fungemia during the study period,"
		"315 (96%) medical charts were accessible. Of these 315 patients, 37 (12.2%) were"
		"HIV-positive, and 13 (35.1%) died within 6 months from their episode of fungemia."
		This was a lower mortality rate than for the HIV seronegative patients (45.8%).
		"The median and average age of the 34 HIV-positive patients was 37.2 years, and 24"
		(64.9%) were males. Cryptococcus neoformans (n = 14) and Candida albicans (n =
		"12) were the most frequently identified species, followed by Candida glabrata (n"
		"= 3), of which 3 were mixed C. albicans + C. glabrata, Histoplasma capsulatum (n"
		"= 2), and Penicillium marneffei (n = 2). The frequency decreased significantly (p"
		< 0.007) from the time period 1993 to 1996 (n = 21) to the period 1997 to 2000 (n
		= 6). Fungemias in HIV-infected patients have declined significantly since 1996.
		This coincides with the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy
		(HAART).

TI	-	Invasive fungal infections in Kuwait: A retrospective study.
PG	-	279-87
AB	-	A retrospective review of a five year period (1994-1998) revealed that
		opportunistic mycoses caused by ubiquitous fungal pathogens are a serious problem
		in the immunocompromised patient population of Kuwait. Patients with renal
		"transplantation and diabetes mellitus were most susceptible to aspergillosis,"
		"cryptococcosis, and zygomycosis, whereas patients with candidemia/hematogenous"
		candidiasis had multiple risk factors. Basidiobolomycosis of the rectum in a
		"Bangladeshi male, cryptococcosis due to Cryptococcus neoformans var. gatti in an"
		"AIDS patient,fungal peritonitis due to Absidia corymbifera in a patient on"
		"peritoneal dialysis, and endocarditis due to Aspergillus terreus detected by"
		direct microscopic examination and culture of the blood clot are some of the
		notable cases diagnosed during the period under review. The predominance of
		Candida species other than C. albicans as bloodstream pathogens is another
		noteworthy observation. Although outbreaks of C. parapsilosis candidemia in
		neonatal intensive care units contributed significantly to this shift in favour
		"of non-albicans Candida species, a surveillance strategy comprising of molecular,"
		epidemiologic and antifungal susceptibility studies is warranted. With the
		"proposed expansion of organ and bone marrow transplantation facilities in Kuwait,"
		the incidence of opportunistic fungal infections is likely to increase.

		"bottles (Becton-Dickinson Microbiology Systems, Sparks, MD, USA)] from 105"
		"patients, and the results were compared with those obtained using conventional"

		"C. glabrata (18), C. parapsilosis (14), Cryptococcus neoformans (9), Trichosporon"
		"asahii (2), Rhodotorula mucilaginosa (2), Penicillium marneffei (2) and three"
		other species. Multiple species fungaemia (MSF) was detected in ten samples as
		"opposed to six detected using conventional methods. In two discrepant samples,"
		antifungal susceptibility testing revealed that the additionally detected isolate
		had higher MICs of fluconazole. An isolate reported as Rhodotorula glutinis by
		"the Vitek Yeast Biochemical Card (bioMérieux Vitek, Marcy l'Etoile, France) was"
		identified as R. mucilaginosa by the array and the identification by array
		hybridization was confirmed by sequence analysis of the ITS region. A test
		sensitivity of 100% was obtained. The test specificity was 100% according to
		examination of 57 blood samples containing non-target fungal species or bacterium
		"only. From the time at which growth was detected in blood cultures, the entire"
		identification procedure could be completed within 16-24 h.

AB	-	To evaluate the incidence and survival time for AIDS-patients affected by
		different stages of nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infection we performed a
		retrospective study. Data of 1540 hospitalised AIDS-patients was analyzed with
		respect to survival time and incidence rates. The overall incidence rate of NTM
		"following AIDS was 16.6/100 person-years (PY), with an increase from 12.1/100PY"
		(1987-1990) to 18.9/100PY (1991-1994). Antiretroviral therapy (ART) and
		toxoplasmosis prophylaxis reduced the risk of NTM disease whereas CD4 cells <40/
		microl at time of the first AIDS defining illness led to a 2.5 fold higher risk.
		"Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), wasting syndrome and PCP prophylaxis"
		increased the risk of progression from colonization to dissemination.
		"Cryptococcus neoformans infection, wasting syndrome, PCP prophylaxis and CD4"
		cells <40/ microl were linked to immediate NTM dissemination. Though the
		"incidence of NTM dissemination increased by the factor 1.56 in 1991-1994,"
		survival did not differ between patients with and without NTM infection.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Fungal infection of animals or humans are common all over the world.
		"Some of microorganisms like fungi, exist on the skin and can be transmitted onto"
		"other individuals, other animal species or even humans and cause skin infections."
		"Moreover, they can be the causative agents of severe generalized infections"
		especially in immunocompromised individuals. The study aimed to evaluate the most
		frequent etiological agents of skin diseases and to compare the prevalence of
		"animal fungal infections in Poland, and to discuss the possibility of"
		transmission to humans in Poland. RESULTS: The obtained results are culture
		based. The fungi most frequently isolated from group of animals with skin lesions
		"were Malassezia pachydermatis (29.14%), and Candida yeasts (27.07%), and"
		"dermatophytes (23.5%), including Microsporum canis as majority of them (59.25%),"
		"and Trichophyton genus (40.7%), most of them T. mentagrophytes, while Malassezia"
		pachydermatis represented (80%) of isolates in animals with otitis externa. In
		over 19% of positive fungal cultures obtained from external ear canals Candida
		"yeasts, mainly C. albicans, were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Dermatomycoses in"
		"companion animals are caused by both, mycelial fungi and yeasts. Most frequently"
		isolated were Malassezia pachydermatis and Candida spp. Dermatophytes
		"(Trichophyton, Microsporum), were also cultured, but the total number of these"
		isolates seems to decrease. We have not found Cryptococcus neoformans in tested
		clinical samples.

AB	-	Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis (CM) is one of the major causes of mortality and
		"morbidity in immunocompromised patients estimating 650,000 deaths each year."
		"Across the globe, CM has been occasionally seen in apparently immunocompetent"
		patients who otherwise don't have established risk factors. The clinical
		presentation of CM in immunocompetent hosts is subtle and often results in
		complications including persistent neurological deficits and death. We present a
		case of Cryptococcal neoformans meningitis in a diabetic female with no other
		"identified risk factors. Although her clinical presentation was atypical, her"
		clinical course was uncomplicated. The pathophysiology in immunocompetent hosts
		"appears somewhat different, so is the clinical presentation. Since there are no"
		"separate evidence-based treatment recommendations, it is challenging to treat"
		this group of patients. There seems to be a need for further studies for
		"management in CM for HIV negative, non-transplant immunocompetent patients."

TI	-	Preemptive treatment of fungal infection based on plasma (1 --> 3)beta-D-glucan
		levels after liver transplantation.
PG	-	346-51
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive fungal infection remains a major challenge in liver
		transplantation and the mortality rate is high. Early diagnosis and treatment are
		required for better results. PATIENTS: We prospectively measured plasma (1 -->
		3)beta-D-glucan (BDG) levels in 180 living donor liver transplant recipients for
		1 year after surgery. Fungal infection was defined as proposed by the European
		Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group. Preemptive
		treatment (intravenous fluconazole and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) was started
		when the BDG level was greater than 40 pg/ml. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients (13%)
		were diagnosed with invasive fungal infection. The responsible pathogens included
		"Candida spp. in 14 cases, Aspergillus fumigatus in 5, Cryptococcus neoformans in"
		"3, and Pneumocystis jiroveci in 2. Preemptive treatment was performed in 22% of"
		patients (n = 40). Renal impairment and mild gastrointestinal intolerance due to
		the drugs were observed in 28% (11/40) of patients during treatment. Among them
		"14 patients were diagnosed with fungal infection including seven candidiasis,"
		"five aspergillosis, and two Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. The sensitivity and"
		"specificity of BDG for overall fungal infection was 58% and 83%, respectively,"
		"with a positive predictive value of 35% and a negative predictive value of 93%,"
		and a positive likelihood ratio of 3.41 and a negative likelihood ratio of 1.98.
		The overall mortality for fungal infection in our series was 0.6%. CONCLUSION:
		"Although the sensitivity and positive predictive value were low, the low"
		mortality rate after fungal infection and the mild side effects of the preemptive
		"treatment might justify our therapeutic strategy. Based on the effectiveness,"
		this strategy warrants further investigation.

PG	-	2251-61
LID	-	10.1128/JCM.00730-16 [doi]
AB	-	Rapid diagnosis and treatment of infectious meningitis and encephalitis are
		critical to minimize morbidity and mortality. Comprehensive testing of
		"cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) often includes Gram stain, culture, antigen detection,"
		"and molecular methods, paired with chemical and cellular analyses. These methods"
		"may lack sensitivity or specificity, can take several days, and require"
		significant volume for complete analysis. The FilmArray Meningitis/Encephalitis
		"(ME) Panel is a multiplexed in vitro diagnostic test for the simultaneous, rapid"
		(∼1-h) detection of 14 pathogens directly from CSF specimens: Escherichia coli
		"K1, Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, Neisseria meningitidis,"
		"Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, cytomegalovirus, enterovirus,"
		"herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, human herpesvirus 6, human parechovirus,"
		"varicella-zoster virus, and Cryptococcus neoformans/Cryptococcus gattii We"
		"describe a multicenter evaluation of 1,560 prospectively collected CSF specimens"
		with performance compared to culture (bacterial analytes) and PCR (all other
		analytes). The FilmArray ME Panel demonstrated a sensitivity or positive
		percentage of agreement of 100% for 9 of 14 analytes. Enterovirus and human
		"herpesvirus type 6 had agreements of 95.7% and 85.7%, and L. monocytogenes and N."
		"meningitidis were not observed in the study. For S. agalactiae, there was a"
		"single false-positive and false-negative result each, for a sensitivity and"
		"specificity of 0 and 99.9%, respectively. The specificity or negative percentage"
		of agreement was 99.2% or greater for all other analytes. The FilmArray ME Panel
		is a sensitive and specific test to aid in diagnosis of ME. With use of this
		"comprehensive and rapid test, improved patient outcomes and antimicrobial"
		stewardship are anticipated.

		(AIDS). DESIGN: Retrospective. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 222 patients with AIDS
		hospitalized between January 1986 and January 1992 at the Medical University of
		South Carolina hospitals. RESULTS: Pleural effusions occurred in 59 patients for
		an overall incidence of 27%. The mean age of the patients was 35 +/- 2 years (SE)
		and the male to female ratio was 5:1. The cause was infectious in 39 (66%)
		"patients, noninfectious in 18 (31%), and unknown in 2 (3%). Pleural effusions"
		"were caused by bacterial pneumonia in 18 (31%) patients, Pneumocystis carinii"
		"pneumonia in 9 (15%), Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 5 (8%), septic embolism in 2"
		"(3%), Nocardia asteroides in 2 (3%), cryptococcus neoformans in 2 (3%), and"
		Mycobacterium arium intracellulare in 1 (2%). Among noninfectious causes (n =
		"18), hypoalbuminemia was the cause in 11 patients (19%), cardiac failure in 3"
		"(5%), and atelectasis, Kaposi sarcoma, uremic pleurisy, and adult respiratory"
		distress syndrome in 1 (2%) each. Patients with AIDS who had pleural effusions
		had significantly lower serum albumin levels and had lower CD4 counts than did
		those without pleural effusions (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Pleural effusions are
		common in hospitalized patients with AIDS. Bacterial pneumonia is the most common
		cause for pleural effusion in AIDS. Large effusions are associated with Kaposi
		sarcoma and tuberculosis. Hypoalbuminemia is a common cause of noninfectious
		pleural effusions.

AB	-	A retrospective study of bacteremia in children with neutropenic fever admitted
		to a medical center in Taiwan from Jan. 1994 to Dec. 1995 was performed. There
		"were in total 273 episodes of neutropenic fever during this period, but only 79"
		pathogens were isolated from blood specimens in 70 episodes. Klebsiella
		"pneumoniae (27.8%), E. coli (10.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.1%) and"
		Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.6%) were the most common pathogens. All the isolates of
		S. aureus were methicillin sensitive. About half of K. pneumoniae (10/22) was
		"multiple-drug resistant. There were seven infection-related mortality cases,"
		"three due to multiple-drug resistant K. pneumoniae, one due to S. aureus, one"
		alpha-hemolytic streptococcus and two fungemia (Cryptococcus neoformans and
		Fusarium sp.). Vancomycin is not necessary in initial empiric therapy of
		"neutropenic fever, while cefazolin or oxacillin may be included in cases with"
		"central venous access device. Antibiotics to cover intestinal flora, especially"
		"K. pneumoniae, are paramount in our hospital."

LID	-	9032958
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcus infection is an opportunistic infection that occurs
		"primarily among immunocompromised patients, and the morbidity and mortality of"
		this infection is high if left unrecognized and untreated. There are no clinical
		"or radiographic characteristics typical of cryptococcal pneumonia, and its"
		clinical and radiological presentations often overlap with other diagnoses. CASE
		PRESENTATION: We present a case of a 25-year-old man from Ghana admitted for an
		"altered mental state, weight loss, neck pain, fever, and photophobia. He was"
		diagnosed with Cryptococcus neoformans meningitis by cerebrospinal fluid culture
		and with disseminated cryptococcal infection by a positive Cryptococcus blood
		test. Diffuse micronodular opacities were found in a miliary pattern in the upper
		"portions of both lungs upon imaging, which suggested miliary tuberculosis; thus,"
		the patient was started on antituberculosis therapy. The patient underwent
		"flexible fiber optic bronchoscopy, and transbronchial biopsy of the right lung"
		showed bronchopneumonia with fungal spores consistent with filamentous
		"Cryptococcus neoformans, which grew in tissue culture of the right lung."
		"Interferon-gamma release assay, Mycobacterium tuberculosis PCR, and acid-fast"
		bacilli staining of the bronchoalveolar lavage were negative for the M.
		tuberculosis complex. CONCLUSION: The similarities in clinical and imaging
		findings among patients with acute immunodeficiency syndrome with coinfections
		make diagnoses difficult; thus image-guided biopsies are essential to confirm
		diagnoses.

PG	-	50-3
LID	-	10.3340/jkns.2015.57.1.50 [doi]
AB	-	Usually fungal infections caused by opportunistic and pathogenic fungi had been
		an important cause of morbidity and mortality among immunocompromised patients.
		However clinical data and investigations for immunocompetent pathogenic fungal
		infections had been rare and neglected into clinical studies. Especially
		Cryptococcal brainstem abscess cases mimicking brain tumors were also much more
		rare. So we report this unusual case. This 47-year-old man presented with a
		history of progressively worsening headache and nausea for 1 month and several
		days of vomituritions before admission. Neurological and laboratory examinations
		performed demonstrated no abnormal findings. Previously he was healthy and did
		not have any significant medical illnesses. A CT and MRI scan revealed enhancing
		1.8×1.7×2.0 cm mass lesion in the left pons having central necrosis and
		peripheral edema compressing the fourth ventricle. And also positron emission
		tomogram scan demonstrated a hot uptake of fluoro-deoxy-glucose on the brainstem
		lesion without any evidences of systemic metastasis. Gross total mass resection
		was achieved with lateral suboccipital approach with neuronavigation system.
		Postoperatively he recovered without any neurological deficits. Pathologic report
		confirmed Cryptococcus neoformans and he was successively treated with antifungal
		medications. This is a previously unreported rare case of brainstem Cryptococcal
		abscess mimicking brain tumors in immunocompetent host without having any
		apparent typical meningeal symptoms and signs with resultant good neurosurgical
		recovery.

LID	-	10.4103/0377-4929.188143 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: The course of human immunodeficiency virus infection and the acquired
		immunodeficiency syndrome can be complicated by a variety of endocrine
		"abnormalities, including abnormalities of thyroid gland. MATERIALS AND METHODS:"
		This study was designed to understand the spectrum of pathology of thyroid in
		Indian patients with AIDS. The present study describes the findings of
		retrospective autopsy findings of 158 patients with AIDS which revealed
		infectious diseases from a time period before the use of highly active
		"antiretroviral regimen. RESULTS: A wide range of bacterial, fungal, and viral"
		"infections were observed. Tuberculosis was recorded in 14 (09%) patients,"
		Cryptococcus neoformans in 11 (7%) patients and cytomegalovirus in 3 (2%)
		patients. Hashimoto's thyroiditis and lymphocytic thyroiditis were seen in 02
		(01%) patients each. One patient had dual infection comprising of tuberculosis
		and cytomegalovirus infection. The other microscopic findings observed were
		"goiter (2 patients), interstitial fibrosis in thyroid (7 patients), and"
		calcification in thyroid (8 patients). CONCLUSIONS: Abnormalities of thyroid are
		uncommon findings in patients with HIV infection however several case reports of
		thyroid involvement by infectious agents and neoplasm are described in these
		patients; hence patients with HIV infection should be closely followed up for
		development of goiter or abnormalities of thyroid functions.

AB	-	Cryptococcal meningitis is a life-threatening condition caused by a fungal
		"pathogen, Cryptococcus neoformans, that can infect both immunosuppressed and"
		immunocompetent hosts. It is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in
		"severely immunodeficient patients. However, in an immunocompetent patient it"
		"represents a diagnostic challenge, mainly because it is extremely rare, but also"
		because of its nonspecific clinical manifestation. Neurovascular involvement in
		cryptococcal meningitis is rare and not well known and only few reports have
		described this association. We describe a cryptococcal meningitis in an
		immunocompetent patient associated with central nervous system vasculitis.

TI	-	Symptomatic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in Papua New Guinea.
PG	-	783-8
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection was first detected in
		Papua New Guinea (PNG) in 1987. By August 1995 a total of 323 persons had been
		diagnosed as HIV antibody positive nationwide and seroprevalence rates were
		climbing. This study was prompted by a lack of data on the clinical syndromes
		associated with HIV infection in Melanesian adults. AIMS: To describe the
		clinical and epidemiological features of symptomatic HIV infection in adult
		Melanesians. METHODS: A largely retrospective study of patients was admitted to
		the medical wards of the Port Moresby general hospital between January 1990 and
		September 1995. Clinical records of patients with antibody to HIV were studied
		"and clinical, laboratory and epidemiological data were recorded. RESULTS: Seventy"
		"patients were studied and the majority were young, urban dwelling adults from a"
		variety of social groups. The sex distribution was even. Common clinical
		"syndromes associated with HIV infection were chronic diarrhoea (47.8%), wasting"
		(94.2%) and oropharyngeal candidiasis (68.7%). Tuberculosis was suspected in
		68.6% and cryptococcal meningitis was detected in 8.6% including one patient with
		Cryptococcus. neoformans var. gattii infection. There was a high mortality (53%)
		in patients admitted to hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with HIV infection in PNG
		present to hospital late in their disease course. Clinical syndromes are similar
		to those observed in Africa and mortality on first admission is high. The major
		mode of transmission is heterosexual and sexually transmitted diseases and
		promiscuity are probably important factors in facilitating spread.

TI	-	Transthoracic needle aspiration in the study of pulmonary infections in patients
		with HIV.
PG	-	697-702
AB	-	STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of transthoracic aspiration
		with an ultrathin needle in the microbiologic diagnosis of pulmonary infections
		in HIV-infected patients. DESIGN: Retrospective review of cases. SETTING: A
		"500-bed teaching hospital in Lleida, Spain. PATIENTS: Forty-five HIV-infected"
		patients admitted between March 1989 and March 1993 with clinical and
		roentgenographic evidence of pulmonary infection and without contraindications
		for transthoracic needle aspiration (TNA). INTERVENTIONS: Forty-seven TNAs were
		performed in the emergency room (20) or during hospitalization (27). The TNA
		procedures were done without premedication and without fluoroscopic guidance.
		Specimens were processed using routine microbiologic and cytologic techniques; in
		"addition, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Pneumocystis carinii was carried"
		out since March 1992. Development of adverse effects was carefully evaluated.
		RESULTS: The TNA was effective in 29 (62 percent) out of 47 procedures. The
		"diagnosis was obtained for 14 of 15 patients with P carinii pneumonia, 8 out of"
		"14 patients with bacterial pneumonia, and 4 out of 12 patients with tuberculosis."
		"Other pathogens recovered were Nocardia asteroides, Cryptococcus neoformans,"
		"Rhodococcus equi, and Mycobacterium avium. No false-positive results were"
		"obtained. Pneumothorax developed in eight (17 percent) procedures, but only one"
		procedure resulted in a pleural drainage; the incidence of other adverse effects
		was low and clinically irrelevant. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that TNA can be
		a useful technique in establishing the etiologic diagnosis of pulmonary
		"infections in HIV-infected patients, with a good sensitivity, high specificity,"
		"and relatively low incidence of serious complications, with TNA appearing as a"
		reliable alternative to more uncomfortable methods.

AB	-	Cryptococcus neoformans is a microscopic fungus that despite its pervasiveness in
		the environment rarely causes infection in immunocompetent patients. In
		"immunosuppressed patients, infections involving the central nervous system (CNS)"
		usually present as meningitis or meningoencephalitis. Cryptococcal infections are
		known to cause significant morbidity and mortality in immunosuppressed patients
		as it is difficult to eradicate even with adequate antifungal treatment. A
		"44-year-old Hispanic male presented to the hospital with headache, progressive"
		"urinary retention, neck and back pain, and right upper and bilateral lower"
		extremity weakness for five days. Imaging revealed small foci in the white matter
		and revealed diffuse abnormal signal involving the cervical medullary junction
		extending up to the thoracic spine. Analysis of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF)
		obtained via lumbar puncture was positive for the Streptococcus antigen with
		"cultures also growing Cryptococcus neoformans. Upon evaluation, patient was not"
		found to be immunocompromised. This report works to highlight an atypical
		presentation of a cryptococcal CNS infection to raise awareness amongst
		clinicians hoping to prevent a delay in diagnosis of this disease given its high
		mortality.

PG	-	191-8
LID	-	10.1111/j.1468-1293.2008.00674.x [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Although many studies have been carried out on pulmonary diseases in
		"HIV-infected patients, studies specifically investigating the aetiologies of"
		cavitary lung lesions are rare. METHODS: HIV-infected patients enrolled in a
		cohort study who presented with cavitary lung lesions by radiography were
		identified between June 1994 and March 2008. Medical records and radiological and
		microbiological data for these patients were retrospectively reviewed using a
		"standardized case collection form. RESULTS: During the 14-year study period, 73"
		episodes of cavitary lung lesions were diagnosed in 66 of 1790 (3.7%)
		"HIV-infected patients. At the diagnosis of cavitary lung lesions, the median CD4"
		count was 25 cells/microL (range 1-575 cells/microL). Eighty-one pathogens were
		"considered causative, with fungi being the most common aetiology (42.0%),"
		"followed by bacteria (29.6%) and mycobacteria (25.9%). Of the fungal pneumonias,"
		"19 (55.9%) were caused by Penicillium marneffei, 11 (32.4%) by Cryptococcus"
		"neoformans, two (5.9%) by Pneumocystis jirovecii, and two (5.9%) by Aspergillus"
		"species. During the study period, 11 of 205 patients (5.4%) who were diagnosed as"
		"having tuberculosis presented with cavitary lung lesions, compared with 19 of 36"
		patients (52.8%) with penicilliosis and 11 of 64 patients (17.2%) with
		cryptococcosis (P<0.0001). The median CD4 count of patients with cavitary lung
		lesions resulting from tuberculosis (115 cells/microL) was significantly higher
		than that of patients with cavitary lung lesions resulting from penicilliosis (4
		cells/microL) and cryptococcosis (29.5 cells/microL). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings
		suggest that invasive infections attributable to endemic fungi were the leading
		"cause of cavitary lung lesions among patients in the late stage of HIV infection,"
		and were more common than infections attributable to bacteria and mycobacteria.

AB	-	Cryptococcal meningitis typically occurs in immunocompromised patients.
		"Approximately 80% of cryptococcal infections occur in HIV patients. Non-HIV,"
		non-transplant recipient patients are the least numerous population groups
		affected by cryptococcal infections. While this group includes patients on
		"biologics and corticosteroids, very few cases have been reported in patients on"
		"azathioprine. Cryptococcal meningitis requires antifungal therapy, the duration"
		of which varies among different population groups. Inadequate duration of
		antibiotics among these groups is one of the most common reasons for relapse;
		"therefore, it is crucial to consider patient demographic when determining"
		"antifungal duration. Here, we report a 68-year-old male with a history of mixed"
		"connective tissue disease on azathioprine for six years, who was admitted to the"
		"hospital with worsening lethargy. Several days into admission, the patient"
		developed low-grade fevers. Subsequent blood cultures grew Cryptococcus
		neoformans. He was started on liposomal amphotericin B. Lumbar puncture (LP) was
		"done, which demonstrated positive cryptococcal antigen, and flucytosine was added"
		to the treatment regimen. Repeat CSF culture demonstrated no fungal organisms.
		Amphotericin B was discontinued after 20 days of therapy. Following clinical
		"improvement, he was subsequently discharged on oral fluconazole. One week"
		"following discharge, the patient was readmitted with worsening fevers and altered"
		mental status. CSF studies demonstrated the growth of Cryptococcus on culture.
		"Liposomal amphotericin B was reinitiated, and fluconazole was continued. Imaging"
		"showed hydrocephalus, which worsened despite ventriculoperitoneal shunt. The"
		"patient expired following transition to comfort care. In conclusion, cryptococcal"
		"meningitis should be considered as a differential in non-HIV, non-transplant"
		"patients on azathioprine presenting with fever and worsening lethargy, and 4-6"
		weeks of induction therapy is required in this patient group to prevent relapse.

		immunosuppressive therapy which makes them highly vulnerable to opportunistic
		fungal infections .These infections can be cutaneous or systemic. Several fungi

		"neoformans, P. carinii, and zygomycetes group of fungi. Cutaneous infections are"
		"most commonly caused by Pityriasis (tinea) versicolor, dermatophytes, and candida"
		sp but these days the demtiaceous fungi are becoming more frequently reported
		.Here we report a case of post renal transplant cutaneous infection caused by

PG	-	441-7
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Penicillium marneffei, an endemic fungus in Southeast Asia and"
		"southern China, is the cause of opportunistic infection in HIV-infected patients"
		"who may present with symptoms and signs of the lungs, and abnormal chest"
		"radiographs. However, only a few cases of pulmonary infection from this organism"
		have been reported. OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical manifestations of patients
		with Penicillium marneffei pneumonia diagnosed by sputum or bronchoalveolar
		lavage (BAL) fluid culture MATERIAL AND METHOD: Retrospective descriptive study
		of patients who were diagnosed with Penicillium marneffei pneumonia at Maharaj
		Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital from September 1999 to July 2004. RESULTS: Twelve
		"patients (eight males, four females) were included with mean age of 36.1 years."
		"Nine cases were HIV-infected. Their presenting symptoms included fever, cough,"
		"dyspnea and weight loss. Skin lesions, hepatomegaly and lymphadenopathy were"
		"extrapulmonary signs. Chest radiographs revealed diffuse reticulonodular, diffuse"
		"reticular, localized alveolar, localized reticular infiltration, and cavitary"
		lesion. The diagnosis was made by cultures from the sputum in five cases and BAL
		"fluid in the others. Co-infections with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella"
		"pneumoniae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Cryptococcus neoformans, and"
		Strongyloides stercoralis were found. Most of them were treated by intravenous
		"amphotericin B followed by oral itraconazole, or oral itraconazole. CONCLUSION:"
		"Penicillium marneffei pneumonia has non-specific clinical manifestations, it"
		cannot be excluded from other infections and may have co-infections. Physicians
		should include this infection in their differential diagnosis especially in
		immunocompromised patients.

PG	-	822-4
LID	-	10.1016/j.transproceed.2008.02.049 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the epidemiology of bacterial
		and fungal pneumonia in lung transplant (LT) recipients and to assess
		donor-to-host transmission of these microorganisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We
		retrospectively studied all positive cultures from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)
		of 49 lung transplant recipients and their donors from August 2003 to April 2007.
		RESULTS: There were 108 episodes of pneumonia during a medium follow-up of 412
		"days (range, 1-1328 days). The most frequent microorganisms were: Pseudomonas"
		"aeruginosa (n = 36; 33.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 29; 26.8%), and"
		Aspergillus spp. (n = 18; 16%). Other fungal infections were due to Fusarium
		"spp., Cryptococcus neoformans, and Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. Of the 31"
		"donors with positive BAL, 15 had S. aureus. There were 21 pretransplant colonized"
		recipients (43%) and 16 of them had suppurative underlying lung disease. P.
		aeruginosa was the most frequent colonizing organism (59% of pretransplant
		positive cultures). There were 11 episodes of bacteremia and lungs were the
		source in 5 cases. Sixteen deaths occurred and 6 (37.5%) were due to infection.
		Statistical analyses showed association between pretransplant colonizing
		microorganisms from suppurative lung disease patients and pneumonias after lung
		transplantation (RR = 4.76; P = .04; 95% CI = 1.02-22.10). No other analyzed
		factor was significant. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial and fungal infections are frequent
		and contribute to higher mortality in lung transplant recipients. P. aeruginosa
		is the most frequent agent of respiratory infections. This study did not observe
		any impact of donor lung organisms on pneumonia after lung transplantation.
		"Nevertheless, we demonstrated an association between pretransplant colonizing"
		microorganisms and early pneumonias in suppurative lung transplant recipients.

TI	-	Fungal endophthalmitis: fourteen years' experience from a center in India.
PG	-	1400-7
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: As fungal endophthalmitis is an emerging challenge, the study was"
		carried out to determine the prevalence and the spectrum of fungal agents causing
		"endophthalmitis from a single center, to identify the risk factors, and to"
		correlate clinical course of illness with the agents involved. METHODS: The
		microbiological and clinical records of all fungal endophthalmitis diagnosed
		during January 1992 through December 2005 at a tertiary center in India were
		"reviewed retrospectively. During this period, treatment protocol of the patients"
		"with fungal endophthalmitis was pars plana vitrectomy, instillation of"
		intravitreal amphotericin B (5 microg) and dexamethasone (400 microg).
		"Additionally, oral fluconazole (27 patients) or itraconazole (78 patients) was"
		given in 105 patients. RESULTS: Fungal endophthalmitis was diagnosed in 113
		"patients and they were categorized into: postcataract surgery (53 patients),"
		"posttrauma (48), and endogenous (12) groups. Aspergillus species was the most"
		"common (54.4%) agent isolated, followed by yeasts (24.6%), and melanized fungi"
		"(10.5%). Among Aspergilli, Aspergillus flavus was the most common (24.6%) species"
		whereas Candida tropicalis (8.8%) was in the yeast. Other rare agents isolated
		"include Fonsecaea pedrosoi, Fusarium solani, Paecilomyces lilacinus,"
		"Pseudallescheria boydii, Colletotrichum dematium, Cryptococcus neoformans, and"
		"Trichosporon cutaneum. Visual acuity after therapy remained <20/400 in 77.4%,"
		"64.3%, 50.0%, and 16.7% patients infected with Aspergillus species, yeasts,"
		"melanized fungi and other mycelial fungi, respectively. The outcome was"
		"unfavorable in 52.8%, 66.7%, and 33.3% patients with postoperative, posttrauma,"
		"and endogenous groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the largest"
		series of fungal endophthalmitis from a single center and highlights the fact
		that a vast array of fungi can cause endophthalmitis though Aspergilli are the
		common agents. The combination of pars plana vitrectomy and intravitreal
		amphotericin B with or without fluconazole/itraconazole was the common mode of
		"therapy in such patients. However, the main challenge is suspecting fungal"
		etiology at the time of presentation and accurately diagnosing those patients.

AB	-	Cryptococcosis is a serious systemic mycosis. Its incidence has escalated in the
		past four decades. Cryptococcus neoformans causes localized or disseminated
		infection in immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients. The capsulated form
		is commonly encountered which can be diagnosed on an India ink preparation or
		"antigen detection. However, the noncapsulated forms are very rare and require a"
		"high index of suspicion for correct diagnosis. Herein, we present a case of"
		cryptococcal meningitis due to a noncapsulated strain in an apparently
		immunocompetent patient with no proven immunodeficiencies along with review of
		world literature. Such cases are a diagnostic challenge for the clinician as well
		as microbiologist.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Acute meningitis and encephalitis (AME) is a syndrome of central
		"nervous system (CNS) infections, which could lead to neurological damage and"
		fatality. This study evaluates the multiplex FilmArray® ME Panel which is aimed
		to diagnose agents causing suspect CNS infections in north India. METHODS: A
		total number of 969 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples collected between August
		2016 and January 2018 from patients who showed clinical symptoms of CNS
		infections were analyzed using the FilmArray® ME Panel. Also a comparison of
		molecular diagnosis and various laboratory and radiological findings for
		"Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterovirus and Cryptococcus neoformans positive cases"
		"was done. RESULT: Out of the 969 CSF samples, 101 cases were found to be positive"
		"for viral (n = 55), bacterial (n = 38), fungal (n = 7), and poly-microbial"
		"(n = 1) agents. Out of the 55 viral positive cases, the most detected pathogen"
		"was Enterovirus (n = 23) with predominance in the age group of 2-17 years,"
		followed by Varicella Zoster virus (n = 14) and HSV1(n = 9) cases. Streptococcus
		"pneumoniae (n = 26) was found to be the predominant bacterial pathogen, of which"
		17 were detected in the age group above 35 years. Cryptococcus neoformans was
		found in 7 cases. CONCLUSION: The FilmArray® ME Panel aids in rapid detection of
		"14 pathogens directly from CSF. When compared to gram stain, culture, antigen"
		"detection, and CSF biochemical analysis, the FilmArray® ME Panel has detected"
		"more cases, some of which are difficult to diagnose by conventional methods. This"
		"rapid technology will help the clinicians in case of early patient management,"
		outcomes and provide aid in antimicrobial stewardship.

		with new generation therapies: Results from a multi-centre cohort study.
PG	-	30-34
LID	-	10.1111/myc.13178 [doi]
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: A multi-centre study to determine the outcomes and risks for
		invasive fungal disease (IFD) in myeloma (MM) patients treated with
		"second-generation immunomodulatory drugs, proteasome inhibitors and monoclonal"
		antibodies was conducted. METHODS: Clinical and microbiology records were
		"reviewed to capture patient demographics, disease characteristics, treatment, IFD"
		episodes and outcomes. Categorical and continuous variables between patients with
		"IFD and without IFD were compared using chi-square test, Fisher's exact test and"
		"Mann-Whitney rank sum test, respectively, with P-value < .05 considered"
		statistically significant. RESULTS: Five out of 148 (3.4%) MM patients were
		"diagnosed with five episodes of IFI: 3 were proven, 1 probable and 1 possible."
		Median time from commencement of new generation therapy to IFD diagnosis was
		"4.0 months (Interquartile range [IQR]: 3.4-5.7). In patients with IFD, median"
		cumulative steroid dose over 60 days was 1119 mg (IQR: 1066-1333 mg). None of the
		patients with IFD had prolonged neutropenia (neutrophil count < 0.5 × 10(9) /L
		for more than 10 days). Common sites of infection were the respiratory tract
		(40.0%) and bloodstream (40.0%). Cryptococcus neoformans (n = 2) and Candida
		krusei (n = 1) were the fungal pathogens isolated in the three proven cases.
		30-day mortality rate was 40.0%. Patients with IFD were younger (median 58 versus
		"68 years, P = .52) and treated with more lines of therapy (median 5 vs 3,"
		P = .04). CONCLUSION: IFD rate is low in heavily treated MM patients treated with
		second-generation therapy including monoclonal antibodies. Patients do not appear
		to have traditional risk factors such as prolonged neutropenia.

AB	-	Invasive cryptococcosis is the third most common invasive fungal infection among
		organ transplant recipients.(1) The most frequently encountered clinical
		manifestation is cryptococcal meningoencephalitis (CM) which may be easily missed
		because of varying clinical presentations. 1-year mortality is estimated at
		20-30% even with long-term consolidated antifungal therapy. Here we report a case
		of combined pulmonary and cryptococcal meningitis in a renal allograft recipient.
		This case illustrates the difficulty of estimating the real extent of the disease
		when only clinical features are considered. The patient presented with
		nonspecific symptoms. Chest computed tomography (CT) scans revealed multiple
		pulmonary nodular shadows. The CT-guided biopsy of the pulmonary nodule clinched
		the diagnosis of pulmonary cryptococcosis (PC). The central nervous system (CNS)
		cryptococcosis was proved by positive culture and crypto-LA antigen in the
		"cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). HOW TO CITE THIS ARTICLE: Shastri PS, Kumar R, Gupta"

PG	-	79-81
AB	-	BACKGROUND: There are several reported cases that describe female genital tract
		"infections with opportunistic fungi, such as Blastomyces dermatitidis,"
		"Coccidioides immitis, Aspergillus flavus, Cryptococcus neoformans and Mucor. We"
		describe a case of paracoccidiodomycosis limited to the uterine cervix. To the
		"best of our knowledge, no such case has been described before in the"
		"English-language literature. CASE: A 27-year-old, healthy female, gravida 3, para"
		"2, abortion 1, presented for a routine gynecologic examination at six weeks'"
		postpartum. Her past medical history was unremarkable. A routine
		cervical/endocervical smear revealed the presence of multiple fungal forms at
		"different stages of development with a characteristic ""pilot's wheel"" appearance"
		consistent with Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. Detailed medical examination of
		the patient did not reveal the presence of the primary infection in any other
		system. Cultures of the endometrium revealed no growth of the fungal organisms.
		"The patient was asymptomatic, and therefore no therapy was initiated. Repeat"
		Papanicolaou smears were negative for organisms. CONCLUSION:
		"Paracoccidioidomycosis can present as a limited form, involving the cervix only."
		Identification and recognition of the infection are important in cytopathology.

AB	-	Infectious Cryptococcus neoformans occurs primarily in immunocompromised
		"patients. The primary organ affected is the lungs, but the infection of the"
		central nervous system (CNS) is also be seen. Disseminated cryptococcosis can
		"involve any organ in the body. However, hepatic involvement is rare. Here we"
		discuss a case of cryptococcal hepatitis in a patient who presented with
		persistently elevated liver enzymes. A 56-year-old Ecuadorian female with no
		"known past medical history presented with fever, abdominal pain, nausea,"
		"unintentional weight loss, and diarrhea for two months. Her liver function tests"
		"(LFTs) revealed elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST: 415 U/L), elevated"
		"alanine aminotransferase (ALT: 201 U/L), elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP: 763"
		"U/L), but normal total bilirubin (0.9 mg/dl). Her HIV antigen screening was"
		"reactive, and the absolute cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) helper count was 22"
		"cell/µL. Over the course of her hospital stay, the patient's liver enzymes"
		"continued to trend upward, with negative Histoplasma antibodies and negative"
		"serum cryptococcal antigen titers. During the second week of hospitalization, her"
		"liver enzymes continued to rise with an ALP of 4046 U/L, AST of 436 U/L, and ALT"
		of 276 U/L. With a persistent elevation of the liver enzymes without any
		"definitive cause, an ultrasound-guided biopsy was performed. Pathology revealed"
		"cryptococcal hepatitis, and the patient was started on a 15-day course of"
		amphotericin B with an eight-week course of fluconazole 400 mg with LFTs nearly
		normalizing at six weeks. This case demonstrates an unusual manifestation of
		cryptococcosis. Our patient did not present with the typical cryptococcal
		"pulmonary or central nervous system infection. Additionally, our patient's serum"
		"cryptococcal antigen titers were negative, but biopsy results revealed"
		"cryptococcal hepatitis, despite a very high sensitivity and specificity of the"
		serum cryptococcal antigen test. This case demonstrates the importance of
		"maintaining a broad differential, specifically in immunocompromised patients."

		was identified on necropsy in 4 of 23 (17%) dogs (Cryptococcus neoformans [n =
		"2], Neospora caninum [n = 1], and Baylisascaris procyonis [n = 1]). Each of these"
		dogs had progressive neurologic deterioration. Sixteen dogs had idiopathic EME.
		Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings were abnormal in 7 of 13 dogs with EME;
		2 dogs had focal lesions and 5 dogs had multifocal lesions. Clinical signs in 12
		of 16 (75%) dogs with idiopathic EME resolved with prednisone treatment. Three
		dogs with acute intervertebral disc herniations recovered after decompressive
		surgery alone. CONCLUSIONS: Idiopathic EME is a common cause of eosinophilic
		pleocytosis in dogs. MRI findings are variable. Infectious causes of EME were
		less common and had a poor prognosis.

AB	-	Histoplasmosis and cryptococcosis are systemic fungal diseases frequently
		"encountered in immunocompromised hosts, particularly in patients with HIV/AIDS"
		"with low CD4 counts. However, co-infection with histoplasmosis and cryptococcosis"
		"is an uncommon clinical scenario, hence carrying the risk of under diagnosis by"
		"medical professionals. For instance, when one infection is identified, most"
		health professionals will have a low suspicion for an additional co-infection.
		"Here, we report the case of a 71-year-old gentleman with a new diagnosis of"
		myasthenia gravis (MG) requiring recent steroid therapy who presented with
		recurrent respiratory symptoms despite treatment for community acquired
		pneumonia. Bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were performed; BAL
		samples revealed presence of Cryptococcus neoformans and histoplasma antigen
		(Ag). Serum cryptococcal Ag and urine histoplasma Ag returned positive as well.
		"The patient then required inpatient treatment with amphotericin B, with eventual"
		transition to oral fluconazole at discharge. Pulmonology and Infectious disease
		consults assisted in appropriate diagnosis and management of this rare
		presentation. Given the high prevalence of immunocompromised states in a myriad
		"of medical co-morbidities, it is important to highlight this case to create"
		awareness regarding possibility of concomitant systemic fungal diseases.

TI	-	Pleural effusions in patients with AIDS.
PG	-	122-5
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To describe the range of pathology causing pleural effusions in HIV
		infected patients with acute respiratory episodes and to attempt to identify
		whether any associated radiological abnormalities enabled aetiological
		discrimination. METHODS: Prospective study of chest radiographs of 58 consecutive
		"HIV infected patients with pleural effusion and their microbiological,"
		"cytological, and histopathological diagnoses. RESULTS: A specific diagnosis was"
		"made in all cases. Diagnoses were Kaposi's sarcoma, 19 patients; para-pneumonic"
		"effusion, 16 patients; tuberculosis, eight patients; Pneumocystis carinii"
		"pneumonia, six patients; lymphoma, four patients; pulmonary embolus, two"
		"patients; and heart failure, aspergillus/leishmaniasis, and Cryptococcus"
		"neoformans, one case each. Most effusions (50/58) were small. Bilateral effusions"
		were commoner in Kaposi's sarcoma (12/19) and lymphoma (3/4) than in
		para-pneumonic effusion (3/16). Concomitant interstitial parenchymal shadowing
		"did not aid discrimination. A combination of bilateral effusions, focal air space"
		"consolidation, intrapulmonary nodules, and/or hilar lymphadenopathy suggests"
		Kaposi's sarcoma. Unilateral effusion with focal air space consolidation suggests
		para-pneumonic effusion if intrapulmonary nodules are absent: if miliary nodules
		"and/or mediastinal lymphadenopathy are detected, this suggests tuberculosis."
		CONCLUSIONS: A wide variety of infectious and malignant conditions cause pleural
		"effusions in HIV infected patients, the most common cause in this group was"
		Kaposi's sarcoma. The presence of additional radiological abnormalities such as
		"focal air space consolidation, intrapulmonary nodules, and mediastinal"
		lymphadenopathy aids aetiological discrimination.

TI	-	Epidemiology of bloodstream infections and predictive factors of mortality among
		HIV-infected adult patients in Thailand in the era of highly active
		antiretroviral therapy.
PG	-	28-32
AB	-	Few studies have described the pattern of bloodstream infections (BSI) among
		"HIV-infected patients in the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era,"
		particularly in resource-limited settings. A retrospective cohort study was
		conducted among 140 HIV-infected patients who had a positive blood culture from
		"2004-2008. Of the 140 patients, 91 (65%) were male with a mean (SD) age of 38"
		(9.1) years and a median (IQR) CD4 cell count of 32 (9-112) cells/mm(3).
		Community-acquired infection was detected in 89% of patients. The blood cultures
		"contained Gram-negative bacteria, 40%; fungi, 24%; Mycobacterium spp., 20%; and"
		"Gram-positive bacteria, 16%. Common causative pathogens were Cryptococcus"
		"neoformans, 21%; Salmonella spp., 15%; and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, 12%."
		"Common focal sites of infection were the central nervous system, 24%; respiratory"
		"tract, 20%; and gastrointestinal tract, 18%. CD4 cell count (OR, 0.61 per 50"
		"cells/mm(3) increment; 95% CI, 0.39-0.96; P = 0.031) was the only factor"
		associated with mycobacterial or fungal BSI. The crude mortality was 21%. HAART
		"(OR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.01-0.77; P = 0.017), focal infection (OR, 0.31; 95% CI,"
		"0.10-0.97; P = 0.044), and complication (e.g., shock) (OR, 9.26; 95% CI,"
		"3.25-26.42; P < 0.001) were the predictive factors of mortality. In conclusion,"
		opportunistic infections are still the leading causes of BSI among HIV-infected
		patients in the HAART era.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Papiliotrema laurentii is one of several non-neoformans cryptococci
		"that have rarely been associated with human infection, since it was previously"
		"considered saprophyte and thought to be non-pathogenic to humans. Nevertheless,"
		"increasing number of reports of human infection have emerged in recent years,"
		mostly in oncologic patients. AIM: To report a case of a female patient with
		pyloric obstructive cancer with a catheter-related Papiliotrema laurentii blood
		stream infection and systematically review the available evidence on P. laurentii
		infection in humans. METHODS: Retrieval of studies was based on Medical Subject
		"Headings and Health Sciences Descriptors, which were combined using Boolean"
		"operators. Searches were run on the electronic databases Scopus, Web of Science,"
		"MEDLINE (PubMed), BIREME (Biblioteca Regional de Medicina), LILACS (Latin"
		"American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature), Cochrane Library for"
		Systematic Reviews and Opengray.eu. There was no language or date of publication
		restrictions. The reference lists of the studies retrieved were searched
		manually. RESULTS: The search strategy retrieved 1703 references. In the final
		"analysis, 31 references were included, with the description of 35 cases. Every"
		patient but one had a previous co-morbidity - 48.4 % of patients had a neoplasm.
		Amphotericin B was the most used treatment and only a single case of resistance
		to it was reported. Most patients were cured of the infection. CONCLUSION: P.
		laurentii infection in humans is usually associated to neoplasia and multiple
		"co-morbidities, and amphotericin B seems to be a reliable agent for treatment."

TI	-	Cardiac tamponade in a patient with AIDS: a review of pericardial disease in
		patients with HIV infection.
PG	-	33-9
AB	-	Pericarditis in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection may be
		"asymptomatic or symptomatic, but is sometimes overlooked because of signs and"
		symptoms of other organ system diseases. A case report of cardiac tamponade in a
		patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is presented. To determine
		"the incidence and causes of pericardial disease in patients with HIV infection, a"
		review of the literature was conducted. Fifteen autopsy and echocardiographic
		series involving 1139 patients with HIV infection reveal that the average
		incidence of pericardial disease is 21%. Most cases are asymptomatic and without
		"an identifiable cause. However, in those that are symptomatic, about two thirds"
		are caused by infection or neoplasm; one third have an undetermined etiology. In
		"the 66 published cases of cardiac tamponade in patients with HIV infection, 26%"
		"are caused by tuberculosis, 17% are purulent, and 8% are caused by Mycobacterium"
		avium-intracellulare (MAI). Lymphoma and Kaposi's sarcoma are each responsible
		for 5% of the effusions. Less frequent causes of tamponade are Cryptococcus
		"neoformans, cytomegalovirus, and Mycobacterium kansasii. Small asymptomatic"
		pericardial effusions in patients with HIV infection do not require diagnostic
		"evaluation. However, large symptomatic pericardial effusions should be"
		"investigated, because two thirds are caused by potentially treatable infections"
		or neoplasms.

AB	-	Recipients of solid organ transplants are at risk for a variety of infections due
		to their immunocompromised status. The types of infections are often correlated
		"to the timing from their transplant. After about six to twelve months, transplant"
		"recipients remain at risk for typical community acquired pathogens, late viral"
		"infections, and fungal infections including atypical molds such as"
		Cladophialophora bantiana. C. bantiana is a dematiaceous fungus that has a
		predilection for infecting the brain and is the most common cause of cerebral
		phaeohyphomycosis - a term used to describe infections caused by molds that
		produce dark cell walls. Patients with cerebral abscesses due to C. bantiana
		infections have an estimated mortality of about 70%. Improved outcomes have been
		seen in patients who receive both surgical and antifungal therapy. While there
		"are no clear guidelines on antifungal therapy, most cases have been treated with"
		"combination amphotericin B, a triazole (itraconazole, voriconazole, or"
		posaconazole) with flucytosine sometimes in conjunction as well. This case
		describes a patient with C. bantiana brain abscess and concurrent Cryptococcus
		neoformans pulmonary infection that occurred twenty years after his kidney
		transplantation. He was treated successfully with two craniotomies for cerebral
		abscess debridement and liposomal amphotericin B followed by planned lifelong
		voriconazole.

PG	-	77
LID	-	10.1186/1756-0500-6-77 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive fungal infections caused by uncommon fungi have increased in
		recent years. Hospitalized low-birth-weight infants are at high risk for neonatal
		"fungal infections. Pichia fabianii is a rare pathogen causing blood infection,"
		which has reportedly caused only 4 cases of fungemia and 1 case of endocarditis
		"worldwide. Here, we describe the first case of a P. fabianii blood infection in a"
		"premature infant in China. CASE PRESENTATION: On July 28th, a low-birth-weight"
		"(LBW, 1760 g) female infant born at 33+4 weeks of gestation was admitted to the"
		"pediatric intensive care unit with mild neonatal asphyxia. Until August 2nd, a"
		mechanical respirator was used to assist respiration under the Continuous
		Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) model. The baby had an increased body temperature
		"and a fever. To prevent infection, Ceftriaxone Sodium (CS) was administered"
		"intravenously for three days, after which Cefepime was administered until August"
		13th. Chest X-rays showed suspected plaque-like shadows in the right lung. Blood
		cultures twice tested positive for fungal infection caused by Candida pelliculosa
		"(recognized as Pichia fabianii later), which is first mis-identified by"
		"commercial kit. Hence, intravenous fluconazole was administered. However,"
		"cultures of other body fluids (e.g., urine, feces and sputum) tested negative for"
		fungal infection. Routine tests and biochemistry of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
		were normal. Latex agglutination of Cryptococcus neoformans and fungi cultures in
		"the CSF were also negative. After 14 days of intravenous fluconazole, blood was"
		"re-cultured, the result of which was negative. On August 30th, intravenous"
		"fluconazole was suspended. On Sep 3rd, the infant left the hospital in good"
		health. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first case of a blood infection caused by P.
		fabianii in a LBW premature female infant in China. Risk factors for fungal
		"infection include premature birth, as well as mechanical invasive operation and"
		antibacterial drug usage. Whether such risk factors necessitate prophylactic use
		of antifungal drugs is an important question that has yet to be fully addressed.
		"Additionally, the pathogen P. fabianii collected in this study was resistant to"
		amphotericin B (AMB) and itraconazole (ITR). With the exception of the
		"azole-resistant endocarditis case, all other cases have not demonstrated such a"
		"resistance. Finally, commercial biochemical methods used in routine practice are"
		limited in their ability to identify P. fabianii. Molecular genetic based methods
		are imperative for identification of uncommon fungal species from disseminated
		infections.

PG	-	399

LID	-	399
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Disseminated cryptococcosis is a well-characterized complication in
		"immunocompromised patients with cryptococcal pneumonia or meningitis; however,"
		isolated cryptococcal osteomyelitis is a rare entity that occurs in approximately
		5% of patients with cryptococcosis. Cryptococcal osteomyelitis in the head and
		"neck region is extremely rare. To the best of our knowledge, no cases of"
		cryptococcal osteomyelitis affecting only the zygomatic bone have been reported
		to date. CASE PRESENTATION: A 78-year-old man without other comorbidities
		presented with progressive swelling of the right cheek along with pain and
		trismus. Clinical examination revealed a tender swelling in the right zygomatic
		region; the maximal mandibular opening was about 2 cm. Laboratory data showed
		mildly elevated inflammatory indices (C-reactive protein: 0.45 mg/dL; erythrocyte
		sedimentation rate: 35 mm/h). Computed tomography showed a 30-mm-diameter lesion
		at the right zygomatic arch. A part of the lesion has extended to the
		subcutaneous area of the cheeks with signs of bone destruction and surrounding
		contrast effects. Histopathological examination of fine-needle aspirate and
		"needle biopsy showed cryptococcus. Furthermore, culture of the aspirate showed"
		growth of Cryptococcus neoformans. No evidence of any other site involvement was
		"observed. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with isolated cryptococcal"
		osteomyelitis and was initiated on fluconazole therapy. The treatment was
		"effective, and all symptoms were resolved in 4 weeks. Fluconazole therapy was"
		stopped after 6 months. There are no signs of recurrence as of 15-month
		follow-up. The patient has no cosmetic abnormalities or sequelae. CONCLUSIONS:
		"Fine-needle aspiration cytology, needle biopsy, and fungal culture were useful"
		for definitive diagnosis. Immunocompetent patients with isolated osteomyelitis
		may be cured with oral fluconazole alone.

		"Anbessa University Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia."
PG	-	349-59
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Meningitis is usually caused by viral, bacterial or fungal pathogens."
		Bacterial meningitis is a medical emergency and if untreated has a high mortality
		"rate. Even among those who survive the infection, some may develop permanent"
		neurological disorders. OBJECTIVES: This study was undertaken to isolate and
		identify the bacterial and fungal etiologic agents of meningitis and to access
		the susceptibility pattern of bacterial isolates. METHODS: During the period of
		"November 2007 to June 2008, 340 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens were obtained"
		"from suspected cases of meningitis admitted to Tikur Anbessa University Hospital,"
		"Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Microbiological analysis was performed on CSF specimens"
		"using standard procedures. RESULTS: Of the 340 patients investigated, 53.5% were"
		males and 46.5% were females. Over half of the patients (51.2%) were children (1
		month to 16 years) and the remaining 32.6% and 16.2% were neonates (below 1 month
		"of age) and adults (above 16 yrs of age), respectively. Fever was the commonest"
		"clinical feature observed in all age groups. Of the 340 CSF specimens, 26 (7.6%)"
		had a positive bacterial or fungal culture. Bacterial isolates accounted for
		"84.6% of the total isolates. Among the bacteria, Streptococcus pneumoniae"
		accounted for 36.4% followed by Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and Nessieria
		meningitidis (serogroup A and C) (13.6%) each. Cryptococcus neoformans was the
		"only fungal isolate. All gram positive bacteria were sensitive to ceftriaxone,"
		"ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin and rifampicin and showed low level"
		"of resistance (< 60%) to penicillin, tetracycline and"
		trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole. The gram-negative bacteria showed high level of
		"resistance (> 80%) to tetracycline and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole,"
		intermediate level of resistance (60-80%) to ampicilin and low level of
		"resistance (< 60%) to ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, chloramphenicol and"
		rifampicin. Multiple resistance (resistance to two or more drugs) was observed in
		"18.2% and 100% gram positive and gram-negative bacteria, respectively."
		CONCLUSION: This study showed that the predominant pathogens of meningitis were
		"S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and N. meningitidis. Ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin"
		were the most effective drugs against these organisms. Continuous periodic
		surveillance is required to form a comprehensive and updated understanding of the
		etiologies and antimicrobial resistance pattern for appropriate management of
		meningitis cases in the country.

LID	-	942751
AB	-	"Being introduced in 2010, fingolimod was among the first oral therapies for"
		"relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS). Since that time, postmarketing surveillance"
		has noted several case reports of various cryptococcal infections associated with
		"fingolimod use. To date, approximately 15 such case reports have been published."
		We present the first and unique case of cryptococcal chest wall mass and rib
		osteomyelitis associated with fingolimod use. The patient presented with
		left-side chest pain and was found to have a lower left chest wall mass.
		Computerized tomography (CT) showed chest wall mass with the destruction of left
		7th rib. Aspirate from the mass grew Cryptococcus neoformans. The isolate was
		serotype A. Fingolimod was stopped. The patient received liposomal amphotericin B
		for 2 weeks and started on fluconazole with a plan to continue for 6-12 months.
		The follow-up CT in 6 weeks showed a marked decrease in the size of the chest
		"wall mass. In conclusion, our case highlights the atypical and aggressive form of"
		cryptococcal infection possibly related to immunosuppression from fingolimod use.

PG	-	44-46
LID	-	10.1016/j.mmcr.2019.10.003 [doi]
AB	-	The meningococcal disease manifestation associated with the presence of
		Cryptococcus neoformans is rare. There are no reports in the literature about
		these simultaneous infections in immunocompetent patients. The aim of the present
		study is to describe the first case of fulminant septic shock by Neisseira
		meningitidis associated with Cryptococcus neoformans coinfection in an
		immunocompetent patient. We describe a case of an immunocompetent 74-year-old
		Caucasian woman who presented with fulminant acute meningococcemia associated
		"with cryptococcal meningitis, which progressed to worsening general condition and"
		died of septic shock and multiple organ dysfunctions in less than 48 hours. This
		case report demonstrates the possibility of coinfections related to Neisseria
		"meningitidis and Cryptococcus neoformans, even in immunocompetent patients, which"
		"represent a diagnostic challenge for clinicians, thus encouraging further studies"
		for a better understanding.

AB	-	AIM: Skeletal involvement of Cryptococcus neoformans is rare and normally
		associated with disseminated cryptococcosis or potential predisposing factors.
		"Here, we report an atypical case of osteoarticular cryptococcosis in an"
		immunocompetent patient. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of cryptococcal
		osteomyelitis in a 45-year-old female who presented with swelling and pain in the
		"left inner thigh. After a biopsy of the pubic bone and surrounding soft tissue,"
		the pathological results and bacterial culture of the biopsy tissue confirmed
		Cryptococcus neoformans infection. After draining the pus by aspiration and
		"administering oral fluconazole (400 mg/d) treatment, the patient's symptoms"
		disappeared. CONCLUSION: Cryptococcus neoformans is a rare etiology of infection
		"of the entire pubis, and oral fluconazole and pus aspiration could benefit some"
		cryptococcal osteomyelitis patients with soft-tissue cryptococcal infection.

LID	-	10.2147/IDR.S294299 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Skeletal involvement of Cryptococcus neoformans is infrequent and
		usually associated with disseminated cryptococcosis or underlying predisposing
		conditions. We present an atypical case of osteoarticular cryptococcosis in an
		immunocompetent patient. CASE PRESENTATION: We herein report a case of bone and
		soft tissue cryptococcal infection in a 42-year-old male from Pakistan with
		well-controlled diabetes without other associated immunodeficiencies treated with
		"antifungal therapy without surgical debridement. Furthermore, the patient"
		"developed toxidermia due to fluconazole use, so a fluconazole desensitization was"
		performed. Therapeutic management also included the performance of therapeutic
		drug monitoring of fluconazole plasma concentrations. CONCLUSION: To our
		"knowledge, this is the first case of osteoarticular cryptococcosis treated with"
		this treatment regimen. This strategy may be of interest to try to reduce
		hospital stay and associated complications.

AB	-	We present a case of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in a previously immunocompetent
		"patient. At the time of presentation, he was co-infected with Cryptococcus"
		neoformans. This case demonstrates how infectious diseases besides human
		"immunodeficiency virus can lead to immunosuppression for patients, placing them"
		at risk of opportunistic infections.

LID	-	1667
AB	-	"(1) Background: Cryptococcus neoformans is mostly known for causing meningitis,"
		with or without disseminated disease. (2) Case presentation: An immunocompromised
		"75-year-old gentleman presented post renal transplant with generalized weakness,"
		"altered mental status, hypoxemia, and hyponatremia, and was found to have"
		"disseminated cryptococcal infection. After an initial improvement, the patient"
		"became suddenly hypotensive, and passed away soon after. The autopsy revealed"
		"widespread cryptococcal involvement, with the most severely affected organs being"
		"the brain, lungs, pancreas, adrenal glands, and spleen. The pancreas and one of"
		"the adrenal glands revealed diffuse granulomatous cryptococcal infection, with"
		large areas of necrosis. The spleen also showed a large area of cryptococcal
		"necrosis. In addition, the patient had chylous ascites, without histologically"
		identifiable organisms. (3) Conclusions: This is a rare case of disseminated
		"cryptococcal infection with severe necrotizing adrenalitis and pancreatitis, in"
		"addition to significant spleen, lung, and central nervous system involvement. The"
		early recognition and treatment of the adrenal gland and pancreas cryptococcosis
		with surgical interventions may lead to better outcomes in affected patients.
		"Furthermore, steroid treatment and diabetes mellitus may be risk factors for"
		"adrenal gland involvement. Additionally, clinicians should keep cryptococcal"
		infection in their differential diagnosis for isolated adrenal gland and pancreas
		lesions.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis is a life-threatening disease
		affecting mainly immunocompromised hosts. CASE REPORT: We present a case of a
		"64-year-old immunocompetent patient, who initially developed a traumatic scalp"
		skin infection due to Cryptococcus neoformans. The patient received oral
		fluconazole and subsequently liposomal amphotericin B due to the development of
		"resistance with resolution of the infection. Two years later, during chemotherapy"
		"for newly diagnosed gastric and lung cancer, he developed fulminant cryptococcal"
		"meningoencephalitis, which did not respond to liposomal amphotericin B and"
		"flucytosine. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first case of fulminant"
		cryptococcal meningoencephalitis following long latency after adequately treated
		primary cutaneous infection.

AB	-	Meningitis in individuals living with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)
		is most frequently infectious in origin and usually due to opportunistic
		infections. The most common pathogens are Cryptococcus neoformans and
		Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Treponema pallidum causes neurosyphilis and can
		complicate HIV infections at any time after the initial infection. Simultaneous
		infections of the central nervous system caused by these pathogens are very
		uncommon even in the setting of severe immunosuppression. We report the case of a
		newly diagnosed HIV/AIDS young man who was found to have neurosyphilis with
		Cryptococcus meningitis. After a few weeks of treatment and initiation of
		"antiretroviral therapy, he was also diagnosed with tuberculous meningitis, which"
		was probably unmasked by the development of immune reconstitution inflammatory
		"syndrome (IRIS). To the best of our knowledge, this is the only case of reported"
		neurosyphilis and meningitis caused concomitantly by Cryptococcus and
		Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

		several cases of cryptococcosis. CASE REPORT: We present a case of Cryptococcal
		"meningoencephalitis attributable to Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii, in a"
		"58-year-old bird-keeper from Australia, after 7 years of fingolimod therapy. We"
		"discuss this in the context of previously reported cases, our understanding of"
		"fingolimod immune modulation, and known Cryptococcus pathobiology. CONCLUSION: We"
		suggest consideration of harm minimisation behaviours in patients requiring
		"fingolimod, particularly in those with profound CD4 lymphopenia. Furthermore, we"
		echo the call for improved post-marketing surveillance systems to determine the
		epidemiology of atypical infections with novel immunomodulatory treatments.

LID	-	10.3402/jchimp.v2i3.19254 [doi]
AB	-	Cryptococcal infections are fungal infections most commonly seen in
		immunocompromised patients. Chronic high-dose steroid may precipitate such an
		immunocompromised state and thus create susceptibility to fungal infections.
		Cryptococcus neoformans is a saprophyte usually found in soil contaminated with
		pigeon droppings. Suspicion to diagnose begins with clinical symptoms that can be
		"non-specific such as fevers, cough, and headaches. We present a case of"
		steroid-induced cryptococcal infection in a non-HIV-infected person.

AB	-	Cryptococcosis caused by encapsulated yeast Cryptococcus neoformans most commonly
		presents as disease of the central nervous system. Cryptococcus is a non-mycelial
		"budding yeast found in soil, pigeon droppings and their nesting places. The three"
		"'classic' virulence factors of cryptococci are: polysaccharide capsule, melanin"
		"production and growth at 37°C. Here, we present a rare case of cryptococcosis"
		affecting left supraclavicular lymph node in a Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
		infected individual. Culture of fine needle aspirate of the lymph node yielded
		Cryptococcus neoformans which was identified by standard microbiological
		techniques. Meyer's mucicarmine stain imparted a typical rose burgundy colour to
		the capsule. Unusual characteristics of the isolate included poorly developed
		capsule and the presence of yeast in chains resembling pseudo-hyphae. This case
		highlights the importance of microbiological techniques for diagnosis and prompt
		treatment of cryptococcosis.

LID	-	e01567
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Solid organ transplant recipients are immunocompromised and at risk
		"for invasive viral, fungal, and bacterial pathogens. Cryptococcus neoformans is"
		"the third most common invasive fungal infection in transplant recipients, and the"
		clinical presentation of Cryptococcus neoformans infection can vary widely.
		"Cryptococcal disease can affect the brain, lungs, skin, or vasculature, and it is"
		"frequently disseminated. Meningitis typically presents with fever, headache, and"
		altered mental status. Solid organ transplant recipients with cryptococcosis tend
		to have poorer outcomes than HIV patients with cryptococcosis. CASE PRESENTATION:
		"In this case report, we describe the case of a 69 year-old man with a past"
		medical history of a deceased donor kidney transplant who presented with severe
		orthostatic hypotension and was found to have disseminated cryptococcosis.
		CONCLUSIONS: This case report emphasizes the importance of broadening the
		differential diagnosis in transplant recipients who present with non-specific
		chief concerns. AVAILABILITY OF DATA AND MATERIALS: No datasets were used in the
		preparing of this manuscript. All patient information comes from the electronic
		health record and authors personal care of this patient.

PG	-	6617-6625
LID	-	10.12998/wjcc.v10.i19.6617 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcal osteomyelitis is a bone infection caused by
		"cryptococcus. As an opportunistic infection, bone cryptococcosis usually occurs"
		in patients with immunodeficiency diseases or in those undergoing
		immunosuppressive therapy and often displays characteristics of disseminated
		disease. Isolated cryptococcal osteomyelitis is extremely unusual in
		"immunocompetent person. The pathogenic fungus often invades vertebrae, femur,"
		"tibia, rib, clavicle, pelvis, and humerus, but the ulna is a rare target. CASE"
		"SUMMARY: A 79-year-old woman complaining of chronic pain, skin ulceration and a"
		"sinus on her right forearm was admitted, and soon after was diagnosed with"
		"cryptococcal osteomyelitis in the right ulna. Unexpectedly, she was also found to"
		have apparently normal immunity. After treatment with antifungal therapy combined
		"with surgery debridement, the patient's osteomyelitis healed with a satisfactory"
		"outcome. CONCLUSION: Although rare, cryptococcal osteomyelitis should be"
		considered in the differential diagnosis of osteolytic lesions even in
		"immunocompetent patients, and good outcomes can be expected if early definitive"
		diagnosis and etiological treatment are established.

PG	-	33-37
LID	-	10.18869/acadpub.cmm.3.2.33 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Naganishia albida (formerly Cryptococcus albidus) is a
		non-neoformans cryptococcal species rarely isolated as a human pathogen. CASE
		"REPORT: Herein, we present the case of a 26-year-old Iranian man with a"
		superficial cutaneous lesion in the axilla. The initial treatment for pityriasis
		versicolor by clotrimazole was unsuccessful. We performed skin sampling based on
		the standard protocol and conducted further investigations by the conventional
		laboratory tests and molecular analysis of the skin samples. All the mentioned
		analyses revealed N.albida as the causative agent of infection. The minimum
		"inhibitory concentration (MIC) analysis was carried out for the isolated agent,"
		and the patient was treated using 100 mg daily of oral itraconazole. CONCLUSION:
		N. albida can be the causative agent of some superficial infections. This is the
		first report on the successful detection and treatment of a superficial skin
		infection due to N. albida by oral itraconazole.

AB	-	AIM: To report a case of cryptococcus meningitis in an immunocompetent teenager
		that presented early with diplopia and bilateral poor vision. METHODS: A case
		report RESULTS: A 17-year-old boy presented with blurring of vision in both eyes
		"and diplopia for 3 weeks. It was associated with severe throbbing headaches,"
		nausea and vomiting. He was also having low grade fever. On physical examination
		he was afebrile with no sign of meningism. His vision was 6/15 in both eyes with
		constricted visual field. Anterior segment was normal in both eyes. Extraocular
		muscles movement showed bilateral sixth nerve palsies. Fundoscopy revealed
		bilateral hyperaemic and slightly elevated optic disc. CT scan of the brain was
		normal with no evidence of intracranial mass or abnormal ventricles. Lumbar
		puncture revealed high opening pressure >300mmH(2)O. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
		microscopically and culture showed presence of cryptococcus neoformans. This case
		was combinedly managed with neuro-medical team. Patient was started on
		intravenous Amphotericin B and fluconazole. His neurological symptoms recovered
		after a week. His vision was improved to 6/6 in both eyes with recovery of
		peripheral visual field. The diplopia improved with recovery of sixth nerve
		"palsies in both eyes. Unfortunately, patient developed nosocomial lower"
		respiratory tract infection and was treated for the problem. CONCLUSION: This
		case highlights the indolent nature of cryptococcus meningitis and the fact that
		the overt signs of meningism may not be present even in immunocompetent person.
		Diplopia may be one of the early presentations of meningitis patient.

		literature.
PG	-	247-252
LID	-	10.1016/j.rmcr.2018.09.014 [doi]
AB	-	Cryptococcosis is an infection caused by the yeast-like fungus Cryptococcus
		neoformans. Pulmonary cryptococcosis is typically identified as a single mass or
		"as multiple nodules, while endobronchial lesions are quite rare. Here we report"
		an uncommon case of pulmonary cryptococcosis presenting as endobronchial lesion
		in an immunocompetent patient. A 49-year-old male patient complained of
		intermittent cough with hemoptysis for two years. Computerized tomography of the
		chest showed a filling defect in the basal segment of the right lower lobe
		bronchus. A flexible bronchoscopic examination revealed a white smooth-surfaced
		polypoid lesion completely occluding the medial basal segment of the right lower
		lobe bronchus. The diagnosis was confirmed by bronchial biopsy under
		"bronchoscopy, and the histopathologic findings showed the organisms were"
		Cryptococcal neoformans. The patient was treated with fluconazole at a dose of
		400 mg daily. The endobronchial lesion was found rapidly diminished after 18 days
		"of therapy, and disappeared after 6.5 months of therapy by repeated fiberoptic"
		bronchoscopy. Then the patient continued fluconazole for another 2.5 months.
		"During the total 16 months' follow-up visits, the patient repeated CT scanning"
		"for five times, the results of which were all normal. The patient's symptoms"
		"disappeared as well, and now he is still under follow-up. This case highlights"
		the fact that pulmonary cryptococcosis can present as endobronchial lesions even
		"in immunocompetent subjects, mimicking lung tumor. Pathological confirmation is"
		important to establish the definite diagnosis.

LID	-	10.2147/IDR.S325826 [doi]
AB	-	"Cutaneous cryptococcosis, an infectious disease resulting from Cryptococcus"
		"neoformans, primarily affects immunodeficient individuals. Here, we report a case"
		of mediastinal small cell carcinoma (MSCC) complicated with multiple skin and
		soft tissue infections mimicking erysipelas and cellulitis. Antibiotics for
		bacteria were ineffective and a culture of pus from the infected areas revealed
		Cryptococcus neoformans in this patient. The absence of any evidence indicative
		of systemic cryptococcal infection leads to a final diagnosis of primary
		cutaneous cryptococcosis (PCC). Following two weeks of fluconazole at 400 mg/day
		"and 200 mg/day for the subsequent three months, combined with incision,"
		"irrigation and drainage, the wound gradually healed. An analysis and discussion"
		of the clinical features of this patient are presented. This case alerts
		clinicians as to the possibility of Cryptococcus neoformans in patients with
		advanced malignant tumors complicated with multiple skin and soft tissue
		infections. While a timely diagnosis and treatment of PCC in this patient
		"resulted in a favorable outcome, the patient succumbed to the malignant tumor at"
		six months post-discharge.

TI	-	First Subungual Cryptococcosis Described in an HIV Patient with Disseminated
		Cryptococcosis.
PG	-	480-482
LID	-	10.1159/000516661 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cutaneous cryptococcosis occurs in 10-15% of patients with
		disseminated cryptococcosis. It typically presents as papulonodular
		"molluscum-like lesions, but it can also produce a wide variety of lesions."
		Cryptococcal infection of the nail unit has never been reported. CASE REPORT: A
		28-year-old woman with a history of HIV with disseminated cryptococcosis in
		complete remission was referred to evaluate a subungual swelling of the right
		middle finger. Examination revealed an ulcero-burgeoning nodule over the right
		"middle finger's subungual area with onycholysis, eschar, and erosion. An"
		excisional biopsy was performed. Histopathological analysis demonstrated multiple
		histiocytic granulomas centered by encapsulated yeast cells. Culture grew
		"Cryptococcus neoformans var. neoformans. After 9 months of follow-up, there was"
		no recurrence of the lesion. DISCUSSION: It is the first reported case of nail
		involvement in the course of cutaneous cryptococcosis. Definitive diagnosis
		required pathology and culture. Cryptococcal infection of the nail unit was
		recalcitrant to systemic therapy while the remaining infection cleared. Our case
		report suggests that surgical excision associated with systemic therapy is the
		best treatment approach for subungual cryptococcosis. Recognition of rare
		"manifestations of cutaneous cryptococcosis, such as ours, is essential because"
		HIV cases increase continuously.

TI	-	Cryptococcal Pneumonia in an Immunocompetent Patient: A Rare Occurrence.
PG	-	e29841
LID	-	10.7759/cureus.29841 [doi]
LID	-	e29841
AB	-	Cryptococcosis is an invasive yeast infection commonly found among
		immunosuppressed patients. Pulmonary cryptococcal infection can have variable
		presentations ranging from pulmonary nodules and masses to consolidation. A
		"patient can present with shortness of breath, cough, sputum production, chest"
		"pain, fatigue, and weight loss. Diagnosis can be made using fungal culture,"
		"histology, radiographic findings, and cryptococcal antigen in serum as well as in"
		the cerebrospinal fluid. Treatment is usually with a combination or a single
		antifungal agent. Few cases have been reported in immunocompetent individuals.
		"Here we present a case of 69-year-old immunocompetent individual, who was"
		"initially seen in the outpatient clinic for dyspnea, cough, and fatigue and was"
		treated for pneumonia. The patient remained symptomatic despite multiple courses
		of oral antibiotics. He was then sent for inpatient admission. CT scan was
		"obtained that showed patchy infiltrates and consolidations, followed by"
		bronchoscopy. The cytology confirmed adenocarcinoma. The fungal smear and culture
		grew Cryptococcus neoformans. The patient was treated with fluconazole with
		improvement of his symptoms before starting chemotherapy. We are reporting this
		case as clinicians usually focus on bacterial etiologies in outpatient setting.
		"Our patient, who was immunocompetent, had a new diagnosis of cryptococcal"
		pneumonia and was also found to have lung adenocarcinoma. This case highlights
		the rare occurrence of this type of pneumonia in immunocompetent patients and the
		importance of considering fungal causes of pneumonia in patients.

PG	-	3510860
LID	-	10.1155/2019/3510860 [doi]
LID	-	3510860
AB	-	Immune deficiency is usually the underlying predisposing factor for cryptococcal
		"meningitis, though there have been case reports of immunocompetent patients"
		presenting with same. The portal of entry for Cryptococcus neoformans is the
		"respiratory tract, and by hematogenous spread, it causes systemic symptoms. The"
		presence of CSF leak is described to have predisposed our immunocompetent patient
		to infection by this organism possibly through direct spread. The gold standard
		"for diagnosing CSF leak is by cisternography. In this case, we added a technique"
		where nasal gauze is inserted during the procedure and scanned afterwards for
		"dye, thus increasing the confidence of diagnosis of CSF leak through the nares."
		"Prompt diagnosis and treatment is key to prevent adverse outcomes, and we propose"
		that in patients with cryptococcal meningitis without any identifiable risk
		"factor, evaluation for CSF leak should be considered especially with history of"
		head trauma.

		ventricular dysfunction that develops following a stressful emotional or physical
		event primarily occurring in postmenopausal females. Many physiologic triggers
		"have been identified in the pathogenesis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, including"
		diseases which affect the central nervous system such as traumatic brain
		"injuries, hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes, epilepsy, and central nervous system"
		"infections, including meningitis and encephalitis; however, there are very few"
		published case reports of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in the setting of fungal
		meningoencephalitis. We present a unique case of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy
		secondary to Cryptococcus neoformans meningoencephalitis in a middle-aged female
		with a history of multiple sclerosis who was taking immunosuppressive therapy.

PG	-	824-829
LID	-	10.1016/j.radcr.2022.11.011 [doi]
AB	-	Cryptococcosis has been recognized as an increasing cause of severe systemic
		mycosis in immunocompetent patients in the last few years. Cerebral
		"cryptococcomas are a more uncommon manifestation of cryptococcal meningitis,"
		which are not usually included in the differential of brain masses. We report a
		"case of a young, immunocompetent woman that rapidly developed severe neurological"
		deficits. She was ultimately diagnosed with cerebral cryptococcoma caused by both
		"Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii, and was treated with"
		amphotericin B and isavuconazole. After several complications during
		"hospitalization, including hydrocephalus and cerebellitis, she was discharged"
		"home on isavuconazole. On follow-up, she only complained of anosmia. We review"
		the clinical and radiological findings of similar cases. It is the first time
		that this form of cryptococcal meningitis is favorably treated with isavuconazole
		and is caused by 2 species of Cryptococcus. We emphasize that cerebral
		cryptococcomas should be suspected in immunocompetent patients that present with
		brain masses.

AB	-	Cryptococcus species are ubiquitous in the environment with a global
		distribution. While causing disease predominantly in immunocompromised hosts such
		"as those with advanced HIV, HIV-uninfected patients are increasingly recognized"
		as being affected. The most common forms of infection are cryptococcal pneumonia
		and meningitis. HIV-uninfected patients and extrapulmonary infections have worse
		"outcomes, likely due to delayed diagnosis and treatment. Cryptococcus infections"
		involving chylothorax or chyloabdomen have rarely been reported in humans. We
		"describe a case of fulminant disseminated cryptococcosis with fungemia,"
		"peritonitis, and empyema in a patient with chronic chylothorax treated with an"
		indwelling pleurovenous shunt. Key autopsy findings included cryptococcal
		"organisms identified on calcified lymphadenopathy, pleural adhesions, and"
		pericardium. We discuss the importance of identifying patients with
		"nontraditional risks factors for cryptococcal disease, such as lymphopenia and"
		"hypogammaglobulinemia, and the potential implications of pleurovenous catheters"
		in Cryptococcus dissemination.

AB	-	Cryptococcus neoformans is a saprophytic fungus that causes fatal disseminated
		"infections in immunocompromised hosts. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic,"
		"multiple cases of secondary viral, bacterial, and fungal infections have been"
		reported in patients after SARS-CoV-2 infection. We describe here a case of
		severe cryptococcal meningitis that developed in a previously healthy patient one
		week after treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection with dexamethasone. This case adds
		to the growing knowledge of emerging secondary infectious complications including
		opportunistic pathogens after SARS-CoV-2 infection. While few reports allude to
		"depressed T-cell function and lymphopenia due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, further"
		studies are needed to evaluate the effects of this infection and its treatment on
		the immune system and its contribution to the emergence of secondary
		opportunistic infections.

AB	-	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cryptococcus. magnus is a non-Cryptococcus neoformans
		"species isolated from certain plants, soil, air, and arctic glaciers. CASE"
		REPORT: This report describes a case of a 23-year-old Iranian female with
		pruritus and vaginal irritation. Conventional tests and molecular analysis of the
		samples of vaginal discharge were performed. The mentioned analyses revealed
		Cryptococcus magnus as the causative agent of vaginal infection. The minimum
		inhibitory concentration analysis revealed that this species is susceptible to
		"itraconazole, fluconazole, ketoconazole, and amphotericin B. The patient received"
		200 mg of oral ketoconazole once daily for 10 days. The patient did not show any
		clinical signs of vaginal infection after six months. CONCLUSION: C. magnus was
		found to have the ability to cause vulvovaginitis. This is the first report of
		successful detection and treatment of vulvovaginal infection with C. magnus.

PG	-	454-457
LID	-	10.1002/ams2.298 [doi]
AB	-	CASE: Disseminated cryptococcosis is a well-recognized condition among HIV
		"patients, but it also occurs in non-HIV patients. Necrotizing fasciitis caused by"
		cryptococcus is rare. An 81-year-old man who had received steroid therapy
		presented with erythema and pain in his right thigh. After the rapid progression
		"of symptoms and a failure to respond to antibiotic therapy, a clinical diagnosis"
		"of necrotizing fasciitis was made. We performed debridement, and yeasts were"
		detected using a Gram stain of the fascia. We treated the patient with liposomal
		"amphotericin B. On day 3, he developed meningitis. Cryptococcus neoformans was"
		"detected in the blood, fascia, and cerebrospinal fluid. Flucytosine was added to"
		"liposomal amphotericin B. OUTCOME: Despite the antifungal treatment, new regions"
		"of dissemination to the skin developed, and the patient died of multiple organ"
		failure. CONCLUSION: A diagnosis of disseminated cryptococcosis should be
		considered in a differential diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis among
		"immunocompromised patients, regardless of their HIV status."

PG	-	142-145
LID	-	10.3947/ic.2017.49.2.142 [doi]
AB	-	Cryptococcus spp. other than Cryptococcus neoformans or Cryptococcus gattii were
		previously considered saprophytes and thought to be non-pathogenic to humans.
		"However, opportunistic infections associated with non-neoformans and non-gattii"
		"species, such as Cryptococcus laurentii and Cryptococcus albidus, have increased"
		over the past four decades. We experienced a case of cryptococcosis caused by
		non-neoformans and non-gattii spp. in a 47-year-old female with refractory acute
		myeloid leukemia after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The
		patient underwent salvage chemotherapy with fluconazole prophylaxis and
		subsequently developed neutropenic fever with multiple erythematous umbilicated
		papules. A skin biopsy revealed fungal hyphae and repetitive blood cultures
		showed yeast microorganisms that were identified later as C. laurentii by
		Vitek-II®. Skin lesions and fever began to improve with conventional amphotericin
		B therapy. The treatment regimen was continued for 21 days until the disseminated
		cryptococcosis was completely controlled.

		literature.
PG	-	142-148
LID	-	10.1016/j.idcr.2018.05.004 [doi]
AB	-	We present a case of a 74 years old male with cutaneous cryptococcosis of the
		right forearm. Cryptococcus neoformans var. neoformans was cultivated from the
		skin and from the bloodstream. He was diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome (focal
		"segmental glomerulosclerosis) 21 months prior to admission, which was"
		steroid-dependent. He was treated with prednisone and cyclosporine A.
		Concurrently with his renal disease he was also diagnosed as having disseminated
		"severe tinea mannum, tinea corporis and tinea cruris; onychomycosis, skin eczema"
		"and psoriasis. After a prolonged course of anti-fungal therapy, his skin lesions"
		as well as his nephrotic syndrome recovered completely. Follow up after 7 months
		without any anti-fungal or immunosuppression showed no skin or renal recurrence.
		We assume that the renal disease was related to the pre-existing cutaneous
		"cryptococcosis, aggravated by immunosuppression, and discuss the close"
		"association between cutaneous cryptococcosis and nephrotic syndrome, as well as"
		similar case reports in the literature.

AB	-	"Cryptococcus neoformans is an encapsulated, yeast-like fungus that can cause a"
		"systemic mycosis, particularly in immunocompromised patients. Disseminated"
		"infections typically affect the central nervous system, and osseous lesions are"
		infrequent. Only 5%-10% of disseminated cryptococcosis involves bones. A
		"69-year-old female presented pain, swelling, and a soft tissue mass in her right"
		lateral hindfoot. Her medical history included a kidney transplant (10 years
		earlier) secondary to chronic disease due to IgA nephropathy. The patient
		"underwent an excisional biopsy, surgical debridement, and secondarily negative"
		pressure wound therapy to achieve skin closure. Biopsy revealed a rare
		Cryptococcus neoformans osteomyelitis of the calcaneus. The patient then received
		IV treatment with liposomal amphotericin B at 3 mg/kg/d for 25 days. In
		"conclusion, we present a case of cryptococcal osteomyelitis which, although not a"
		"frequent disease, must be considered as one of the differential diagnoses of"
		osteolytic osseous lesions in patients with chronic osteomyelitis. Cryptococcus
		"neoformans may be a potential cause of below-knee infection, mainly in"

AB	-	Cryptococcal meningitis is a common opportunistic infection in HIV-infected
		"patients and other immunocompromised people. Pregnancy, which is a state of"
		"relative immunosuppression, can also be a risk factor for the development of"
		cryptococcal meningitis. We report a clinical case of a 41-year-old woman who
		developed a severe meningeal syndrome after an otherwise normal pregnancy.
		"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytochemical analysis presented hypoglycorrhachia, high"
		"protein levels, and pleocytosis. Cryptococcal antigen tested positive in serum"
		"and CSF, and Cryptococcus neoformans was identified in the CSF culture. The"
		"diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis was confirmed, and antifungal induction"
		therapy was started with liposomal amphotericin B and flucytosine. After clinical
		"improvement, induction therapy was discontinued, and the patient was discharged"
		under maintenance therapy with fluconazole. While under antifungal maintenance
		"therapy, the patient presented worsening of symptoms and a new brain magnetic"
		resonance showed the development of multiple cryptococcoma. Despite sterile CSF
		"cultures, there was a deterioration of the cytochemical parameters. The diagnosis"
		"of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome was assumed, and after initiation"
		"of corticotherapy, the patient improved considerably. This is a rare case of"
		cryptococcal meningitis in a puerperal woman with a challenging management.

		and acute exacerbation of interstitial pneumonia in a patient with rheumatoid
		arthritis: an autopsy case report.
PG	-	10
LID	-	10.1186/s12890-021-01806-x [doi]
LID	-	10
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Accelerated nodulosis (ARN) is a rare variant of rheumatoid nodules
		(RNs) that is characterized by a rapid onset or the worsening of RNs. It
		generally develops at the fingers in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
		receiving methotrexate (MTX). Few case reports have described ARN at an
		extracutaneous location. CASE PRESENTATION: An elderly patient with long-standing
		RA was admitted to our hospital with acute respiratory failure. Computed
		tomography upon admission showed diffuse ground-glass opacities superimposed with
		subpleural reticular shadowing and honeycombing and multiple nodules in the lungs
		and liver. Despite the discontinuation of MTX and introduction of an
		immunosuppressive regimen with pulse methylprednisolone followed by a tapering
		"dose of prednisolone and intravenous cyclophosphamide, the patient died due to"
		the acute exacerbation (AE) of RA-related interstitial lung disease (ILD)
		following the parallel waxing and waning of a diffuse interstitial shadow and
		"pulmonary and liver nodules. At autopsy, RNs were scattered throughout both lung"
		fields in addition to extensive interstitial changes. RNs were also detected in
		the liver and kidneys. The foci of cryptococcosis were mainly identified in
		"alveolar spaces. Based on the clinical and pathological findings, these nodules"
		were most consistent with ARN because of acute increases in the size and number
		of previously detected pulmonary nodules. CONCLUSION: The present case is
		noteworthy because ARN was concurrently detected in multiple internal organs and
		may be associated with the AE of RA-related ILD.

PG	-	84-7
LID	-	10.15171/jnp.2016.15 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: In transplantation immunosuppression enhances the appearance of
		"opportunist infections. An ideal balance between the prevention of rejection, the"
		lowest risk of infections and the highest rates of graft survival is a continuous
		"challenge. Lower doses of immunosuppression may diminish the risk of infections,"
		"metabolic and hemodynamic complications or even of malignancy, but may expose"
		patients to episodes of acute rejection. New drugs are being developed to improve
		graft survival at the lowest risk of side effects. Belatacept has recently been
		introduced in kidney transplantation to inhibit the co-ligand signal of T cell
		"stimulation. It is a drug with a safe profile, is well-tolerated and appears to"
		"improve long-term survival of kidney grafts. However, there may be an increase in"
		"opportunistic infections which may be facilitated by T cell depression, as"
		"Aspergillus sp., Cryptococcus neoformans or tuberculosis. CASE PRESENTATION: We"
		"describe a 59-year-old female who developed fever, clinical wasting and a"
		mediastinal mass 31 months after receiving a living non-related kidney transplant
		while on belatacept therapy. A mediastinal node biopsy disclosed the presence of
		Histoplasma capsulatum. Infection successfully resolved after appropriate
		"antifungal treatment. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first reported"
		case of Histoplasma capsulatum in a kidney transplanted patient on belatacept
		therapy.

PG	-	311-315
LID	-	10.1515/med-2021-0234 [doi]
AB	-	Cryptococcosis is frequently found in immunosuppressed patients. It is also a
		significant opportunistic infection in non-immunocompromised individuals. In this
		"study, we present a rare case of membranous nephropathy (MN) with pulmonary"
		cryptococcosis. A 33-year-old man with MN was referred to our hospital because of
		"dyspnea and weakness for 1 week. Before the above symptoms occurred, the dose of"
		Cyclosporin A was increased again for relapse of MN. Multiple massive or patchy
		high-density shadows were present on computed tomography of the lung. Initially
		"the patient underwent empirical anti-bacterial therapy, which turned out to be"
		ineffective. As the results of serum cryptococcal latex agglutination tests were
		"positive, the administration of anti-fungal drugs was prescribed. The results of"
		fungal culture and pathologic examination of the lung tissue revealed the
		findings consistent with Cryptococcus neoformans. The patient was successfully
		treated with voriconazole followed by fluconazole with satisfactory result.
		"Therefore, in patients with chronic kidney disease, lung lesions with poor"
		bactericidal effects of cephalosporins need further examination to make sure
		whether there is pulmonary cryptococcosis. Early diagnosis and treatment might
		contribute to good results. It is a problem worthy of consideration that whether
		immunosuppressive agents need to be discontinued or not during antifungal
		therapy.

AB	-	CASE SUMMARY: An 11-year-old spayed female cat presented with a 6-month history
		"of a progressive nodular skin disease with concurrent, ocular lesions,"
		"intermittent vomiting, halitosis and weight loss. The cat had received different"
		topical treatments without success prior to referral to the Dermatology
		"Department of Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ghent University. Several"
		fine-needle aspirations of the lesions showed a vast number of macrophages with
		intra-cytoplasmic inclusions compatible with Cryptococcus species.
		Histopathological examination revealed pyogranulomatous inflammation with
		capsulated yeast. Periodic acid-Schiff stain was positive. Latex cryptococcal
		"antigen agglutination test on serum was positive with a titre of >1/524,288. PCR"
		and fungal culture identified Cryptococcus neoformans. The cat was treated with
		"itraconazole 10 mg/kg PO q24h. After 10 months of therapy, there was a complete"
		resolution of the lesions except for a small nodule on the ventral aspect of the
		"tongue. RELEVANCE AND NOVEL INFORMATION: As far as we are aware, this is the"
		first feline case reported of cutaneous nodular cryptococcosis without nasal
		involvement in Belgium. Oral itraconazole therapy was well tolerated and appeared
		to give a good result and prognosis.

AB	-	CASE: We present a 68-year-old diabetic man with a periprosthetic shoulder
		infection (PSI) by Cryptococcus magnus. The fungus was identified 4 weeks after a
		revision surgery for a chronic bacterial PSI. Treatment was successful with a
		2-week course of intravenous liposomal amphotericin B (5 mg/kg) followed by 6
		"weeks of fluconazole (200 mg/d). CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, only 2"
		periprosthetic infections due to Cryptococcus neoformans have been previously
		reported. This is the first report of cryptococcal involvement of a prosthetic
		"shoulder, and the first identified osteoarticular infection ever by C. magnus."

PG	-	141-4
AB	-	"The authors report the first case, to their knowledge, of disseminated"
		coccidioidomycosis occurring in a liver transplant recipient. The case is also
		interesting in that the diagnosis of disseminated coccidioidomycosis was made
		"fortuitously, only after finding the characteristic endosporulating spherules on"
		"a percutaneous liver biopsy. In addition, the authors reviewed the literature on"
		post-transplant infection with particular emphasis on fungal pathogens. All
		studies concurred that Candida species was the most prevalent infecting fungal
		organism when both localized and disseminated forms of infection are included.
		"Aspergillus was the second most common offender, and disseminated infection was"
		associated with a very grave prognosis for the transplant recipient. Rare
		infections with Mucor and Cryptococcus neoformans are described in the
		literature.

TI	-	Cryptococcal peritonitis in patients on the liver transplant waitlist: Reporting
		two cases with opposite outcomes.
PG	-	e13583
LID	-	10.1111/tid.13583 [doi]
AB	-	Cryptococcus neoformans is rarely associated with peritonitis in cirrhotic
		"patients; nevertheless, it has a high mortality rate. Early diagnosis and prompt"
		treatment may be the determining prognostic factors. This is a report of two
		patients awaiting a liver transplant who had opposite outcomes after the
		"diagnosis of spontaneous cryptococcal peritonitis. In Patient 1, the fungal"
		"culture was positive in the blood and ascites. She had a poor evolution and died,"
		which was likely caused by the delayed diagnosis and concomitant bacterial
		"infections. In Patient 2, the fungus was found in the ascites, urine, and"
		cerebrospinal fluid cultures. Antifungal treatment was effective. He underwent a
		liver transplant on the 83rd day of antifungal therapy and is still alive 1 year
		later. It is important to suspect fungal etiology when there is a lack of
		response to antibiotics in patients with decompensated cirrhosis and spontaneous
		"peritonitis, and physicians must be aware of leukocyte count in the ascitic"
		"fluid, which is not so high in these cases. This report also emphasizes the need"
		for the routine use of blood culture bottles for microbiological analysis of the
		"ascitic fluid, as it was helpful to diagnose fungal peritonitis in both cases."

		"standard stereotactic methodology targeting the posterior-ventral pallidum, and"
		his choreiform movements dramatically improved post-operatively within 48 hours.

LID	-	101283
AB	-	PURPOSE: To present a case of subretinal abscess associated with pneumonia and
		meningitis caused by Cryptococcus gattii in an immunocompetent host.
		OBSERVATIONS: A 37-year-old man presented with sub-acute painless unilateral
		vision loss and a white submacular elevation. Systemic evaluation revealed a lung
		lesion and cerebrospinal fluid evidence of Cryptococcus gattii infection.
		CONCLUSIONS AND IMPORTANCE: While Crypococcus neoformans has been well described
		"as a cause of chorioretinitis in immunocompetent and immunocompromised hosts,"
		this report demonstrates that Cryptocuccus gattii is a related uncommon pathogen
		to be considered in similar presentations. Submacular surgical debridement may be
		challenging and OCT imaging may be helpful to detect full-thickness retinal
		necrosis.

		cause of fungal infections of the central nervous system in immunocompromised
		patients. Survival following treatment of Aspergillus brain abscess has been
		"reported only 4 times. In each case, craniotomy was performed for abscess"
		drainage. We present a case of long-term survival following stereotactic drainage
		"of a bilateral Aspergillus brain abscess. In all reported cases, including the"
		"present one, histological examination of the abscess contents established the"
		correct diagnosis. Amphotericin B was used in combination with operation in 4 of
		the 5 cases of long-term survival.

		Due to Cryptococcal Meningitis.
PG	-	e4652
LID	-	10.7759/cureus.4652 [doi]
LID	-	e4652
AB	-	Cryptococcal meningitis is a systemic infection that can be seen in
		"immunosuppressed patients. Altered mental status, somnolence, and obtundation are"
		warning signs of poor prognosis or advanced disease processes. We present a
		23-year-old female with a past medical history significant for human
		immunodeficiency virus (HIV) obtained via vertical transmission who presented to
		the emergency department (ED) with a gradual onset of worsening headache over 10
		"days, with blurry vision, photophobia, nausea and vomiting, and progressive"
		"memory lapses. Her blood tests, chest plain radiograph, and non-contrast brain"
		"computed tomography (CT) were normal. In the ED, she developed a fever of 102°F"
		"and became more confused and agitated, with interspersed screaming and yelling. A"
		lumbar puncture (LP) showed elevated white blood cell count and was positive for
		Cryptococcus neoformans; an opening pressure was unable to be obtained due to
		patient agitation. Despite prompt intravenous antibiotics and antifungal
		"medications, her short, but tenuous hospital course involved declining mental"
		"status, requiring intubation and multiple therapeutic lumbar punctures, with an"
		elevated opening pressure of up to 55 cm H2O. The patient suffered global
		ischemic encephalopathy and died on hospital day two. This case highlights the
		rapid decompensation of a young immunocompromised patient with cryptococcal
		"meningitis, as well as the importance of early disease management and"
		consultation to neurology and neurosurgery services. An important paradigm
		difference for emergency medicine (EM) physicians in the management of increased
		intracranial pressure (ICP) in patients with cryptococcal meningitis is avoiding
		"acetazolamide, mannitol, and steroids and considering the indication for"
		neurosurgical interventions for severe cryptococcal meningitis.

AB	-	Cryptococcal meningitis is being increasingly described in immunocompetent
		adults. We describe here a young immuncompetent adult of Indian origin from
		"Ghana, West Africa with cryptococcal meningitis who had several ups and downs"
		during his treatment. First he developed neurologic worsening due to premature
		transition from intensive to consolidation phase therapy. Subsequently he
		"deteriorated due to ""immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)"" like"
		phenomenon that necessitated the prolonged use of steroids. Additionally he
		suffered serious adverse effects due to antifungal drugs including liposomal
		amphotericin B and flucytosine. He recovered after 16 months of treatment. The
		case highlights the possible difficulties in management of cryptococcal
		meningitis in immunocompetent host including 'immune reconstitution like
		syndrome'. There is need for new trial data and guidelines about treatment of
		cryptococcosis in the non HIV host.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a chronic
		progressive neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by the discovery of
		eosinophilic hyaline intranuclear inclusions in the central and peripheral
		"nervous systems and visceral organs. In this paper, we report a case of an"
		adult-onset neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease presenting with mental
		abnormality in China. CASE PRESENTATION: A 62-year-old woman presented with
		mental abnormality and forgetfulness for 3 months before she was admitted to our
		hospital. There were prodromal symptoms of fever before she had the mental
		"disorder. Encephalitis was first suspected, and the patient underwent lumbar"
		puncture and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
		"examination indicated normal pressure, a normal white blood cell count, and"
		"slightly elevated protein and glucose levels. Coxsackie B virus, enterovirus, and"
		cytomegalovirus tests showed normal results. Bacterial culture and Cryptococcus
		neoformans test results were negative. The contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain was
		normal. The brain diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) showed a symmetrically
		distributed strip-shaped hyperintensity signal of the corticomedullary junction
		"in the bilateral frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes. We considered the"
		"diagnosis of the NIID, and therefore, skin biopsy was performed. The electron"
		microscopy revealed that intranuclear inclusions in the nucleus of fibrocytes
		existed and were composed of filaments. CONCLUSIONS: NIID is a rare
		"neurodegenerative disease with diverse clinical manifestations. In clinical work,"
		when a patient presents with abnormal mental behavior and exhibits hyperintensity
		"signals on DWI images of the corticomedullary junction, it is crucial to consider"
		the diagnosis of NIID.

AB	-	Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungus that commonly invades the central nervous
		"system. While the choroid plexus, the site of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid"
		"barrier, serves as one potential entry point for the pathogen, disease"
		involvement of the choroid plexus itself remains a very rare manifestation of
		Cryptococcus infection. In cases in which choroid plexus involvement blocks
		"cerebrospinal fluid flow, obstructive hydrocephalus may occur. Here we report the"
		case of a 63-year-old woman who presented with choroid plexitis causing
		obstructive hydrocephalus at the foramen of Monro. Endoscopic biopsy confirmed
		"Cryptococcus neoformans, and the patient was successfully treated with"
		"amphotericin, flucytosine, and fluconazole. With proper recognition and treatment"
		"of this pathology, patients can fully recover from this condition."

		meningitis and meningoencephalitis. While there have been several cases of
		"cerebral cryptoccal granuloma published in the literature, the isolated"
		occurrence of intramedullary cryptococcal granuloma is very rare. We present an
		immunocompetent patient with such a lesion of the conus medullaris. The patient's
		clinical symptoms mimicked an intramedullary spinal cord tumor. The diagnosis was
		"made by histopathology, rather than by image or laboratory examinations. The case"
		was successfully managed with surgical removal of the lesion and postoperative
		anti-fungal treatment.

LID	-	e21984
AB	-	Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis (CM) remains a common cause of central nervous
		"system infections. Patients usually present with headache, fever, malaise, and"
		"altered mental status over several weeks. Signs are often absent, but they may"
		"include meningism, papilledema, cranial nerve palsies, and depressed level of"
		consciousness. Individuals with CM can occasionally present with small vessel
		vasculitis causing cerebral lesions. The literature regarding patterns of
		cerebrovascular injury in CM is scarce. We describe a case of CM in which an
		unusual presentation was observed: transient focal neurological symptoms
		initially with absence of fever that led to a misleading primary diagnosis of
		transient ischemic attack. Since neurological symptoms may be a manifestation of
		"a cryptococcal infection, it is necessary to have a high degree of suspicion for"
		"this pathology in the presence of focal neurological deficits, even in patients"
		"with vascular risk factors, requiring a thorough etiological investigation."

LID	-	e05461
AB	-	Cryptococcus neoformans (CN) is an encapsulated yeast that is found worldwide. It
		"causes self-limiting infections in immunocompetent hosts; however, infections due"
		to CN could be disseminated and potentially life-threatening in immunocompromised
		"hosts. Herein, we present a patient with primary myelofibrosis who received"
		ruxolitinib and developed disseminated cryptococcosis due to CN. We further
		"discuss immune compromising factors indigenous to myeloproliferative neoplasms,"
		"ruxolitinib, and immunological pathways associated with janus kinase inhibition."
		We further review other cases of cryptococcal infections in patients receiving
		ruxolitinib reported in the literature. The report underscores the importance of
		suspecting infections with intracellular pathogens early in the course of illness
		in patients with higher rates of cumulative immunosuppression. A high clinical
		suspicion should be maintained when caring for such immunosuppressed patients
		"receiving immunomodulatory agents as severe, disseminated infections can present"
		atypically and lead to worse outcomes.

AB	-	We present a case of a 70-year-old Caucasian woman with multisystem granulomatous
		"disease involving her lungs, bones and lymph nodes. The patient initially"
		presented with cervical lymphadenopathy and subsequently developed progressive
		"breathlessness. Imaging revealed extensive mediastinal, hilar and intra-abdominal"
		lymphadenopathy as well as bilateral pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates. Lymph
		node and lung biopsy confirmed non-necrotising granulomatous inflammation while a
		BAL showed scanty growth of Cryptococcus neoformans and moderate growth of
		Staphylococcus aureus The patient received intravenous ceftriaxone and had a good
		response to treatment. She also completed 3 months of oral fluconazole. Although
		"a diagnosis of sarcoidosis was considered most likely, the patient was not"
		initially started on systemic corticosteroids due to concern around possible
		"infection and initial response to antimicrobials. However, her exercise tolerance"
		gradually deteriorated. A craniofacial CT revealed multiple lytic lesions
		involving the skull and visualised cervical spine. Biopsy of a clivus lesion
		revealed non-necrotising granulomatous inflammation while fungal cultures and
		histopathological stains were negative. The patient was diagnosed with widespread
		sarcoidosis and she was initiated on prednisolone and methotrexate which led to
		marked clinical and radiological improvement.

AB	-	We report a case of a 41-year-old male who presented to our institution with a
		"large groin mass. CT, MRI and PET imaging was performed and was concerning for a"
		soft tissue abscess likely originating in the lumbar spine. Differential
		"considerations included infection, with atypical infections such as tuberculosis"
		strongly considered. Biopsy revealed fungal elements preliminarily reported as
		consistent with Cryptococcus neoformans but later revealed to be Blastomyces
		dermatitidis. The patient responded positively following the introduction of
		appropriate treatment. This case illustrates the imaging similarities between
		"spinal blastomycosis, spinal tuberculosis, and other fungal infections as well as"
		the need for biopsy to differentiate.

		of literature.
PG	-	76-80
LID	-	10.3315/jdcr.2015.1205 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcosis is a deep fungal infection caused by Cryptococcus
		"neoformans. The infection usually involves the lungs, the central nervous system"
		"as well as the skin, the bones and the urinary tract. Immunocompromised"
		"individuals, including solid organ transplant recipients, are at higher risk for"
		cryptococcal infections. MAIN OBSERVATIONS: We present a 40-year-old renal
		"transplant recipient who developed a slightly painful, erythematous, indurated"
		plaque on his thigh several years after a kidney transplant. Histopathology
		revealed cryptococcal panniculitis and cryptococcus neoformans subsequently grew
		from the tissue culture. There was no other systemic involvement. CONCLUSION: The
		primary cutaneous form of cryptococcosis is extremely rare and early diagnosis
		and treatment is essential in view of possible dissemination and variable
		nonspecific clinical manifestations.

		Report.
PG	-	148-151
LID	-	10.4235/agmr.20.0012 [doi]
AB	-	Cryptococcus neoformans is an encapsulated yeast that can be found in pigeon
		"droppings, hay, and dust. Primary cutaneous cryptococcosis (PCC) without systemic"
		involvement is recognized as a distinct clinical condition and is rarely reported
		in immunocompetent patients. A 78-year-old woman with no history of other
		diseases except for hypertension presented with a painful diffuse erythematous
		plaque along with oozing on left forearm that had lasted for 7 weeks. She was
		treated with cefoperazone/sulbactam for 3 weeks under suspicion of bacterial
		"cellulitis, although the lesions aggravated without any improvement. We performed"
		bacterial and fungal cultures as well as incisional biopsy. The pathogen was
		identified as Cryptococcus neoformans following sequence analysis of the internal
		transcribed spacer gene. The patient was treated with fluconazole 400 mg/day for
		"3 months, and there was no evidence of recurrence after 3 months of follow-up."

TI	-	Successful long-term management of invasive cerebral fungal infection following
		liver transplantation.
PG	-	181-6
LID	-	10.1111/myc.12289 [doi]
AB	-	Central nervous system (CNS) infections after liver transplantation may be fungal
		"in aetiology, with involvement from either common organisms such as Cryptococcus"
		"neoformans and Aspergillus spp. as well as less common organisms, such as the"
		Mucorales and Scedosporium spp. Although the mortality of CNS fungal infections
		"was nearly 100% in early series, more recent data has suggested that good"
		outcomes can be achieved. This may be due to both improved diagnostic
		"capabilities, such as the ability to obtain fungal susceptibilities and"
		"therapeutic drug levels, and improved therapeutic options, such as the newer"
		"triazoles- voriconazole and posaconazole. Due to improved outcomes, issues have"
		now arisen around the long-term tolerability of these agents. The following two
		"cases of invasive cerebral fungal infections following liver transplantation, one"
		"with Aspergillus flavus, and the other with Scedosporium boydii/apiospermum"
		highlight the success that can be seen with the modern management of a previously
		"fatal diagnosis. In particular, we highlight the issues around therapeutic"
		monitoring and discontinuation of therapy.

LID	-	e28806
AB	-	"RATIONALE: Epstein-Barr virus-associated smooth muscle tumors (EBV-SMT) are rare,"
		virally-induced malignancies that occur almost exclusively in immunocompromised
		individuals. We report a very rare case of a dura-based EBV-SMT with superimposed
		local cryptococcal infection. PATIENT CONCERNS: An adult male with a history of
		untreated acquired immunodeficiency syndrome presented to our hospital with
		"worsening headaches, diarrhea, and diffuse myalgias. DIAGNOSES: Blood cultures"
		were positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Cryptococcus
		neoformans serum antigen. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed 2 adjacent
		"enhancing masses in the right temporal lobe, perilesional edema, and mass effect"
		of the right lateral ventricle. Histological examination and immunohistochemical
		stains of the surgical specimen were consistent with EBV-SMT. Cryptococcus
		organisms were identified within the neoplasm. INTERVENTIONS: The patient
		"underwent complete tumor resection, received an extended course of amphotericin"
		"and flucytosine, and was restarted on antiretroviral therapy. OUTCOMES: The"
		patient was discharged from the hospital with no focal neurological deficits.
		LESSONS: Epstein-Barr virus associated smooth muscle tumors are rare malignancies
		that occur in immunocompromised patients. Prognosis is largely dependent on
		immune reconstitution and treatment of concomitant infections.

PG	-	e00294

LID	-	e00294
AB	-	Cryptococcal pleural infection is rare with about 50 cases reported. It tends to
		occur in immunocompromised individuals. We describe a 38-year-old male who
		presented with a lymphocytic exudative right pleural effusion and a raised
		pleural fluid adenosine deaminase (ADA) level. He was initially treated for
		"pleural tuberculosis, but presented again with worsening pleural effusion 6 weeks"
		later. A thoracoscopic pleural biopsy revealed chronic nodular granulomatous
		pleuritis with cryptococcal organisms present. The repeat pleural fluid culture
		was positive for Cryptococcus neoformans. He was started on intravenous
		"amphotericin B and oral flucytosine for 1 week, and then continued on oral"
		fluconazole. He was subsequently diagnosed to have acute myeloid leukaemia. His
		"peripheral blood film showed presence of blast cells (33%), with flow cytometry"
		showing increased myeloblast population. Lymphocytic exudative pleural effusions
		with raised ADA levels in an immunocompromised patient can be due to
		opportunistic fungal infections.

LID	-	10.4103/jgid.jgid_2_17 [doi]
AB	-	We report a case of acute cryptococcal meningitis (CM) masquerading as normal
		pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) in an immune-competent female. An 85-year-old human
		immunodeficiency virus-negative female presented to the emergency room for
		"altered mental status and difficulty walking. She was increasingly lethargic,"
		with urinary incontinence and gait instability. A previous computed tomography
		was reported to have ventricular dilatation out of proportion to the degree of
		cortical atrophy. Magnetic resonance scan of the brain revealed ventricular
		dilatation and subtle debris layering the occipital horns of the lateral
		ventricles. A working diagnosis of NPH had been made considering the clinical
		symptoms and imaging. She became febrile to 103°F. Lumbar puncture was then
		"performed which showed increased protein, decreased glucose, and mononuclear"
		pleocytosis. India ink preparation of the cerebrospinal fluid was positive for
		Cryptococcus along with a positive cryptococcal antigen test. The patient was
		"started on treatment for CM, but the patient continued to deteriorate further and"
		died on the same day. Blood cultures subsequently grew Cryptococcus neoformans as
		well.

AB	-	Diagnosis of invasive cryptococcal infection in apparently nonimmunocompromised
		patients is difficult and often delayed. Human immunodeficiency virus- (HIV-)
		negative patients with decompensated hepatic cirrhosis might be at high risk of
		cryptococcal infection. We report here an 82-year-old Japanese female with
		"end-stage hepatic failure and undergoing renal dialysis, hospitalized with septic"
		shock-like symptoms. The patient had had hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in the
		"past. She survived only 4 days following admission. During hospitalization, she"
		was found to have pleural effusion and ascites. Cryptococcus neoformans was
		"obtained from blood culture but not from pleural effusion culture. Consequently,"
		the patient was diagnosed as having invasive cryptococcosis in association with
		"HBV-related hepatic cirrhosis. Unfortunately, the patient died prior to receiving"
		antifungal agents. Twelve Japanese cases of hepatic cirrhosis-related invasive
		"cryptococcal infection, consisting of previously described and this case, were"
		summarized for discussion of the clinical features and outcomes.

TI	-	Atypical Cryptococcus neoformans isolate from an HIV-infected patient in Brazil.
PG	-	127-32
AB	-	Cryptococcus neoformans is an important fungal pathogen in immunocompromised
		"hosts. Capsulation, urease and melanin synthesis activity of the fungus are well"
		known virulence factors. Although artificial melanin-deficient mutants of Cr.
		"neoformans have been investigated, the clinical mutant is rare. We found a Cr."
		neoformans isolate in the cerebrospinal fluid of an AIDS patient which produced a
		light tan colony on a caffeic acid cornmeal agar (CACA) plate. The mycological
		"feature of the isolate was as follows; normal capsulation, defective inositol"
		"assimilation ability, serotype A; urease-positive; mating type alfa; haploid;"
		"extremely slow growth in RPMI 1640 medium, Sabouraud dextrose broth, brain heart"
		infusion broth and yeast nitrogen base; lower production of melanin with L-DOPA
		substrate; and low virulence to ddY mice. We also investigated the partial DNA
		sequence of CNLAC1 gene between the 3085th to 3623rd base. There were many
		"substitutions, 3 insertions and 3 deletions in the isolate compared with GenBank"
		accession number L22866. The result indicated some functional disorder in the
		gene. Although the CACA plate is an excellent selective medium for Cr.
		"neoformans, other identification methods should also be used."

TI	-	Death of a child associated with multiple overdoses of acetaminophen.
PG	-	391-7
AB	-	"A case of long-term acetaminophen overdosage in a six-year-old child, which"
		contributed to her death despite optimal medical management including oral
		"acetylcysteine therapy, is reported. Acetaminophen 325 mg every six hours was"
		prescribed for fever associated with measles. Believing that acetaminophen was
		"nontoxic, the child's mother progressively increased the dose over three days,"
		first in response to fever and subsequently for abdominal pain probably secondary
		"to unrecognized acetaminophen toxicity. On admission to the hospital, the"
		patient's serum acetaminophen concentration was 163 micrograms/mL (11 hours after
		"the last dose); subsequently, the acetaminophen half-life was determined to be 15"
		hours. A course of oral acetylcysteine therapy (a loading dose of 140 mg/kg as
		the sodium salt followed by 70 mg/kg every four hours for 17 doses) was begun.
		"Hepatic and renal failure developed within two days, followed by the onset of"
		"seizures, and brain death occurred on the 11th day. Autopsy findings consistent"
		with acetaminophen toxicity included centrilobular hepatic and renal tubular
		necrosis. Aspergillis fumigatus and Cryptococcus neoformans isolates from
		"pulmonary abscesses and bronchopulmonary lymph nodes, respectively, were an"
		"unexpected finding. However, in the absence of acetaminophen overdosage, death"
		would have been unlikely. Cryptococcal lymphadenitis was believed to have been
		the initial febrile illness that was treated with supratherapeutic doses of
		acetaminophen. Fatalities in children from a single overdose of acetaminophen
		"have been rare, and there is only one previous report of a fatality after"
		long-term administration of multiple excessive doses. The lethal outcome in this
		case illustrates the need to educate the public on the potential toxicity of
		nonprescription medications.

TI	-	Scytalidium dimidiatum causing recalcitrant subcutaneous lesions produces
		melanin.
PG	-	3789-94
AB	-	Scytalidium dimidiatum is a pigmented dematiaceous coelomycete that typically
		"causes chronic superficial skin diseases and onychomycosis, as well as deeper"
		"infections, such as subcutaneous abscesses, mycetoma, and even fungemia in"
		"immunocompromised patients. A second species, Scytalidium hyalinum, has hyaline"
		hyphae and arthroconidia and is considered by some authors to be an albino mutant
		of S. dimidiatum. This study aimed to confirm the presence of melanin or
		melanin-like compounds (which have been previously implicated in the virulence of
		other fungal pathogens) in S. dimidiatum from a patient with multiple
		subcutaneous nodules. Treatment of the hyphae and arthroconidia with proteolytic
		"enzymes, denaturant, and concentrated hot acid yielded dark particles, which were"
		"stable free radicals, consistent with their identification as melanins. Extracted"
		melanin particles from S. dimidiatum cultures were labeled by melanin-binding
		"monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) from Sporothrix schenckii, Aspergillus fumigatus,"
		and Cryptococcus neoformans. Lesional skin from the patient infected with S.
		"dimidiatum contained fungal cells that were labeled by melanin-binding MAbs, and"
		digestion of the tissue yielded dark particles that were also reactive. S.
		"hyalinum was also subjected to the melanin extraction protocol, but no dark"
		particles were yielded.

		grubii.
PG	-	93-98
LID	-	10.2147/VMRR.S35490 [doi]
AB	-	Although cryptococcosis is usually associated with respiratory and neurologic
		"signs in domestic species (such as sneeze, cough, nasal discharge, seizures,"
		"ataxia), clinical manifestations of the disease may be more subtle and"
		nonspecific. A 3-year-old male castrated Boxer dog presented with a history of
		"chronic vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, and lethargy. At no time had respiratory"
		or neurologic signs been noted by the owners or the primary care veterinarian.
		Palpation of an abdominal mass revealed an atypical lesion location: a large (16
		× 9 × 7 cm) mass at the root of the mesentery. Diagnosis was achieved through
		cytology of this mass and a positive serologic Cryptococcus capsular antigen
		titer; polymerase chain reaction was utilized for speciation of the abdominal
		isolate as Cryptococcus neoformans variety grubii. The animal was euthanized due
		"to poor prognosis. After necropsy and histopathologic analysis, the mesenteric"
		mass and associated lymph nodes were identified as large fungal granulomas. This
		"is a rare manifestation of cryptococcosis, involving several visceral organs,"
		with no remaining evidence of the route of entry of the organism. As prompt
		"diagnosis of mycotic illness is paramount to successful management, this case"
		indicates that cryptococcal infection should be considered as a differential
		diagnosis in dogs with gastrointestinal signs and lymphadenopathy. The protean
		nature of cryptococcosis is discussed within the context of a brief review of
		emerging and unresolved issues in pathogenesis.

AB	-	"A male adult in his mid-40s with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on haemodialysis,"
		"with history of splenectomy and sarcoidosis, developed septic arthritis of the"
		knee. Excision and drainage was performed and empiric antibiotics were initiated.
		"Cultures were initially negative without clinical improvement. Eventually, the"
		aerobic synovial fluid culture grew Cryptococcus neoformans (formerly
		Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii). The patient was treated with liposomal
		amphotericin B and then switched to fluconazole until the infection resolved.
		This case highlights the less well-recognised association between cryptococcal
		"arthritis and immunodeficiency states like ESRD, splenectomy and sarcoidosis."

TI	-	Chlamydospore formation on Staib agar. Observations made before Candida
		dubliniensis was described.
PG	-	23-7
AB	-	When routinely using Staib agar to detect Cryptococcus neoformans in AIDS
		"patients by the brown colour effect of its colonies, rough-looking colonies of a"
		"questionable variety of Candida albicans were also found. Microscopically, these"
		colonies consisted of pseudohyphae with abundant masses of chlamydospores.
		"However, the colonies of C. albicans were smooth-edged and formed by round-oval"
		blastospores only. Such observations were made during the mycological supervision
		of 36 cryptococcosis cases during the 1987-94 period. All these questionable
		"cultures of Candida spp. were discarded. However, because the corresponding"
		photographs of and records on such strains were found to be identical with those
		recently published by molecular biologists under the title 'Chlamydospore
		formation on Staib agar as a species-specific characteristic of Candida
		"dubliniensis' [Staib, P. & Morschhäuser, J. (1999) Mycoses 42, 521-524], the"
		present communication presents a report on such observations in a representative
		and exemplary case of an AIDS patient.

TI	-	Hyponatremia as the Initial Presentation of Cryptococcal Meningitis After Liver
		Transplantation.
PG	-	e29902
LID	-	10.5812/hepatmon.29902 [doi]
LID	-	e29902
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Meningoencephalitis is the most common clinical manifestation of
		"cryptococcal infection, as the organism has a propensity to invade the CNS."
		"Patients often present with elevated intracranial pressure, focal motor deficits,"
		altered mentation and internal hydrocephalus. Syndrome of inappropriate
		antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) has been reported as a notable cause of
		euvolemic hyponatremia in immunocompromised patients. CASE PRESENTATION: A
		67-year-old male with liver transplantation due to hepatitis C (HCV) related
		liver cirrhosis developed severe hyponatremia four months after liver
		"transplantation, which was discovered during routine clinic visit. Patient was"
		"referred to the emergency department, treated and discharged with normal serum"
		"sodium level. Few days later, he presented with dizziness, confusion, ataxia,"
		abnormal muscle movements and leg pain. Laboratory investigations were consistent
		with SIADH and revealed a sodium level of 115 mmol/L. Brain MRI showed a
		leptomeningeal enhancement in the superior cerebellar sulci suspicious for
		infection. Lumbar puncture was performed and consistent with Cryptococcus
		"neoformans infection; therefore, cryptococcal meningitis was diagnosed."
		Amphotericin B was started for the patient for six weeks followed by fluconazole
		"for one year. His level of consciousness improved significantly, and his serum"
		sodium level slowly returned to its normal baseline over three weeks after
		starting amphotericin B. CONCLUSIONS: Symptomatic hyponatremia secondary to SIADH
		remains a rare complication of cryptococcal meningitis.

PG	-	115-33
AB	-	"Thirty-one immunocompromised patients (22 renal allograft recipients, 5 patients"
		"receiving chronic corticosteroid therapy, and 4 patients undergoing chemotherapy"
		"for acute leukemia) with significant dermatologic infection, excluding typical"
		"cellulitis and herpesvirus infections, were retrospectively identified over a"
		"12-year period. Of these 31 patients, 15 (48%) had infection restricted to their"
		"skin, 6 (19%) appeared to have primary cutaneous infection that spread"
		"hematogenously to other parts of the body, 2 (6%) had infections of adjoining"
		"nasal tissue that spread to contiguous skin, and 8 (26%) appeared to have"
		disseminated systemic infection that spread to the skin. In six of the eight
		"patients with apparent secondary skin involvement, the development of the"
		cutaneous lesion was the first clinical indication of disseminated infection.
		Eleven immunocompromised patients (35%) with bacterial infection of the skin or
		subcutaneous tissue were identified. These patients could be divided into three
		categories: leukemic patients with bacteremic gram-negative infection
		"metastasizing to the skin (3 cases), renal transplant recipients with recurrent"
		"staphylococcal infection on and around the elbow (""transplant elbow"") or"
		"streptococcal sepsis from a site of cellulitis (5 cases), and immunocompromised"
		patients with opportunistic bacterial infection due to Nocardia asteroides or
		atypical mycobacteria (3 cases). Seventeen immunocompromised patients (55%) with
		fungal infection of the skin or subcutaneous tissue were identified. These
		included 12 patients with opportunistic fungal infection (Cryptococcus
		"neoformans, 4 cases; Aspergillus species, 3 cases; Paecilomyces, 2 cases;"
		"Rhizopus species, 2 cases; and Candida tropicalis, 1 case) and 5 patients with"
		"extensive, confluent cutaneous dermatophyte infections. One patient with"
		protothecosis and two patients with extensive papillomavirus infection were
		"identified. Of these latter two cases, one had his immunosuppression"
		"discontinued, with clearing of his extensive warts; the other had confluent warts"
		of the face and neck that subsequently underwent malignant degeneration to
		squamous cell carcinoma while chronic immunosuppressive therapy was
		continued.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

LID	-	10.1159/000524359 [doi]
AB	-	Fingolimod is a disease-modifying treatment utilized in the treatment of
		relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Fingolimod has been associated with an
		increased risk in herpes simplex and varicella infection in clinical trials. We
		report a case of cerebral venous thrombosis secondary to cryptococcus in a
		patient receiving fingolimod. A 61-year-old male with multiple sclerosis treated
		"with fingolimod presented with a 2-week history of headache, chills, and night"
		sweats. An MRI of the brain revealed a left transverse and sigmoid sinus
		thrombosis. Two blood cultures revealed Cryptococcus neoformans; a serum
		cryptococcal antigen was also positive. HIV testing was negative. A lumbar
		"puncture was deferred as the patient was placed on heparin and, subsequently,"
		warfarin for the cerebral venous thrombosis. The patient received antifungal
		"therapy for 14 days with liposomal amphotericin B and flucytosine, followed by"
		oral fluconazole for 8 weeks. He was subsequently readmitted 60 days later with
		"bilateral papilledema; his anticoagulation was reversed, and a lumbar puncture"
		revealed a negative cryptococcal antigen and an intracranial pressure of 20. A
		"repeat MRI revealed worsening superior sagittal sinus thrombosis, thought to be"
		the cause of the papilledema; his anticoagulation was reinitiated. He received a
		"brief course of intravenous methylprednisolone, but as his multiple sclerosis was"
		"well-controlled, further therapy was deferred. His symptoms had resolved at a"
		3-month follow-up appointment. This is the first report of a multiple sclerosis
		patient treated with fingolimod to develop cerebral venous thrombosis secondary
		to cryptococcal fungemia. The risks of opportunistic infections should be
		considered in patients managed with fingolimod.

TI	-	Treatment of acute myeloblastic leukaemia in a patient with Bombay blood type: a
		case report.
PG	-	140-6
AB	-	A 62-year-old female was admitted to our hospital with suspected acute leukaemia
		and after investigation we diagnosed acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML-M1). The
		patient's blood type was found to be the very rare Bombay type and surveillance
		of her relatives showed the same blood type in her male cousin on her mother's
		side. Alongside chemotherapy the patient received 4000 ml of frozen Bombay-type
		"red cells, 1400 ml of concentrated red cells in manitol adenine phosphate"
		solutions and 360 units of type O concentrated platelets without marked effects.
		The anti-H antibody was initially at 128 dilution but for unknown reasons
		increased to 2048 dilution after remission of AML-M1. About 3 months after
		hospitalization the patient died of Cryptococcus neoformans pneumonia despite
		strict precautions against infection. Although AML-M1 is a common adult leukaemia
		"and is chemosensitive to anti-leukaemic drugs, neither AML-M1 in a patient with"
		Bombay-type red cells nor its treatment with chemotherapy and transfusion with
		type Oh frozen red cells have previously been reported.

TI	-	Dermoscopy of Mycobacterium marinum Skin infection: A Challenging Diagnosis.
PG	-	278-279
AB	-	"Dear Editor, Mycobacterium (M.) marinum is a slow-growing atypical mycobacterium"
		found mainly in saltwater environments. Infection occurs following inoculation of
		"a skin lesion and manifests as a localized granuloma; in fact, the most common"
		cause of infection with M. marinum is the exposure of traumatized skin to
		"affected aqueous environments (1), and it most commonly involves individuals with"
		occupational and recreational exposure to non-chlorinated water (2). An
		erythematous or bluish 0.5 to 3.0 cm nodule usually develops at the inoculation
		"site, while ulceration can occur later and subsequent lesions may be present"
		along the lymphatic drainage. We present the first case in the literature
		describing the dermatoscopic characteristics of a microbiologically proven
		"Mycobacterium marinum skin infection, although more cases are certainly needed to"
		"identify the main dermatoscopic features of this infection. In January 2019, a"
		66-year-old patient was referred to our Dermatological Clinic reporting the
		"appearance of two purplish nodules about 2 months earlier, located on the back of"
		the hand and on the left thumb (Figure 1) and of erythematous purplish appearance
		"and quite painful to palpation. Based on the clinical presentation, infection"
		"with atypical mycobacteria, botryomycosis, fungal infection (Cryptococcus"
		"neoformans, Histoplasma capsulatum) and infection with Francisella tularensis"
		were considered in the differential diagnosis. The patient was asked if he had an
		aquarium at home and he confirmed this by telling us of his passion for
		"aquariums, which made the diagnosis easier. Dermatoscopic examination performed"
		on the two lesions at the center of the first nodule located on the hand showed a
		whitish area surrounded by an erythematous background with fine scaling and
		dotted vessels and orange-whitish central areas with looped concentric
		"monomorphic vessels (Figure 2, a). However, the thumb lesion had a purplish"
		background with multiple structured rounded areas with orangish appearance
		"surrounded by looped vessels arranged in a crown-like shape (Figure 2, b). It is"
		interesting to note the dermoscopic-histological correlation in this disease: the
		"orangish areas in fact correspond to a granulomatous dermatitis, characterized by"
		inflammatory nodular infiltrate within the dermis (tuberculoid granulomas) (3).
		"Clinically and dermoscopically, the nodules had two different sets of features"
		because they were in different stages of development: the nodule of the thumb was
		"older than the other one on the hand, which the patient reported was of recent"
		"onset, also confirmed by the presence of suppuration and ulceration. Both lesions"
		had orange areas in the context of an erythematous background which led us to
		investigate a granulomatous disease. A deep culture examination and a skin biopsy
		"were thus performed, showing Mycobacterium marinum infection. Oral therapy with"
		clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily for 4 weeks was started and healing occurred in
		about 21 days. We present this case to emphasize the role of dermoscopy in
		differential diagnosis of granulomatous disease and to show dermoscopic clues
		that have not yet been described and that can be used in the future to establish
		"very early diagnosis of this infection, reducing the diagnostic delay."
