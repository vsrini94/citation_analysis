AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To further characterize the histomorphology and clinicopathologic
		features of colonization and invasive disease by Scedosporium and Lomentospora.
		METHODS: We conducted a 20-year retrospective study. Patients with at least 1
		"histopathology specimen and concurrent culture were included. Clinical features,"
		"histopathology, microbiology, and outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: Eighteen"
		"patients were identified, and all were immunocompromised. Eight patients had"
		"colonization, while 10 had invasive disease (pneumonia [n = 3], skin and"
		"soft-tissue infections [n = 3], disseminated disease [n = 4]). Scedosporium"
		"apiospermum was identified in 15 patients, Lomentospora prolificans in 2"
		"patients, and Scedosporium ellipsoideum in 1 patient. Fungal elements were"
		"identified histologically in 11 patients. Granulomatous, suppurative, and"
		necrotizing inflammation with irregular branching hyphae and characteristic
		microconidia were observed in 9 cases; conidiogenous cells were identified in 4
		"cases. Seven patients died of invasive disease despite therapy, and 3 recovered"
		after treatment. No deaths were observed in patients with colonization.
		"CONCLUSIONS: Scedosporium and Lomentospora are rare, virulent opportunistic"
		"fungal pathogens. Fungal morphology may overlap with other hyaline molds, but"
		identification of obovoid conidia should allow a diagnosis of non-Aspergillus
		hyalohyphomycosis and consideration of Scedosporium and Lomentospora.
		Histopathologic correlation with culture and polymerase chain reaction is
		critical for diagnosis and treatment.

TI	-	Lomentospora prolificans endocarditis--case report and literature review.
PG	-	36
LID	-	10.1186/s12879-016-1372-y [doi]
LID	-	36
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Lomentospora prolificans (formally Scedosporium prolificans) is an
		environmental mould with a global distribution. Endocarditis caused by L.
		prolificans is a rare but serious emerging disease in immunocompromised patients.
		Prior to this case there have only been eight cases reported in the literature.
		Diagnosis can be challenging and there are no evidence-based guidelines for
		treatment. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 75-year-old woman with ovarian
		carcinoma who presented with fever after chemotherapy. Repeated sterile site
		"cultures remained negative until day 22 of admission, when Lomentospora"
		"prolificans was isolated from blood cultures. Following extensive investigations,"
		including Fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and
		"transoephageal echocardiography (TOE), the patient was diagnosed with"
		endocarditis complicated by cerebral emboli. The patient was considered
		unsuitable for surgical intervention and passed away five days after the fungus
		was isolated. CONCLUSION: Endocarditis caused by Lomentospora prolificans is a
		"rare but emerging condition, with limited treatment options and a high mortality."
		"Awareness of the increasing incidence of Lomentospora prolificans infection,"
		"diagnosed often at an advanced stage, with potential for endocarditis may prompt"
		earlier echocardiography or FDG-PET imaging. Further studies are needed to
		"determine the optimal combination and duration of anti-fungal agents, used in"
		conjunction with aggressive surgical excision where feasible.

TI	-	Scedosporiosis/lomentosporiosis observational study (SOS): Clinical significance
		of Scedosporium species identification.
PG	-	486-497
LID	-	10.1093/mmy/myaa086 [doi]
AB	-	Scedosporiosis/lomentosporiosis is a devastating emerging fungal infection. Our
		objective was to describe the clinical pattern and to analyze whether taxonomic
		grouping of the species involved was supported by differences in terms of
		clinical presentations or outcomes. We retrospectively studied cases of invasive
		scedosporiosis in France from 2005 through 2017 based on isolates characterized
		"by polyphasic approach. We recorded 90 cases, mainly related to Scedosporium"
		"apiospermum (n = 48), S. boydii/S. ellipsoideum (n = 20), and Lomentospora"
		"prolificans (n = 14). One-third of infections were disseminated, with"
		unexpectedly high rates of cerebral (41%) and cardiovascular (31%) involvement.
		"In light of recent Scedosporium taxonomic revisions, we aimed to study the"
		clinical significance of Scedosporium species identification and report for the
		first time contrasting clinical presentations between infections caused S.
		"apiospermum, which were associated with malignancies and cutaneous involvement in"
		"disseminated infections, and infections caused by S. boydii, which were"
		"associated with solid organ transplantation, cerebral infections, fungemia, and"
		early death. The clinical presentation of L. prolificans also differed from that
		"of other species, involving more neutropenic patients, breakthrough infections,"
		"fungemia, and disseminated infections. Neutropenia, dissemination, and lack of"
		antifungal prescription were all associated with 3-month mortality. Our data
		support the distinction between S. apiospermum and S. boydii and between L.
		prolificans and Scedosporium sp. Our results also underline the importance of the
		"workup to assess dissemination, including cardiovascular system and brain."

		"cases, with 118 (65.6%) cases of colonization and 62 (34.4%) cases of infection."
		Predisposing factors for isolation of Scedosporium spp. included chronic lung
		disease in 37.8% and malignancy in 21.7% of cases. Predictors of invasive disease
		"(n=62) included haematological stem cell transplantation (n=7), leukaemia (n=16)"
		"and diabetes mellitus (n=8). Of 183 phenotypically-speciated isolates, 75 (41%)"
		"were Scedosporium prolificans (risk factors: haematologic cancer (n=17),"
		neutropaenia (n=14)) and 108 (59%) had Scedosporium apiospermum/Pseudallescheria
		boydii phenotype [risk factor: diabetes (n=15)]. Scedosporium prolificans (p
		0.01) and leukaemia (p 0.03) independently predicted death. Epidemiological and
		antifungal susceptibility profiles of Scedosporium aurantiacum
		(prevalence>or=15.8%) and S. apiospermum were similar. No patient with S.
		aurantiacum infection (n=6) died. This is the first description of clinical
		features associated with S. aurantiacum.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: Detection of hyphomycetes of the Scedosporium apiospermum complex and
		Lomentospora prolificans (Sac-Lp) is not yet standardized. Prevalence rates in
		patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and the resistance pattern of these pathogens
		in Germany are unknown. METHODS: In a one-year prospective study 11 laboratories
		"used a selective medium for isolation of Sac-Lp, examining >11,600 respiratory"
		samples from 2346 patients with CF. Isolates were identified by molecular methods
		and tested for susceptibility to antifungal drugs. RESULTS: The prevalence of
		Sac-Lp in patients with CF in Germany varied from 0.0 to 10.5% (mean: 3.1%) among
		the clinical centres. The benefit of the selective medium SceSel(+) compared to
		standard media for fungi was documented for >5000 samples. High antifungal
		"resistance was detected in the S. apiospermum complex, and the multiresistance of"
		L. prolificans was confirmed. CONCLUSION: Microbiology laboratories should be
		aware of these resistant species in patients with CF and consider using a
		selective medium.

AB	-	Lomentospora prolificans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen found especially in
		"Australia, Spain, Portugal, California, and the southern United States. Although"
		"it causes a wide spectrum of infections, disseminated L. prolificans infection"
		remains very rare. The diagnosis and medical management are challenging. No clear

		"report, we have highlighted the rare vascular effect of disseminated"
		L. prolificans infection. We have reported the case of a 48-year-old
		immunocompromised man who had presented with a right groin mass. After extensive
		"workup, the patient was found to have disseminated L. prolificans infection"
		causing a superficial femoral artery pseudoaneurysm. A multidisciplinary team was
		"involved to provide medical and surgical care. However, the patient died after"
		treatment failure and withdrawal of support.

AB	-	Infections caused by the Scedosporium genus have become recognized as a fatal
		"complication after lung transplantation in Europe and Australia, but the reports"
		have been rare from Asian countries including Japan. We present a case of
		pneumonia caused by a mixed infection of Scedosporium apiospermum (SA) and
		Lomentospora prolificans (LP) that developed after augmentation of
		immunosuppression for chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) after lung
		transplantation. A 13-year-old man underwent bilateral lung transplantation for
		"pulmonary hypertension. One year after surgery, he was treated with a series of"
		augmented immunosuppressive therapy for severe acute rejection and subsequent
		"CLAD. Three months following the first steroid pulse therapy, his serum"
		β-D-glucan elevated without any sign of fungal infection by other tests. The
		serum β-D-glucan once returned to a normal level by empirical administration of
		"micafungin; however, the patient's condition worsened again by discontinuation of"
		"it. He did not recover by restarting micafungin, and computed tomography (CT)"
		scans eventually demonstrated new infiltrates in his lung field 6 weeks after the
		elevation of serum β-D-glucan. Microscopic findings of transbronchial lung biopsy
		"specimens showed filamentous fungi, and the culture of bronchoalveolar lavage"
		fluid revealed the growth of SA and LP. Despite subsequent voriconazole
		"administration, he died 14 days after the start of voriconazole. Early and"
		aggressive inspection including bronchoscopy should be performed for the
		"diagnosis of Scedosporium infection in immunocompromised patients, even if CT"
		scans and sputum culture show no evidence of infection.

		transplantation.
PG	-	138-42
AB	-	This report concerns the first case of disseminated infection with Scedosporium
		prolificans (S. inflatum) that occurred in a patient who had received an organ
		transplant and was verified at autopsy. The patient underwent single (right)-lung
		transplantation and subsequently died on the 33rd postoperative day in a context
		"of septic shock. S. prolificans was isolated from various specimens, including"
		two cultured blood samples. The organism was associated with Candida albicans in
		some of these specimens. Autopsy revealed the presence of numerous nodular
		"abscesses in the lungs, myocardium, kidneys, spleen, and gall bladder. These"
		abscesses contained mycelial filaments and numerous oval conidia suggestive of
		Scedosporium species but no yeasts. MIC studies demonstrated the resistance of
		"the S. prolificans isolate to amphotericin B, fluctyosine, miconazole,"
		"ketoconazole, and itraconazole, whereas the isolate of C. albicans was"
		"susceptible to amphotericin B, flucytosine, miconazole, and ketoconazole. From"
		the data from our case and six published reports of cases of disseminated S.
		"prolificans infection, it can be concluded that this filamentous fungus is a new"
		agent responsible for the most serious mycoses in both neutropenic patients and
		patients who have undergone organ transplantation.

AB	-	Lomentospora prolificans is an emerging pathogen that is difficult to treat due
		to its intrinsic resistance to currently available antifungal agents. Current
		evidence demonstrates synergy between Azoles and Terbinafine against L.
		"prolificans infections, while adjunct use of antifungal agent-loaded bone cement"
		has also shown favourable outcomes. We report a case of an immunosuppressed adult
		with rheumatoid arthritis who developed L. prolificans osteomyelitis in his right
		wrist following trauma and subsequent exposure to commercially available
		fertiliser. The infection was successfully eradicated via a combination of
		"aggressive, staged surgical source control, antifungal therapy using voriconazole"
		"and Terbinafine, and insertion of voriconazole-loaded bone cement into the wrist"
		and carpus. The utility of this approach supports the synergistic effects of
		"voriconazole and Terbinafine and, more broadly, the clinical benefits of"
		"antifungal-loaded bone cement, as demonstrated in previous case reports and in"
		"vitro studies. As such, combination antifungal therapy and voriconazole-loaded"
		bone cement should be considered the therapy of choice in cases of osteomyelitis
		where L. prolificans is proven to be the causative organism.

AB	-	Risk factors for the association of Scedosporium in cases of cystic fibrosis (CF)
		"and its clinical implications are poorly understood. Clinical, lung function and"
		laboratory data of adult CF patients in Sydney (April 2008-March 2009) were
		prospectively analysed for such risk factors. Expectorated sputa were cultured
		for bacteria and examined for fungi using standard mycological and
		"Scedosporium-selective media, and by an internal transcribed spacer"
		region-targeted multiplex PCR assay. Scedosporium spp. (n = 4 each of
		"Scedosporium prolificans, Scedosporium aurantiacum and Pseudallescheria boydii/"
		Scedosporium apiospermum complex [non-S. aurantiacum]) were recovered from 12 of
		69 (17.4%) patients. Samples of 11 of the patients yielded isolates on
		Scedosporium- selective media (vs. 6 [8.7%] by non-selective culture) and one
		"additional patient was noted by PCR. Of these patients, 83.3% were co-colonized"
		"with other moulds, most frequently Aspergillus fumigatus. Colonization was not"
		"associated with best FEV₁/predicted, corticosteroid or antifungal therapies. By"
		"univariate analysis, patients with Scedosporium colonization were significantly"
		"less likely to be colonized with mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P = 0.025), while"
		prior therapy with antistaphylococcal penicillins was a risk factor for
		colonization (P = 0.045). Bacterial colonization and antimicrobial exposure
		"likely influence Scedosporium colonization, which is optimally detected with"
		selective media. Studies are required to confirm independent risk factors for
		Scedosporium colonization and to determine its impact on lung disease.

PG	-	207-9
AB	-	BACKGROUND: The fungus Scedosporium prolificans was first described as a human
		"pathogen in 1984, and has been associated with metastatic endophthalmitis and one"
		previously reported case of sclerokeratitis. METHODS: We report a case of S.
		prolificans sclerokeratitis in the setting of late scleral necrosis complicating
		pterygium surgery with adjunctive beta-irradiation. RESULTS: A poor clinical
		"response to topical natamycin and amphotericin B, and systemic itraconazole and"
		"ketoconazole was encountered. Enucleation was required, with subsequent"
		microbiological cure. Pathological correlation is described. CONCLUSIONS: S.
		prolificans infections often respond poorly to medical therapy. Early surgical
		intervention is indicated in culture-proven scleritis due to Scedosporium
		prolificans.

TI	-	Infections due to Pseudallescheria/Scedosporium species in patients with advanced
		HIV disease--a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge.
PG	-	e422-9
LID	-	10.1016/j.ijid.2011.03.004 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to highlight the importance of infections
		caused by members of the genera Pseudallescheria/Scedosporium in HIV-positive
		patients. METHODS: We describe a case of a fatal scedosporiosis in a
		treatment-naïve HIV patient and review all previously reported cases of
		pseudallescheriosis/scedosporiosis from a search of the PubMed and Deutsches
		"Institut für Medizinische Dokumentation und Information (DIMDI) databases,"
		"applying the terms 'Pseudallescheria', 'Scedosporium', 'Allescheria',"
		"'Monosporium', 'Petriellidium', 'boydii', 'prolificans', 'inflatum',"
		cross-referenced with 'HIV' and 'AIDS'. RESULTS: Detection of Scedosporium and
		Pseudallescheria species has been reported in 22 HIV-positive patients. Fourteen
		isolates belonged to the Pseudallescheria boydii complex and eight to
		Scedosporium prolificans. Invasive scedosporiosis (IS) was proven in 54.5% of the
		patients. Among them dissemination was observed in 66.7%.
		Pseudallescheria/Scedosporium species were mainly isolated from male individuals.
		Patients with proven IS showed CD4+ cell counts <100/μl and a higher co-infection
		rate as compared to colonized patients. Patients with central nervous system
		(CNS) manifestations showed CD4+ cell counts <50/μl. The mortality rate for
		patients with proven IS was 75% and was 100% for patients with dissemination/CNS
		manifestations. The fatality rate for patients treated with antifungal drugs plus
		surgery was lower compared to patients treated with antimycotic agents alone.
		CONCLUSIONS: IS only occurred in HIV-positive patients with a strongly impaired
		immune system. The survival rates of patients with advanced HIV disease and
		invasive scedosporiosis can be improved by rapid diagnosis by biopsy and requires
		"complex therapy with a combination of active antifungal drugs, surgery and"
		supportive immune augmentation.

		patients with chronic pulmonary disease. While Scedosporium prolificans is
		"resistant to most antimycotics, Scedosporium apiospermum is usually sensitive to"
		voriconazole and posaconazole. Pharmacokinetics and efficacy of nebulized
		voriconazole have been described in a murine model previously. We report for the
		first time the safe and effective use of nebulized voriconazole for the treatment
		of severe pulmonary infection with Scedosporium apiospermum in an adolescent with
		cystic fibrosis.

AB	-	BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Postoperative fungal spondylodiscitis is a rare infectious
		disease. PURPOSE: We report the first case of postoperative spondylodiscitis
		because of Scedosporium prolificans and review postoperative vertebral infection
		caused by fungi. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Medline search. METHODS: Case report and
		literature review. RESULTS: On reviewing the cases of postoperative fungal
		"spondylodiscitis reported so far in the literature, we found eight were caused by"
		"mold, and five by yeast. Clinically, the disease presents similar to"
		"postoperative vertebral osteomyelitis caused by bacteria, and a high clinical"
		index of suspicion may be required to perform appropriate cultures to establish a
		diagnosis. Our review revealed a significant number of cases that were cured
		after surgical debridement and/or antifungal therapy. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis
		"of this limited assessment, it appears that the clinical course and prognosis of"
		postoperative fungal spondylodiscitis is similar to that reported for
		postoperative pyogenic spondylodiscitis.

PG	-	308-13
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Scedosporium prolificans is a dematiaceous fungus that is known to
		"cause a wide spectrum of infections in humans, bearing a severity and a prognosis"
		that is relationed with the patients immune status. METHODS: A retrospective
		review was made of the clinical charts of all patients who developed positive S.
		prolificans cultures in our centre from 1990 to 2000. Isolates were identified by
		colonial morphology and microscopic features. The in vitro susceptibility was
		evaluated using the microdilution method according to NCCLS. RESULTS: S.
		prolificans was isolated in 15 patients. Eight were affected with cystic fibrosis
		and the isolation of S. prolificans in their airways did not worsen their
		clinical status. Among the remaining 7 cases there were five leukemic patients
		with neutropenia and two immunocompetent hosts with cutaneous infection and
		endocarditis. Four of five neutropenic patients died of sudden sepsis and S.
		"prolificans was isolated from blood cultures made a few days before their death,"
		and the fifth neutropenic case suffered a bilateral pneumonia with improving
		course probably due to recovery from neutropenia. As to the immunocompetent group
		"the clinical course was good in the cutaneous infection case, but the"
		endocarditis case died four days after the antifungical therapy was started. All
		"the isolates tested were found to be resistant to amphotericin, 5 flucytosine,"
		"fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, miconazole and terbinafine. CONCLUSIONS:"
		Scedosporium prolificans is a fungal pathogen that colonizes the airways of
		patients affected with cystic fibrosis. It can also cause a wide variety of
		"infections, whose severity and prognosis depends on the patients immune status."
		"Due to the resistance of this fungus to antifungal drugs, the therapeutic options"
		are limited. Only with the correction of neutropenia and surgery in local
		infections in immunocompetent hosts it has been possible to cure these
		infections.

AB	-	PURPOSE: To describe the non-exenteration management of sino-orbital fungal
		"infection, a life-threatening condition for which orbital exenteration is"
		generally considered a first-line treatment. METHODS: A retrospective case series
		is presented of 7 orbits in 6 consecutive patients admitted and treated at 2
		"major metropolitan tertiary teaching hospitals in Sydney, New South Wales,"
		Australia. RESULTS: Seven orbits in 6 consecutive patients with sino-orbital
		fungal infection were treated conservatively with surgical debridement and
		intravenous antifungal agents. Four patients were immunosuppressed and the other
		"2 patients were otherwise healthy. All presented with pain, proptosis, or loss of"
		"vision. Causative organisms found were Mucormycoses, Aspergillus, and"
		Scedosporium prolificans. Exenteration was avoided in all patients as part of
		"their planned management and 5 patients, including 1 with bilateral disease,"
		survived their disease without exenteration. Medical treatment included
		intravenous liposomal amphotericin B or voriconazole. A single immunosuppressed
		"patient deteriorated and as a last resort, exenteration was performed, but this"
		made no difference to his clinical course and in retrospect could have been
		avoided as he died of multiple cerebral metastases diagnosed shortly after his
		deterioration. CONCLUSION: The authors recommend that patients with sino-orbital
		"fungal disease preferably be treated conservatively, without orbital"
		exenteration.

		review of the literature.
PG	-	e13574
LID	-	10.1111/tid.13574 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Lomentospora prolificans (formerly S prolificans) is a saprophyte
		fungi that causes opportunistic infections in solid organ transplant (SOT)
		recipients. Resulting disseminated infections are difficult to treat and have a
		high mortality. Indications for antifungal prophylaxis after heart
		"transplantation (HT) include CMV disease, reoperation, renal replacement therapy,"
		"extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and high environmental exposure to"
		"Aspergillus spores. However, the risk of breakthrough infections, such as"
		"Lomentosporiosis, remains a cause of concern. METHODS: We report the clinical"
		"findings, microbiology, treatment and outcome of a disseminated Lomentosporiosis"
		in a heart transplant recipient with ECMO and antifungal prophylaxis. RESULTS: A
		25-year-old male with complex grown-up congenital heart disease (GUCHD) was
		admitted for HT. He presented severe post-surgical complications including acute
		kidney injury and right heart and respiratory failure requiring
		"venoarterial-ECMO, continuous renal replacement therapy (CCRT) and later on (+14)"
		"a ventricular assist device (VAD). Ganciclovir, cotrimoxazole, and antifungal"
		prophylaxis with anidulafungin at standard doses had been started on day + 3 post
		"HT. The patient presented seizures (+4), pancytopenia with mild neutropenia"
		"(days + 6 to + 11), influenza B (+7), and bacteremic Pseudomonas aeruginosa"
		ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) (+10). On days + 14 to + 16 Lomentospora
		"prolificans was recovered from blood cultures, broncho aspirate, catheter tip,"
		"and skin biopsy. Despite treatment with L-AMB, voriconazole and terbinafine the"
		patients died on day 17 after HT. Necropsy revealed disseminated infection with
		"fungal invasion in central nervous system, heart, lung, cutaneous, and"
		subcutaneous tissue. Broth microdilution tests demonstrated resistance to all
		antifungals. CONCLUSIONS: Lomentosporiosis is a rare complication that may emerge
		as a breakthrough invasive fungal infection in heart transplant recipients on
		ECMO despite antifungal prophylaxis.

AB	-	Scedosporium prolificans is an emerging agent for severe infections. Although
		among the dematiaceous fungi Scedosporium is the most frequently isolated in
		"blood cultures, Scedosporium endocarditis is rarely reported. We show herein a"
		patient with acute leukaemia who developed S. prolificans endocarditis. Twelve
		cases were found in an extensive review of the English literature. In six cases
		"(46%), there was predisposing heart conditions such as a prosthetic valve or an"
		intracavitary device. Only 4 patients (31%) were immunocompromised hosts with
		"haematologic neoplasia, solid-organ transplantation or acquired immunodeficiency"
		syndrome (AIDS). Exposure to Scedosporium was observed in immunocompetent
		patients who developed infection while in the community. Scedosporium
		endocarditis occurred on both sides of the heart. Systemic and pulmonary emboli
		and other metastatic complications were seen in all of these patients. The
		"overall mortality was 77% and, specifically, all of the immunocompromised hosts"
		and 6 out of 7 patients with mitral or aortic valve endocarditis died. Patients
		with right-sided endocarditis associated with a removable intracardiac device
		"exhibited a better prognosis. Scedosporium endocarditis, although still rare, is"
		"an emerging infection with an ominous prognosis. At the present time, valve"
		replacement or the removal of cardiac devices plus combined antifungal treatment
		may offer the best possibility of cure.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: An increasing rate of respiratory colonization and infection in
		cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by fungi of the Scedosporium apiospermum species
		complex or Lomentospora prolificans (Sac-Lp). These fungi rank second among the
		"filamentous fungi colonizing the CF airways, after Aspergillus fumigatus."
		"However, the epidemiology, clinical relevance and risk of pulmonary colonization"
		with Sac-Lp are rarely understood in CF. The objective of the present prospective
		multicenter study was to study pathogen distribution and determine association
		factors of pulmonary Sac-Lp colonization in patients with CF. MATERIAL AND
		"METHODS: Clinical, microbiological and laboratory data of 161 patients aged 6-59"
		years with CF in Germany were analyzed for Sac-Lp distribution and association
		factors. The free statistical software R was utilized to investigate adjusted
		logistic regression models for association factors. RESULTS: Of the 161 patients
		"included in the study, 74 (56%) were male. The median age of the study cohort was"
		23 years (interquartile range 13-32 years). 58 patients of the total cohort (36%)
		were < 18 years old. Adjusted multivariate regression analysis revealed that
		"Sac-Lp colonization was associated with younger age (OR 0.8684, 95%CI:"
		"0.7955-0.9480, p<0.005) and less colonization with H. influenzae (OR 0.0118,"
		"95%CI: 0.0009-0.1585, p<0.001). In addition, Sac-Lp-colonized patients had more"
		"often allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) (OR 14.6663, 95%CI:"
		"2.1873-98.3403, p<0.01) and have been colonized more often with the mucoid"
		"phenotype of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (OR 9.8941, 95%CI: 1.0518-93.0705, p<0.05)."
		CONCLUSION: Newly found association of ABPA and Pseudomonas revealed new probable
		risk factors for Sac-Lp colonization. Allergy might play a role in inducing
		immunologic host reactions which lead to a less effective response to species of
		Sac-Lp.

TI	-	Causes of death in hyper-IgE syndrome.
PG	-	1234-40
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Hyper-IgE syndrome (HIES) is characterized by recurrent pyogenic
		"infections, eczema, increased serum IgE levels, and a variety of connective"
		tissue and skeletal system abnormalities. Little has been published regarding the
		causes of death in these patients or pathologic findings. OBJECTIVE: To identify
		the cause of death in patients with HIES and to describe pathologic findings in
		fatal HIES. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records and autopsy slides of 6
		patients with HIES with autopsies performed at our institution. RESULTS: All 6
		patients with HIES were women and ranged in age from 24 to 40 years. All patients
		"had a history of cystic lung disease and had pneumonia at the time of death, with"
		Pseudomonas aeruginosa and fungal organisms predominating. Pulmonary fungal
		"vascular invasion with fatal hemorrhage was observed in 3 patients, and"
		metastatic fungal disease to the brain was observed in 2 patients caused by
		Aspergillus fumigatus and Scedosporium prolificans. Four patients had evidence of
		"renal tubular injury, which was likely from amphotericin B toxicity; 3 patients"
		had glomerulosclerosis; and 1 patient had 2 kidney angiomyolipomas. CONCLUSIONS:
		Our series highlights the important role Pseudomonas and Aspergillus species play
		in patients with HIES with cystic lung disease. Intensified antifungal and
		gram-negative bacterial prophylaxis need evaluation as possible strategies to
		prevent these infectious complications in patients with cystic lung disease.
		CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Fungal and Pseudomonas infection of cystic lung disease in
		"HIES may be life threatening, and the proper management and prevention of these"
		infections need continued investigation.

AB	-	"AIMS: Because of the paucity of previous data, we report the organisms causing"
		infection in children with injuries from lawnmowers and farm machinery. METHODS:
		Retrospective study of children admitted to the Children's Hospital at Westmead
		for lawnmower and farm machinery-related injuries from 1998 to 2007. RESULTS:
		Twenty-four patients were admitted for lawnmower-related injuries. They had a
		"bimodal age distribution, with peaks at 2-4 years and 14 years. Twenty-one"
		(87.5%) were boys. Positive wound cultures were obtained in 16.7% and included
		Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. Eight patients were admitted for farm
		machinery-related injuries. Two patients (25%) returned positive wound cultures
		"with multiple organisms including bacteria, fungi and mycobacteria and were"
		diagnosed with osteomyelitis caused by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and
		"Scedosporium prolificans, respectively. CONCLUSION: The rate of infection in our"
		small series of children with lawnmower and farm machinery-related injuries was
		"comparable to previous reports. We found a wide range of causative organisms,"
		"often inherently antibiotic resistant, and we add a case of invasive fungal"
		"infection to previous case reports. Because of the wide range of organisms,"
		empirical antibiotic therapy is difficult and our data emphasise the need for
		cultures to direct ongoing therapy.

AB	-	Scedosporium apiospermum associated endocarditis is extremely rare. We report a
		case of a disseminated S. apiospermum infection with an invasive right atrial
		"mass in a 52-year-old male, 11 months after heart transplantation, referred to"
		our institution for an endogenous endophthalmitis with a one-month history of
		diffuse myalgias and fatigue. The patient had been supported two times with
		extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) during the first three postoperative
		months. The echocardiography on admission revealed a mass in the right atrium
		attached to a thickened lateral wall. The whole-body [(18)F]FDG PET/CT revealed
		"systemic dissemination in the lungs, muscles, and subcutaneous tissue. Blood"
		cultures were positive on day three for filamentous fungi later identified as S.
		apiospermum. The disease was refractory to a 3-week dual antifungal therapy with
		"voriconazole and anidulafungin in addition to reduced immunosuppression, and"
		palliative care was implemented.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate safety and efficacy of oral posaconazole and terbinafine
		for Lomentospora prolificans and Scedosporium apiospermum in children with cystic
		fibrosis. METHODS: Retrospective case review. RESULTS: There were five children
		"(four girls), median age 15.0 years; three had S. apiospermum and two had L."
		prolificans. Treatment duration: median 5 months (range: 5-18 m). In no patient
		"was eradication achieved, with the follow-up range being 6 months to 4 years."
		Effect on lung function was variable but encouraging. No adverse effects were
		"reported, one child had transient elevation of liver enzymes. CONCLUSIONS: While"
		"the combination therapy was well tolerated, it was unsuccessful at eradication."

TI	-	Disseminated infection by Scedosporium prolificans: an emerging fatality among
		haematology patients. Case report and review.
PG	-	340-4
AB	-	We describe a case of proven disseminated infection by Scedosporium prolificans
		in a profoundly neutropenic patient. The patient presented with a fever
		"unresponsive to broad-spectrum antibiotics, endophthalmitis, respiratory failure"
		and a renal abscess. The organism was isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid
		and from pus obtained through a sterile puncture. Review of the English-language
		literature identified 28 additional cases; these occurred exclusively in severely
		neutropenic patients (predominantly leukaemia) and in transplant recipients.
		"Apart from two or possibly three cases, dissemination was uniformly fatal due to"
		persistent neutropenia and inherited resistance of these pathogens to currently
		"available antifungal drugs. At present, the optimal treatment of S. prolificans"
		"infections is unknown, but reversal of the underlying deficient immune status"
		appears of great importance.

TI	-	Bone and joint infection after traumatic implantation of Scedosporium prolificans
		treated with voriconazole and surgery.
PG	-	980-2
AB	-	Scedosporium prolificans is an environmental mould that may cause local infection
		"in bone and joints after traumatic implantation, or generalized infection in"
		"immunocompromised patients. The fungus is highly drug resistant, both in vitro"
		and in vivo. We present a case of osteomyelitis and arthritis caused by S.
		prolificans in a 9-y-old boy whose knee had been punctured by a hawthorn spike.
		Treatment with different drugs was difficult and arthrodesis was necessary.
		"Concomitantly, voriconazole was given, and after three months bone biopsies were"
		sterile despite a high in vitro MIC-value of the fungus against voriconazole.
		Reversible skin depigmentation and fingernail oncholysis appeared toward the end
		of 17 months of voriconazole treatment. Twelve months after discontinuation of
		"treatment, no signs of relapse were detected. CONCLUSION: Voriconazole may be a"
		valuable adjunct to surgical treatment of bone and joint infection by
		Scedosporium prolificans.

AB	-	STUDY DESIGN: Case report and clinical discussion. OBJECTIVE: To describe a rare
		case of chronic spinal epidural abscess caused by Scedosporium prolificans in an
		immunocompetent patient. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: S. prolificans is an
		emerging multiresistant fungal pathogen that may cause a wide variety of
		"infections, whose severity depends of the patient's immune status. METHODS: A"
		35-year-old Brazilian man developed a 5-year chronic progressive paresis in lower
		limbs followed by sphincter dysfunction. Spinal magnetic resonance imaging
		revealed a thoracic-lumbar epidural mass that heterogeneously enhanced
		gadolinium. Spinal biopsy showed a chronic inflammatory process localized in
		epidural thoracic spine. S. prolificans was isolated in a specific culture.
		RESULTS: He was treated with endovenous voriconazole for 2 weeks followed by oral
		"voriconazole for 90 days. Three months later, a T9-T10 epidural mass was detected"
		"on a new magnetic resonance imaging. The abscess was drained, and the culture of"
		the material confirmed the persistence of infection by S. prolificans. A
		progressive paraparesis due to chronic meningo-myelitis was observed at a 6-month
		"follow-up. Although patient was treated with caspofungin, terbinafine, and"
		"voriconazole, no improvement was observed. CONCLUSION: S. prolificans can cause"
		chronic epidural abscess and spine infection in immunocompetent patients. The
		potential resistance of S. prolificans to antifungal agents should be borne in
		mind.

AB	-	PURPOSE: To describe the clinical features and outcomes of patients with
		culture-proven Pseudallescheria endophthalmitis in the context of previously
		"published cases. METHODS: A multicenter, retrospective, consecutive case series"
		was undertaken. Pathology records were reviewed for all patients with
		Pseudallescheria endophthalmitis on vitreous/aqueous cultures from June 1998 to
		"June 2013 throughout Queensland, Australia. RESULTS: Three females and 1 male"
		"aged 60 to 78 years were identified. All patients had endogenous endophthalmitis,"
		"had an underlying malignancy, and were from South East Queensland. Vitreous"
		cultures identified Scedosporium auranticum in two cases and Scedosporium
		prolificans and Scedosporium apiospermum in one case each. All isolates were
		sensitive to voriconazole. Enucleation was required in two patients. Two patients
		had final best-corrected visual acuities of perception of light and no perception
		"of light, respectively. CONCLUSION: Endophthalmitis caused by species of the P."
		boydii complex is a devastating condition with poor visual outcomes. It is a
		condition that is difficult to treat because of its variable antifungal agent
		resistance.

AB	-	Aggressive chemotherapy and immunosuppressive treatment may prolong patients'
		"life, but influence the risk of severe, life-threatening infections. Here, we"
		report the case of a 21-year-old caucasian female who developed a disseminated
		infection of Scedosporium prolificans after allogenic stem cell transplantation
		performed for treatment of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. The pathogen
		was isolated from the blood and identified on the basis of its macroscopic and
		microscopic morphological features. The empirical treatment with amphotericin B
		"provided no improvement. However, introduction of intravenous voriconazole"
		"resulted in amelioration of fever. Unfortunately, the patient died due to"
		"progression of underlying disease and multiorgan failure. However, this case"
		report indicates a possible relevance of voriconazole-based treatment regimens in
		invasive S. prolificans infections.

AB	-	Scedosporium prolificans has been increasingly recognized as an etiological agent
		of disseminated mycelial infections in profoundly immunocompromised patients.
		Reported herein is a case of disseminated S. prolificans infection in a patient
		undergoing anti-neoplastic chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia. Antemortem
		"blood culture yielded S. prolificans, which was confirmed on conventional"
		morphological examination and polymerase chain reaction-based DNA sequencing
		targeting internally transcribed spacer regions. Histopathology of autopsy
		"specimens indicated fungal infection in the heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, spleen,"
		"pancreas and gastrointestinal tract, with the development of hemorrhagic and"
		ischemic necrosis. The infecting fungus had developing septate hyphae and was
		"identified as belonging to the genus Scedosporium, on in situ hybridization of"
		tissue. The combination of haphazardly branching hyphae and lemon-shaped conidia
		appeared to be the most useful distinguishing features to allow differentiation
		of this fungus from other filamentous fungi in tissue. Three other unique
		histopathological characteristics of the fungus were noted: (i) parallel hyphae
		bridged at right angles to produce letter-H patterns; (ii) intravascular
		"conidiation; and (iii) purple conidia in tissue, though these are usually"
		"described as brown in most text books. Precise histopathology, in addition to"
		"other techniques such as in situ hybridization, can aid in the identification of"
		etiological fungi.

		"abscesses. To our knowledge, this is the first report from Japan in which"
		Scedosporium prolificans (S. prolificans) was cultured from intraocular tissue.
		"CASE: A 74-year-old man, receiving chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia,"
		complained of visual loss in both eyes. Best-corrected visual acuity was hand
		"motion in the right and 2/200 in the left eye. His right eye showed exophthalmos,"
		inflammation in the anterior chamber and iris neovascularization. Funduscopy
		"revealed no details as there was vitreous opacity in the right eye, and irregular"
		round yellowish-white subretinal lesions involving the macula in the left eye.
		"Blood culture was negative, and C-reactive protein (CRP) and β-D glucan titers"
		were high. An antifungal drug and broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated. Two
		"days after the initial visit, right visual acuity had deteriorated to light"
		perception. Enucleation of the right eye was performed for diagnosis and
		"treatment. Fungi were cultured from the subretinal lesion, confirming a diagnosis"
		of S. prolificans infection. After systemic administration and intravitreal
		"injections of antifungal agents, the subretinal abscess in the left eye gradually"
		"diminished. At present, six months after the first visit, left visual acuity is"
		"20/200. CONCLUSION: Although S. prolificans endophthalmitis can be intractable,"
		this case suggests that repeated intravitreal antifungal agent injections can be
		effective.

AB	-	"Invasive mould infection, e. g. aspergillosis in the first place, is a common"
		infection in immunocompromised patients. The diagnosis of invasive mould
		infection is difficult in the absence of confirmation by tissue biopsy and
		"histological studies. Therefore, prevalence of invasive mould infections at the"
		School of Medicine of the Leipzig University between 1992 and 1994 was
		investigated. The diagnosis of invasive mould infection was suspected on
		"clinical, mycological, and radiological findings. The definitive diagnosis was"
		"obtained by identification of characteristic mould hyphae on stained smears,"
		"and/or positive culture, and/or the detection of Aspergillus antigen (Pastorex)"
		"in serum, bronchial secretion, or bronchoalveolar fluid, and confirmed by"
		histopathology. In altogether 21 patients the definitive diagnosis invasive mould
		"infection was recorded, among them 20 invasive aspergilloses. Underlying diseases"
		"were leukaemia (n = 11), aplastic anaemia (n = 2), non-Hodgkin-lymphoma (n = 1),"
		"systemic lupus erythematosus (n = 1), kidney transplantation (n = 1), peritonitis"
		"after Billroth II anastomosis (n = 1), Polymyalgia rheumatica (n = 1), AIDS plus"
		"Burkitt lymphoma (n = 1), glioblastoma (n = 1), and subarachnoid haemorrhage (n ="
		"1). As causative fungi were isolated: Aspergillus fumigatus (n = 13), Aspergillus"
		"terreus (n = 1), Aspergillus flavus as rare simultaneous injection with the"
		"basidiomycete Coprinus spec. in a leukaemic patient (n = 1), and the dematiaceous"
		fungus Scedosporium prolificans in an AIDS patient with Burkitt lymphoma (n = 1).
		In four patients the invasive mould infection was confirmed histopathologically
		without isolation and differentiation of the causative agent. Nineteen of the 21
		patients with invasive mould infections died corresponding to a mortality rate of
		90%.

AB	-	Disseminated Scedosporium prolificans infection occurs mainly in
		"immunocompromised patients. The mortality rate is high, as the fungus is"
		"resistant to most antifungal agents. Here, we present the case of a 66-year-old"
		female with acute myeloid leukemia who developed infective endocarditis caused by
		"S. prolificans infection during induction chemotherapy. Her 1,3-β-D-glucan levels"
		were elevated and computed tomography revealed bilateral sinusitis and
		disseminated small nodular masses within the lungs and spleen; it nonetheless
		took 6 days to identify S. prolificans by blood culture. The patient died of
		multi-organ failure despite the combined use of voriconazole and terbinafine.
		Autopsy revealed numerous mycotic emboli within multiple organs (caused by mitral
		valve vegetation) and endocarditis (caused by S. prolificans). The geographic
		"distribution of this infection is limited to Australia, the United States, and"
		"southern Europe, particularly Spain. The first Japanese case was reported in"
		"2011, and four cases have been reported to date, including this one. Recently,"
		the incidence of S. prolificans-disseminated infection in immunocompromised
		"patients has increased in Japan. Therefore, clinicians should consider S."
		prolificans infection as a differential diagnosis when immunocompromised patients
		"suffer disseminated infections with elevated 1,3-β-D-glucan levels."

		transplantation.
PG	-	370-3
AB	-	PURPOSE: To report a case of bilateral endogenous fungal endophthalmitis
		resulting from disseminated Scedosporium prolificans. DESIGN: Observational case
		report. METHODS: A 56-year-old woman with cystic fibrosis status post dual lung
		transplantation on chronic immunosuppressive therapy presented with acute graft
		rejection. Cultures of bronchial brushings revealed S. prolificans. Three weeks
		"after admission, the patient noted increased blurriness and a central scotoma in"
		her right eye. Dilated fundus examination revealed profound vitritis in the right
		"eye with hemorrhagic retinitis involving the macula. A peripheral, yellow"
		choroidal infiltrate with overlying retinitis and localized vitritis was present
		"in the left eye. RESULTS: Intravitreal antibiotics were initiated, and vitreous"
		cultures revealed S. prolificans. The patient ultimately succumbed to her
		disseminated disease. Pathologic examination of the eyes confirmed bilateral
		endogenous fungal endophthalmitis. CONCLUSION: S. prolificans is an opportunistic
		infection resistant to standard antifungal therapy that can result in endogenous
		endophthalmitis in immunocompromised individuals.

TI	-	Pathology of hyalohyphomycosis caused by Scedosporium apiospermum
		(Pseudallescheria boydii): an emerging mycosis.
PG	-	1266-72
AB	-	The genus Scedosporium contains two medically significant species of emerging
		"mycotic agents, S. apiospermum and S. prolificans, which have received scant"
		"attention. Scedosporium apiospermum is the anamorph, or asexual state, of the"
		"cosmopolitan fungus Pseudallescheria boydii, with both sharing the same risk"
		"factors for infection, clinical spectrum, and histopathologic features."
		"Scedosporium prolificans is a recently recognized agent of bone, soft tissue, and"
		joint infections that occurs with highest frequency in children and young adults.
		S. prolificans may also cause potentially fatal disseminated infections in
		immunocompromised persons. The drug sensitivities of both Scedosporium species
		"are significantly different from those of most other fungi, and thus"
		"identification of these organisms is important. Unfortunately, the pathological"
		features of Scedosporium infections may be easily confused with other mycotic
		"agents, resulting in delayed or inappropriate medical therapy. Because many"
		pathologists and clinicians are unfamiliar with the significance of Scedosporium
		"spp. infection, this communication describes three persons with differing"
		clinical and pathological presentations of S. apiospermum infection. In one
		"patient with sickle cell disease and chronic mycotic sinusitis, fungal colonies"
		of S. apiospermum removed from the sinuses showed a pattern of alternating zones
		"of mycelial hypercellularity and hypocellularity associated with conidiation,"
		similar to a previous report of P. boydii infection. The clinicopathologic
		"features of an immunocompetent person with S. apiospermum osteomyelitis, and a"
		patient with S. apiospermum infection of the brain after bone marrow
		"transplantation, are also described."

PG	-	460-4
AB	-	The case is described of a 42-year-old patient with acute myeloid leukemia who
		received two courses of chemotherapy complicated by prolonged bone marrow
		"depression. He was admitted to hospital with fever, hepatosplenomegaly and"
		bilateral nodular pulmonary infiltrates. After admission diffuse cutaneous skin
		"nodules, and hypodense lesions in the hemispheres and cerebellum developed."
		"Cultures of cerebrospinal fluid, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, skin biopsy"
		"specimens and blood revealed Scedosporium prolificans, indicative of disseminated"
		mycosis. Treatment with amphotericin B and fluconazole was unsuccessful and the
		patient died within five days after admission. Features that may enhance early
		recognition of Scedosporium prolificans infection by both clinicians and
		"microbiologists, as well as options in the treatment of infection with this"
		fungal agent are discussed.

PG	-	139-42
LID	-	10.1016/j.riam.2011.06.007 [doi]
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Scedosporium spp. are filamentous fungi, and the 2 most important"
		species are Scedosporium prolificans and Scedosporium apiospermum. S. apiospermum
		accounts for approximately 25% of non-Aspergillus filamentous fungi infections in
		organ transplant recipients. Scedosporium can colonize the sinuses and airways of
		"lung recipients with underlying pulmonary diseases, such as bronchiectasis or"
		"cystic fibrosis before transplant, and develop invasive disease after lung"
		"transplantation. In fact, invasive diseases caused by S. apiospermum have been"
		"reported only rarely, in single lung transplant recipients and cystic fibrosis"
		transplant patients. The treatment of scedosporiasis is complicated due to the
		difficulty in early diagnosis together with inherent resistance to amphotericin
		B. CASE REPORT: A case of disseminated S. apiospermum infection after single lung
		transplant in a patient with pulmonary fibrosis is reported. Leg mycetoma was the
		"initial sign of this disseminated infection. In this case report, current"
		"treatment options are discussed, and a review of the literature of previously"
		published cases of lung transplants is made. CONCLUSIONS: One conclusion based on
		this case is the risk of emergent molds related to antifungal prophylaxis. In
		"addition, colonization by Scedosporium in transplant recipients should not be"
		"ignored, and target prophylaxis or suppressive therapy should be considered in"
		all those cases with residual lesions in native lung or chronic rejection in
		transplanted lungs.

AB	-	We report a very rare case of pulmonary chromomycosis caused by Scedosporium
		prolificans that developed after lung transplantation and was successfully
		treated with endobronchial topical amphotericin B instillation. The subject was a
		woman in her 50s with a history of bilateral lobar lung transplantation from
		living donors for idiopathic pulmonary hypertension. Eight years after the lung
		"transplantation, chest radiography X-ray and computed tomography showed an"
		abnormal shadow in the right lung. Bronchoscopic findings showed obstruction by a
		fungal component at the laterobasal bronchus B9. She was diagnosed with pulmonary
		chromomycosis after S. prolificans was detected in the bronchial aspirate.
		"Systemic antifungal treatment with itraconazole was ineffective. Therefore, we"
		administered topical amphotericin B weekly via endobronchial instillation and
		replaced oral itraconazole with voriconazole. The endobronchial procedure was
		safe and tolerable. Bronchial obstruction improved after three 3 instillations.
		"We continued topical amphotericin B instillation once every 3 months for 2 years,"
		and the abnormal shadow nearly disappeared. This case report describes infection
		"by S. prolificans, which rarely becomes an etiologic agent in lung transplant"
		"patients, and shows that endobronchial topical amphotericin B instillation is a"
		therapeutic option when systemic antifungal treatment is ineffective.

TI	-	Scedosporium infection in immunocompromised patients: successful use of liposomal
		amphotericin B and itraconazole.
PG	-	122-5
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive fungal disease is a major cause of death in
		immunocompromised patients. The filamentous fungus Scedosporium consists of two
		"species, S. prolificans and S. apiospermum, which can cause infections in"
		immunocompromised patients that are often fatal. A significant feature of this
		"pathogen is its broad resistance to many antifungal agents, including"
		amphotericin B. PROCEDURE AND RESULTS: Five cases of infection with Scedosporium
		spp. occurred in patients with haematologic malignancies over a 10-month period.
		Three patients with S. prolificans were severely immunosuppressed and
		neutropenic; two were in relapse and another was early post-matched unrelated
		bone marrow transplant. All three died despite treatment with various
		combinations of amphotericin B and itraconazole. Two patients who were less
		immunosuppressed and had a normal neutrophil count developed S. apiospermum
		infection. Both were successfully treated with liposomal amphotericin B and
		itraconazole. CONCLUSIONS: Disseminated infection in immunocompromised hosts with
		"Scedosporium spp. is often fatal. However, in patients with a lesser degree of"
		immunocompromise and particularly in those infected with the less virulent S.
		"apiospermum, intensive antifungal therapy with liposomal amphotericin B and"
		itraconazole may be associated with complete eradication of infection. Med
		Pediatr Oncol 2001;37:122-125.

TI	-	Scedosporium prolificans corneoscleritis: a successful outcome.
PG	-	169-71
AB	-	BACKGROUND: A case of Scedosporium prolificans corneoscleritis is reported in a
		"patient who had developed scleral necrosis following pterygium surgery, with"
		adjunctive beta-irradiation. This fungus has been reported to be the causative
		organism in only two previous cases of corneoscleritis. METHODS: The patient
		presented with signs and symptoms typical of corneoscleritis. When the fungus was
		"isolated from a biopsy specimen, aggressive scleral debridement was carried out"
		and intensive antifungal therapy was instigated. RESULTS: After a prolonged
		"course, the eye was rendered sterile. CONCLUSION: Early conjunctival recession"
		and aggressive scleral debridement combined with intensive instillation of
		antifungals are crucial to the successful management of fungal corneoscleritis.

AB	-	Disseminated Scedosporium prolificans infection in a 1-year-old female spayed
		German Shepherd dog is described. Clinical signs were predominantly associated
		with fungal pyelonephritis and the organism was cultured from the urine. The dog
		"was treated with itraconazole and later, terbinafine was added. Subsequent"
		antifungal susceptibility testing of the isolate showed it to be resistant to all
		available antifungal drugs. The dog was euthanased because of acute abdominal
		haemorrhage and associated clinical deterioration. Postmortem examination
		revealed extensive pyogranulomas containing fungal organisms in the renal
		"parenchyma, myocardium, bone marrow, skeletal muscle, liver, lung, spleen,"
		multiple lymph nodes and pancreas.

PG	-	233-6
AB	-	Scedosporium prolificans infections of normal hosts usually require extensive
		"debridement and sometimes amputation to effect cure, due to the intrinsic"
		resistance of this species to available antifungal agents. Newer agents have not
		"tested favourably. Variable results are obtained with voriconazole, and 100%"
		resistance is described with echinocandins. Itraconazole and terbinafine has
		offered synergy against various moulds including S. prolificans. In vivo success
		is reported with the azole/terbinafine combination in S. apiospermum pulmonary
		infection and Pythium insidiosum periorbital cellulitis. We report a case of
		"orthopaedic infection in a non-immunocompromised host with S. prolificans, in"
		which the combinations of itraconazole/terbinafine and voriconazole/terbinafine
		"showed synergy in vitro, and success was achieved without radical surgery, using"
		voriconazole and terbinafine.

		Scedosporium prolificans diagnosed post mortem is reported in a 60-year-old male
		patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome who additionally suffered from
		Burkitt's lymphoma. The patient was significantly granulocytopenic following
		aggressive chemotherapy and irradiation. He developed dyspnoea at rest and chest
		pain despite a normal chest radiograph. Fluconazole treatment was carried out
		"empirically because no sign of a fungal infection was detected ante mortem,"
		either by mycological cultivation or by serological investigation. First
		post-mortem examination revealed a disseminated fungal infection involving the
		"central nervous system. Scedosporium prolificans was cultured from the kidney,"
		"spleen and myocardium. In vitro, the fungal isolate was found to be highly"
		resistant to all available systemic antimycotics.

		"from the rooms, corridors, and adjacent areas did not yield S. prolificans"
		"(inflatum). Nevertheless, circumstantial evidence suggested a nosocomial outbreak"

TI	-	Imaging findings of pulmonary infection caused by Scedosporium prolificans in a
		deep immunocompromised patient.
PG	-	47-9
AB	-	Scedosporium prolificans is an emerging fungus that causes rapid progressive and
		disseminated infections in immunodepressed patients. We present a case of a
		34-year-old woman with chronic myelogenous leukemia who received a bone marrow
		transplantation and suffered a sudden respiratory failure in +67 day. Chest
		radiographies showed growing bilateral patchy condensations. Computed Tomography
		depicted bilateral nodular condensation of alveolar space. S. prolificans was
		"detected from sputum, but the patient died 72 h later. Imaging findings of lung"
		"scedosporiosis are nonspecific, but CT may provide a prompter diagnosis and allow"
		to add newer antifungal treatments. This report presents the first imaging report
		of lung scedosporiosis.

PG	-	2223-4
LID	-	10.1016/j.transproceed.2009.06.017 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: We sought to present our results of topical intrabronchial
		installation of amphotericin B lipid complex (AmpB lipid). PATIENT AND METHODS: A
		deposit of fungal material was observed in a bilateral lung transplant recipient
		who experienced stenosis of the left anastomosis and have been fitted with a
		double endobronchial prosthesis. The deposit was adherent to the prosthetic
		"material, causing marked local laceration, risk of perforation, and exacerbation"
		"of the bronchial stenosis. Upon cultivation of a bronchial aspirate (BAS), we"
		"isolated Aspergillus fumigatus, Scedosporium prolificans, and Candida glabrata."
		Systemic antifungal treatment was begun with oral voriconazole (200 mg every 12
		hours) and inhaled AmpB lipid (25 mg once daily). The fungal deposit on the
		prosthetic material was treated by topical instillation of a solution of 25 mg
		"AmpB lipid before and after each therapeutic fibrobronchoscopy (FB), which was"
		performed weekly at 5 consecutive examinations. Tolerance was excellent. RESULTS:
		The improvement obtained after the procedure made it possible to withdraw one of
		the displaced prostheses. Subsequent cultivation for the fungi found in the BAS
		was persistently negative over a follow-up of 2 years. CONCLUSION: Topical
		intrabronchial instillation of AmpB lipid has proven effective and well tolerated
		for the treatment of localized fungal colonies. This use could be extended by
		protocol to FB in the early postoperative period after lung transplantation for
		antifungal prophylaxis.

		anti-mold azole antifungal agents like voriconazole or posaconazole have been
		increasingly reported. We report a case of lung Scedosporium prolificans
		infection with multiple cavities in a 58-year-old man with monoclonal gammopathy
		of undetermined significance (MGUS) during voriconazole treatment for probable
		invasive aspergillosis. Cultures of repeated sputum specimens yielded the same
		fungus until his death 83 days after diagnosis. S. prolificans should be
		considered in patients with breakthrough infections receiving voriconazole.

TI	-	Fungemia due to Scedosporium prolificans: a description of two cases with fatal
		outcome.
PG	-	645-7
AB	-	"Two cases, probably related, of fungemia due to Scedosporium prolificans are"
		described in two patients with acute leukemia. Both were admitted to the
		"hematological ward in nearby rooms, during building work in the hospital. After a"
		"previous bacterial sepsis in the neutropenic phase, which improved with"
		"antibiotic treatment, the respiratory status in both patients deteriorated"
		"presenting acute dypsnea, with a lung infiltrate in one of them. A few hours"
		later both patients died. Blood cultures were positive for S. prolificans. These
		two new cases of S. prolificans infection stress the importance of awareness of
		this emerging pathogen in patients who suffer a hematologic malignancy during the
		"neutropenic phase, especially if building work is taking place in the hospital."
