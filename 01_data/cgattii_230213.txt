AB	-	Rapid diagnosis and treatment of infectious meningitis and encephalitis are
		critical to minimize morbidity and mortality. Comprehensive testing of
		"cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) often includes Gram stain, culture, antigen detection,"
		"and molecular methods, paired with chemical and cellular analyses. These methods"
		"may lack sensitivity or specificity, can take several days, and require"
		significant volume for complete analysis. The FilmArray Meningitis/Encephalitis
		"(ME) Panel is a multiplexed in vitro diagnostic test for the simultaneous, rapid"
		(∼1-h) detection of 14 pathogens directly from CSF specimens: Escherichia coli
		"K1, Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, Neisseria meningitidis,"
		"Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, cytomegalovirus, enterovirus,"
		"herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, human herpesvirus 6, human parechovirus,"
		"varicella-zoster virus, and Cryptococcus neoformans/Cryptococcus gattii We"
		"describe a multicenter evaluation of 1,560 prospectively collected CSF specimens"
		with performance compared to culture (bacterial analytes) and PCR (all other
		analytes). The FilmArray ME Panel demonstrated a sensitivity or positive
		percentage of agreement of 100% for 9 of 14 analytes. Enterovirus and human
		"herpesvirus type 6 had agreements of 95.7% and 85.7%, and L. monocytogenes and N."
		"meningitidis were not observed in the study. For S. agalactiae, there was a"
		"single false-positive and false-negative result each, for a sensitivity and"
		"specificity of 0 and 99.9%, respectively. The specificity or negative percentage"
		of agreement was 99.2% or greater for all other analytes. The FilmArray ME Panel
		is a sensitive and specific test to aid in diagnosis of ME. With use of this
		"comprehensive and rapid test, improved patient outcomes and antimicrobial"
		stewardship are anticipated.

AB	-	"Cryptococcosis is a systemic fungal infection, caused by encapsulated yeast of"
		"the genus Cryptococcus, C neoformans and C gattii. These environmental"
		"microorganisms live in pigeon and other bird droppings, as well as in the fruit"
		and bark of various trees. Infection in humans and other animal species usually
		occurs by inhalation and less frequently through the skin and by ingestion of the
		"fungus. Most infections have a benign course and resolve spontaneously; however,"
		"the incidence of cryptococcosis has increased considerably, mainly due to diverse"
		"causes of immunodeficiency, particularly AIDS. Cryptococcus neoformans infections"
		"are common, worldwide, and severe forms are seen in immunocompromised patients."
		Cases caused by C gattii predominate in tropical or subtropical regions.
		"Cryptococcosis may present as an acute, subacute, or chronic lung disease, as a"
		"nonpurulent cerebrospinal fluid meningitis, or as a severe infection with fever,"
		"anemia, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly. The eye can be affected, with"
		partial or total loss of vision. Diagnosis is by direct observation of the
		"causative agent, in histopathologic studies, by isolation in culture, and by the"
		presence of capsular antigen. Treatment is the intravenous administration of
		"amphotericin B deoxycholate, alone or combined with 5-fluorocytosine or"
		"fluconazole, which can be given orally or intravenously. Itraconazole is less"
		effective when the central nervous system is affected. Voriconazole appears to be
		"a drug that can be used in these patients. In AIDS patients, secondary"
		prophylaxis is administered with fluconazole or amphotericin B and is continued
		until CD4 cell counts exceed 200 cells/μL. Evaluation of intracranial pressure is
		important in the first weeks after diagnosis in AIDS patients.

TI	-	Avian cryptococcosis.
PG	-	115-24
AB	-	Clinical and laboratory findings in 15 unreported cases of avian cryptococcosis
		from Australia were collated and contrasted with 11 cases recorded in the
		literature. Cryptococcus species produced localized invasive disease of the upper
		respiratory tract of captive parrots living in Australia. This resulted in signs
		referable to mycotic rhinitis or to involvement of structures contiguous with the
		"nasal cavity, such as the beak, sinuses, choana, retrobulbar space and palate."
		Parrots of widely differing ages were affected and of the seven birds for which
		"sex was determinable, six were male. Cryptococcus bacillisporus (formerly C."
		neoformans var. gattii) accounted for four of five infections in which the
		"species or variety was determinable, suggesting that exposure to eucalyptus"
		"material may be a predisposing factor. In these cases, Cryptococcus appeared to"
		behave as a primary pathogen of immunocompetent hosts. One tissue specimen was
		available from an Australian racing pigeon with minimally invasive subcutaneous
		disease; immunohistology demonstrated a C. neoformans var. grubii (formerly C.
		"neoformans var. neoformans serotype A) infection, presumably subsequent to"
		traumatic inoculation of yeast cells into the subcutis. Two similar cases had
		"been reported previously in pigeons domiciled in America. Data for parrots, one"
		pigeon and other birds studied principally in America and Europe (and likely
		"infected with C. neoformans) suggested a different pattern of disease, more"
		suggestive of opportunistic infection of immunodeficient hosts. In this cohort of
		"patients, the organism was not restricted to cool superficial sites such as the"
		"upper respiratory tract or subcutis. Instead, infections typically penetrated the"
		lower respiratory tract or disseminated widely to a variety of internal organs.
		"Finally, three captive North Island brown kiwis, one residing in Australia, the"
		"other two in New Zealand, died as a result of severe diffuse cryptococcal"
		pneumonia (two cases) or widely disseminated disease (one case). C. bacillisporus
		"strains were isolated from all three cases, as reported previously for another"
		kiwi with disseminated disease in New Zealand.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcosis is one of the major causes of mortality among HIV
		patients worldwide. Though most often associated with late stage HIV
		"infection/AIDS, a significant number of cases occur in other immunocompromised"
		patients such as solid organ transplant recipients and patients with
		hematological malignancies. Immunocompromised patients are a heterogeneous group
		and their number increases constantly. Since little is known about the incidence
		"and the clinical features of cryptococcosis in Northern Europe, our aim was to"
		investigate the clinical characteristics of cryptococcosis patients in Finland.
		METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the laboratory confirmed cryptococcosis
		cases in Finland during 2004-2018. Only those who were treated for cryptococcosis
		were included in the study. Initial laboratory findings and medical records were
		also collected. RESULTS: A total of 22 patients with cryptococcosis were included
		"in our study. The annual incidence of cryptococcosis was 0.03 cases per 100,000"
		population. Ten patients were HIV-positive and 12 out of 22 were HIV-negative.
		Hematological malignancy was the most common underlying condition among
		"HIV-negative patients. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study of"
		the clinical presentation and incidence of cryptococcosis in Finland. We
		demonstrate that invasive cryptococcal infection occurs not only in HIV/AIDS
		patients or otherwise immunocompromised patients but also in immunocompetent
		"individuals. Even though cryptococcosis is extremely rare in Finland, its"
		recognition is important since the prognosis depends on rapid diagnostics and
		early antifungal therapy.

AB	-	PURPOSE: To present a case of subretinal abscess associated with pneumonia and
		meningitis caused by Cryptococcus gattii in an immunocompetent host.
		OBSERVATIONS: A 37-year-old man presented with sub-acute painless unilateral
		vision loss and a white submacular elevation. Systemic evaluation revealed a lung
		lesion and cerebrospinal fluid evidence of Cryptococcus gattii infection.
		CONCLUSIONS AND IMPORTANCE: While Crypococcus neoformans has been well described
		"as a cause of chorioretinitis in immunocompetent and immunocompromised hosts,"
		this report demonstrates that Cryptocuccus gattii is a related uncommon pathogen
		to be considered in similar presentations. Submacular surgical debridement may be
		challenging and OCT imaging may be helpful to detect full-thickness retinal
		necrosis.

AB	-	"Cryptococcosis caused by Cryptococcus gattii, is a life threatening fungal"
		infection with recently increasing prevalence. C. gattii is a species complex
		"comprising multiple independent species. However, many biological characteristics"
		and clinical features of cryptococcosis due to C. gattii are relatively less well
		"defined. In this paper, we identify two cases of C. gattii infection, and"
		laboratory findings of genotype VGI and VGII in two groups of apparently
		immunocompetent Chinese individuals respectively. Upon detailed review of all 35
		"cases of C. gattii infections, it was observed that C. gattii can cause"
		debilitating illness in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals.
		"Cryptococcosis due to C. gattii is a serious systemic fungal infection, with"
		"pulmonary central nervous system tropism. Epidemiologically, C. gattii infection"
		"is not only restricted in tropical and subtropical regions, but also in other"
		geographical settings.

PG	-	1531-1544
LID	-	10.2217/fmb-2019-0215 [doi]
AB	-	"Aim: Cryptococcosis causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, but"
		pediatric data are limited. Methods: A retrospective literature review of
		Australian pediatric cryptococcosis and additional 10-year audit of cases from a
		large pediatric network. Results: 22 cases of cryptococcosis in children were
		"identified via literature review: median age was 13.5 years (IQR 7.8-16 years),"
		18/22 (82%) had meningitis or central nervous system infection. Where outcome was
		"reported, 11/18 (61%) died. Of six audit cases identified from 2008 to 2017, 5"
		(83%) had C. gattii disease and survived. One child with acute lymphoblastic
		"leukemia and C. neoformans infection died. For survivors, persisting respiratory"
		or neurological sequelae were reported in 4/6 cases (67%). Conclusion:
		"Cryptococcosis is uncommon in Australian children, but is associated with"
		substantial morbidity.

AB	-	"Cryptococcosis is an invasive systemic mycosis caused by Cryptococcus, a genus of"
		yeast. Causative organisms for human cryptococcosis include Cryptococcus
		neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii. Disease due to C.neoformans is conventionally
		"seen in patients with underlying immunosuppression, whereas"
		C.gattii-related infection is usually seen in immunocompetent people. The fact
		that the infection can occur among otherwise healthy individuals underscores the
		importance of having a necessary understanding of the pathophysiology and
		clinical and radiological presentations of the disease. We report a case of
		disseminated pulmonary and central nervous system (CNS) cryptococcosis in an
		apparently immunocompetent individual with unusual radiological findings
		necessitating probing for alternative diagnoses. We have attempted to supplement
		and revise the existing data on the radiological manifestations of C.gattii.

PG	-	1185-91
LID	-	10.3201/eid1508.081384 [doi]
AB	-	Cryptococcus gattii has emerged as a human and animal pathogen in the Pacific
		"Northwest. First recognized on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada, it now"
		"involves mainland British Columbia, and Washington and Oregon in the United"
		"States. In Canada, the incidence of disease has been one of the highest"
		"worldwide. In the United States, lack of cryptococcal species identification and"
		case surveillance limit our knowledge of C. gattii epidemiology. Infections in
		"the Pacific Northwest are caused by multiple genotypes, but the major strain is"
		genetically novel and may have emerged recently in association with unique mating
		or environmental changes. C. gattii disease affects immunocompromised and
		"immunocompetent persons, causing substantial illness and death. Successful"
		management requires an aggressive medical and surgical approach and consideration
		of potentially variable antifungal drug susceptibilities. We summarize the study
		results of a group of investigators and review current knowledge with the goal of
		increasing awareness and highlighting areas where further knowledge is required.

TI	-	Neutralizing Anti-Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor Autoantibodies
		in Patients With Central Nervous System and Localized Cryptococcosis:
		Longitudinal Follow-up and Literature Review.
PG	-	278-287
LID	-	10.1093/cid/ciab920 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Neutralizing anti-granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor
		(GM-CSF) autoantibodies (AAbs) have been increasingly recognized to predispose
		"healthy individuals to disseminated cryptococcosis. However, studies have only"
		considered patients with central nervous system (CNS) infection. No longitudinal
		study has captured the disease spectrum and clinical course. METHODS: We
		prospectively enrolled adults without human immunodeficiency virus infection who
		"had disseminated or unusual cryptococcosis. We compared the demographics,"
		"clinical features, kinetics of serum cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) titers,"
		"anti-GM-CSF AAb concentrations, and treatment outcomes between patients with"
		(case patients) and without (control patients) anti-GM-CSF AAbs. Additional
		reports from the literature were also reviewed. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients
		"were enrolled, of whom 6 tested positive for anti-GM-CSF AAbs. All case patients"
		with positive fungal cultures (5/5 [100%]) were infected with Cryptococcus gattii
		"VGII. Among them, 3 had exclusively pulmonary involvement, and 1 had only"
		musculoskeletal lesions. Patients with CNS cryptococcosis exhibited a higher
		serum concentration of anti-GM-CSF AAbs than those with extraneural
		cryptococcosis. Case patients had higher initial and peak levels of serum CrAg
		and longer duration of antigenemia compared with the control patients. All case
		patients who had completed antifungal therapy had favorable outcomes without
		recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Testing for anti-GM-CSF AAbs should be considered for
		not only previously healthy patients with disseminated cryptococcosis but also
		"those with unexplained, localized cryptococcosis. Recurrence after completion of"
		antifungal therapy was rare despite the persistence of anti-GM-CSF AAbs.

AB	-	Cryptococcosis is a fungal disease caused by Cryptococcus neoformans and
		"Cryptococcus gattii. By inhalation and subsequent pulmonary infection, it may"
		disseminate to the CNS and cause meningitis or meningoencephalitis. Most cases
		"occur in immunosuppressed hosts, including patients with HIV/AIDS, patients"
		"receiving immunosuppressing drugs, and solid organ transplant recipients."
		"However, cryptococcosis also occurs in individuals with apparently healthy immune"
		"systems. A growing number of cases are caused by C gattii, with infections"
		occurring in both immunosuppressed and immunocompetent individuals. In the
		"majority of documented cases, treatment of C gattii infection of the CNS requires"
		aggressive management of raised intracranial pressure along with standard
		antifungal therapy. Early cerebrospinal fluid evacuation is often needed through
		"placement of a percutaneous lumbar drain or ventriculostomy. Furthermore,"
		pharmacological immunosuppression with a high dose of dexamethasone is sometimes
		needed to ameliorate a persistently increased inflammatory response and to reduce
		"intracranial pressure. In this Grand Round, we present the case of an otherwise"
		"healthy adolescent female patient, who, despite aggressive management, succumbed"
		to C gattii meningoencephalitis. We also present a review of the existing
		literature and discuss optimum clinical management of meningoencephalitis caused
		by C gattii.

AB	-	Cryptococcal infections are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in
		tropical Australia. This retrospective audit was conducted to characterise the
		"aetiology, temporospatial epidemiology, and clinical course of 49 cryptococcal"
		infections in Far North Queensland between 1 January 1999 and 31 December 2019.
		Cryptococcus gattii was identified in 15/32 (47%) in whom it was possible to
		"speciate the organism. Among these 15 patients, 13 (87%) had a rural residential"
		"address, 10 (67%) were Indigenous Australians and 11 (73%) presented during the"
		May-November dry season. When compared to the 17 patients with Cryptococcus
		"neoformans infection, patients with C. gattii were less likely to be"
		"immunocompromised (0/15 versus 8/17 (47%), p = 0.003). Neurosurgery was necessary"
		in 5/15 C. gattii cases and 3/17 (18%) C. neoformans cases (p = 0.42). Outcomes
		were generally good with 42/49 (86%) cases-and 14/15 (93%) with C. gattii
		infection-surviving to hospital discharge. These positive outcomes are likely to
		be explained by the development of standardised treatment guidelines during the
		"study period, low rates of comorbidity in the patients with C. gattii infection"
		and access to liposomal amphotericin and neurosurgical support in the
		well-resourced Australian healthcare system.

AB	-	Although abdominal cryptococcomas and visceral cryptococcal lymphadenitis as part

		"patients, localized intra-abdominal involvement due to Cryptococcus gattii has"
		"not been previously described in non-HIV-infected patients. In general, a smaller"
		proportion of cryptococcosis is caused by C. gattii. We report here on a type II
		diabetic HIV-negative patient who presented with a localized intra-abdominal
		"cryptococcal mass due to C. gattii. In addition, we review the general aspects of"
		intra-abdominal and gastrointestinal involvement by Cryptococcus neoformans in
		the literature and discuss the importance of identifying the C. neoformans
		varieties and C. gattii in routine laboratories.

AB	-	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The current review gives a concise and updated overview of the
		relative new field of anticytokine autoantibodies (ACAA) and associated
		"infections with a focus on recent findings regarding clinical manifestions,"
		diagnostic and treatments. RECENT FINDINGS: Several recent case reports of
		unusual presentations of patients with neutralizing autoantibodies to IFN-γ and
		granulocyt macrophage colony-stimulating factor and expand the spectrum of
		clinical manifestations and suggest that anticytokine-mediated acquired
		immunodeficiency causing susceptibility to infection may be underdiagnosed. There
		is an expanding geographical distribution of antigranulocyt macrophage
		colony-stimulating factor associated Cryptococcus gattii infection. The spectrum
		of identified infections in patients with neutralizing antibodies to IFN-γ has a
		strong endemic component. Rituximab or cyclophophamide in addition to
		antimycobacterials could be a treatment options in refractory cases. NF-κB2
		deficiency may be associated with a complex pattern of high titre neutralizing
		ACAA similar to autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type I and Thymoma. New
		technique for the detection of anticytokine antibodies are presented. Quantiferon
		"testing, which is widely available for TB-diagnostic, may be repurposed to detect"
		anti-IFN-γ autoantibodies. We propose that this test could be as well used to
		show if they are neutralizing. SUMMARY: ACAA are an emerging cause of acquired
		immunodeficiency which is likely underdiagnosed. Recent case reports document
		expanding spectra of clinical manifestations. NF-κB2 deficiency may be associated
		with a complex anti cytokine autoantibody pattern.

AB	-	Cryptococcosis is a life-threatening fungal infection caused by the Cryptococcus
		neoformans/Cryptococcus gattii species complex. Most cases are recorded in
		patients suffering from HIV/AIDS (human immunodeficiency virus/acquired
		"immunodeficiency syndrome). However, this infection also occurs in non-HIV"
		patients with a proportion of 10-30% of all cases. The study aimed at the
		clinical and molecular characterization of non-HIV patients diagnosed with
		cryptococcosis at the Tropical Medicine Foundation (FMT-HVD) from July 2016 to
		June 2019. Medical records of respective patients were analyzed to describe the
		"course of cryptococcosis in non-HIV patients. In addition, multi-locus sequence"
		typing (MLST) was applied to identify the sequence types of the isolated
		"Cryptococcus strains, to perform phylogenetic analysis, and to evaluate the"
		isolates' genetic relationship to global reference strains. Antifungal
		"susceptibility profiles to amphotericin B, fluconazole, and itraconazole were"
		"assessed by broth microdilution. From a total of 7 patients, 4 were female, the"
		age range varied between 10 and 53 years (median of 36.3 years). Cryptococcal
		meningitis was the common clinical manifestation (100%). The period between onset
		of symptoms and confirmed diagnosis ranged from 15 to 730 days (mean value of
		"172.9 days), and the observed mortality was 57.1%. Of note, comorbidities of the"
		"assessed cryptococcosis patients comprised hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and"
		intestinal tuberculosis. Genotyping applying PCR-RFLP of the URA5 gene identified
		"all clinical isolates as C. gattii genotype VGII. Using MLST, it was possible to"
		"discriminate the sequence types ST20 (n = 4), ST5 (n = 3), and the newly"
		"identified sequence type ST560 (n = 1). The antifungals amphotericin B,"
		"fluconazole, and itraconazole showed satisfactory inhibitory activity"
		(microdilution test) against all C. gattii VGII strains.

AB	-	"Cryptococcal disease, caused by Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii,"
		is associated with significant morbidity and mortality but limited data exist on
		its incidence and impact. A study utilizing the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from
		2000 to 2007 to examine the epidemiology and impact of cryptococcal disease in
		the United States was undertaken. The International Classification of Diseases
		9th Version code was used to identify hospital discharges with diagnosis of
		Cryptococcus (117.5). Our primary outcome was the incidence rate of cryptococcal
		"admissions. The impact of AIDS, age, and sex on hospitalization rates, mortality,"
		"and costs was assessed. The results showed that a total of 10,077"
		hospitalizations for cryptococcosis occurred corresponding to a weighted estimate
		"of 49,010 cases. The median age was 43 years (interquartile range 34-54), and 26%"
		were female. Approximately 64% of cases occurred in persons with AIDS. Although
		"rates declined overall, age-adjusted rates were significantly higher in males"
		with AIDS than in uninfected persons (p < 0.001). The mortality rate decreased
		"but was greater in HIV-uninfected versus infected cohorts (12% versus 10%,"
		"p < 0.001). Conversely, hospital costs were greater in persons with AIDS ($40,671"
		"versus $40,096, p=0.02). Although cryptococcal disease rates are decreasing over"
		"time, the associated mortality and costs remain concerning."

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Cryptococcosis is an opportunistic fungal disease, caused by"
		"Cryptococcus grubii, C. neoformans, and infrequently by C. gattii. [1], [2]"
		Infection occur in patients with immunosuppression or with intact immunity.
		"Dissemination mostly occurs in the lungs and meninges, but also the skin, bones"
		"and the prostate, with very high mortality rates reported for cryptococcal"
		"meningitis ranging from 27% to nearly 100%. [2], [3]. CASE PRESENTATION: We"
		"report the case of a healthy, immunocompetent male presenting with a six-month"
		"history of weight loss, a chronic cough, recent-onset haemoptysis and a lung"
		"mass. The differential diagnosis included pulmonary Tuberculosis, bacterial or"
		fungal pneumonia and lung carcinoma. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with
		"disseminated C. gattii, which remains very rare. Risk factors for this infection"
		"included a distant history of cigarette smoking, as well as travel to central"
		Africa for a recreational trip several months prior. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION:
		Fungal infections should be considered in any patient presenting with respiratory
		"or neurological symptoms suggestive of Tuberculosis, pneumonia or lung carcinoma,"
		regardless of immunocompetency. Our case highlights the importance of taking a
		"thorough travel history in all patients, as the differential diagnosis would need"
		to include atypical pathogens that could be endemic in the area of travel. It
		also highlights the significant morbidity associated with cryptococcosis and
		drug-related toxicities and the methods to prevent complications.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii are yeasts
		"responsible for invasive infection, primarily pulmonary and neurological. Their"
		clinical epidemiology has been previously described in an Australian national
		"study, but this included no data from the Hunter region, where we anecdotally"
		"noted a high incidence of infection. We aimed to describe the epidemiology,"
		management and outcomes of cryptococcal disease in the Hunter region and to
		compare this with previous Australian data. METHODS: We searched our laboratory
		database for positive cryptococcal antigen and culture results from January
		"2003-December 2016. We extracted demographic factors, risk factors, clinical"
		"presentation, treatment and outcomes from medical records. We used the 2010"
		census-derived estimated resident population to calculate population-based
		"incidences. RESULTS: Over a 13-year period, 107 patients had either a positive"
		culture or a positive cryptococcal antigen with a compatible clinical syndrome.
		"Of these, 46 (42.2%) were C. neoformans, 28 (25.7%) C. gattii, and 33 (30.3%)"
		antigen only. The crude incidence (per million with 95% CI) for all disease was
		"9.5, and for culture proven disease was 2.5 for C. gattii and 4.1 for C."
		neoformans. Geospatial mapping by species revealed no evident cluster. Of the 63
		"patients where detailed information was available, around half were"
		"immunocompromised (3 [15%] for C. gattii and 25 [81%] for C. neoformans,"
		"p < 0.001). Complications were common, including visual loss (11 cases, 17.7%)"
		"and hearing loss (5 cases, 8%). Adverse outcomes at one year (death or"
		"neurological sequelae) occurred in 42%, and was significantly more likely"
		"(OR = 5.2, 95% CI 1.4-18.8) in those with raised intracranial pressure at"
		baseline. Adverse outcomes were no more common in those treated with lower doses
		"of liposomal amphotericin (≤150 mg/day, 5/10) than those treated with the"
		recommended dose of 3-5 mg/kg (≥150 mg; 13/27). CONCLUSION: Although a rare
		"disease, cryptococcosis is more common in the Hunter region than in other parts"
		"of Australia, and long-term sequelae are serious and common."

		characteristics of six HIV-negative patients presenting with invasive
		cryptococcosis. METHODS: Patients with cryptococcosis without any of the
		"classical risk factors, such as HIV infection, followed at Cayenne Hospital, were"
		prospectively included. An immunologic and genetic assessment was performed.
		"RESULTS: Five male patients and one female patient, 5 adults and one child, were"
		investigated. All presented a neuromeningeal localization. Cryptococcus
		neoformans var. gattii and C. neoformans var. grubii were isolated in two and
		"three patients, respectively, whereas one patient could not be investigated."
		"Overall, we did not observe any global leukocyte defect. Two patients were found"
		with high levels of circulating autoantibodies against Granulocyte
		"macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and none had detectable levels of"
		autoantibodies against Interferon gamma (IFN-γ) Sequencing of STAT1 exons and
		flanking regions performed for four patients was wild type. CONCLUSION: To better
		"understand cryptococcosis in patients with cryptococcosis but otherwise healthy,"
		further explorations are needed with repeated immune checkups and strain
		virulence studies.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcosis due to Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii
		"varies with geographic region, populations affected, disease manifestations, and"
		"severity of infection, which impact treatment. METHODS: We developed a"
		retrospective cohort of patients diagnosed with culture-proven cryptococcosis
		during 1995-2013 from 5 centers in North America and Australia. We compared
		"underlying diseases, clinical manifestations, treatment, and outcomes in patients"
		with C. gattii or C. neoformans infection. RESULTS: A total of 709 patients (452
		C. neoformans; 257 C. gattii) were identified. Mean age was 50.2 years; 61.4%
		were male; and 52.3% were white. Time to diagnosis was prolonged in C. gattii
		"patients compared with C. neoformans (mean, 52.2 vs 36.0 days; P < .003), and"
		there was a higher proportion of C. gattii patients without underlying disease
		"(40.5% vs 10.2%; P < .0001). Overall, 59% had central nervous system (CNS)"
		"infection, with lung (42.5%) and blood (24.5%) being common sites. Pulmonary"
		infection was more common in patients with C. gattii than in those with C.
		neoformans (60.7% vs 32.1%; P < .0001). CNS or blood infections were more common
		in C. neoformans-infected patients (P ≤ .0001 for both). Treatment of CNS disease
		with induction therapy of amphotericin B and flucytosine occurred in 76.4% of
		patients. Crude 12-month mortality was higher in patients with C. neoformans
		"(28.4% vs 20.2%; odds ratio, 1.56 [95% confidence interval, 1.08-2.26])."
		CONCLUSIONS: This study emphasizes differences in species-specific epidemiology
		"and outcomes of patients with cryptococcosis, including underlying diseases, site"
		"of infection, and mortality. Species identification in patients with"
		"cryptococcosis is necessary to discern epidemiologic patterns, guide treatment"
		"regimens, and predict clinical progression and outcomes."

PG	-	543-51
LID	-	10.1093/cid/cit341 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: We describe antifungal therapy and management of complications due to
		Cryptococcus gattii infection in 86 Australian patients followed for at least 12
		months. METHODS: Patient data from culture-confirmed cases (2000-2007) were
		"recorded at diagnosis, 6 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months. Clinical, laboratory,"
		and treatment variables associated with raised intracranial pressure (ICP) and
		immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) were determined. RESULTS:
		Seven of 10 patients with lung infection received amphotericin B (AMB) induction
		therapy (6 with 5-flucytosine [5-FC] for a median of 2 weeks); median duration of
		"therapy including azole eradication therapy was 41 weeks, with a complete/partial"
		"clinical response in 78%. For neurologic disease, 88% of patients received AMB,"
		"78% with 5-FC, for a median of 6 weeks. The median total course was 18 months."
		Nine patients receiving fluconazole induction therapy were reinduced with AMB
		plus 5-FC for clinical failure. Raised ICP (31 patients) was associated with
		"initial abnormal neurology, and neurologic sequelae and/or death at 12 months"
		(both P = .02); cerebrospinal fluid drains/shunts were placed in 58% of patients
		and in 64% of 22 patients with hydrocephalus. IRIS developed 2-12 months after
		"starting antifungals in 8 patients, who presented with new/enlarging brain"
		"lesions. Risk factors included female sex, brain involvement at presentation, and"
		higher median CD4 counts (all P < .05); corticosteroids reduced
		cryptococcoma-associated edema. CONCLUSIONS: Induction AMB plus 5-FC is indicated
		for C. gattii neurologic cryptococcosis (6 weeks) and when localized to lung (2
		weeks). Shunting was often required to control raised ICP. IRIS presents with
		cerebral manifestations.

TI	-	Pulmonary cryptococcosis coexisting with central type lung cancer in an
		immuocompetent patient: a case report and literature review.
PG	-	161
LID	-	10.1186/s12890-020-01200-z [doi]
LID	-	161
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Pulmonary Cryptococcosis is a common fungal infection mainly caused
		by Cryptococcus neoformans/C.gattii species in immunocompromised patients. Cases
		of pulmonary cryptococcosis in patients with normal immune function are
		increasingly common in China. Clinical and radiographic features of pulmonary
		"cryptococcosis are various and without obvious characteristics, so it is often"
		misdiagnosed as pulmonary metastatic tumor or tuberculosis. When coexisting with
		"malignant lung tumors, it was more difficult to differentiate from metastatic"
		"lung cancer, although the coexistence of pulmonary cryptococcosis and central"
		type lung cancer is rare. Reviewing the imaging manifestations and diagnosis of
		the case and the relevant literature will contribute to recognition of the
		disease and a decrease in misdiagnoses. CASE PRESENTATION: A 72-year-old
		immunocompetent Han Chinese man had repeated dry cough for more than half a year.
		"CT examination of chest showed an irregular mass at the left hilum of the lung,"
		"and two small nodules in the right lung, which were considered as the left"
		"central lung cancer with right lung metastasis. However, the patient was"
		diagnosed with pulmonary cryptococcosis coexisting with central type lung cancer
		"based on the results of laboratory examination, percutaneous lung biopsy,"
		"fiberoptic bronchoscopy, and surgical pathology. The patient underwent surgical"
		resection of the left central type lung cancer and was placed on fluconazole
		treatment after a positive diagnosis was made. Five years after the lung cancer
		"surgery, the patient had a recurrence, but the pulmonary cryptococcus nodule"
		disappeared. CONCLUSION: Our case shows that CT findings of central type lung
		"cancer with multiple pulmonary nodules are not necessarily metastases, but may be"
		coexisting pulmonary cryptococcosis. CT images of cryptococcosis of the lung were
		"diverse and have no obvious characteristics, so it was very difficult to"
		distinguish from metastatic tumors. CT-guided percutaneous lung biopsy was a
		simple and efficient method for identification.

		California: 93 cases (1988-2010).
PG	-	357-69
LID	-	10.2460/javma.239.3.357 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To compare clinical features of cryptococcosis among cats and dogs in
		"California, determine whether the distribution of involved tissues differs from"
		"distribution reported previously in a study in southeastern Australia, and"
		identify Cryptococcus spp isolated from the study population. DESIGN:
		Retrospective case series. ANIMALS: 62 cats and 31 dogs with cryptococcosis.
		PROCEDURES: Medical records of cats and dogs with cryptococcosis were reviewed.
		"Information collected included geographic location, species, signalment, and"
		"tissues or organs involved. Cryptococcosis was confirmed via serology, cytology,"
		"histology, or microbial culture, and molecular typing was performed. Odds ratios"
		and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to determine significant
		associations among variables. Other comparisons were evaluated via χ(2) or
		"unpaired t tests. RESULTS: American Cocker Spaniels were overrepresented,"
		compared with other dog breeds. Serum cryptococcal antigen test results were
		positive in 51 of 53 cats and 15 of 18 dogs tested. Cryptococcus gattii was more
		"commonly detected in cats (7/9 for which species identification was performed),"
		and Cryptococcus neoformans was more commonly detected in dogs (6/8). Six of 7 C
		gattii isolates from cats were molecular type VGIII. Distribution of involved
		tissues was different between cats and dogs in California and between populations
		of the present study and those of the previously reported Australian study.
		CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Strains of Cryptococcus spp appeared to have
		host specificity in dogs and cats. Differences in lesion distribution between
		geographic locations may reflect strain differences or referral bias. Antigen
		assays alone may not be sufficient for diagnosis of cryptococcosis in cats and
		dogs.

		difference was found in prevalence of the two species (P>0.05) from different
		Eucalyptus tree samples. For C. neoformans var. grubii the highest isolation
		"frequency of the pathogen was in spring followed by autumn, summer, winter and"
		"rainy season. For C. gattii, highest isolation frequency of the pathogen was in"
		"summer, followed by autumn, spring, winter and rainy season. Significant"
		difference was seen in the isolation frequency of C. neoformans var. grubii and
		"C. gattii during autumn and rainy season (P<0.01), spring and rainy season"
		(P<0.001) and summer and rainy season (P<0.001). Population density and isolation
		frequency of the both pathogens were significantly lower in rainy season. Bark of
		the Eucalyptus tree yielded the highest frequency of C. neoformans var. grubii
		"followed by flower, fruits, buds and debris. Trees located in the densely"
		populated area of the city yielded highest frequency of the pathogens followed by
		trees located in sparsely populated area on the outskirt of the city and areas
		near the river Narmada. Further comprehensive study is suggested to assess the
		overall impact of seasonal prevalence in the isolation frequency and population
		density of both the pathogens and their clinical significance across climatically
		divergent region of India.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: We compared the epidemiology of laboratory-confirmed paediatric
		cryptococcal disease with adult-onset disease in the South African population.
		"METHODS: The study was an active, prospective, population-based, laboratory-based"
		surveillance in South Africa. We compared cases of paediatric cryptococcosis (<15
		years) with cases of adult-onset cryptococcosis that were reported to the
		surveillance programme between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2007. The case
		"definition was based on a positive India ink test, cryptococcal antigen test or"
		cryptococcal culture. Clinical case data were obtained at enhanced surveillance
		"sites. RESULTS: Of 16,192 incident episodes of cryptococcosis in South Africa,"
		"361 (2%) episodes occurred among children. In 2007, incidence was one and 19"
		"cases per 100,000 persons in the general paediatric and adult populations and was"
		"47 and 120 cases per 100,000 persons for HIV-infected children and adults,"
		"respectively. Among children, a bimodal peak in incidence was evident in the less"
		than 1-year age group and in the 5 age group. Most children (64%) and adults
		(63%) were severely immunocompromised (CD4 T-lymphocyte cell count < 50 cells/μl)
		"at the time of diagnosis. On multivariable analysis, children were significantly"
		"more likely than adults to be male, diagnosed on blood culture, infected with"
		"Cryptococcus gattii, treated with amphotericin B and admitted for a longer stay"
		in hospital. CONCLUSION: This series of 361 cases of paediatric cryptococcosis is
		by far the largest described to date. The diagnosis of cryptococcosis should be
		"considered in the paediatric HIV-infected population, especially among those who"
		are severely immunocompromised.

		diagnosed globally. Methods: case report; Literature review. Although initial
		reports described outbreaks of pulmonary and central nervous system (CNS) disease
		"in tropical regions such as Australia and New Guinea, it is now clear that"
		"Cryptococcus gattii is a global, neurotropic pathogen. In contrast with C."
		"neoformans, C. gattii patients are more likely to present with cryptococcomas in"
		the brain and lungs and are often HIV negative. Imaging findings can mimick
		cancer leading to delays in diagnosis and definitive treatment. Some experts have
		"speculated that the spread of C. gattii is due to climate change, newly"
		"recognized genotypes that cause disease in temperate zones (genotype VGII),"
		"international travel, and improved awareness among physicians and veterinarians."
		"We emphasize neurocritical and neurosurgical management, because patients with"
		CNS involvement often have high intracranial pressures (ICP). Cryptococcus gattii
		patients often have elevated ICP without 'red flag' radiographic signs of
		"elevated ICP such as ventriculomegaly, cerebral edema, or effaced basal cisterns."
		"Therefore, diagnosis of high ICP should be suspected based on clinical symptoms"
		"such as incapacitating headaches, progressive visual loss and associated"
		"papilledema, and then confirmed by measuring the opening pressure with lumbar"
		puncture (LP). Cerebral intraparenchymal deposition of the large cryptococcal
		polysaccharide capsule and cryptococcal organisms causes poor brain compliance
		leading to a 'frozen brain state.' Mortality rates and clinical outcomes are
		"significantly improved with early diagnosis, antifungal therapies, steroids, and"
		aggressive management of elevated ICP including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
		"diversion by serial LP's, external ventricular drains and CSF shunts. Following"
		"institution of antifungal therapy, about 10% of patients can worsen due to immune"
		reconstitution inflammatory syndrome which responds to steroids. We recommend
		neurocritical and neurosurgical management of C. gattii patients with CNS
		involvement and elevated ICP. There is often poor correlation between elevated
		ICP and neuroimaging due to the frozen brain state.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: This study aims to explore the epidemiology, clinical profile and"
		strain characteristics of cryptococcosis from 2013 to 2017 in a major teaching
		hospital in China. METHODS: Trends in antifungal drug susceptibility of 217
		consecutive non-repetitive cryptococcal isolates collected from patients of an
		"university hospital in China were analyzed between 2013 and 2017. Of those, 98"
		isolates were conserved for identification by internal transcribed spacer (ITS)
		sequencing and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass
		spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) system. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was used to
		designate molecular types. Clinical characteristics of the 98 patients with
		cryptococcosis during the period of 2013-2017 were retrospectively evaluated.
		RESULTS: There was a trend for gradual increase in the MIC range of fluconazole
		was from 2013 to 2017. The conserved 98 clinical cryptococcal isolates included
		"97 C. neoformans and one C. gattii, and 90 (91.8%) isolates belonged to ST5"
		"genotype VNI. Out of the 98 patients with cryptococcosis, 28 (28.6%) were"
		HIV-infected and 32 (32.7%) had no underlying diseases. HIV-infected patients had

		CONCLUSIONS: Most of the patients with cryptococcosis were not HIV-infected in
		"this study, while patients with HIV had a higher mortality. Reduced"
		"susceptibility to fluconazole was observed among C. neoformans isolates, most of"
		them belonged to ST5 genotype VNI having an impact on the effective dose of
		fluconazole.

AB	-	"OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical features, treatments, outcomes, and subtype"
		prevalence of cryptococcosis in Singapore. METHODS: All patients with laboratory
		confirmed cryptococcal infections admitted from 1999 to 2007 to a teaching
		hospital in Singapore were reviewed retrospectively. Identification and molecular
		types of Cryptococcus neoformans variants and Cryptococcus gattii were determined
		by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP).
		Serotypes were inferred with a multiplex PCR method. RESULTS: Of 62 patients with
		"cryptococcosis, C. neoformans var. grubii was the predominant subtype (in 95%),"
		affecting mainly immunocompromised hosts (91%) with HIV infection (80%). Patients
		"with HIV were younger (median age 36.5 vs. 49.5 years, p=0.006) and less likely"
		"to present with an altered mental status (14% vs. 50%, p=0.013). In contrast,"
		"delayed treatment (median 7 days vs. 2 days, p=0.03), pulmonary involvement (58%"
		"vs. 14%, p=0.03), and initial treatment with fluconazole (25% vs. 2%, p=0.02)"
		"were more common in HIV-negative patients. C. gattii was uncommon, affecting only"
		"three patients, all of whom were immunocompetent and had disseminated disease"
		"with pulmonary and neurological involvement. All C. gattii were RFLP type VG II,"
		"serotype B and all C. neoformans var. grubii were RFLP type VN I, serotype A,"
		"except for one that was RFLP type VN II. CONCLUSION: C. neoformans var. grubii,"
		"subtype VN I, was the predominant subtype in Singapore, infecting younger, mainly"
		"immunocompromised hosts with HIV. C. gattii was uncommon, causing pulmonary"
		"manifestations in older, immunocompetent patients and were RFLP type VG II."

		species C. neoformans and C. gattii that can affect humans and animals. These
		yeasts are widely distributed in the environment and are typically associated
		with avian droppings and decaying wood. Most infections are related to the
		"respiratory tract, but the central nervous system and cutaneous lesions are also"
		reported in the literature. The present report is a case of cryptococcosis in an
		18-month-old unspayed female English Bulldog with the main complaint of weight
		loss and diarrhea. The presence of two large masses observed in an ultrasound
		examination leads us to perform an exploratory laparotomy. Considering the size
		"of the lesion and the impossibility of owner to provide intensive care, the"
		consent for euthanasia was requested. The postmortem diagnosis of cryptococcosis
		"was revealed by cytological evaluation, and the involvement of C. gattii VGII was"
		confirmed by isolation and identification tests as well as by the detection of
		the URA5 gene restriction fragment length polymorphism PCR analysis. Reports in
		the literature of the involvement of Cryptococcus in gastrointestinal lesions are
		rare in both human and veterinary medicine. Data about different forms of
		cryptococcosis are important to provide more knowledge of uncommon clinical
		presentations of this yeast and therefore improve the diagnoses and decisions for
		the best therapy.

		Cryptococcus gattii is more severe in immunocompromised individuals. This study
		"aimed to analyze the epidemiology of the disease, the molecular characteristics"

		in a Brazilian university hospital. This retrospective study was conducted in the
		"Clinical Hospital, Federal University of Uberlândia, and evaluated cases of"

		"evaluated 41 patients, 85% of whom were diagnosed with AIDS. The fungus was"
		isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 21 patients (51%); 19.5% had
		"fungemia and in 24% the agent was isolated from the CSF and blood, concurrently."
		Meningoencephalitis was the most frequent (75%) manifestation of infection.
		"Despite adequate treatment, the mortality of the disease was 58.5%. Most isolates"
		"(97.5%) presented the VNI genotype (serotype A, var. grubii) and one isolate was"
		genotyped as C. gattii (VGI); all the isolates were determined as mating type
		"MATa and showed susceptibility to the tested antifungals (fluconazole,"
		"voriconazole, amphotericin B and 5-flucytosine). Although AIDS detection rates"
		"remain stable, opportunistic infections such as cryptococcosis remain as major"
		causes of morbidity and mortality in these patients.

		"clinical outcomes of patients with cryptococcosis were investigated. In addition,"
		a molecular analysis of the Cryptococcus neoformans species complex isolated from
		these patients was performed. METHODS: A prospective study of 62 cases of
		patients with cryptococcal infection was conducted at the Hospital de Doenças
		Tropicais de Goiás Dr. Anuar Auad from 2009-2010. Cryptococcal meningitis cases
		were diagnosed by direct examination and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample
		culture. The profiling of these patients was assessed. The CSF samples were
		"submitted to India ink preparation and cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar, and"
		"C. neoformans was identified by the production of urease, a positive"
		phenoloxidase test and assimilation of carbohydrates. C. neoformans and C. gattii
		isolates were distinguished by growth on L-canavanine-glycine-bromothymol blue
		"medium, and molecular analysis was conducted via PCR fingerprinting reactions"
		"using M13 and (GACA)4 primers. RESULTS: From the 62 patients with cryptococcosis,"
		71 isolates of CSF were obtained; 67 (94.4%) isolates were identified as C.
		"neoformans var. grubii/VNI, and 4 (5.6%) were identified as C. gattii/VGII. Of"
		"these patients, 53 had an HIV diagnosis. The incidence of cryptococcosis was"
		"higher among patients 20-40 years of age, with 74.2% of the cases reported in"
		"males. Cryptococcus-related mortality was noted in 48.4% of the patients, and the"
		"symptoms were altered sensorium, headache, fever and stiff neck. CONCLUSIONS: The"
		high morbidity and mortality observed among patients with cryptococcosis
		demonstrate the importance of obtaining information regarding the epidemiological
		"profile and clinical course of the disease in the State of Goiás, Brazil."

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcosis is a frequent complication in immunosuppressed
		"patients, causing mainly central nervous system and lung infection, and leading"
		to increased mortality risk. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the first documented
		case in Switzerland of Cryptococcus gattii pneumonia in a kidney-pancreas
		"transplant patient, with a concomitant Pneumocystis jirovecii infection mimicking"
		an immune reconstitution syndrome. Diagnosis of cryptococcal pneumonia was based
		on a positive serum cryptococcal antigen and confirmed by Grocott&rsquo;s
		methenamine silver and periodic acid-Schiff stains on bronchoalveolar lavage
		fliud. C. gattii was identified with mass spectrometry and antifungal
		susceptibility testing by microdilution was performed. After an initial
		"successful treatment with liposomal amphotericin-B, flucytosine and tapering of"
		"immunosuppression, the patient clinically deteriorated, developing bilateral"
		diffuse ground-glass opacities with consolidations on chest computed tomography.
		A diagnosis of probable P. jirovecii pneumonia versus an immune reconstitution
		syndrome was considered. Because of a high titre of Pneumocystis on polymerase
		"chain-reaction testing of bronchoalveloar lavage fluid and high serum b-D-glucan,"
		a diagnosis of probable P. jirovecii pneumonia was made. CONCLUSION: This case
		illustrates the potential complications of a cryptococcal infection in
		"immunosuppressed hosts, despite timely diagnosis and appropriate antifungal"
		therapy.

PG	-	6444-6449
LID	-	10.12998/wjcc.v8.i24.6444 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Pulmonary cryptococcosis (PC) is an invasive fungal disease caused
		mainly by Cryptococcus (C.) neoformans or C. gattii. It may be present in
		immunocompetent or immunocompromised patients. The radiographic features of PC
		"vary, and the most common computed tomography manifestation is the presence of"
		solitary or multiple pulmonary nodules or masses distributed in the outer zone of
		the lung field. The appearance of nodular or mass-like PC on computed tomography
		"scans resembles that of primary or metastatic lung cancers, and differential"
		diagnosis is sometimes difficult. The coexistence of PC and malignant tumors is
		rarely observed. CASE SUMMARY: This paper reports three cases of PC combined with
		"lung adenocarcinoma diagnosed by video-assisted thoracic surgery lung biopsy,"
		which were successfully managed by early diagnosis and treatment. CONCLUSION: The
		present case report might serve as a reminder not to neglect PC coexisting with
		adenocarcinoma. Early diagnosis and treatment lead to a better prognosis.

LID	-	10.1017/S0022215113000522 [doi]
AB	-	"OBJECTIVE: Laryngeal cryptococcosis is a rare condition. In this report, we"
		describe the findings for and treatment of a 58-year-old man with Cryptococcus
		gattii infection of the right vocal fold. METHOD: Case report and review of the
		relevant English language literature. RESULTS: The patient presented with
		"persistent hoarseness of voice. Laryngoscopy demonstrated an irregular, red"
		lesion on the right vocal fold. Histopathological examination identified
		cryptococcus. The patient was treated with oral fluconazole 400 mg/day for eight
		weeks. CONCLUSION: Laryngeal involvement by Cryptococcus gattii can result from
		prolonged inhaled corticosteroid therapy and proximity to eucalyptus trees. The
		"clinical presentation, laryngoscopic findings and imaging results of laryngeal"
		involvement may mimic a neoplasm. Histopathological examination can demonstrate
		the causative organism. Management consists of advice from an infectious disease
		specialist together with adequate treatment by antifungal agents.

		"(26 = 68%) followed by Cr. albidus (2), Cr. laurentii (1) and not precisely"
		identified Cryptococcus species (9 = 24%). Serotyping of the 18 isolates of Cr.
		"neoformans revealed that 13 (72%) were serotype A, two (11%) were serotype AD and"
		three (17%) were serotype B (Cr. neoformans var. gattii). Cryptococcus species
		were found to produce infection in 24 patients and were possibly transient
		"colonizers in another 14 patients. In addition, in 11 patients no Cryptococcus"
		species was isolated from any site but the latex agglutination test for antigen
		(Crypto-LA) was positive in serum and/or cerebrospinal fluid. Response to various
		antifungal drugs was also studied in these patients.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: During the past decades there has been an increase in cryptococcal
		infections caused by the basidiomycetous yeast species Cryptococcus gattii sensu
		"lato, among humans and animals that live in endemic regions in Australia, Europe"
		"and the Americas. Unlike human cryptococcosis, little epidemiological data are"
		available about C. gattii sensu lato infections in horses. CASE REPORT: A fatal
		case of a disseminated C. gattii sensu lato infection in an 11-year-old Arabian
		gelding imported from South Africa into the United Arab Emitares is reported.
		Tissue samples were studied by conventional mycology procedures and the obtained
		"cryptococcal isolate was molecularly characterized by mating-type determination,"
		"amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) fingerprinting, and multi-locus"
		sequence typing (MLST). Phylogenetic analysis was performed to investigate the
		geographic origin of the cryptococcal isolate. The isolate was identified as
		"Cryptococcus deuterogattii (AFLP6/VGII), mating-type α. Phylogenetic analysis"
		showed that it was closely related to another C. deuterogattii isolate from the
		Middle East. CONCLUSIONS: A second case of a C. deuterogattii infection in the
		Middle East is described. It is likely that the horse acquired the infection in
		"the Middle East, as the isolate is closely related to that of a recent human case"
		from that region.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to describe cryptococcal meningitis (CM) cases and
		"the associated demographic, clinical, and microbiological data obtained from"
		cities in the State of Mato Grosso do Sul in the Midwestern region of Brazil.
		METHODS: The data from 129 patients with laboratory-confirmed CM admitted from
		1997 to 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. The molecular types of Cryptococcus
		neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii isolated from cerebrospinal fluid were
		analyzed to determine their geographic distribution. RESULTS: The patients had a
		mean age of 37 years and consisted mostly of men (76.7%). Most of the
		Cryptococcus isolates were obtained from patients infected with human
		immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and included 105 (87.5%) and 5 (55.6%) isolates of
		"C. neoformans and C. gattii complexes, respectively. A restriction fragment"
		length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of URA5 revealed that most of the isolates
		"were C. neoformans molecular type VNI (89.1%), whereas the molecular types VGII"
		"(7%) and VNII (3.9%) were observed less frequently. Notably, 65% of the cases"
		with a time from symptom onset to laboratory diagnosis of more than 60 days
		"resulted in fatalities, and sequelae were observed among the patients who"
		survived. CONCLUSIONS: The present study documents the occurrence of
		"neurocryptococcosis, which is mainly caused by C. neoformans VNI, in Mato Grosso"
		"do Sul, Brazil, with probable autochthonous cases in the Brazilian Pantanal, the"
		"world's largest tropical wetland, and a biome where cryptococcosis has not yet"
		been explored.

AB	-	Cryptococcosis is a common opportunistic systemic mycosis caused by members of
		the encapsulated yeast genus Cryptococcus. The aetiological agents of the disease
		"are classified into two species, i.e., Cryptococcus neoformans (serotypes A, D,"
		and AD) affecting mainly immunocompromised patients and Cryptococcus gattii
		(serotypes B and C) usually found in immunocompetent individuals. Limited data
		"exist on Cryptococcus infections in French Guiana, the department with the"
		highest HIV incidence in the French territories. A retrospective study between
		"January 1998 and December 2008 was performed on all patients with cryptococcosis,"
		"admitted to hospitals in French Guiana. Epidemiological data, clinical forms and"
		"diagnosis methods were studied. Of the 43 patients with cryptococcosis, 29"
		"(67.4%) had HIV infections. Among the HIV-negative patients, two (4.7%) presented"
		identified risk factors for cryptococcosis. This study has shown a high frequency
		of patients with HTLV-1 positive serology (12.1%). C. neoformans var. grubii was
		recovered with a frequency of 77.3% and was mainly isolated from patients with
		"AIDS (13/17), whereas C. gattii (22.7%) was strictly isolated from HIV-negative"
		patients with no apparent risk factors. Despite a socio-economic environment
		"closer to western countries, the overall epidemiology of cryptococcosis in French"
		"Guiana is more similar to that found in South America, particularly with"
		"reference to the serotypes of the causative yeasts. Indeed, French Guiana"
		"presents an especially high proportion of cases caused by C. gattii, which may"
		"explain the significant incidence of this disease, particularly in HIV-negative"
		and immunocompetent patients.

AB	-	Cryptococcosis is widely reported in North America and Australia but considered
		rare in the UK. Disease is mainly caused by Cryptococcus neoformans and
		Cryptococcus gattii and affects animals and humans. Cases of cryptococcosis have
		"been described in non-human primates, including a few in the Callitrichidae"
		family. Six captive callitrichids from five zoological facilities in the UK were
		diagnosed with cryptococcosis on post-mortem examination over a 13-year period.
		Histological examination revealed intralesional yeast bodies consistent with
		"Cryptococcus spp in lung, brain, lymph nodes, larynx, salivary gland and ears. C."
		neoformans was confirmed in two cases by culture and by culture and polymerase
		"chain reaction (28S rRNA gene), respectively. This case series is the first"
		report of Cryptococcus spp in captive callitrichids in the UK and reinforces the
		need to include this fungal disease in the differential diagnosis of sick
		callitrichids in zoo settings.

AB	-	Cryptococcus gattii is a species that has received more recognition in the recent
		past as distinct from Cryptococcus neoformans. C gattii is known to cause
		meningeal disease in both immunocompetent and immunosuppressed hosts. Patients
		may be clinically asymptomatic until immunosuppressive conditions occur such as
		corticosteroid treatment or an HIV infection. HIV-associated cryptococcal
		infections are most often due to C neoformans. C gattii is found in a minority.
		Speciation and subtyping of Cryptococcus are not always accomplished. In many
		"parts of the world, there is no availability for speciation of Cryptococcus."
		Travel history may provide a clue to the most probable species. This case
		demonstrates a case of C gattii meningitis with a multiplicity of complications.
		"These include advanced HIV disease secondary to nonadherence, immune"
		"reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, and superior sagittal sinus thrombosis. The"
		patient represented diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas over time. Headache was
		"the primary symptom in cryptococcal meningitis, immune reconstitution"
		"inflammatory syndrome, and superior sagittal sinus thrombosis. All are discussed"
		in detail as potential etiologies for the primary disease. Isavuconazonium is a
		relatively new broad-spectrum antifungal azole that was used as salvage therapy.

TI	-	Cryptococcosis in apparently immunocompetent patients.
PG	-	143-51
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Few reports have described the clinical and microbiological features
		of cryptococcosis in immunocompetent patients. AIM: To compare clinical
		presentations and outcomes of cryptococcosis in immunocompetent vs.
		immunocompromised patients. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. METHODS: All
		culture- or histology-confirmed cases (n = 46) of cryptococcosis in two acute
		"hospitals in Hong Kong (1995-2005) were included. Clinical presentations, rates"
		"of fungaemia, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) parameters and clinical outcomes were"
		"recorded. RESULTS: Twenty patients (43.5%) were apparently immunocompetent, 17"
		"(37.0%) had predisposing factors other than HIV infection, and 9 (19.6%) were"
		"HIV-positive. Thirty-one (67.4%) presented with meningitis, four (8.7%) with"
		"pulmonary cryptococcosis, and 11 (23.9%) with extraneural, extrapulmonary"
		cryptococcosis. Of the immunocompetent patients with retrievable isolates (n =
		"8), three (37.5%) were Cryptococcus gattii; all isolates (n = 6) from"
		immunocompromised patients were Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii.
		Immunocompetent patients more commonly presented with meningitis (80.0% vs.
		"47.1%, p = 0.03), and tended toward lower rates of fungaemia (10.0% vs. 35.3%, p"
		"= 0.06) and mortality (25.0% vs. 52.9%, p = 0.06). Death was associated with"
		fungaemia (p = 0.01) and underlying malignancy (p < 0.01). In cryptococcal
		"meningitis, immunocompetent patients had longer mean time from illness onset to"
		"presentation (34.4 vs. 12.6 days, p = 0.02), more intense inflammatory responses"
		"(CSF: white blood cells 108 vs. 35 x 10(9)/l, p = 0.03; protein 1.61 g/l vs. 0.79"
		"g/l, p = 0.07), less fungaemia (0% vs. 26.7%, p = 0.04) and more satisfactory"
		"clinical outcomes (81.3% vs. 46.7%, p = 0.04). DISCUSSION: A substantial"
		proportion of patients with cryptococcosis are apparently immunocompetent. C.
		neoformans var. grubii and C. gattii are the common causes. Immunocompetent
		"patients tend to present with localized, indolent neurological disease, with more"
		intense inflammatory responses but better clinical outcomes.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcus gattii is known to be an etiologic agent of human
		"cryptococcosis, particularly in immunocompetent persons. C. gattii infection"
		"usually involves the central nervous system, the respiratory tract, or may be"
		disseminated. Here we report an atypical manifestation of C. gattii infection in
		a patient who had C. gattii meningitis complicating the ventriculoperitoneal (VP)
		shunt infection and concurrent infected intraabdominal VP shunt pseudocyst. CASE
		PRESENTATION: A 66-year-old Thai female was initially diagnosed with normal
		pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) and underwent programmable VP shunt placement.
		"However, she still suffered from recurrent communicating hydrocephalus with"
		"in-place VP shunt, and later developed recurrent gait impairment, chronic"
		abdominal pain and abdominal mass. Radiological studies demonstrated recurrent
		hydrocephalus and a very large intraabdominal VP shunt pseudocyst. C. gattii was
		isolated from both the cerebrospinal fluid and the pseudocyst aspiration. C.
		gattii meningitis complicating the VP shunt infection and concurrent infected
		"intraabdominal VP shunt pseudocyst was diagnosed. Prolonged antifungal therapy,"
		removal of the infected VP shunt with subsequent implant of a new shunt provided
		a good outcome. CONCLUSION: Chronic C. gattii meningitis should be aware in a
		patient presenting with normal pressure hydrocephalus. Under-diagnosed
		cryptococcal meningitis following VP shunt insertion for treating the
		hydrocephalus can render a complicated VP shunt infection including infected VP
		shunt pseudocyst.

TI	-	Clinical manifestations of Cryptococcus gattii infection: determinants of
		neurological sequelae and death.
PG	-	789-98
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Longer-term morbidity and outcomes of Cryptococcus gattii infection
		"are not described. We analyzed clinical, microbiological, and outcome data in"
		"Australian patients followed for 12 months, to identify prognostic determinants."
		METHODS: Culture-confirmed C. gattii cases from 2000 to 2007 were retrospectively
		"evaluated. Clinical, microbiological, radiological, and outcome data were"
		"recorded at diagnosis and at 6 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months. Clinical and"
		laboratory variables associated with mortality and with death and/or neurological
		sequelae were determined. RESULTS: Annual C. gattii infection incidence was 0.61
		per 10(6) population. Sixty-two of 86 (72%) patients had no immunocompromise; 6
		"of 24 immunocompromised hosts had idiopathic CD4 lymphopenia, and 1 had human"
		immunodeficiency virus/AIDS. Clinical and microbiological characteristics of
		"infection were similar in immunocompromised and healthy hosts. Isolated lung,"
		"combined lung and central nervous system (CNS), and CNS only disease was reported"
		"in 12%, 51% and 34% of the cases, respectively. Complications in CNS disease"
		"included raised intracranial pressure (42%), hydrocephalus (30%), neurological"
		deficits (27%; 6% developed during therapy) and immune reconstitutionlike
		syndrome (11%). Geometric mean serum cryptococcal antigen (CRAG) titers in CNS
		disease were 563.9 (vs 149.3 in isolated lung infection). Patient
		immunocompromise was associated with increased mortality risk. An initial
		cerebrospinal fluid CRAG titer of ≥256 predicted death and/or neurological
		sequelae (P = .05). CONCLUSIONS: Neurological C. gattii disease predominates in
		"the Australian endemic setting. Lumbar puncture and cerebral imaging, especially"
		"if serum CRAG titers are ≥512, are essential. Long-term follow up is required to"
		detect late neurological complications. Immune system evaluation is important
		because host immunocompromise is associated with reduced survival.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Cryptococcosis is an opportunistic fungal infection whose etiology
		"is Cryptococcus neofromans / C. gattii, complex which affects immunocompromised"
		"patients mainly. Meningeal infection is one of the most common presentations, but"
		"cerebellar affection is rare. CASE DESCRIPTION: Male patient with 65 old years,"
		"from an area of subtropical climate with chronic exposure to poultry, without"
		"pathological antecedents, who presented clinical picture consistent with"
		"headache, fever, seizures and altered mental status. CLINICAL FINDINGS AND"
		DIAGNOSTIC METHODS: Initially without menigeal signs or intracranial hypertension
		"and normal neurological examination. Later, the patient developed ataxia,"
		dysdiadochokinesia and limb loss. By lumbar punction and image of nuclear
		magnetic resonance (NMR) cerebellitis cryptococcal was diagnosticated. TREATMENT:
		"Antifungal therapy with amphotericin B and fluconazole was performed, however the"
		"patient died. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The cryptococcosis has different presentations,"
		it´s a disease whose incidence has been increasing since the advent of the HIV /
		"AIDS pandemy, however the commitment of the encephalic parenchyma and in"
		particular the cerebellum is considered rare. In this way we are facing the first
		case of cryptococcal cerebellitis in our midst.

AB	-	Cryptococcosis is an invasive fungal infection caused primarily by Cryptococcus
		"neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii species, presenting predominantly as"
		meningoencephalitis. The aim of this study is to assess all cryptococcal
		"infections managed at our facility from 2001 to 2015 to determine incidence, risk"
		"factors, and comparison of outcomes prior to and following introduction of the"
		2010 Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) guidelines. Retrospective
		analysis of all patients diagnosed and treated for cryptococcal infection
		occurring between January 2001 and December 2015. Of 102 patients diagnosed with
		"cryptococcal infection, 97 were eligible for study inclusion. There appears to be"
		an overall increased incidence of cryptococcosis in both transplant and
		non-transplant cohorts with a peak in 2015 of 6 transplant and 13 non-transplant
		"cases. In the meningitis cohort, 38/52 (73%) of identified isolates were"
		"C. neoformans, and 14/52 (27%) were C. gattii. Notably, 14/14 (100%) of C. gattii"
		"isolates were associated with meningitis, as compared to only 38/64 (59%)"
		C. neoformans associated with meningitis (P: .003). It appears that patients
		"presenting with cough are less likely to have meningitis, 17/27 (63%), (P: .005)."
		When stratifying for culture positive meningitis lumbar puncture opening
		"pressure, the median in the culture positive cohort was 31.5 cm H(2) O compared"
		with 15.5 cm H(2) O (P: .036).Multiple admissions were required prior to
		diagnosis in the majority of cases with only 18/72 (25%) diagnosed on 1st
		presentation. Postguideline mortality has improved from 15% to 6.1% (P: .046).
		"Cryptococcal infection remains relatively uncommon, but there appears to be an"
		increasing trend in incidence. Overall mortality is relatively low and has
		improved since introduction of the 2010 IDSA guidelines.

AB	-	The pathogenic species of Cryptococcus are a major cause of mortality owing to
		severe infections in immunocompromised as well as immunocompetent individuals.
		"Although antifungal treatment is usually effective, many patients relapse after"
		"treatment, and in such cases, comparative analyses of the genomes of incident and"
		"relapse isolates may reveal evidence of determinative, microevolutionary changes"
		"within the host. Here, we analyzed serial isolates cultured from cerebrospinal"
		fluid specimens of 18 South African patients with recurrent cryptococcal
		meningitis. The time between collection of the incident isolates and collection
		"of the relapse isolates ranged from 124 days to 290 days, and the analyses"
		"revealed that, during this period within the patients, the isolates underwent"
		several genetic and phenotypic changes. Considering the vast genetic diversity of
		"cryptococcal isolates in sub-Saharan Africa, it was not surprising to find that"
		the relapse isolates had acquired different genetic and correlative phenotypic
		"changes. They exhibited various mechanisms for enhancing virulence, such as"
		"growth at 39°C, adaptation to stress, and capsule production; a remarkable"
		amplification of ERG11 at the native and unlinked locus may provide stable
		resistance to fluconazole. Our data provide a deeper understanding of the
		microevolution of Cryptococcus species under pressure from antifungal
		chemotherapy and host immune responses. This investigation clearly suggests a
		"promising strategy to identify novel targets for improved diagnosis, therapy, and"
		prognosis.IMPORTANCE Opportunistic infections caused by species of the pathogenic
		yeast Cryptococcus lead to chronic meningoencephalitis and continue to ravage
		"thousands of patients with HIV/AIDS. Despite receiving antifungal treatment, over"
		"10% of patients develop recurrent disease. In this study, we collected isolates"
		of Cryptococcus from cerebrospinal fluid specimens of 18 patients at the time of
		their diagnosis and when they relapsed several months later. We then sequenced
		and compared the genomic DNAs of each pair of initial and relapse isolates. We
		also tested the isolates for several key properties related to cryptococcal
		virulence as well as for their susceptibility to the antifungal drug fluconazole.
		These analyses revealed that the relapsing isolates manifested multiple genetic
		and chromosomal changes that affected a variety of genes implicated in the
		pathogenicity of Cryptococcus or resistance to fluconazole. This application of
		comparative genomics to serial clinical isolates provides a blueprint for
		identifying the mechanisms whereby pathogenic microbes adapt within patients to
		prolong disease.

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis is commonly caused by
		"Cryptococcus neoformans, whilst infections with Cryptococcus gattii sensu lato"
		"are historically rare. Despite available studies, little is known about the"
		occurrence of C. gattii sensu lato infections among HIV-infected individuals in
		"Zimbabwe. METHODS: In a prospective cohort, we investigated the prevalence of C."
		"gattii sensu lato meningitis among HIV-infected patients (n = 74) in Harare,"
		"Zimbabwe. RESULTS: Of the 66/74 isolates confirmed by molecular characterization,"
		16.7% (11/66) were found to be C. gattii sensu lato and 83.3% (55/66) C.
		neoformans sensu stricto. From one patient two phenotypically different C. gattii
		sensu lato colonies were cultured. The majority (n = 9/12; 75%) of the C. gattii
		"sensu lato isolates were Cryptococcus tetragattii (AFLP7/VGIV), which has been an"
		infrequently reported pathogen. In-hospital mortality associated with C. gattii
		sensu lato was 36.4%. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests that C. tetragattii
		(AFLP7/VGIV) is a more common cause of disease than C. gattii sensu stricto
		(genotype AFLP4/VGI) among patients with HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis
		"in Harare, Zimbabwe and possibly underreported in sub-Saharan Africa."

AB	-	Cryptococcal meningitis is mainly caused by Cryptococcus neoformans and
		"Cryptococcus gattii, but occasionally other Cryptococcus species and"
		"phylogenetically related species are involved. Herein, we present a case of"
		"cryptococcal meningitis from China, which was caused by an azole and flucytosine"
		"resistant Filobasidium uniguttulatum. In addition, we present an overview of the"
		literature of meningitis caused by Cryptococcus species other than C. neoformans
		and C. gattii. Eight cases were related to infections of the central nervous
		system. Leukaemia and cancer were important risk factors in HIV-negative
		patients. Molecular identification and susceptibility testing are important for
		proper management of patients because the species involved may differ in
		susceptibility to antifungal drugs.

TI	-	Clinical analysis of 16 cases of pulmonary cryptococcosis in patients with normal
		immune function.
PG	-	1117-1124
LID	-	10.21037/apm-20-897 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Pulmonary cryptococcosis (PC) is an invasive pulmonary fungal disease
		caused by Cryptococcus neoformans or Cryptococcus gattii. Cryptococcus is the
		opportunistic pathogen. Immune damage and chronic consumptive diseases are the
		high risk. The prevalence of cryptococcus infection is 5% to 10% in individuals
		"with weakened immune function. In recent years, with the application of"
		"glucocorticoids, antitumor drugs, and broad-spectrum antibiotics, the prevalence"
		of cryptococcal infection has increased yearly. Cryptococcus infection can also
		"occur in normal people without underlying diseases. One in every 100,000"
		"individuals with normal immune function is also affected, but these cases are"
		often misdiagnosed due to inadequate understanding and low awareness of PC in
		"individuals with normal immune function. In this study, we investigated the"
		clinical characteristics of PC in patients with normal immune function to improve
		the diagnosis and treatment of these cases. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed
		"the clinical, imaging and pathological data of 16 patients with pulmonary"
		cryptococcosis treated at Beijing Shijitan Hospital between 2010 and 2017.
		"RESULTS: Of the 16 patients with disseminated cryptococcosis, 6 were men, and 10"
		were women; their ages were 35 to 76 years (median: 53 years). Initial symptoms
		"were cough, sputum, chest pain, and fever. Thirteen patients had a history of"
		"chronic disease or tumor, including diabetes and bronchial asthma (n=2), simple"
		"hypertension (n=2), chronic bronchitis (n=2), diabetes and hypertension (n=5),"
		"previous tuberculosis (n=1), and previous lung cancer surgery (n=1). Chest"
		computed tomography (CT) in these 16 patients showed single or multiple nodules
		"and masses (n=14), lobar consolidation (n=1), and diffuse mixed lesions (n =1)."
		Lung biopsy showed granulomatous lesions in these 16 patients. Cryptococcus
		neoformans was identified with Grocott's methenamine silver and Grocott's
		methenamine silver (GMS) stains. Fourteen patients received fluconazole alone;
		two patients with intracranial infection received fluconazole combined with
		"amphotericin B. Five patients improved significantly, and nine patients improved"
		with significant lesion absorption. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical manifestations of
		PC are nonspecific in patients with normal immune function. Lung biopsy and
		cryptococcus antigen tests of cerebrospinal fluid are valuable diagnostic aids.
		Fluconazole is an effective treatment for disseminated cryptococcal infection.

		in north-western India: a retrospective study.
PG	-	320-3
LID	-	10.3109/13693786.2010.516457 [doi]
AB	-	This study presents a 7-year retrospective analysis of seasonal variations in the
		prevalence of Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii and Cryptococcus gattii in
		decayed wood inside trunk hollows of 518 trees belonging to 20 species in
		"north-western India during 2000-2007. Of the 1,439 wood samples investigated, 406"
		(28.2%) were found to be positive for the Cryptococcus neoformans species complex
		which included 247 samples from which C. neoformans var. grubii was recovered and
		171 which yielded C. gattii. While both of the pathogens were isolated through
		"all the seasons, the overall prevalence of C. neoformans var. grubii was"
		"significantly higher (17.2%) than that of C. gattii serotype B (11.9%, P <"
		"0.0001), indicating that decayed wood was as good, if not better, a natural"
		habitat of C. neoformans var. grubii as that of C. gattii. The highest recovery
		"of both yeasts was in the autumn, followed by that in the summer. For C. gattii,"
		the lowest prevalence occurred during the winter and for C. neoformans var.
		grubii during the rainy season. The low prevalence of C. gattii during winter is
		"similar to that reported from Bogota, Colombia, where C. gattii had a low"
		population density in bark samples but it was not found in decayed wood of trunk
		hollows investigated during the period of January and February. The prevalence of
		C. neoformans var. grubii was significantly lower in the rainy season than in the
		other portions of the year. This finding is similar to the reported low isolation
		frequency (4%) of C. neoformans var. grubii from chicken feces in the rainy
		season in northern Thailand. Further investigations are warranted to determine
		the clinical significance of seasonal variations in the prevalence of C.
		neoformans var. grubii and C. gattii in decayed trunk wood of various trees in
		climatically divergent regions of India.

		from 1988 to 2011. A cause of death could be determined with confidence in 118
		"(49%) of these cases. Of these 118 cases, the leading cause of mortality for both"
		"regions, together and separately, was infectious disease. In the Pacific region,"
		"this was followed by traumatic and anthropogenic causes, whereas in the Atlantic"
		"region, it was followed by emaciation/starvation, mortality of dependent calves,"
		and anthropogenic causes. Pathogens of potential zoonotic significance or
		"indicative of environmental contamination, e.g. Salmonella sp. and Cryptococcus"
		"gattii, were identified. Numerous parasitic species were observed within the"
		"lungs, liver, stomach, middle ear, and subcutaneous tissues, although they were"
		usually interpreted as incidental findings. Anthropogenic causes may be
		"underrepresented as they are notoriously difficult to diagnose with certainty,"
		thereby making up a proportion of the 'unknown causes of death' (51%) category.
		Improved standardization of data collection and documentation is required to
		better understand harbor porpoise and ecosystem health.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: A survey on cryptococcosis is being conducted regularly in Colombia
		since 1997. We present hereby the results corresponding to patients diagnosed
		from 2006 to 2010. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the data obtained during this period.
		MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of the corresponding surveys.
		RESULTS: A total of 526 surveys originating from 72% of the Colombian political
		divisions were received during the 5-year period. Most patients (76.6%) were
		males and 74.9% were 21-50 years old. The most prevalent risk factor was HIV
		infection (83.5%) with cryptococcosis defining AIDS in 23% of the cases. In the
		general population the estimated mean annual incidence rate for cryptococcosis
		was 2.4 x 106 inhabitants while in AIDS patients this rate rose to 3.3 x 103. In
		"474 surveys stating clinical features, most frequent complaints were headache"
		"84.5%, fever 63.4%, nausea and vomiting 57.5%, mental alterations 46.3%,"
		"meningeal signs 33.0%, cough 26.4% and visual alterations 24.5%."
		Neurocryptococcosis was recorded in 81.8% of the cases. Laboratory diagnosis was
		"based on direct examination, culture and latex in 29.3% cases. From 413"
		"Cryptococcus isolates analyzed, 95.6% were identified as C. neoformans var."
		"grubii, 1% C. neoformans var. neoformans, and 3.4% C. gattii. Treatment was"
		reported for 71.6% of the cases with amphotericin B alone or in combination with
		fluconazole prescribed in 28%. CONCLUSIONS: Surveys done through passive
		surveillance continue to be sentinel markers for HIV infection and represent a
		systematic approach to the study of opportunistic problems regularly afflicting
		AIDS patients since cryptococcosis requires no compulsory notification in
		Colombia.

AB	-	"Cryptococcosis is a classical systemic opportunistic mycosis, primarily occurring"
		"among patients with significant immunologic impairment. However, this disease"
		"could also affect patients without any recognized immunologic defects, that is,"
		phenotypically normal patients. The medical records of 29 non-HIV/nontransplant
		patients with cryptococcal disease during the period 2007-2014 were
		retrospectively reviewed. The most common site of infection was the central
		"nervous system (n = 25, 86.2%), followed by the pulmonary system (n = 11, 37.9%)"
		"and blood (n = 2, 6.8%). Thoracic- and brain-computed tomography demonstrated"
		"abnormalities of 81.2% (n = 13) and 62.5% (n = 15), respectively. In sum, 22% (n"
		= 6) of the patients experienced a significant underlying condition. More than
		one therapeutic regimen was used in 77.8% (n = 21) of the patients. The isolates
		"were identified as being Cryptococcus neoformans species complex (n = 4, 36.4%)"
		"and Cryptococcus gattii species complex (n = 7, 63.6%). The overall mortality was"
		"20.7% (n = 6). Herein, we presented the first case series of cryptococcosis in"
		"this specific population in São Paulo City, Brazil. The incidence of"
		"cryptococcosis in our hospital has not increased in recent years, and 77.8% (n ="
		"21) of cases had no obvious predisposing factor. However, this disease remains"
		associated with high mortality.

		Cryptococcus deuterogattii (AFLP6/VGII).
PG	-	e005168
LID	-	10.1099/jmmcr.0.005168 [doi]
LID	-	e005168
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Cryptococcosis in immunocompetent adults is a rare disease in
		"Europe, mostly induced by members of the Cryptococcus gattii species complex. The"
		"diagnosis can be challenging due to its rarity, unspecific symptoms and long"
		symptomless latency. CASE PRESENTATION: A 49-year-old woman with a three weeks
		history of headache was admitted to the hospital due to discrete ataxia and
		impaired vision. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a
		contrast-enhancing mass in the cerebellum. Further investigations detected a
		slight leukocytosis and a single subpleural nodule in the right inferior lung
		"lobe. The cerebral lesion was surgically removed, and a direct frozen section"
		only showed an unspecific inflammation. In the course of her admission she
		developed non-treatable cerebral edema and died ten days after surgical
		intervention. Histopathological examination of the surgical specimen and
		postmortem evaluation of the lung and the cerebrum demonstrated fungal elements.
		Molecular identification of the fungal elements in formalin-fixed
		paraffin-embedded tissue lead to the diagnosis of cryptococcosis induced by C.
		gattii sensu lato. Molecular genetic analysis identified the involved
		"cryptococcal species as genotype AFLP6/VGII, recently described as Cryptococcus"
		"deuterogattii, which is known to be endemic to the west-coast of Canada and the"
		USA. Additional heteroanamnestic information revealed that she had spent her
		"holidays on Vancouver Island, Canada, two years before disease onset, indicating"
		that infection during this stay seems to be plausible. CONCLUSION: Cryptococcosis
		"due to C. deuterogattii is a rarely encountered fungal disease in Europe, not"
		"particularly associated with immunodeficiency, and infection is likely to be"
		"contracted in endemic areas. Due to its rarity, long symptomless latency,"
		unspecific symptoms and misleading radiological features the diagnosis can be
		challenging. Physicians need to be aware of this differential diagnosis in
		"immunocompetent patients, as early adequate therapy can be lifesaving."

AB	-	"Cryptococcosis, caused by the Cryptococcus gattii and C. neoformans species"
		"complexes, is an environmentally acquired mycosis affecting a broad range of host"
		"species. Among 9 communally housed ferrets, a 5-y-old castrated male ferret"
		"domiciled in an outdoor enclosure in Sydney, Australia was diagnosed with"
		sinonasal cryptococcosis. Clinical signs resolved during 18 mo of itraconazole
		"therapy, but the ferret was eventually euthanized because of splenic"
		"hemangiosarcoma. At postmortem, microscopic foci of persistent cryptococcosis"
		were detected. The diagnosis raised concerns that the owners and other ferrets
		"were exposed to a common environmental source of infection, thus prompting an"
		"investigation. Soil samples, swabs of a hollow eucalypt log (used for behavioral"
		"enrichment), and nasal swabs from 8 asymptomatic ferrets were collected. Nasal"
		exudate (obtained at diagnosis) and tissues (collected at postmortem) were
		available from the clinical case. Bird seed agar culture resulted in a heavy
		"growth of Cryptococcus spp. from one environmental site (the log), one nasal"
		"swab, and nasal exudate and tissues from the clinical case. All other samples"
		were culture-negative. Sub-cultured isolates from the log were a mixture of C.
		gattii molecular type VGI and C. neoformans molecular type VNI. Ferret isolates
		were a similar mixture of C. gattii VGI (all disease isolates) and C. neoformans
		VNI (nasal-colonizing isolate). Multilocus sequence typing further revealed the
		"ferret isolates as identical to environmental isolates collected from the log,"
		confirming the log as the source of clinical disease and nasal colonization. The
		log was removed to prevent further exposure to a high environmental load of
		Cryptococcus spp.

AB	-	Cryptococcal meningitis has become the largest cause for the death of infectious
		diseases in the central nervous system infectious disease worldwide. Most
		"patients with cryptococcal meningitis have AIDS, autoimmune diseases, hematologic"
		"malignancies, and some other relevant diseases. It is mainly caused by infection"
		with Cryptococcus neoformans or Cryptococcus gattii. Although the relationship
		"between cryptococcal meningitis and autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus"
		"erythematosus, has been recognized, little has been studied about it."
		"Furthermore, with the use of glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants, the"
		incidence of cryptococcal meningitis is increasing year by year. Cryptococcal
		"meningitis accounts for 15% of HIV-related deaths globally, compared with little"
		research on HIV-negative cryptococcal diseases. A 54-year-old female patient with
		gingival bleeding was admitted to the Department of Neurology at the Second
		Xiangya Hospital of Central South University. The patient subsequently developed
		"a series of central nervous system symptoms such as headache, ischemic stroke,"
		"and epilepsy. The number of thrombocytes was at 4×10(9)/L, antinuclear antibody"
		"was (+), antihuman globulin was (++), globulin IgG anticardiolipin antibody IgG,"
		"IgA, and IgM was positive, lupus anticoagulant was strong positive, antibody"
		against β2 glycoprotein 1 IgM >841 AU/mL with elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
		"pressure. The CSF India ink staining was positive, CSF was cultured cryptococcus"
		neoformans. Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and cryptococcal neoformans
		"meningitis were diagnosed. After active antifungal therapy and control of APS,"
		"the patient still had a serial of complications including high CSF pressure,"
		"persistent positive India ink staining, refractory electrolyte disturbance,"
		"hemolytic anemia recurs, heart failure, and finally death. No cases of the"
		"combination of the two diseases have been reported, and this case of cryptococcal"
		meningitis with APS may provide a new direction to the diagnosis and treatment
		for this kind of disease.

		United States Pacific Northwest.
PG	-	e88875

LID	-	e88875
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcus gattii is a fungal pathogen causing an emerging outbreak
		in the United States Pacific Northwest (PNW). Treatment guidelines for
		cryptococcosis are primarily based on data from C. neoformans infections;
		applicability to PNW C. gattii infection is unknown. We evaluated the
		relationship between initial antifungal treatment and outcomes for PNW C. gattii
		patients. METHODS: Cases were defined as culture-confirmed invasive C. gattii
		infections among residents of Oregon and Washington States during 2004-2011.
		Clinical data were abstracted from medical records through one year of follow-up.
		"Recommended initial treatment for central nervous system (CNS), bloodstream, and"
		severe pulmonary infections is amphotericin B and 5-flucytosine; for non-severe
		"pulmonary infections, recommended initial treatment is fluconazole. Alternative"
		initial treatment was defined as any other initial antifungal treatment. RESULTS:
		Seventy patients survived to diagnosis; 50 (71%) received the recommended initial
		treatment and 20 (29%) received an alternative. Fewer patients with pulmonary
		infections [21 (64%)] than CNS infections [25 (83%)] received the recommended
		"initial treatment (p = 0.07). Among patients with pulmonary infections, those"
		with severe infections received the recommended initial treatment less often than
		"those with non-severe infections (11% vs. 83%, p<0.0001). Eight patients with"
		severe pulmonary infections received alternative initial treatments; three died.
		Four patients with non-severe pulmonary infections received alternative initial
		treatments; two died. There was a trend towards increased three-month mortality
		among patients receiving alternative vs. recommended initial treatment (30% vs.
		"14%, p = 0.12), driven primarily by increased mortality among patients with"
		pulmonary disease receiving alternative vs. recommended initial treatment (42%
		"vs. 10%, p = 0.07). CONCLUSIONS: C. gattii patients with pulmonary"
		infections--especially severe infections--may be less likely to receive
		recommended treatment than those with CNS infections; alternative treatment may
		be associated with increased mortality. Reasons for receipt of alternative
		"treatment among C. gattii patients in this area should be investigated, and"
		clinician awareness of recommended treatment reinforced.

AB	-	An outbreak of infections due to a rare subspecies of Cryptococcus neoformans
		"(var. gattii) was recognized on Vancouver Island (VI), British Columbia, in 2002,"
		"which had affected 59, mostly immunocompetent, individuals since 1999. The"
		objectives of this study were to: (1) determine if the outbreak had spread to
		"Vancouver and its surrounding communities and (2) review the epidemiological,"
		clinical and pathological features of all cryptococcal infections in patients
		admitted to the Vancouver Hospital and Health Sciences Centre (VHHSC) over a 5
		year period. VHHSC microbiology and pathology databases were searched for
		cryptococcal infections from 1 June 1997 to 31 December 2002. Hospital charts of
		all identified patients were reviewed. Available cryptococcal isolates and
		histopathological specimens were reviewed. Twenty-six cases of cryptococcosis
		were identified in both HIV-positive (n = 15) and HIV-negative (n = 11) patients.
		"C. neoformans var. grubii was cultured from 13 patients, of whom 10 were"
		"HIV-positive. The outbreak strain, C. neoformans var. gattii, was detected in"
		three patients; all had travelled to VI. C. neoformans var. neoformans was
		"cultured from two patients, Cryptococcus laurentii was cultured from one, and"
		"seven patients had cryptococcosis based on histopathology alone, without"
		cultures. The majority (10/15) of the HIV-positive patients developed systemic
		disease whilst HIV-negative patients (8/11) presented with pulmonary
		"cryptococcosis. Lung biopsies revealed necrotizing and/or fibrosing granulomas,"
		with cryptococcal cells in 5 of 10 specimens. Brain biopsies showed cryptococcal
		organisms within leptomeninges and deeper structures with minimal associated
		inflammation. This retrospective study demonstrated a sharp increase in the total
		number of C. neoformans infections in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent
		patients at the VHHSC in 2002. There was no evidence of spread of the outbreak
		strain to the Greater Vancouver area. This is the first correlation of clinical
		and investigational findings of cryptococcosis in a region in North America where
		C. neoformans varieties gattii and grubii are endemic.

AB	-	A 39-year-old man presented to our hospital with a four-week history of headache
		and a two-week history of low-grade fever. Chest X-rays showed a tumor of
		approximately 50 mm in size in the right lower field. A histopathological
		examination of a transbronchial lung biopsy specimen from the right S9/10
		revealed numerous fungal elements that appeared as encapsulated yeast with clear
		halos. Gadolinium-enhanced brain magnetic resonance images showed multiple
		cerebral nodules. Cryptococcus gattii (Genotype VGIIa) was isolated from the
		bronchial lavage and cerebrospinal fluid specimens. The patient was an
		immunocompetent Japanese man who had not recently traveled to a C. gattii-endemic
		area.

		of Oregon outbreak cases.
PG	-	467-76
LID	-	10.1111/tid.12370 [doi]
AB	-	Cryptococcus gattii was recognized as an emerging infection in the Pacific
		"Northwest in 2004. Out of 62 total infections in Oregon since the outbreak, 11"
		were in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients. SOT recipients were more likely
		"to have disseminated disease and higher mortality than normal hosts, who mostly"
		had isolated mass lesions. The median time from transplantation to C. gattii
		"diagnosis was 17.8 months. The primary sites of infection were lung (n = 4),"
		"central nervous system (n = 3), or both (n = 4). The Oregon-endemic strain, VGII"
		(subtypes IIa and IIc) was present in 10 of 11 patients; the median fluconazole
		minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was 12 μg/mL (range 2-32 μg/mL) for this
		strain. We found C. gattii infection among organ transplant recipients was
		"disseminated at diagnosis, had low cerebrospinal fluid cryptococcal antigen"
		"titers, and was associated with an elevated fluconazole MIC and high attributable"
		mortality.

LID	-	e3707
AB	-	Cryptococcal infections are caused by encapsulated fungi Cryptococcus gattii and
		C. neoformans. Inhalation commonly causes innocuous colonization but may cause
		meningitis or disseminated disease via hematogenous spread. Cryptococcosis occurs
		most commonly in immunocompromised patients including those with acquired
		"immunodeficiency syndrome, meningoencephalitis or disseminated disease. However,"
		cryptococcosis can occur as asymptomatic isolated pulmonary nodules in
		immunocompetent patients. Here we present a unique retrospective case report of a
		"55-year-old immunocompetent man who presented with pleuritic chest pain,"
		"productive cough, dyspnea on exertion, chills, night sweats, and weight loss. A"
		computed tomography scan of his chest revealed multiple ground-glass opacities
		throughout both lung fields. The results of his autoimmune evaluation and human
		immunodeficiency virus tests were negative. A biopsy obtained through
		video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery revealed mucicarmine staining capsules
		"confirming Cryptococcus, requiring treatment with amphotericin, flucytosine, and"
		fluconazole. This case highlights the rarely studied presentation of symptomatic
		diffuse pulmonary cryptococcal infection in an immunocompetent patient requiring
		treatment.

AB	-	Cryptococcus neoformans is the leading cause of cryptococcosis in HIV-infected
		"subjects worldwide. Treatment of cryptococcosis is based on amphotericin B,"
		"flucytosine, and fluconazole. In Zimbabwe, little is known about antifungal"
		susceptibility of Cryptococcus. Sixty-eight genotyped Cryptococcus isolates were
		"tested for antifungal profiles. Amphotericin B, isavuconazole, and voriconazole"
		showed higher activity than other triazoles. Fluconazole and flucytosine were
		"less effective, with geometric mean MICs of 2.24 and 2.67mg/L for C. neoformans"
		"AFLP1/VNI, 1.38 and 1.53mg/L for C. neoformans AFLP1A/VNB/VNII and AFLP1B/VNII,"
		"and 1.85 and 0.68mg/L for Cryptococcus tetragattii, respectively. A significant"
		difference between flucytosine geometric mean MICs of C. neoformans and C.
		tetragattii was observed (P=0.0002). The majority of isolates (n=66/68; 97.1%)
		had a wild-type MIC phenotype of all antifungal agents. This study demonstrates a
		favorable situation with respect to the tested antifungals agents. Continued
		surveillance of antifungal susceptibility profiles is important due to the high
		burden of cryptococcosis in Africa.

AB	-	Cryptococcus gattii infection is a rare cause of severe pulmonary disease and
		meningoencephalitis that has only recently been detected in the southeastern
		United States. We describe an organ transplant-associated outbreak of C. gattii
		infection involving an HIV-negative immunosuppressed donor in this region who
		died following new-onset headache and seizure of unknown cause. Retrospective
		cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) testing of donor serum was positive. Two of the three
		transplant recipients developed severe C. gattii infection 11 and 12 weeks
		"following transplantation. One recipient died from severe pulmonary infection,"
		"identified on autopsy, and the other ill recipient survived following treatment"
		for cryptococcal meningitis. This outbreak underscores the importance of
		considering cryptococcosis in patients with clinical findings suggestive of
		"subacute meningitis or other central nervous system (CNS) pathology, and the"
		potential benefit of routine pre-transplant donor CrAg screening using lateral
		flow assay to guide recipient antifungal prophylaxis. The case also adds to
		emerging evidence that C. gattii is a potential threat in the southeastern United
		States.

TI	-	Disseminated Cryptococcal Disease in a Patient With Monoclonal Gammopathy of
		Undetermined Significance and Polycythemia Vera: A Case Report and Review of the
		Literature.
PG	-	e12458

LID	-	e12458
AB	-	Cryptococcosis is a life-threatening opportunistic infection caused by
		Cryptococcus gattii and Cryptococcus neoformans. It affects both immunocompetent
		and immunosuppressed hosts. Disseminated cryptococcal infection is rare in
		"immunocompetent patients, but the cryptococcal disease's neurological sequelae"
		may be more prominent in this group. We present a case of a 58-year-old male
		patient with medical comorbidities of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined
		significance (MGUS) and polycythemia vera. The patient presented with gradual
		worsening of mental status over one week. He was found to have Cryptococcus
		neoformans meningoencephalitis and fungemia. The patient received two weeks of
		liposomal amphotericin B (LAmB) and flucytosine with excellent clinical response.
		"He was discharged on high dose fluconazole, and he returned to the hospital in"
		one week with new-onset hemiplegia and cryptococcomas on imaging. Prolonged
		intravenous (IV) treatment of six weeks duration resulted in significant clinical
		improvement and disease-free state at two years follow-up. This article aims to
		stress the importance of individualized prolonged IV treatment with liposomal
		amphotericin B and flucytosine despite good initial response in patients with
		polycythemia vera and MGUS. This is the first reported case of cryptococcal
		"disease, to the best of our knowledge, in a patient with MGUS and the third case"
		of cryptococcal infection in patients with polycythemia vera in a non-HIV
		non-transplant state. Prolonged individualized IV treatment should be considered
		"in immunocompetent patients with the above conditions, as this condition, if not"
		"adequately treated and relapses, lead to high morbidity and mortality."

		outcomes of Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii fungemia.
PG	-	1114-1121
LID	-	10.1093/mmy/myab046 [doi]
AB	-	Mortality rates due to Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii fungemia remain
		significant despite treatment with antifungal drugs. The predictive function of
		antifungal susceptibility and its correlation with treatment outcome remains
		"controversial. A retrospective study was conducted from January 1, 2009, to"
		"December 31, 2016, on 85 patients with C. neoformans var. grubii fungemia"
		confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass
		spectrometry. Antifungal drug susceptibility was determined using the YeastONE™
		colorimetric broth microdilution method coupled with Vizion™ System following the
		Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Six antifungal
		"agents-amphotericin B, fluconazole, flucytosine, itraconazole, posaconazole, and"
		voriconazole-were tested. The patients' demographic data and clinical information
		were abstracted for further analyses. Antifungal regimens consisting of
		amphotericin B with or without fluconazole or flucytosine were administered for
		"induction treatment of these patients, followed with intravenous or oral"
		fluconazole for maintenance therapy. Clinical outcomes were defined by 14- and
		30-day mortality rates. Risk factors associated with outcomes were fitted in a
		logistic regression model by univariate or multivariate method. Eighty-five
		patients with C. neoformans var. grubii fungemia were enrolled in the study. The
		"Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score, Glasgow Coma Scale, Charlson"
		"comorbidity score, and adequate duration of therapy for amphotericin B were"
		predictors for mortality in univariate analysis. Antifungal susceptibility
		testing with YeastONE™ does not predict clinical outcomes of C. neoformans var.
		"grubii fungemia. Greater disease severity, high comorbidities, poor consciousness"
		"level, and inappropriate treatment were associated with increased mortality in"
		cryptococcemia cases.

		"animals that is composed of three main serotypes: C. neoformans var. grubii, C."
		"neoformans var. gattii, and C. neoformans var. neoformans. C. neoformans var."
		grubii is the most common disease-causing Cryptococcus species worldwide. C.
		neoformans var. gattii is more prevalent than C. neoformans var. neoformans in
		"both tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. C. neoformans causes severe, even"
		"fatal, diseases such as pulmonary infection, bloodstream infection, skin and soft"
		"tissue infection, bone and joint infection, central nervous system infection, and"
		"disseminated infection, regardless of host immunocompetence. We conducted a"
		"retrospective study on 85 patients who contracted cryptococcemia from January 1,"
		"2009, to December 31, 2016. This work conducted both microbiological and clinical"
		"studies involving in vitro susceptibility testing, demographic data,"
		"comorbidities, treatment modalities, and treatment outcomes. We utilized a modern"
		"medical technique-based instrument, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization"
		"time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF MS; Biotyper, Bruker Daltonics,"
		"Inc.), which determines the unique proteomic fingerprint of an organism, to"
		identify the C. neoformans serotype. We utilized Thermo Fisher Scientific™
		Sensititre™ YeastONE™ colorimetric broth microdilution plates coupled with a
		Vizion™ Digital MIC Viewing System (a computer-assisted optical reading machine)
		"to determine the in vitro susceptibility of amphotericin B, flucytosine,"
		"fluconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole against 85 C."
		"neoformans var. grubii blood isolates. In conclusion, the susceptibility patterns"
		of these antifungal agents did not correlate significantly with treatment
		"outcomes. However, a lower disease severity score, a lower Glasgow Coma Scale"
		"score, fewer comorbidities, and adequate amphotericin B treatment duration were"
		predictors for treatment success in univariate analysis.

PG	-	295-308
LID	-	10.7589/2014-06-143 [doi]
AB	-	A wide range of systemic mycoses have been reported from captive and wild marine
		mammals from North America. Examples include regionally endemic pathogens such as
		"Coccidioides and Blastomyces spp., and novel pathogens like Cryptococcus gattii,"
		which appear may have been introduced to North America by humans. Stranding and
		necropsy data were analyzed from three marine mammal stranding and response
		"facilities on the central California coast to assess the prevalence, host"
		"demographics, and lesion distribution of systemic mycoses affecting locally"
		"endemic marine mammals. Between 1 January 1998 and 30 June 2012, >7,000 stranded"
		marine mammals were necropsied at the three facilities. Necropsy and
		histopathology records were reviewed to identify cases of locally invasive or
		systemic mycoses and determine the nature and distribution of fungal lesions.
		"Forty-one animals (0.6%) exhibited cytological, culture- or histologically"
		"confirmed locally invasive or systemic mycoses: 36 had coccidioidomycosis, two"
		"had zygomycosis, two had cryptococcosis, and one was systemically infected with"
		Scedosporium apiospermum (an Ascomycota). Infected animals included 18 California
		"sea lions (Zalophus californianus), 20 southern sea otters (Enhydra lutris"
		"nereis), two Pacific harbor seals (Phoca vitulina richardsi), one Dall's porpoise"
		"(Phocoenoides dalli), and one northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris)."
		"Coccidioidomycosis was reported from 15 sea lions, 20 sea otters, and one harbor"
		"seal, confirming that Coccidioides spp. is the most common pathogen causing"
		systemic mycosis in marine mammals stranding along the central California coast.
		We also report the first confirmation of C. gattii infection in a wild marine
		mammal from California and the first report of coccidioidomycosis in a wild
		harbor seal. Awareness of these pathogenic fungi during clinical care and
		postmortem examination is an important part of marine mammal population health
		surveillance and human health protection. Temporal-spatial overlap may be
		observed for pathogenic mycoses infecting coastal marine mammals and adjacent
		human populations.

		associations. RESULTS: Animals were enrolled during 2 noncontiguous periods in
		August 2001 to February 2002 (8 dogs and 9 cats enrolled) and May to December
		2003 (12 dogs and 20 cats enrolled). Risk factors significantly associated with
		development of cryptococcosis included residing within 10 km of a logging site or
		"other area of commercial soil disturbance, above-average level of activity of the"
		"animal, travelling of the animal on Vancouver Island, hunting by the animal, and"
		owners hiking or visiting a botanic garden. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE:
		Results indicated that dogs and cats that were active or that lived near a site
		of commercial environmental disturbance had a significantly increased risk of
		developing C gattii infection. Veterinarians should communicate these risks to
		owners in context because cryptococcosis was an uncommon disease in this
		population.

PG	-	499-508
AB	-	A prospective population-based study was conducted in Australia and New Zealand
		during 1994-1997 to elucidate the epidemiology of cryptococcosis due to
		Cryptococcus neoformans var. neoformans (CNVN) and C. neoformans var. gattii
		(CNVG) and to relate clinical manifestations to host immune status and
		cryptococcal variety. The mean annual incidence per 10(6) population was 6.6 in
		"Australia and 2.2 in New Zealand. Of 312 episodes, CNVN caused 265 (85%; 98% of"
		the episodes in immunocompromised hosts) and CNVG caused 47 (15%; 44% of the
		episodes in immunocompetent hosts). The incidence of AIDS-associated cases in
		Australia declined annually (P<.001). Aborigines in rural or semirural locations
		(P<.001) and immunocompetent males (P<.001) were at increased risk of CNVG
		infection. Cryptococcomas in lung or brain were more common in immunocompetent
		hosts (P< or =.03) in whom there was an association only between lung
		cryptococcomas and CNVG. An AIDS-associated genetic profile of CNVN serotype A
		was confirmed by random amplification of polymorphic DNA analysis. Resistance to
		antifungal drugs was uncommon. The epidemiology of CNVN infection has changed
		substantially. Clinical manifestations of disease are influenced more strongly by
		host immune status than by cryptococcal variety.

AB	-	Pulmonary infections from the environmental fungus Cryptococcus gattii (C.
		"gattii) are notable for cryptococcomas, which are usually solitary and can be"
		very large. As with infections with Cryptococcus neoformans (C. neoformans)
		"patients can have concomitant cryptococcal meningitis; however, unlike for C."
		"neoformans, infections with C. gattii often occur in immunocompetent patients."
		The highest published incidence of C. gattii infection has been in the Indigenous
		Australian population of Arnhem Land in the tropical north of the country. More
		recently C. gattii has been responsible for outbreaks of cryptococcosis in the
		Pacific Northwest of Canada and the United States of America (USA). A previously
		healthy Indigenous male from Arnhem Land presented with pulmonary cryptococcosis
		with chest imaging showing >50 bilateral lung nodules. This unusual occurrence
		was attributed to probable inhalation of fungal elements from prior use of a
		high-pressure leaf blower to clear eucalyptus and other debris in a remote bush
		camp.

AB	-	Cryptococcal meningitis is the leading fungal infection and AIDS defining
		"opportunistic illness in patients with late stage HIV infection, particularly in"
		"South-East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Given the high mortality, clinical"
		differences and the extensive ecological niche of Cryptococcus neoformans and
		"Cryptococcus gattii species complexes, there is need for laboratories in"
		sub-Sahara African countries to adopt new and alternative reliable diagnostic
		algorithms that rapidly identify and distinguish these species. We biotyped 74
		and then amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) genotyped 66 Cryptococcus
		isolates from a cohort of patients with HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis.
		C. gattii sensu lato was isolated at a prevalence of 16.7% (n = 11/66) and C.
		neoformans sensu stricto was responsible for 83.3% (n = 55/66) of the infections.
		"l-Canavanine glycine bromothymol blue, yeast-carbon-base-d-proline-d-tryptophan"
		and creatinine dextrose bromothymol blue thymine were able to distinguish
		pathogenic C. gattii sensu lato from C. neoformans sensu stricto species when
		compared with AFLP genotyping. This study demonstrates high C. gattii sensu lato
		"prevalence in Zimbabwe. In addition, biotyping methods can be used as alternative"
		diagnostic tools to molecular typing in resource-limited areas for
		differentiating pathogenic Cryptococcus species.

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) remains an important cause of morbidity
		and mortality among immunocompromised patients. Laboratory diagnostics for CM
		"includes antigen detection, staining and culture. Data on the performance of the"
		Biofire® FilmArray® meningitis/encephalitis (ME) panel for detecting Cryptococcus
		"neoformans/gattii is limited, with several reports describing false negativity"
		for this target. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 1384 physician-ordered ME
		panel tests ordered between January 2017 to October 2018 was performed. ME panel
		results were compared to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cryptococcal antigen (CrAg)
		and CSF culture testing and clinical significance of cryptococcal detection was
		determined. RESULTS: There were 34 patients positive for cryptococcal detection
		"by either ME panel, CSF CrAg or CSF culture in 2.7% of CSF specimens tested"
		"(38/1384). Of the 34 patients positive for cryptococcal detection, 85.3% were"
		human immunodeficiency virus positive (29/34). The ME panel detected 32/38
		"(84.2%) cryptococcal-positive specimens, culture detected 28/38 (73.7%) and CSF"
		CrAg was positive in 37/38 specimens (97.4%). The ME panel had a sensitivity and
		specificity of 96.4% (95% CI 81.7-99.9%) and 99.6% (95% CI 99.2-99.9%) compared
		"with culture, and 83.8% (95% CI 68.0-93.8%) and 99.9% (95% CI 99.6-100.0%)"
		"compared to CSF CrAg testing, respectively. CrAg titres were lower among ME"
		"panel-negative, culture-negative specimens compared with ME panel-positive,"
		culture-negative specimens (reciprocal median end-point titres of 128 ± 60 vs.
		"1920 ± 1730, p 0.04). All five CrAg-positive, ME panel- and culture-negative"
		specimens were obtained from previously treated CM patients. DISCUSSION: The ME
		panel had high correlation with CSF culture and a somewhat lower correlation with
		CSF CrAg testing. The potential utility of using negative ME panel test results
		to predict culture sterility among patients undergoing treatment for CM warrants
		further study.

TI	-	ISOLATION AND CHARACTERISATION OF CRYPTOCOCCUS NEOFORMANS AND CRYPTOCOCCUS GATTII
		"FROM ENVIRONMENTAL SOURCES IN NAIROBI, KENYA."
PG	-	281-5
AB	-	Objective: To establish the environmental reservoirs of Cryptococcus neoformans
		"and Cryptococcus gattii in Nairobi, Kenya. Design: Prospective study. SETTING:"
		"Kenya Medical Research Institute, Mycology laboratory, Nairobi, Kenya. SUBJECTS:"
		A total of 400 environmental samples from different sites were analysed
		"including; avian droppings, tree swabs, soil contaminated with avian droppings"
		and swabs from garbage damping sites. Samples were subjected to various
		"phenotypic tests including microscopic morphology, physiological and biochemical"
		"tests, pigmentation on bird seed agar and reaction on"
		Canavanine-Glycine-Bromothymol Blue agar. RESULTS: Cryptococcus neoformans was
		isolated from 23/200 (11.5%) dropping samples and Cryptococcus gattii in 5/200
		(2.5%) of the same samples. Cryptococcus gattii was isolated from 7/60 (11.7%)
		tree swabs and Cryptococcus neoformans in 5/60 (8.5%) of the same samples. From
		"other sites there was no Cryptococcus gattii recovered with (5/50: 10%), (6/60:"
		"10%), (2/30: 6.7%) Cryptococcus neoformans recovered from chicken cage, garbage"
		damping site and soil respectively. CONCLUSION: Findings clearly showed a high
		presence of Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii from several
		"environmental sites in Nairobi, Kenya. This could probably explain the high"
		incidence of cryptococcal meningitis in HIV/AIDS patients in Kenya.

AB	-	"To gain a more detailed picture of cryptococcosis in Thailand, a retrospective"
		study of 498 C. neoformans and C. gattii isolates has been conducted. Among
		"these, 386, 83 and 29 strains were from clinical, environmental and veterinary"
		"sources, respectively. A total of 485 C. neoformans and 13 C. gattii strains were"
		studied. The majority of the strains (68.9%) were isolated from males (mean age
		"of 37.97 years), 88.5% of C. neoformans and only 37.5% of C. gattii strains were"
		from HIV patients. URA5-RFLP and/or M13 PCR-fingerprinting analysis revealed that
		the majority of the isolates were C. neoformans molecular type VNI regardless of
		"their sources (94.8%; 94.6% of the clinical, 98.8% of the environmental and 86.2%"
		"of the veterinary isolates). In addition, the molecular types VNII (2.4%; 66.7%"
		"of the clinical and 33.3% of the veterinary isolates), VNIV (0.2%; 100%"
		"environmental isolate), VGI (0.2%; 100% clinical isolate) and VGII (2.4%; 100%"
		clinical isolates) were found less frequently. Multilocus Sequence Type (MLST)
		analysis using the ISHAM consensus MLST scheme for the C. neoformans/C. gattii
		species complex identified a total of 20 sequence types (ST) in Thailand
		combining current and previous data. The Thai isolates are an integrated part of
		"the global cryptococcal population genetic structure, with ST30 for C. gattii and"
		"ST82, ST83, ST137, ST141, ST172 and ST173 for C. neoformans being unique to"
		"Thailand. Most of the C. gattii isolates were ST7 = VGIIb, which is identical to"
		"the less virulent minor Vancouver island outbreak genotype, indicating Thailand"
		as a stepping stone in the global spread of this outbreak strain. The current
		study revealed a greater genetic diversity and a wider range of major molecular
		types being present amongst Thai cryptococcal isolates than previously reported.

AB	-	Ten cases of cryptococcosis due to unusual microscopic forms of Cryptococcus sp.
		observed over a twenty-eight year period (1981-2009) are presented. The most
		important clinicopathological and laboratory data are tabulated. The uncommon
		forms of cryptococcal cells given are: structures resembling germ tube (one
		"case), chains of budding yeasts (one case), pseudohyphae (two cases) and"
		nonencapsulated yeast-like organisms (eight cases). The diagnosis was based on
		the histopathological findings. The causative organism was isolated and
		"identified in seven cases; five were due to C. neoformans, and two to C. gattii."
		"In addition, the importance of using staining histochemical techniques -"
		"Grocott's silver stain (GMS), Mayer's mucicarmine stain (MM) and Fontana-Masson"
		stain (FM) - in the diagnosis of cryptococcosis is argued.

PG	-	402-406
LID	-	10.6002/ect.2018.0051 [doi]
AB	-	Cryptococcosis is an opportunistic infection caused by the Basidiomycota
		"Cryptococcus neoformans (Cryptococcus gattii), which affects immunosuppressed"
		patients and less frequently immunocompetent patients. Solid-organ transplant
		"recipients are a particularly high-risk group, depending on the net state of"
		"immunosuppression. In these patients, the infection usually appears after the"
		"first year after transplant, although it may occur earlier in liver transplant"
		"recipients. In most cases, the infection is secondary to the reactivation of a"
		"latent infection, although it may be due to an unidentified pretransplant"
		"infection by primary infection. Less frequently, it may be transmitted by the"
		graft. The lung and central nervous system are most frequently involved.
		"Extrapulmonary involvement is seen in 75% of the cases, and disseminated disease"
		"occurs in 61%, with mortality ranging from 17% to 50% when the central nervous"
		"system is involved. Here, we report a case of disseminated cryptococcosis"
		"(lymphadenitis, meningitis, pulmonary nodules, and possibly sacroiliitis) in a"
		"patient after liver transplant, with good clinical and microbiological outcomes"
		and without relapse.

AB	-	The fungal pathogen Cryptococcus gattii was considered to be restricted to tropic
		and sub- tropic regions. A recent outbreak in North America due to isolates
		"belonging to molecular type VG II, affecting mostly non-immunocompromised hosts,"
		documented the potential public health impact of this fungal pathogen also in
		"temperate regions. Surveillance of these infections in Germany is challenging, as"
		cryptococcosis is not notifiable and often C. gattii is diagnostically not
		distinguished from the more prevalent Cryptococcus neoformans. We used hospital
		discharge data and identified cryptococcal isolates received by the German
		cryptococcosis reference laboratory at the species level to gain insights into
		the epidemiology of C. gattii-infections in Germany between 2004 and 2013.
		Between 49 and 60 (Median 57) hospitalizations for cryptococcosis are documented
		per year. Between 5 and 28 (Median 14) isolates were received at the reference
		"laboratory per year. Among 155 single patient isolates, four C. gattii (3%) of"
		the molecular types VGI and VG III were identified from patients with
		"meningoencephalitis, including one interspecies hybrid. Patient histories and"
		molecular typing suggest that half of the infections were acquired abroad. Only
		one patient survived the infection. C. gattii remains rarely identified as agent
		of cryptococcosis in Germany but underestimation is likely. Definition of
		environmental niches occupied by C. gattii in Germany may help to assess the
		associated risk of infection and prevent this deadly fungal infection.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcus gattii-induced cryptococcosis is an emerging infectious
		disease of humans and animals with worldwide distribution and public health
		importance due to its significant morbidity and mortality rate. The present study
		aimed to report a case of pulmonary infection by C. gattii molecular type VGII in
		"State of São Paulo, Brazil. CASE PRESENTATION: A 5-year-old goat showing"
		"intermittent dry cough, ruminal tympany, anorexia, fever, tachycardia and"
		tachypnea was presented for necropsy at the Veterinary Hospital of the School of
		"Veterinary Medicine and Animal Sciences, São Paulo University, São Paulo, Brazil."
		Postmortem examination revealed numerous 2.0-6.0 cm diameter yellow gelatinous
		"pulmonary masses. Tissues were evaluated by a combination of pathological,"
		"mycological, and molecular diagnostic techniques. Microscopically, pneumonia"
		"granulomatous, multifocal to coalescing, moderate, with many intralesional"
		carminophilic yeasts was observed. The immunohistochemistry and mycological
		culture confirmed Cryptococcus spp. Internal transcribed spacers and orotidine
		monophosphate pyrophosphorylase nucleotide differentiation demonstrated that the
		isolate corresponds to the C. gattii VGII molecular subtype. CONCLUSIONS: To our
		"knowledge, this is the first report of a pulmonary infection in a goat linked to"
		C. gattii molecular type VGII in Southeastern Brazil. Our findings emphasize the
		need for an active surveillance program for human and animal new infections to
		improve the current public health policies due to expansion of the
		epidemiological niche of this important microorganism.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To determine clinical and pathologic findings associated with an
		"outbreak of cryptococcosis in an unusual geographic location (British Columbia,"
		"Canada). DESIGN: Retrospective study. ANIMALS: 1 pink-fronted cockatoo, 2"
		"ferrets, 20 cats, and 15 dogs. PROCEDURE: A presumptive diagnosis of"
		"cryptococcosis was made on the basis of serologic, histopathologic, or cytologic"
		"findings, and a definitive diagnosis was made on the basis of culture or"
		immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: No breed or sex predilections were
		"detected in affected dogs or cats. Eleven cats had neurologic signs, 7 had skin"
		"lesions, and 5 had respiratory tract signs. None of 17 cats tested serologically"
		for FeLV yielded positive results; 1 of 17 cats yielded positive results for FIV
		"(western blot). Nine of 15 dogs had neurologic signs, 2 had periorbital"
		"swellings, and only 3 had respiratory tract signs initially. Microbiologic"
		culture in 15 cases yielded 2 isolates of Cryptococcus neoformans var grubii
		(serotype A) and 13 isolates of C. neoformans var gattii (serotype B); all
		organisms were susceptible to amphotericin B and ketoconazole. Serologic testing
		had sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 98%. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL
		RELEVANCE: Serologic titers were beneficial in identifying infection in animals
		"with nonspecific signs, but routine serum biochemical or hematologic parameters"
		were of little value in diagnosis. Most animals had nonspecific CNS signs and
		represented a diagnostic challenge. Animals that travel to or live in this region
		and have nonspecific malaise or unusual neurologic signs should be evaluated for
		cryptococcosis.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Cryptococcus gattii species complex is endemic to tropical and
		subtropical regions and is described as a causative agent of cryptococcosis in
		immunocompetent individuals. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the first case of
		cryptococcosis in a HIV-negative patient from Ivory Coast infected by
		Cryptococcus gattii sensu stricto VGI. Isolates were recovered from cerebrospinal
		fluid (CSF) prior to systemic antifungal treatment up to 42 days after detection
		"of the presence of yeasts in the CSF. Eighteen isolates were recovered, genetic"
		diversity and antifungal susceptibility analyses were performed. All the isolates
		belonged to the Cryptococcus gattii sensu stricto (B;VGI) and were identified as
		a new sequence type (ST) 553 by Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) analyses.
		Susceptibility testing showed that all the strains had a wild-type phenotype for
		"fluconazole, amphotericin B and flucytosine. Treatment with fluconazole"
		(1200mg/day) was initiated with success. CONCLUSION: This is the first case
		report of the presence of C. gattii sensu stricto VGI in a HIV-negative ivorian
		patient and the second report of the presence of species from the C. gattii
		complex species in this country.

AB	-	Cryptococcosis is a major opportunistic mycosis which has meningitis as its most
		frequent clinical presentation and can be fatal in the absence of antifungal
		"therapy. The aetiological agents are Cryptococcus neoformans, which affects"
		"mainly immunocompromised subjects, and C. gattii, the aetiologic agent for"
		cryptococcosis in healthy individuals. A recent outbreak of cryptococcosis on
		"Vancouver Island, Canada, raised the level of concern about the epidemiology of"
		"this disease. In Brazil, between 1980 and 2002, six per cent of AIDS patients had"
		cryptococcosis in course at the time of diagnosis. To identify the profile of
		"cryptococcal meningitis patients in Rio Grande do Sul (RS), Brazil, a retroactive"
		study was realized using data from patients registered at Laboratório Central de
		Saúde Pública IPB-LACEN/RS from 2000 to 2005. Most of the patients were men
		"(77.12%), Caucasian (83.5%), median age between thirty and thirty-nine years old"
		(46.24%) and HIV positive (95%).

		"analyzed between 1997-2011, 45 cases caused by C. gattii were reported"
		(prevalence 3.7%; annual incidence 0.07 cases/million inhabitants/year). Norte de
		"Santander had the highest incidence (0.81 cases/million/year), representing 33.3%"
		of all cases. The male: female ratio was 3.3∶1. Mean age at diagnosis was 41±16
		years. No specific risk factors were identified in 91.1% of patients. HIV
		"infection was reported in 6.7% of patients, autoimmune disease and steroids use"
		"in 2.2%. Clinical features included headache (80.5%), nausea/vomiting (56.1%) and"
		neurological derangements (48.8%). Chest radiographs were taken in 21 (46.7%)

		examination was positive in 97.7% cases. Antigen detection was positive for all
		CSF specimens and for 75% of serum samples. C. gattii was recovered from CSF
		(93.3%) and respiratory specimens (6.6%). Serotype was determined in 42 isolates;
		"36 isolates were serotype B (85.7%), while 6 were C (14.3%). The breakdowns of"
		"molecular types were VGII (55.6%), VGIII (31.1%) and VGI (13.3%). Among 44"
		"strains, 16 MLST sequence types (ST) were identified, 11 of them newly reported."
		CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The results of this passive surveillance study
		demonstrate that cryptococcosis caused by C. gattii has a low prevalence in
		"Colombia, with the exception of Norte de Santander. The predominance of molecular"
		type VGII is of concern considering its association with high virulence and the
		potential to evolve into outbreaks.

AB	-	Cryptococcus gattii (C. gattii) has been considered a leading cause of meningitis
		in immunocompetent hosts in tropical and subtropical regions. Visual loss is
		common but hearing impairment is relatively infrequent in C. gattii meningitis.
		"Notably, there have been limited studies on the etiology, and especially therapy"
		of auditory and ocular complications associated with C. gattii meningitis. Here
		we report a case of reversible deafness and blindness treated with a
		ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) surgery in C. gattii meningitis. This case
		indicated that elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) may play a role in the
		concurrent hearing and vision impairments associated with C. gattii meningitis
		and the early VPS surgery after the initiation of the antifungal therapy may
		effectively improve both hearing and vision in this condition.

TI	-	Longitudinal clinical findings and outcome among patients with Cryptococcus
		gattii infection in British Columbia.
PG	-	1368-76
LID	-	10.1093/cid/civ041 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcus gattii (Cg) infection emerged in British Columbia in
		"1999. A longitudinal, clinical description of patients has not been reported."
		METHODS: Medical records were reviewed for Cg patients identified through
		surveillance (1999-2007). Risk factors for Cg mortality were explored using
		multivariate Cox regression; longitudinal patterns in serum cryptococcal antigen
		(SCrAg) titers and the probability of chest cryptococcomas over time were
		estimated using cubic B-splines in mixed-effects regression models. RESULTS:
		"Among 152 patients, 111 (73.0%) were culture confirmed. Isolated lung infection"
		was present in 105 (69.1%) patients; 47 (30.9%) had central nervous system
		"infection, with or without lung involvement. Malignancy was the provisional"
		diagnosis in 64 (42.1%) patients. Underlying diseases were present in 91 (59.9%)
		"patients; 23 (15.1%) were immunocompromised, and 23 (15.1%) had asymptomatic"
		"disease. There were only 2 (1.8%) culture positive relapses, both within 12"
		months of follow-up. The estimated median time to resolution of lung
		"cryptococcomas and decline in SCrAg titer to <1:8 was 2.8 and 2.9 years,"
		respectively. Cg-related and all-cause mortality among culture-confirmed cases at
		"12 months' follow-up was 23.3% and 27.2%, respectively. Cg-related mortality was"
		"associated with age >50 years (hazard ratio [HR], 15.6; 95% confidence interval"
		"[CI], 1.9-130.5) and immunocompromise (HR, 5.8; CI, 1.5-21.6). All Cg-related"
		mortality occurred among culture-positive cases within 1 year of diagnosis.
		"CONCLUSIONS: Cryptococcomas and serum antigenemia were slow to resolve. However,"
		"late onset of failed therapy or relapse was uncommon, suggesting that delayed"
		resolution of these findings does not require prolongation of treatment beyond
		that recommended by guidelines.

LID	-	10.1111/myc.12176 [doi]
AB	-	Primary Cutaneous Cryptococcosis is an uncommon infection caused by the yeast
		Cryptococcus neoformans and C. gattii. Few case reports are available in the
		literature describing in detail primary cutaneous cryptococcosis due to C. gattii
		"in immunocompetent patients. Herein, we present a case of a 68-year-old"
		immunocompetent male patient with erythematous nodular lesions on the right
		forearm due to C. gattii mating-type α and molecular type VGI. The virulence
		"factors test was performed for capsule diameter, melanin production and"
		phospholipase activity. In vitro fluconazole testing showed the sensitivity
		"profile of this clinical isolate. In addition, a review of the literature on this"
		subject was carried out and verified that this is the first reported case of VGI
		in the south-east region of Brazil.

PG	-	463-6
LID	-	10.1111/tid.12371 [doi]
AB	-	Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii are environmental fungi that can
		"cause fever, cough, pneumonia, meningoencephalitis, dissemination, and death. C."
		gattii causes cryptococcomas more frequently than does C. neoformans and may
		require prolonged antifungal treatment. We present a rare case of C. gattii
		"pneumonia in a renal transplant patient. A 44-year-old man, living in a rural"
		"area endemic for C. gattii and who had received a kidney transplant, was admitted"
		"to the hospital with fever, vomiting, weight loss, and diarrhea. A chest computed"
		"tomography revealed 2 alveolar, nodular, subpleural infiltrates in the periphery"
		"of the lungs. Differential diagnoses included infectious infiltrates,"
		"granulomatosis, embolization, and hemorrhage. C. gattii, molecular type VGI, was"
		confirmed on day 28. Treatment consisted of amphotericin B at 1 mg/kg/day or
		"fluconazole at 800 mg/day for first 6 weeks, followed by fluconazole at 400"
		mg/day for the subsequent 12 months. Response to the therapy has been slow.
		Because of the occurrence of outbreaks and its high morbidity and mortality
		"rates, physicians must be aware of this complication in transplant recipients to"
		avoid delays in diagnosis and to provide prompt management.

TI	-	Central nervous system cryptococcoma in immunocompetent patients: a short review
		illustrated by a new case.
PG	-	129-36
LID	-	10.1007/s00701-009-0311-8 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: Cryptococcal infection in CNS is frequently seen in HIV patients and
		"those with other immunosuppressed conditions. However, cryptococcal granuloma in"
		CNS in immunocompetent patient is rare. We present one new case of cryptococcoma
		and review literature to illustrate diagnosis and treatment of these lesions.
		METHODS: We conducted literature search in Pubmed search engine of the National
		Center for Biotechnology Information. RESULTS: Seventeen cases of CNS cryptoccoma
		"in immunocompetent patients, including ours, have been reported to date. Of them,"
		"two patients had lesions inside spinal cord, and C. neoformans var. gattii was"
		identified in three cases. All patients were symptomatic with normal
		immunocompetency although two patients had type 2 diabetes mellitus and one had
		torsades de pointes. Eight patients received surgical treatment and all were
		given antifungal agents except one suspected of teniasis. CONCLUSIONS: With
		"literature reports and our experiences, we suggest that ring shaped enhancement"
		of mass lesion with or without cystic changes in MR scan may indicate
		"cryptococcoma, but definitive diagnosis relies on pathology study of lesion"
		"specimen. Open surgery and anti-fungal therapy should be scheduled, and outcome"
		of cryptococcoma is largely determined by its locations.

		susceptibility testing.
PG	-	242-5
AB	-	We report a clinical case of cerebral infection caused by Cryptococcus gattii in
		a 10 year-old boy. Clinical and laboratory exams did not demonstrate any apparent
		"immunosuppressed state (HIV antibody and the tuberculin skin tests, both"
		"negative, were performed; blood cells count and immunoglobulin levels were within"
		normality). Treatment was begun with amphotericin B-deoxycholate but renal
		toxicity signs led to its substitution by fluconazole. The infection proceeded
		even after treatment with fluconazole. In vitro determination of minimum
		"inhibitory concentration values were high for itraconazole (= or > 2 microg/ml),"
		fluconazole and 5-flucytosine (= or > 64 microg/ml) and low for amphotericin B
		"(1.0 microg/ml). Renal toxicity signs, induced by amphotericin B, progression of"
		"infection after fluconazole, and likely in vivo resistance to this triazole made"
		this case difficult to treat. In vitro drug interaction tests confirmed probable
		synergism between amphotericin B and 5-flucytosine (frational inhibitory
		"concentration - FIC = 0.375). In contrast, a probable additive effect was"
		observed for amphotericin B and fluconazole (FIC = 0.75). Initial treatment of
		persistent high intracranial pressure was insufficient and neurological surgery
		was necessary. Antifungal susceptibility tests and Cryptococcus species
		identification were important in selecting appropriate antifungal therapy.

TI	-	Necrotizing Fasciitis Caused by Cryptococcus gattii.
PG	-	E517-22
AB	-	Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a severe soft-tissue infection that can lead to
		high morbidity and mortality. The etiology of NF is often polymicrobial. Although
		"rare, fungal organisms have been known to cause NF. Cryptococcus is a fungal"
		infection that may lead to NF. Here we report the case of a 73-year-old man who
		had diabetes and presented with pain and swelling in the left hand after being
		bitten by an insect over the dorsum of the hand. Operative débridement revealed
		"NF caused by Cryptococcus gattii. Antifungal medication was started, and the"
		patient underwent multiple débridements of the hand with subsequent skin
		"grafting. Four months later, the hand wound was completely healed. Authors have"
		reported several cases of NF secondary to Cryptococcus neoformans in
		immunocompromised patients. The emerging C gattii pathogen affects
		"immunocompetent patients. Although the transmission route is mainly respiratory,"
		direct inoculation has been described as well. Ours is the first reported case of
		NF secondary to C gattii. It is important to consider fungal elements as a source
		of NF. Appropriate treatment includes aggressive surgical débridement and
		antifungal therapy.

		case report and review.
PG	-	235-8
AB	-	"Cutaneous cryptococcosis caused by C. gattii, in immunocompent patients is a rare"
		"manifestation of disease, and may be one of the first manifestations of"
		disseminated cryptococcosis. We report a case of disseminated cryptococcosis
		caused by Cryptococcus gattii presenting as cutaneous lesions in an
		"immunocompetent patient. Previously to our report, only five cases of cutaneous"
		involvement by Cryptococcus gattii in immunocompetent patients have been reported
		in the literature. Risk factors for C. gattii infection included exposure to the
		eucalypt reservoirs in tropical and subtropical areas. Skin involvement
		corresponded to the disseminated form of cryptococcosis in the majority of
		"patients, and commonly affected the face and neck with different morphologies"
		"including papules, pustules, plaques, ulcers, subcutaneous masses, cellulitis or"
		acneiform lesions. Due to the severity of this infection and the life threatening
		"condition that it represents, clinicians must be aware that cutaneous involvement"
		may be one of the first manifestations of disseminated cryptococcosis caused by
		C. gattii especially in patients living and coming from endemic areas.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Although flucytosine is a key component of WHO-recommended induction
		"treatment for HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis, this antifungal agent is"
		not widely available in low-income and middle-income countries due to limited
		"production and cost. In 2018, a national flucytosine access programme was"
		initiated in South Africa. We aimed to determine the effectiveness of
		flucytosine-containing induction regimens in routine care to motivate for the
		urgent registration of flucytosine and its inclusion in treatment guidelines.
		"METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we compared outcomes of adults aged 18"
		years and older with incident laboratory-confirmed cryptococcal meningitis
		treated with or without flucytosine-containing regimens at 19 sentinel hospitals
		in South Africa. A case of cryptococcosis was defined as illness in an adult
		with: (1) positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) India ink microscopy; (2) a positive
		CSF cryptococcal antigen test; or (3) culture of Cryptococcus neoformans or
		Cryptococcus gattii from CSF or any other specimen. We excluded patients without
		"a case report form, those with an unknown or negative HIV serology result, those"
		"with a recurrent episode, and those who did not receive antifungal treatment in"
		hospital. We assessed cumulative in-hospital mortality at 14 days and 30 days and
		calculated the overall crude in-hospital case-fatality ratio. We used
		random-effects logistic regression to examine the association between treatment
		"group and in-hospital mortality. FINDINGS: From July 1, 2018, to March 31, 2020,"
		10 668 individuals were diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed cryptococcal
		"meningitis, 7787 cases diagnosed at non-enhanced surveillance sites and 567 cases"
		from eight enhanced surveillance sites with no access to flucytosine were
		excluded. Of 2314 adults with a first episode of cryptococcosis diagnosed at 19
		"facilities with access to flucytosine, 1996 had a case report form and of these,"
		1539 received induction antifungal treatment and were confirmed HIV-seropositive
		"first-episode cases. Of 1539 patients who received antifungal therapy, 596"
		(38·7%) individuals received a flucytosine-containing regimen and 943 (61·3%)
		received another regimen. The median age was 36 years (IQR 32-43) and 906 (58·9%)
		participants were male and 633 (41·1%) were female. The crude in-hospital
		case-fatality ratio was 23·9% (95% CI 20·0-27·0; 143 of 596) in those treated
		with flucytosine-containing regimens and 37·2% (95% CI 34·0-40·0; 351 of 943) in
		those treated with other regimens. Patients admitted to non-academic hospitals
		(adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1·95 [95% CI 1·53-2·48]; p<0·0001) and those who were
		antiretroviral treatment-experienced (aOR 1·30 [1·02-1·67]; p=0·033) were more
		"likely to receive flucytosine. After adjusting for relevant confounders,"
		flucytosine treatment was associated with a 53% reduction in mortality (aOR 0·47
		"[95% CI 0·35-0·64]; p<0·0001). Among survivors, the median length of hospital"
		admission in the flucytosine group was 11 days (IQR 8-15) versus 17 days (13-21)
		in the comparison group (p=0·0010). INTERPRETATION: In-hospital mortality among
		patients treated with a flucytosine-containing regimen was comparable to reduced
		mortality reported in patients receiving a flucytosine-containing regimen in a
		recent multicentre African clinical trial. Flucytosine-based treatment can be
		delivered in routine care in a middle-income country with a substantial survival
		"benefit. FUNDING: National Institute for Communicable Diseases, a Division of the"

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To illustrate three different ophthalmic presentations of cryptococcal
		meningitis (CM). INTRODUCTION: CM is the most common manifestation of
		extra-pulmonary cryptococcosis. Intracranial hypertension occurs in up to 75% of
		patients with CM and is associated with increased mortality. CM can present to
		"the ophthalmologist as vision loss, papilledema, abducens palsy, and/or other"
		"cranial neuropathies. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: We report three cases, two C."
		"neoformans and one C. gattii, highlighting the various CM presentations. The"
		first was a woman immunosuppressed following kidney transplantation in whom
		idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) was initially suspected. The second
		was a man immunocompromised by previously undiagnosed HIV/AIDS who presented with
		signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. The third case is an
		immunocompetent man with bilateral disc edema and an incomplete macular star
		diagnosed with presumed neuroretinitis. Further evaluation revealed positive CSF
		cryptococcal antigen with culture positive for C. gattii. CONCLUSIONS:
		Ophthalmologists should be aware that cryptococcosis can mimic more benign
		"etiologies including IIH and neuroretinitis. Additionally, C. gattii, an emerging"
		"organism, can infect immunocompetent patients. In contrast to the typical"
		"treatment of increased ICP, serial lumbar punctures are recommended while"
		acetazolamide and surgical CSF shunting may be harmful.

		syndrome in three apparently immunocompetent children.
PG	-	943-947
LID	-	10.1111/jpc.14321 [doi]
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Paediatric Cryptococcus gattii disease is rare, with only two"
		previous cases recorded in the Northern Territory (NT) over the last 54 years.
		Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is a recognised complication
		"of C. gattii infection, even in the absence of an identified immunodeficiency"
		"syndrome; however, limited paediatric data exist. We present a series of three"
		paediatric patients treated for C. gattii infection in the NT during 2016/2017.
		CASE DISCUSSIONS: All three cases were males aged 8-13 years at the time of
		"presentation. Two were Aboriginal Australians from remote NT communities, and the"
		third was a Timorese child from a remote district in Timor-Leste. All cases had
		"evidence of brain cryptococcomas, and two had associated pulmonary lesions. Each"
		child was treated with a 6-week induction phase of intravenous liposomal
		amphotericin and flucytosine and then continued on a 2-year course of eradication
		oral fluconazole. Persistent high intracranial pressure (ICP) complicated each
		"case, requiring serial lumbar punctures and, in two cases, insertion of"
		ventriculoperitoneal shunts. All three cases were diagnosed with IRIS between 5
		and 10 weeks after commencement of antifungal treatment and were managed with
		"high-dose corticosteroids, which were weaned slowly (6-20 months"
		"post-commencement). CONCLUSIONS: Paediatric C. gattii disease is rare, although"
		three recent cases in the NT highlight some of the challenges involved in
		"managing the infection, including persistent raised ICP and complications such as"
		IRIS. There is a need for further collaborative research into paediatric C.
		gattii disease.

AB	-	"Nearly one million of cryptococcosis cases occur yearly around the world,"
		involving mainly HIV-infected patients who are not receiving antiretroviral
		therapy (ART) or present poor adherence. This study aims to evaluate
		"epidemiological, clinical and outcome aspects of patients with cryptococcosis"
		"from 1998-2010. Patients were prospectively recruited, and their medical and"
		"laboratory records were reviewed. A total of 131 cases were included, and of"
		"these, 119 (90.83%) had AIDS, 4 received a renal transplant, 2 presented systemic"
		lupus erythematosus and 6 (4.6%) were apparently immunocompetent. Ninety-one
		"(69.46%) were men, and the median age was 38.7 years. Cryptococcal meningitis"
		"(CM) was diagnosed in 103 (78.62%), whereas 28 (21.38%) had cryptococcal"
		"infection in other sites. Of patients with CM, 94 (91.26%) had AIDS being"
		"cryptococcosis the first defining illness in 61 (64.9%), while 37 (60.65%) of"
		"them presented simultaneously both diagnosis. Headache, altered mental status,"
		papilledema and seizures at admission were significatively associated with a poor
		"outcome. Of 163 different isolates, 155 (95.09%) were Cryptococcus neoformans and"
		eight (4.88%) Cryptococcus gattii. Antifungal therapy was warranted in 8 (87.4%)
		"patients with CM, but 46 (51.1%) died during the first days or weeks. Of 28"
		"patients without CM, 21 (75%) received treatment, but 6 (28.6%) died. The poor"
		outcome among this case series was similar to that reported from other developing
		"countries, but it is paradoxal in Brazil where the ART is at free disposal in the"
		"public health services. Despite, at least 60-70% of patients present advanced"
		immunosuppression when they receive the AIDS diagnosis.

AB	-	A 70-year-old immunocompetent male in South Carolina was admitted secondary to
		altered mental status and headache without focal neurological deficits. Head CT
		"was negative. Lumbar puncture (LP) revealed normal glucose, elevated protein, and"
		lymphocytosis. Opening pressure was 15 cm of H20. CSF lateral flow assay was
		negative for cryptococcal antigen; CSF cultures showed no growth. The patient
		"rapidly improved on acyclovir and was diagnosed with presumed viral meningitis,"
		as viral PCR and fungal culture were pending at time of discharge. The patient's
		condition quickly worsened and the patient returned one day later with right arm
		weakness and dysarthria. Brain MRI revealed T2/flair signal abnormalities in the
		left frontal lobe with associated parenchymal enhancement. Repeat LP revealed
		increasing white blood cell count with a worsening lymphocytosis and decreasing
		"glucose, and opening pressure remained normal. CSF fungal culture from the first"
		"admission grew Cryptococcus gattii, and repeated CSF cryptococcal antigen and"
		"culture returned positive. The patient was started on IV steroids, induction"
		"Amphotericin and Fluconazole, followed by maintenance oral Fluconazole. The"
		"patient's clinical course was complicated by a brainstem lacunar infarction,"
		which led to demise. We present this case of Cryptococcus gattii
		"meningoencephalitis to highlight the risk factors, characteristics, and"
		challenges in diagnosis and treatment of an emerging disease in the Southeastern
		United States.

LID	-	ofac146
AB	-	Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is known to play a key
		role in enhancing multiple immune functions that affect response to infectious
		"pathogens including antigen presentation, complement- and antibody-mediated"
		"phagocytosis, microbicidal activity, and neutrophil chemotaxis. Reduced GM-CSF"
		activity and immune response provides a mechanism for increased infection risk
		associated with autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (aPAP) and other
		disorders involving the presence of GM-CSF autoantibodies. We present a case
		series of five patients with persistent or unusual pulmonary and central nervous
		"system opportunistic infections (Cryptococcus gattii, Flavobacterium, Nocardia)"
		"and elevated GM-CSF autoantibody levels, as well as 27 cases identified on"
		systematic review of the literature.

PG	-	e760-6
LID	-	10.1111/j.1439-0507.2011.02018.x [doi]
AB	-	We conducted a retrospective study of 58 cases of cryptococcosis (1986-2008) with
		"urine test positive for Cryptococcus sp, in Mycology Laboratory, Santa"
		"Casa-Hospital Complex, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil. The diagnosis of cryptococcuria"
		was based on microscopic examination and culture of urinary sediment.
		"Cryptococcus was isolated from other clinical specimens such as blood,"
		"cerebrospinal fluid, ascitic and pleural fluids, respiratory secretions, biopsies"
		"of skin, nasal and bone marrow. Cryptocccus neoformans was present in 55 cases"
		and Cryptocccus gattii in three cases. Males predominated (79.3%); age ranged
		from 12 to 86 years. Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) were present in
		"60.3%, 31.1% did not have AIDS and 5.2% were apparently immunocompetent patients."
		The most frequent signs and symptoms were headache (53.4%) and fever (51.7%). The
		most widely used medication was the amphotericin B (43 patients). The mortality
		rate was 45%. We conclude that the mycological examination of the urine can be an
		"alternative simple, non-invasive and useful in diagnosis of disseminated"
		"cryptococcosis, especially when used in conjunction with techniques for"
		demonstration of the capsule (nigrosine) and/or production of melanin in special
		culture media (Staib agar).

AB	-	Cryptococcus gattii is an endemic fungus predominantly isolated in the tropical
		"and subtropical regions, causing predominantly pulmonary disease with a"
		"predilection for the central nervous system. Herein, we report a case of rapidly"
		progressing C. gattii pneumonia in an immune-deficient but virologically
		"suppressed host with underlying human immunodeficiency viral (HIV) infection,"
		exhibiting various fungal morphologies from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)
		cytological specimens. A 51-year-old Chinese male with known HIV disease was
		"admitted to the Singapore General Hospital for evaluation of functional decline,"
		"febrile episodes, and a left hilar mass on chest radiograph. Computed tomography"
		(CT) showed consolidation in the apical segment of the left lower lobe. He
		underwent bronchoscopy and BAL. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography
		done 10 days after the initial CT showed approximate doubling of the pulmonary
		lesion. Cytological examination of the fluid revealed yeasts of varying sizes.
		Subsequent fungal culture from BAL fluid grew C. gattii 10 days later.

		"from approximately 100 fungi, representing about 50 species of pathogens and"
		"commonly encountered saprophytes, was sequenced to develop universal PCR primers"
		and species-specific oligonucleotide probes. Each step in the process of
		detection and identification was standardized to a common set of conditions
		applicable without modification to all fungi of interest and all types of
		clinical specimens. These steps consist of DNA extraction by boiling specimens in
		"an alkaline guanidine-phenol-Tris reagent, amplification of a variable region of"
		"the 28S rRNA gene with universal primers, and amplicon identification by probe"
		hybridization or DNA sequencing performed under conditions identical for all
		fungi. The results obtained by testing a panel of fungal isolates and a variety
		of clinical specimens indicate a high level of specificity.

AB	-	Cryptococcosis is a life-threatening mycosis reported mainly in human adults with
		low frequency in children. High mortality rates may occur in cases with late
		"diagnosis therefore, a timely suspicion of this pathology is important."
		Cryptococcus gattii is the less prevalent species complex predominantly isolated
		from apparently normal hosts. We report a fatal case of neurocryptococcosis in a
		"Colombian minor without known risk factors, in Barranquilla, Colombia. The"
		patient was hospitalized for neurological assessment with a recent history of
		"intense headache, vomiting, anorexia, loss of consciousness, drowsiness,"
		"inability to recognize family members, disorientation, aphasia and anxiety."
		Despite initiating antifungal treatment after isolation of the fungus from
		"cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the patient died early due to his deteriorated"
		condition.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcosis is a severe universally distributed mycosis which
		mainly affects immunocompromised hosts. This mycosis is caused by yeasts of two
		species complex of the genus Cryptococcus: Cryptococcus neoformans and
		Cryptococcus gattii. Meningeal cryptococcosis is the most frequent clinical
		presentation of this disseminated mycosis. The oral mucosa involvement is
		extremely unusual. CASE REPORT: We present a case of cryptococcosis with an
		unusual clinical form. The patient was assisted because she had an ulcerated
		lesion on the lingual mucosa. Encapsulated yeasts compatible with Cryptococcus
		were found in microscopic exams of wet preparations from lingual ulcer clinical
		samples obtained for cytodiagnosis and mycological studies. Cryptococcus
		neoformans (C. neoformans var. grubii VNI) was isolated in culture. This patient
		did not know her condition of HIV seropositive before the appearance of the
		tongue lesion. CONCLUSIONS: The involvement of the oral mucosa is uncommon in
		"this fungal infection, but is important to include it in the differential"
		diagnosis in HIV positive patients.

TI	-	Feline pyothorax: a retrospective study of 27 cases in Australia.
PG	-	211-22
AB	-	Pyothorax was diagnosed in 27 cats between 1983 and 2002. In 21 (78%) of the
		"cases, pleural fluid culture and/or cytology was consistent with a mixed"
		"anaerobic bacterial infection of oropharyngeal origin. In six cases (22%),"
		infection was caused by unusual pathogens or pathogens of non-oropharyngeal
		"origin, including a Mycoplasma species, Cryptococcus gattii, Escherichia coli,"
		Salmonella typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus. The overall mortality rate was
		22%. Treatment was successful in 18 of 19 cases (95%) where closed thoracostomy
		tubes were inserted. One case resolved only after thoracotomy. Actinomyces
		species were isolated in three cases and in contrast to dogs where thoracotomy is
		"recommended, they were resolved with tube thoracostomy. Mechanical complications"
		occurred in 58% of the cats with indwelling chest tubes. Probable mechanisms of
		pleural space infection were identified in 18 cats (67%) including haematogenous
		"infection (n=1), direct inoculation of bacteria into the pleural space (n=1),"
		intrathoracic oesophageal rupture (n=1) and parapneumonic extension of infection
		"(n=15; 56%). Of the latter, perioperative aspiration was suspected in two cats,"
		parasitic migration in two and antecedent upper respiratory tract infection was
		implicated in seven. Parapneumonic spread of infection after colonisation and
		invasion of lung tissue by oropharyngeal flora appears to be the most frequent
		cause of feline anaerobic polymicrobial pyothorax and contests the widespread
		belief that direct inoculation of pleural cavity by bite wounds is more common.

AB	-	A 31-year-old man presented with cryptococcal meningitis (CM) without typical
		"clinical characteristics, but with abnormal walking, difficult leg lifting and"
		frequent falling. He was admitted to Peking Union Medical College Hospital. After
		"multiple tests failed to identify the pathogen, single-cell sequencing (scS) was"
		used to test the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Comparing the sequence obtained from
		"single-cell sequencing with the reference database, it was found that the"
		infection was caused by Cryptococcus gattii sensu stricto (AFLP4/VGI genotype).
		Cryptococcus is difficult to cultivate from complex body fluids. The etiological
		agent of this patient was identified and the patient was treated. This is the
		first case in which scS was used to detect and identify fungal pathogen after
		conventional testing failed to identify the cause of the disease. This report
		demonstrates that the scS approach can be used to generate fungal genome
		sequences directly from the CSF of a CM patient. The scS technology could become
		a powerful tool to precise detect microscopically visible but uncultured
		pathogens in clinical samples.

AB	-	Cryptococcus spp. other than Cryptococcus neoformans or Cryptococcus gattii were
		previously considered saprophytes and thought to be non-pathogenic to humans.
		"However, opportunistic infections associated with non-neoformans and non-gattii"
		"species, such as Cryptococcus laurentii and Cryptococcus albidus, have increased"
		over the past four decades. We experienced a case of cryptococcosis caused by
		non-neoformans and non-gattii spp. in a 47-year-old female with refractory acute
		myeloid leukemia after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The
		patient underwent salvage chemotherapy with fluconazole prophylaxis and
		subsequently developed neutropenic fever with multiple erythematous umbilicated
		papules. A skin biopsy revealed fungal hyphae and repetitive blood cultures
		showed yeast microorganisms that were identified later as C. laurentii by
		Vitek-II®. Skin lesions and fever began to improve with conventional amphotericin
		B therapy. The treatment regimen was continued for 21 days until the disseminated
		cryptococcosis was completely controlled.

		Cryptococcomas: A Novel Disease Complication.
PG	-	24-26
LID	-	10.1097/NRL.0000000000000297 [doi]
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Cryptococcus, a yeast-like fungus, is the most common cause of fungal"
		meningitis worldwide. The Cryptococcus gattii variety is concentrated in
		"Australia has a greater propensity to infect immunocompetent hosts, cause"
		meningitis and form crytococcomas. This case presents a novel disease
		"complication, that is, acute neurological symptoms without seizures, disease"
		progression or reactivation. CASE PRESENTATION: A 58-year-old immunocompetent
		male was brought to the emergency department with dysarthria and right arm
		paraesthesias. Computed tomography of the brain brain and magnetic resonance
		imaging revealed no stroke but found several previously identified crytococcomas
		that demonstrated no interval change. Blood tests and lumbar puncture found only
		a low cryptococcal antigen complex titer (CRAG) (1:10) and a negative cell
		culture. He had remained compliant on his maintenance fluconazole therapy and had
		no immunocompromise or seizure activity. He was initially treated as a relapse of
		cryptococcal disease and restarted on induction therapy but after the cell
		culture returned negative and the symptoms resolved over the following days he
		was reverted back to maintenance therapy. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Central
		"nervous system cryptococcomas are difficult to treat, chronic infections, that in"
		our patient had lasted over 10 years despite treatment compliance. A true
		cryptococcal meningitis relapse is indicated by positive cell cultures in
		previously sterile fluid but cryptococcoma progression is measured by serial
		magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography scans. In the case of
		progression or relapse induction and consolidation therapy should be restarted.
		Our patient demonstrated neither relapse nor progression but presented with a
		novel disease complication of acute fluctuating neurology in chronic stable
		cryptococcomas.

PG	-	29-32
AB	-	Primary cutaneous cryptococcal infection is uncommon. The cutaneous
		manifestations are most often the result of dissemination from the central
		"nervous system or lung, usually in an immunocompromised host; cellulitis is"
		regarded as the rarest cutaneous form. Primary cutaneous cryptococcosis has
		"occasionally been reported in the immunocompetent, the causative organism being"
		Cryptococcus neoformans var. neoformans. We present a case of cellulitis of the
		"right arm in a 75-year-old man caused by Cryptococcus neoformans var. gattii, a"
		fungus which is endemic in Australia and an important cause of infection in the
		immunocompetent. This is the first case described of a primary cutaneous
		infection due to Cryptococcus neoformans var. gattii. The interesting ecology of
		this organism is discussed.

		with cutaneous involvement in an immunocompetent individual. During
		"hospitalization, Cryptococcus gattii was isolated from skin lesions, lung and"
		spinal fluid. The diagnosis of disseminated cryptococcosis was confirmed and
		treatment was established. The patient showed improvement. Due to the probable
		clinical severity of the disease and the possibility that skin lesions may be the
		"first manifestation of this illness, prompt diagnosis must be established and"
		treatment provided.

AB	-	Members of the Cryptococcus gattii species complex are notorious causes of
		"cryptococcosis as they often cause severe, life-threatening infections. Here we"
		describe a case of a severe disseminated C. deuterogattii infection in a
		"previously healthy patient who was initially treated with amphotericin B,"
		"5-fluorocytosine and fluconazole, which led to a good neurological response, but"
		the infection in the lungs remained unaltered and was not completely resolved
		until switching the antifungal therapy to isavuconazole. The infection was likely
		"acquired during a one-month stay at the Azores Islands, Portugal. Environmental"
		"sampling did not yield any cryptococcal isolate; therefore, the source of this"
		apparent autochthonous case could not be determined. Molecular typing showed that
		the cultured C. deuterogattii isolates were closely related to the Vancouver
		Island outbreak-genotype.

TI	-	A prospective descriptive study of cryptococcal meningitis in HIV uninfected
		patients in Vietnam - high prevalence of Cryptococcus neoformans var grubii in
		the absence of underlying disease.
PG	-	199
LID	-	10.1186/1471-2334-10-199 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Most cases of cryptococcal meningitis occur in patients with HIV
		infection: the course and outcome of disease in the apparently immunocompetent is
		much more poorly understood. We describe a cohort of HIV uninfected Vietnamese
		"patients with cryptococcal meningitis in whom underlying disease is uncommon, and"
		relate presenting features of patients and the characteristics of the infecting
		species to outcome. METHODS: A prospective descriptive study of HIV negative
		patients with cryptococcal meningitis based at the Hospital for Tropical
		"Diseases, Ho Chi Minh City. All patients had comprehensive clinical assessment at"
		"baseline, were cared for by a dedicated study team, and were followed up for 2"
		years. Clinical presentation was compared by infecting isolate and outcome.
		RESULTS: 57 patients were studied. Cryptococcus neoformans var grubii molecular
		type VN1 caused 70% of infections; C. gattii accounted for the rest. Most
		"patients did not have underlying disease (81%), and the rate of underlying"
		disease did not differ by infecting species. 11 patients died while in-patients
		(19.3%). Independent predictors of death were age > or = 60 years and a history
		"of convulsions (odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals 8.7 (1 - 76), and 16.1"
		"(1.6 - 161) respectively). Residual visual impairment was common, affecting 25 of"
		46 survivors (54.3%). Infecting species did not influence clinical phenotype or
		outcome. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of flucytosine and amphotericin B
		were significantly higher for C. neoformans var grubii compared with C. gattii (p
		< 0.001 and p = 0.01 respectively). CONCLUSION: In HIV uninfected individuals in
		"Vietnam, cryptococcal meningitis occurs predominantly in people with no clear"
		predisposing factor and is most commonly due to C. neoformans var grubii. The
		rates of mortality and visual loss are high and independent of infecting species.
		There are detectable differences in susceptibility to commonly used antifungal
		"drugs between species, but the clinical significance of this is not clear."

AB	-	The aims of this study are to make a more precise identification of the etiologic
		"agent of a nasal granuloma in a cat, to verify the susceptibility to the"
		"antifungal drugs: ketoconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole, posaconazole,"
		"voriconazole, amphotericin B and the proper treatment. Part of the granuloma's"
		"fragment was removed, added to a saline solution and sent to the Laboratory of"
		"Mycology. The solution was then seeded in Sabouraud dextrose agar, and the yeast"
		was primarily identified by the traditional methods. The confirmation of the
		specie Cryptococcus gattii and its molecular type were performed using the
		PCR-RFLP molecular techniques. The antifungal susceptibility was verified by
		"using the E-test method, and the cat was treated with itraconazole associated"
		with 5-flucytosine. The isolated strain was identified as C. gattii type VGII and
		was susceptible to all antifungal drugs tested. The treatment with itraconazole
		associated with 5-flucytosine led to the cure of granulomatous lesions in the
		feline after 6 months. The characterization and molecular investigation of this
		microorganism are relevant because they could help us better understand the
		epidemiology of the infection and to guide us to treat properly the disease.

		lesions of disseminated cryptococcosis. The radiologic features mimicked those of
		lung cancer metastatic to the central nervous system. C. gattii was recovered
		"from cultures of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, brain biopsy, and blood. The same"
		fungus was recovered from pulmonary and brain specimens at autopsy. Serum and
		cerebrospinal fluid cryptococcal antigen tests were diagnostic in our case and
		should be included in the diagnostic evaluation of unexplained pulmonary and

TI	-	In vivo development of fluconazole resistance in serial Cryptococcus gattii
		isolates from a cat.
PG	-	396-401
LID	-	10.1093/mmy/myw104 [doi]
AB	-	Elevated fluconazole minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) are more frequently
		"observed in Cryptococcus gattii compared to C. neoformans isolates; however, the"
		development of in vivo resistance and the molecular mechanisms responsible have
		not been reported for this species. We report a case of Cryptococcus gattii
		(molecular type VGIII) that developed reduced susceptibility to fluconazole
		during therapy and delineate the molecular mechanisms responsible. Multilocus
		sequence typing and quantitative DNA analysis of the pre- and post-treatment
		isolates was performed using well-characterized methods. Pre- and post-treatment
		"clinical isolates were confirmed isogenic, and no differences in ERG11 or PDR11"
		sequences were found. qPCR found an overexpression of ERG11 and the efflux pump
		PDR11 in the resistant isolate compared to the isolate collected prior to
		initiation of antifungal therapy. Reversion to wild-type susceptibility was
		observed when maintained in antifungal-free media confirming the in vivo
		development of heteroresistance. The in vivo development of heteroresistance to
		fluconazole in our patient with C. gattii is secondary to overexpression of the
		efflux pump PDR11 and the drug target ERG11. Additional work in other clinical
		isolates with elevated fluconazole MICs is warranted to evaluate the frequency of
		heteroresistance versus point mutations as a cause of resistance.

TI	-	Two cases of cutaneous cryptococcosis.
PG	-	238-41
AB	-	We report two cases of cutaneous cryptococcosis in male patients without
		"underlying disease. Case 1 had a granulomatous mass on his right neck, gradually"
		"enlarging for 3 months. After the mass was debrided surgically in a hospital, the"
		incision wound gradually developed into a severe ulceration. Mycological
		examination revealed Cryptococcus neoformans infection. It was significant that
		histopathology of both pre-surgery granuloma and post-surgery ulceration revealed
		thick-walled spores with thick capsule. Chest X-ray revealed a shadow in the left
		"lower lung. After treatment with amphotec for 21 days, the lesion healed. Case 2"
		"had an approximately 2 x 2 cm solitary dull nodule on his right thigh, which had"
		been present for 8 months. Mycological examination confirmed that the lesion was
		caused by C. neoformans. The patient's ratio of peripheral blood CD4(+) cell was
		"slightly reduced. After 14 days of treatment with oral fluconazole, followed by"
		"oral itraconazole for 2 months, mycological and clinical cure were achieved. The"
		two isolates were identified as C. neoformans var. gattii serotype C and C.
		neoformans var. grubii serotype A.

PG	-	108-10
LID	-	10.1002/rcr2.64 [doi]
AB	-	A 41-year-old previously healthy Japanese man complained of cough for 2 months. A
		chest computed tomography scan revealed a mass in his left lung with multiple
		"mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed many small,"
		enhancing lesions. He was admitted to our hospital for further evaluation of an
		abnormal shadow suspicious for metastatic lung cancer. Bronchoscopy showed
		aggregated white nodes in the compressively stenosed left main bronchus. A
		specimen from transbronchial biopsy showed many foamy and yeast-like cells.
		Cultures and additional gene analysis identified these cells as C ryptococcus
		gattii. Antifungal treatment was commenced and his symptoms clearly improved. To
		"our knowledge, this is the first case of an aggressive form of endobronchial"
		cryptococcosis caused by C . gattii.

LID	-	e5851
AB	-	"In 2007, the first confirmed case of Cryptococcus gattii was reported in the"
		"state of North Carolina, USA. An otherwise healthy HIV negative male patient"
		"presented with a large upper thigh cryptococcoma in February, which was"
		surgically removed and the patient was started on long-term high-dose fluconazole
		"treatment. In May of 2007, the patient presented to the Duke University hospital"
		emergency room with seizures. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed two large CNS
		lesions found to be cryptococcomas based on brain biopsy. Prior chest CT imaging
		had revealed small lung nodules indicating that C. gattii spores or desiccated
		yeast were likely inhaled into the lungs and dissemination occurred to both the
		leg and CNS. The patient's travel history included a visit throughout the San
		"Francisco, CA region in September through October of 2006, consistent with"
		acquisition during this time period. Cultures from both the leg and brain
		"biopsies were subjected to analysis. Based on phenotypic and molecular methods,"
		"both isolates were C. gattii, VGI molecular type, and distinct from the Vancouver"
		Island outbreak isolates. Based on multilocus sequence typing of coding and
		"noncoding regions and virulence in a heterologous host model, the leg and brain"
		"isolates are identical, but the two differed in mating fertility. Two clinical"
		"isolates, one from a transplant recipient in San Francisco and the other from"
		"Australia, were identical to the North Carolina clinical isolate at all markers"
		tested. Closely related isolates that differ at only one or a few noncoding
		"markers are present in the Australian environment. Taken together, these findings"
		support a model in which C. gattii VGI was transferred from Australia to
		"California, possibly though an association with its common host plant E."
		"camaldulensis, and the patient was exposed in San Francisco and returned to"
		present with disease in North Carolina.

		Northwest Outbreak Region in an Anti-Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating
		Factor Autoantibody-Positive Patient in the United States.
LID	-	10.1128/mBio.02733-18 [doi]
LID	-	e02733-18
AB	-	"The region encompassing the Pacific Northwest (PNW), Vancouver Island, Oregon,"
		and Washington has been the location of an ongoing Cryptococcus gattii outbreak
		"since the 1990s, and there is evidence that the outbreak is expanding along the"
		"West Coast into California. Here we report a clinical case of a 69-year-old,"
		HIV-negative man from North Carolina who was diagnosed with a fungal brain mass
		by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and pathology. He had traveled to Seattle and
		Vancouver 3 years earlier and to Costa Rica 4 months prior to presentation.
		Phenotypic evidence showed that the fungal mass isolated from the patient's brain
		"represented C. gattii In agreement with the phenotypic results, multilocus"
		sequence typing (MLST) provided genotypic evidence that assigned the infecting
		organism within the C. gattii species complex and to the C. deuterogattii VGIIa
		clade. Whole-genome sequencing revealed >99.99% identity with the C.
		"deuterogattii reference strain R265, indicating that the infecting strain is"
		derived from the highly clonal outbreak strains in the PNW. We conclude that the
		patient acquired the C. gattii infection during his travel to the region 3 years
		prior and that the infection was dormant for an extended period of time before
		causing disease. The patient tested positive for anti-granulocyte-macrophage
		"colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) autoantibodies, supporting earlier reports"
		that implicate these autoantibodies as a risk factor associated with C. gattii
		infection.IMPORTANCE Mortality rates associated with C. gattii infections are
		"estimated to be between 13% and 33%, depending on an individual's predisposition,"
		and C. gattii has caused at least 39 deaths in the PNW region. There have been
		four other international travel cases reported in patients from Europe and Asia
		"with travel history to the PNW, but this report describes the first North"
		American traveler who acquired C. deuterogattii infection presenting within the
		United States and the first case of a C. deuterogattii outbreak infection
		associated with anti-GM-CSF autoantibodies. Early and accurate diagnoses are
		important for disease prevention and treatment and for control of infectious
		diseases. Continual reporting of C. deuterogattii infections is necessary to
		raise awareness of the ongoing outbreak in the PNW and to alert travelers and
		physicians to the areas of endemicity with potential risks.

		immunocompetent hosts.
PG	-	151-3
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Meningitis continues to be one of the most important infections
		diagnosed and treated by emergency physicians. Despite the advent of
		"anti-infective therapy, meningitis carries a mortality rate of 20%-40%. In this"
		"study, we describe the first reported emergency medicine case of meningitis"
		"associated with Cryptococcus gattii to alert providers of this insidious,"
		emerging global pathogen infecting immunocompetent individuals. METHODS: We
		provided a case report and accompanying review of the literature. A MEDLINE
		search for the term Cryptoccocus gattii was performed to obtain background
		"information on Cryptococcus gattii. RESULTS: After two months of hospitalization,"
		the patient was eventually discharged neurologically intact except for a
		continued mild bilateral hearing deficit. CONCLUSION: Cryptococcus gattii is an
		"emerging world pathogen, which affects otherwise healthy, immunocompetent"
		patients and requires timely identification and treatment in order to prevent
		severe neurological sequelae.

AB	-	Cryptococcus neoformans variety gattii (C. gattii) causes infection in
		predominantly immunocompetent individuals. The majority of cases present with
		headache due to meningitis and its natural history normally follows an indolent
		course. We report a fatal case of fulminant cryptococcaemia culminating in severe
		intracranial hypertension due to C. gattii. Such cases of fulminant disease are
		rare and highlight a number of important therapeutic and diagnostic
		"considerations. We discuss the atypical nature of this patient's illness, the"
		major complications of C. gattii meningitis and the role of computed tomography
		(CT) in preventing serious sequelae from lumbar puncture. The management of
		intracranial hypertension (ICH) in critically ill patients is also reviewed.

		cryptococcosis in a HIV-infected patient.
LID	-	10.7196/AJTCCM.2019.v25i4.002 [doi]
AB	-	Pulmonary cryptococcosis is a fungal infection caused by inhalation of
		Cryptococcus gattii and/or C. neoformans spores. It mostly affects HIV-infected
		patients. This is a case report of a severely immunocompromised HIV-infected
		"patient, presenting with respiratory symptoms and atypical chest X-ray features"
		for pulmonary cryptococcosis. A serum cryptococcal latex antigen test is positive
		in a majority of HIV-infected patients with pulmonary cryptococcosis. This case
		report demonstrates the occurrence of a false negative serum cryptococcal latex
		"antigen test, becoming positive with the development of an unmasking immune"
		reconstitution syndrome (after antiretroviral therapy was commenced). This also
		resulted in the characteristic cryptococcal lung cavities observed on computed
		tomography chest images. Duration of fluconazole therapy should be
		"individualised, and serial chest imaging (e.g. chest X-ray) should be performed"
		to monitor treatment response.

LID	-	10.1111/vec.13156 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To describe acute cerebral compression caused by an epidural hematoma
		(EDH) in a dog with cryptococcal infection. CASE SUMMARY: An 18-month-old
		neutered male Neapolitan Mastiff was found comatose with no preceding clinical
		signs apart from a mild forelimb lameness. A CT scan of the head revealed a
		lesion within the right caudal nasal cavity that traversed the cribriform plate
		in addition to a right epidural lesion resulting in compression of the right
		"cerebrum. Assessment of brain death was made based on the presence of coma,"
		"apnea, and absence of brain stem reflexes and included assessment of the"
		vestibulo-ocular reflex. Postmortem identified a large EDH causing marked
		compression of the right frontal lobe. A nasal biopsy cultured Cryptococcus
		gattii. NEW OR UNIQUE INFORMATION PROVIDED: EDH formation in a dog secondary to
		cryptococcosis has not been previously reported. This is also the first time a
		caloric vestibulo-ocular reflex assessment has been reported in a dog.

		microbiological control. PIIRS can cause substantial immune-mediated damage to

		death. Steroids have been used successfully in the management of PIIRS in adults.
		"In this report, we present the case of a previously healthy adolescent male with"
		Cryptococcus gattii meningitis who experienced neurological deterioration due to
		PIIRS after the initiation of antifungal therapy. Immunological workup did not
		"demonstrate any frank underlying immunodeficiencies, and genetic primary"
		immunodeficiency screening was unremarkable. He was treated with steroids and
		"recovered clinically; however, intermittent inflammatory episodes needed to be"
		managed through several flares of symptoms. In the setting of the current
		"literature, we discuss the management and monitoring of PIIRS in a pediatric"
		"patient, along with considerations of targeted future therapies."

LID	-	10.1136/bcr-2015-210250 [doi]
LID	-	bcr2015210250
AB	-	Disseminated cryptococcosis is uncommon and almost always occurs in HIV-infected
		"patients. However, cryptococcosis can also be found in patients of organ"
		"transplantation, in those on disease modifying agents for rheumatological"
		conditions and in patients with underlying immunodeficiency. Cryptococcal

		"usually Cryptococcus gattii, and not C. neoformans. However, disseminated"
		"disease, especially cerebral involvement in the form of primary intraventricular"
		"haemorrhage, is exceedingly rare. We report a case of disseminated cryptococcosis"
		"with cutaneous, cerebral and bone marrow involvement in an HIV-negative,"
		apparently immunocompetent patient. Although the patient did not have the usual
		"immunocompromising diseases, there were clinical signs possibly indicating a"
		weakened immune system. This report highlights the need for awareness of
		disseminated cryptococcosis among patients with no apparent immunocompromising
		conditions.

TI	-	First reported case of cellulitis due to Cryptococcus gattii in lung
		transplantation recipient: a case report.
PG	-	20395
AB	-	Cryptococcus gattii are closely related species of encapsulated yeast-like fungi
		"involved in the etiology of cryptococcosis, especially in immunocompetent"
		individuals. Dissemination with involvement of many organ systems is common. On
		"the other hand, cellulitis in an immunossupressed patient caused by C. gattii is"
		rare. We present a case of disseminated disease caused by Cryptococcus gattii in
		a lung transplant recipient who manifested cellulitis. The disease was also
		complicated by a lung carcinoma. We emphasize that cryptococcal cellulitis
		related to C. gattii in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients should be
		considered in the differential diagnosis of acute bacterial skin infections.

TI	-	Ferrets as sentinels of the presence of pathogenic Cryptococcus species in the
		Mediterranean environment.
PG	-	145-51
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-014-9773-1 [doi]
AB	-	Cryptococcus gattii is a pathogenic environmental yeast that is considered to be
		emerging in different areas of the world including the Mediterranean Basin.
		"Exposure to infection might be more likely in animals than in human beings, given"
		"their closer relationship with the natural habitat of the yeast, vegetation and"
		"soil. Thus, animals, and especially pets, can act as indicators of the presence"
		of this yeast in a determined area. Domestic ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) have
		become common pets in the past 10-20 years. Their natural behavior of sniffing
		around and going inside narrow spaces makes them prone to contact with decaying
		"organic matter and soil, the substrate for Cryptococcus species. This study"
		describes two cases of cryptococcosis in ferrets in the Iberian Peninsula and
		Balearic Islands and documents a relationship of ferret cryptococcosis with
		"environmental isolates in the same locations. Here, we emphasize the importance"
		of how an adequate identification and environmental search of the yeast leads to
		a better understanding of the epidemiology of cryptococcosis and suggests ferrets
		may act as sentinels for this fungal disease.

PG	-	399-406
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-017-0215-8 [doi]
AB	-	We report the two first cases of human C. gattii meningoencephalitis acquired on
		"the Canadian east coast, from the province of Quebec. Unlike C. neoformans, C."
		gattii is not known to have an established ecological niche on the North American
		east coast. C. gattii has recently been responsible for major outbreaks in
		"British Columbia, Canada, and in the American pacific northwest. However, no"
		human cases acquired in other Canadian provinces have been reported to our
		knowledge. The source of acquisition remains unclear for both patients but since
		"neither had traveled outside of the province of Quebec, we discuss the"
		"possibilities of environmental and animal-associated acquisition, as well as the"
		possible established endemicity in new areas. These cases add to the growing
		reported human and animal cases in areas previously not thought to be endemic for
		C. gattii.

		grubii.
PG	-	93-98
LID	-	10.2147/VMRR.S35490 [doi]
AB	-	Although cryptococcosis is usually associated with respiratory and neurologic
		"signs in domestic species (such as sneeze, cough, nasal discharge, seizures,"
		"ataxia), clinical manifestations of the disease may be more subtle and"
		nonspecific. A 3-year-old male castrated Boxer dog presented with a history of
		"chronic vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, and lethargy. At no time had respiratory"
		or neurologic signs been noted by the owners or the primary care veterinarian.
		Palpation of an abdominal mass revealed an atypical lesion location: a large (16
		× 9 × 7 cm) mass at the root of the mesentery. Diagnosis was achieved through
		cytology of this mass and a positive serologic Cryptococcus capsular antigen
		titer; polymerase chain reaction was utilized for speciation of the abdominal
		isolate as Cryptococcus neoformans variety grubii. The animal was euthanized due
		"to poor prognosis. After necropsy and histopathologic analysis, the mesenteric"
		mass and associated lymph nodes were identified as large fungal granulomas. This
		"is a rare manifestation of cryptococcosis, involving several visceral organs,"
		with no remaining evidence of the route of entry of the organism. As prompt
		"diagnosis of mycotic illness is paramount to successful management, this case"
		indicates that cryptococcal infection should be considered as a differential
		diagnosis in dogs with gastrointestinal signs and lymphadenopathy. The protean
		nature of cryptococcosis is discussed within the context of a brief review of
		emerging and unresolved issues in pathogenesis.

AB	-	We describe a case of central venous catheter-related fungemia caused by
		"Cryptococcus liquefaciens, a non-neoformans and non-gattii Cryptococcus, in a"
		non-HIV patient. A 71-year-old man with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma receiving
		antineoplastic chemotherapy was febrile approximately 30 weeks after central
		"venous port insertion, and C. liquefaciens was isolated from all three performed"
		blood cultures as well as a central venous catheter tip culture. In vitro
		antifungal susceptibility tests showed that this yeast isolate was susceptible to
		"low concentrations of amphotericin B, fluconazole, itraconazole and voriconazole"
		"yet was resistant to 5-fluorocytosine (MIC: >64 μg/ml), unlike Cryptococcus"
		neoformans. Treatment of the patient with oral and intravenous voriconazole was
		effective and consistent with the susceptibility tests. Although non-neoformans
		and non-gattii Cryptococcus spp. are considered non-pathogenic environmental
		"yeast, they may rarely be the causative agents of serious infections in humans,"
		as in the present case.

		"CSF from a HIV-seronegative, apparently immunocompetent, Thai patient with C."
		"gattii meningitis, over the first 2 weeks of antifungal therapy. Levels of"

		suggest in this case a maladapted immune response to cryptococcal exposure had
		allowed progression to clinical cryptococcal disease.

		caused by the inhalation of dehydrated yeasts or basidiospores. The causative
		agents are C. gattii and C. neoformans. The latter is more commonly associated
		with cellular immunodeficiency and is not rare in patients with Acquired
		Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). Cryptococcosis is common in pregnant women with
		"AIDS; however, it is uncommon for the placenta to be affected, with few reported"
		cases in the literature. We present the case of a pregnant woman with AIDS who
		"had placental and pulmonary cryptococcosis associated with fungemia, with a"
		satisfactory clinical outcome obtained after therapy.

AB	-	Cryptococcus gattii causes a form of endemic mycosis that most commonly affects
		the lungs and central nervous system of immunocompetent patients living in
		tropical and subtropical areas of the world. Case report. A 66-year-old man who
		had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease without HIV infection and had been on
		systemic corticotherapy for several years developed extensive ulceration of the
		"left forearm that was associated with ipsilateral supraclavicular adenomegaly,"
		consequent to infection with Cryptococcus gattii. The patient was treated with
		"fluconazole 400mg/day for eight months, which led to complete healing of the"
		"lesion. This case emphasizes that, although rare, C. gattii may cause"
		opportunistic cutaneous-lymphatic infection in patients living in the
		southeastern region of Brazil who are immunocompromised through chronic
		corticotherapy.

TI	-	Cryptococcoma of a transplanted kidney in a patient presenting with recurrent
		urinary tract infection: a case report.
PG	-	94
LID	-	10.1186/s12882-018-0891-8 [doi]
LID	-	94
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cryptococcosis is an important opportunistic infection of organ
		transplant recipients. It is the third most common fungal infection of transplant
		patients and occurs especially in kidney recipients. Cryptococcus neoformans is a
		ubiquitous fungus which infects humans by inhalation of spores. C. gattii has
		more recently been recognised as a pathogen. Infection commonly is disseminated
		"affecting mainly the central nervous system and the lungs. Cryptococcoma, a"
		"localised form of the disease, has been described in various organs. We present a"
		unique case of a cryptococcoma in a transplanted kidney. The lesion was not seen
		on ultrasound or uncontrasted computerised tomography but was detected by
		FDG-PET/CT. CASE PRESENTATION: A 30 year old woman received a deceased donor
		"kidney transplant in 2005. Due to chronic allograft nephropathy in 2014,"
		cyclosporine and azathioprine immunosuppression was changed to tacrolimus and
		mycophenolate. After rapid deterioration of renal function in 2015 due to
		"suspected non-adherence to immunosuppressants, steroid pulses were administered."
		The patient developed severe recurrent bacterial urinary tract infections and
		demonstrated several features of severe immunosuppression. She was treated for
		cytomegalovirus infection and BK virus was demonstrated in the urine. In
		"addition, Kaposi sarcoma of the stomach was diagnosed on endoscopic biopsy. A"
		metabolically-active lesion of the kidney transplant was imaged on FDG-PET/CT
		scan. Biopsy of the lesion demonstrated infection with cryptococcus. Escherichia
		coli with the same antibiotic sensitivity spectrum as that in the urine was
		cultured from the biopsy. Cryptococcus was not cultured from urine at that time
		or from several subsequent specimens. The lesion was not detected by conventional
		imaging. The patient manifested no other evidence of cryptococcosis. The lesion
		responded poorly to treatment with fluconazole. CONCLUSIONS: This is probably the
		first report of a case of a cryptococcoma in a transplanted organ. FDG-PET/CT
		"scan, which is dependent on cellular metabolism, proved useful in visualising the"
		lesion. Clinicians should be aware of this rare presentation of cryptococcosis in
		organ transplant recipients.

AB	-	We report three cases of meningo-encephalitis caused by Cryptococcous neoformans
		var. gattii in apparently immunocompetent children presenting to a provincial
		hospital in Papua New Guinea (PNG) over a nine-month period. After a postmortem
		"diagnosis was made in the first case, a further two were identified quickly using"
		Indian ink staining of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The second case had a
		complicated course and recovered after relapse. The third made a full recovery
		with appropriate antifungal therapy. Despite the fact that an environmental
		"reservoir has not been established, cryptococcal meningo-encephalitis occurs"
		"regularly in PNG. In developing countries such as PNG, a lack of laboratory"
		resources and limited therapeutic options can complicate the management of severe
		"infections such as cryptococcosis. Nevertheless, with inexpensive diagnostic"
		"tests (such as Indian ink staining of CSF), a high index of suspicion and a"
		"pragmatic approach to antifungal therapy, good therapeutic outcomes can be"
		achieved.

PG	-	721-4
AB	-	We describe the first case of cryptococcosis caused by Cryptococcus neoformans
		var. gattii in a male Atlantic bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus). The
		"dolphin showed clinical signs of tachypnea, transient dyspnea, and mild"
		"tachycardia and developed multiple hyperechoic nodules, parenchymal"
		"consolidation, and thickening of pleura. A diagnosis of bronchopneumonia with"
		"pleuritis was made. Itraconazole therapy was implemented for 120 days, and trough"
		levels in serum were within or above the suggested therapeutic range. Titers of
		"cryptococcal antigen in serum increased eightfold during therapy, and the case"
		had a fatal outcome. Necropsy examination findings included enlarged pulmonary
		lymph nodes and extensive coalescing granulomatous lesions throughout both lungs.
		"Histologic examination revealed numerous, spherical to ellipsoidal,"
		"mucicarmine-positive, 3- to 14-microm, encapsulated, budding cells consistent"
		with C. neoformans. Culture of the lung tissue yielded colonies of C. neoformans.
		The isolate was urease positive and nitrate negative and exhibited phenoloxidase
		activity. It was positive on canavanine-glycine-bromothymol blue agar. When
		"tested by the Iatron serodiagnostic reagent kit (Iatron Laboratories, Inc.), it"
		was shown to belong to serotype B.

TI	-	Symptomatic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in Papua New Guinea.
PG	-	783-8
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection was first detected in
		Papua New Guinea (PNG) in 1987. By August 1995 a total of 323 persons had been
		diagnosed as HIV antibody positive nationwide and seroprevalence rates were
		climbing. This study was prompted by a lack of data on the clinical syndromes
		associated with HIV infection in Melanesian adults. AIMS: To describe the
		clinical and epidemiological features of symptomatic HIV infection in adult
		Melanesians. METHODS: A largely retrospective study of patients was admitted to
		the medical wards of the Port Moresby general hospital between January 1990 and
		September 1995. Clinical records of patients with antibody to HIV were studied
		"and clinical, laboratory and epidemiological data were recorded. RESULTS: Seventy"
		"patients were studied and the majority were young, urban dwelling adults from a"
		variety of social groups. The sex distribution was even. Common clinical
		"syndromes associated with HIV infection were chronic diarrhoea (47.8%), wasting"
		(94.2%) and oropharyngeal candidiasis (68.7%). Tuberculosis was suspected in
		68.6% and cryptococcal meningitis was detected in 8.6% including one patient with
		Cryptococcus. neoformans var. gattii infection. There was a high mortality (53%)
		in patients admitted to hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with HIV infection in PNG
		present to hospital late in their disease course. Clinical syndromes are similar
		to those observed in Africa and mortality on first admission is high. The major
		mode of transmission is heterosexual and sexually transmitted diseases and
		promiscuity are probably important factors in facilitating spread.

TI	-	Cryptococcosis in ferrets: a diverse spectrum of clinical disease.
PG	-	749-55
AB	-	Cryptococcosis was diagnosed in seven ferrets (five from Australia; two from
		western Canada) displaying a wide range of clinical signs. Two of the ferrets
		lived together. One (5-years-old) had cryptococcal rhinitis and presented when
		the infection spread to the nasal bridge. Its sibling developed cryptococcal
		"abscessation of the right retropharyngeal lymph node 12 months later, soon after"
		developing a severe skin condition. DNA fingerprinting and microsatellite
		analysis demonstrated that the two strains isolated from these siblings were
		indistinguishable. Two ferrets (2- to 3-years-old) developed generalised
		"cryptococcosis: one had primary lower respiratory tract disease with pneumonia,"
		"pleurisy and mediastinal lymph node involvement, while in the other a segment of"
		intestine was the primary focus of infection with subsequent spread to mesenteric
		"lymph nodes, liver and lung. The remaining three ferrets (1.75 to 4-years-old)"
		"had localised disease of a distal limb, in one case with spread to the regional"
		lymph node. Cryptococcus bacillisporus (formerly C. neoformans var gattii)
		accounted for three of the four infections in Australian ferrets where the
		biotype could be determined. The Australian ferret with intestinal involvement
		and the two ferrets from Vancouver had C. neoformans var grubii infections.

		"exposure on Vancouver Island, Canada. Diagnosis was based on cerebrospinal fluid"
		"(CSF) examination, i.e., positive India-ink staining, positive latex particle"
		"agglutination, and positive culture. Species identification was performed by"
		growth on L-canavanine-glycine-bromthymol blue medium and by sequencing of the
		intergenic and internal transcribed spacer regions of the rRNA genes. After
		"initial therapy with fluconazole by which the patient did not improve, therapy"
		was changed to amphotericin B and flucytosine and later to high-dose fluconazole
		"and amphotericin B. Despite long-term treatment and external drainage of the CSF,"
		the patient's condition improved only slowly. The patient was discharged after
		132 days of hospitalization.

		cryptococcosis.
PG	-	619-23
LID	-	10.2146/ajhp070203 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: A case of torsades de pointes associated with fluconazole use is
		described. SUMMARY: A 68-year-old woman with a history of hypertension treated
		with 2.5 mg of indapamide for 16 months sought medical treatment after having two
		falls 1 month apart. A computed tomography scan and subsequent magnetic resonance
		imaging of the brain revealed a lesion in the left pons and middle cerebellar
		peduncle. Biopsy of the pontine lesion revealed large yeast forms and
		subsequently revealed Cryptococcus neoformans var. gattii. The patient was
		initially treated with conventional amphotericin B and flucytosine for six weeks.
		"The first week of therapy was complicated by hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and an"
		"episode of atrial fibrillation that was managed with electrolyte replacement,"
		"commencement of metoprolol, and switching from conventional amphotericin B to"
		"amphotericin B lipid complex. After six weeks, liposomal amphotericin was"
		discontinued and high-dose oral fluconazole was initiated. Six days after
		"beginning fluconazole therapy, the patient had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure"
		"and suffered cardiopulmonary arrest. Postresuscitation, an electrocardiogram"
		demonstrated a corrected Q-T interval of 556 msec. Recurrent episodes of torsades
		de pointes were also recorded postarrest. Fluconazole was discontinued at this
		"time, and liposomal amphotericin B was resumed. Neurologic and"
		electroencephalographic assessment conducted 48 hours postarrest revealed that
		"significant neurologic damage had been sustained. Supportive care was withdrawn,"
		and the patient died two days later. A postmortem examination revealed no
		coronary artery disease or hemorrhagic transformation of the pontine
		cryptococcoma. CONCLUSION: Treatment with high-dose fluconazole was the probable
		cause of torsades de pointes in a patient with risk factors for this condition.
		The benefits and risks of using fluconazole should be carefully weighed for
		patients with risk factors for Q-T interval prolongation.

TI	-	Cryptococcosis in a North Island brown kiwi (Apteryx australis mantelli) in New
		Zealand.
PG	-	305-9
AB	-	A case of disseminated cryptococcosis in a North Island kiwi (Apteryx australis
		mantelli) caused by Cryptococcus neoformans var. gattii (serotype B) is reported.
		This is the first case of cryptococcosis to be reported in a kiwi and is also the
		first isolation of C. neoformans var. gattii from a veterinary source in New
		Zealand. The kiwi is an example of a ratite bird and as such has a lower body
		"temperature approximating that of a mammal. As a consequence, the kiwi and other"
		ratitis (e.g. emus) would be expected to show an increased susceptibility to
		cryptococcosis compared with other birds. There has been only one other isolate
		of this variety of C. neoformans in New Zealand and this was isolated from the
		sputum of a human male with leukaemia who was from the Gisborne area of the North
		"Island, a region adjacent to Hawkes Bay where the case of kiwi cryptococcosis"
		"occurred. Some months prior to the development of the infection in the bird, a"
		mulch of Eucalyptus leaves/twigs had been spread throughout the kiwi enclosure
		and this is considered to have been the probable source of the yeast. Neither
		Eucalyptus camaldulensis nor Eucalyptus tereticornis were among the species from
		which the mulch material originated and it is suggested another species may be
		the environmental host(s) of C. neoformans var. gattii in New Zealand.

AB	-	We analyzed the data collected during a nationwide survey of cryptococcosis
		(1985-1993). We first checked the quality of the survey. The stability of its
		completeness (approximately 50%) and its representativity were assessed by the
		capture-recapture method after we cross-checked our data on cryptococcosis (as a
		presenting manifestation of AIDS) against those of the national registry of AIDS.
		"Of the 1,057 cases of cryptococcosis (1,013 patients), 827 (86%) involved"
		patients with AIDS. The increasing number of cases of human immunodeficiency
		virus (HIV)-related cryptococcosis over time paralleled the AIDS epidemic except
		"for a higher male-to-female ratio. Malignancies (32%), organ transplantation"
		"(19%), and corticosteroid therapy (33%) were the main predisposing conditions in"
		163 patients without AIDS. Cryptococcal meningitis more frequently occurred in
		patients with AIDS than in HIV-negative patients (P < 10(-6)). Among the 413
		"isolates available for serotyping, 410 were Cryptococcus neoformans variety"
		neoformans (including 20.5% of serotype D). Three isolates of the variety gattii
		(serotype B) were recovered from patients without AIDS.

PG	-	824-829
LID	-	10.1016/j.radcr.2022.11.011 [doi]
AB	-	Cryptococcosis has been recognized as an increasing cause of severe systemic
		mycosis in immunocompetent patients in the last few years. Cerebral
		"cryptococcomas are a more uncommon manifestation of cryptococcal meningitis,"
		which are not usually included in the differential of brain masses. We report a
		"case of a young, immunocompetent woman that rapidly developed severe neurological"
		deficits. She was ultimately diagnosed with cerebral cryptococcoma caused by both
		"Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii, and was treated with"
		amphotericin B and isavuconazole. After several complications during
		"hospitalization, including hydrocephalus and cerebellitis, she was discharged"
		"home on isavuconazole. On follow-up, she only complained of anosmia. We review"
		the clinical and radiological findings of similar cases. It is the first time
		that this form of cryptococcal meningitis is favorably treated with isavuconazole
		and is caused by 2 species of Cryptococcus. We emphasize that cerebral
		cryptococcomas should be suspected in immunocompetent patients that present with
		brain masses.

PG	-	423-8
AB	-	"In Papua New Guinea, Cryptococcus neoformans var. gattii meningitis has a high"
		fatality rate even in immunocompetent patients. Our retrospective study attempted
		"to identify marker of poor prognosis. Of 88 immunocompetent patients, 30 (34.1%)"
		"died, usually soon after admission, and mortality was higher in men (p = 0.025)"
		and older patients (p = 0.039). Death was associated with altered consciousness
		"(p < 0.001), a history of convulsions prior to treatment (p = 0.002) and a"
		maximum systolic blood pressure of > 150 mmHg (p = 0.017). These data suggest
		that death results from raised intracranial pressure and subsequent tentorial
		"herniation. However, CSF opening pressure measured on admission was raised in"
		"29/36 (81%) patients and did not predict outcome. In survivors, relapse was"
		"uncommon and was not predicted by discharge serum cryptococcal antigen titres,"
		which were frequently raised on completion of therapy in asymptomatic patients.
		Mortality may be reduced if efforts are made to lower intracranial pressure in
		those patients who present with markers of poor prognosis.

		cryptococcoma and meningitis.
PG	-	301-6
AB	-	"A patient who lived in Ohio, U.S.A., developed a large pulmonary cryptococcoma"
		and meningitis as the result of infection with Cryptococcus neoformans var.
		"gattii, an organism of subtropical and tropical distribution. He had no obvious"
		predisposing illness or condition associated with increased susceptibility to
		"cryptococcosis. Although he was found to have cutaneous anergy, his lymphocytes"
		showed significant transformation responses in vitro when cultured both with
		mitogens and with killed cryptococci. The meningitis responded to intrathecal
		"amphotericin B. The cryptococcoma, however, did not resolve in response to"
		"vigorous antifungal therapy during a period of more than 4 months. Eventually,"
		the cryptococcoma was surgically removed. This case is unusual both for the
		finding of C. neoformans var. gattii outside its apparent endemic area as well as
		for the clinical features of the disease.

		a cerebrospinal fluid culture through assimilation of D-proline and D-tryptophan
		"as the single nitrogen source. Initially, the patient received intravenous"
		antifungal therapy with amphotericin B. The patient was discharged 29 days after
		hospitalization and continued with oral fluconazole treatment for ten weeks.
		"During this period, the patient showed clinical improvement with slight"
		"right-side residual weakness. Through this case report, we confirm the existence"
		of this microorganism as an infectious agent in Peru.

PG	-	1241-4
AB	-	Cryptococcus neoformans (C. neoformans) var. gattii infection usually occurs in
		"tropical and subtropical areas, and rarely in the northern hemisphere. We report"
		the first Japanese with cryptococcal meningoencephalitis caused by C. neoformans
		var. gattii infection that occurred during a trip to Australia. This agent was
		identified in a cerebellar biopsy specimen by immunohistochemical technique with
		serotype-specific anti-sera. Because the meningitis caused by it did not respond
		"well to conventional therapy, we used an aggressive therapeutic regimen to"
		successfully treat the patient. Even in areas where C. neoformans var. gattii
		"does not exist, this infection should be considered possible as a travel-related"
		infection.

TI	-	First report of Cryptococcus neoformans var. gattii serotype B from Greece.
PG	-	419-22
AB	-	A plethora of cases of Cryptococcus neoformans infections have been recorded
		worldwide in immunocompromised individuals. The number of such cases showed a
		steady rise before 1981 and increased dramatically thereafter due to the AIDS
		"epidemic. A similar pattern has been seen in Greece but, so far, infections"
		appear to have been caused by C. neoformans var. neoformans. This paper describes
		for the first time two culture-proven C. n. var. gattii serotype B infections in
		"Greece, one in an AIDS patient and one in a patient with systemic lupus"
		erythematosus.

TI	-	Paradoxical inflammatory reaction during treatment of Cryptococcus neoformans
		var. gattii meningitis in an HIV-seronegative woman.
PG	-	e78-82
AB	-	A human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seronegative woman was admitted to the
		hospital with postpartum onset Cryptococcus neoformans var. gattii meningitis and
		markedly increased intracranial pressure. A poor initial response to antifungal
		"therapy was followed, 2 months after hospital admission, by severe acute"
		meningeal and cerebral inflammation and clearance of yeast cells from
		cerebrospinal fluid. This first reported case of paradoxical inflammatory
		reaction to C. neoformans illustrates important aspects of the host-pathogen
		interaction and highlights possible effects of immunomodulatory therapies.

TI	-	Peripheral vestibular disease associated with cryptococcosis in three cats.
PG	-	29-34
AB	-	Peripheral vestibular disease referable to otitis media/interna was the main
		"reason for presentation in three cats with cryptococcosis. In two cats,"
		Cryptococcus neoformans var neoformans was isolated from the tympanic bulla. In
		"the remaining cat, otitis media/interna was considered to be secondary to"
		occlusion of the auditory tube by a nasopharyngeal granuloma associated with a C
		neoformans var gattii infection. This report emphasises the importance of
		maintaining an index of suspicion for a fungal aetiology in cats with signs of
		"otitis media/interna, particularly in countries with a high prevalence of"
		cryptococcosis. The presence of C neoformans may be overlooked with potentially
		fatal consequences where only standard methods for bacterial isolation are used
		to examine samples obtained from the middle ear.

AB	-	A case of meningitis due to Cryptococcus neoformans var. gattii coincident with
		disseminated Nocardia transvalensis infection is reported. Nocardia infection
		initially progressed despite high-dose antimicrobial therapy. Although a specific
		"immunologic defect could not be defined, in vitro lymphocyte proliferation in"
		response to stimulation with the Nocardia isolate was reduced. It is proposed
		that coinfection with Cryptococcus neoformans may have contributed to the

PG	-	405-9
AB	-	We describe a case of meningitis due to Cryptococcus neoformans var gattii in an
		AIDS patient. The reasons for the observed predominance of C. neoformans var
		neoformans infections in AIDS patients living in areas endemic for the gattii
		variety are not understood thus far. Treatment with fluconazole resulted in poor
		clinical and mycological response. In vitro sensitivity testing of the fungus
		"revealed high minimal inhibitory concentrations, suggesting fluconazole"
		resistance. Treatment with amphotericin B was successful.
