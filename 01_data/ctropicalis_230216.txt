AB	-	BACKGROUND: The oral mucosa is likely to be compromised by acquired systemic
		disease. There are no data available on the prevalence of oral candidiasis and
		"the species distribution among patients with oral mucosal diseases. Therefore, it"
		is necessary to conduct a study assessing the characterization of oral
		candidiasis and the species profiles in such patients. METHODS: Over a period of
		"four consecutive years, patients with oral mucosal diseases were screened for"
		oral candidiasis by a combination of clinical presentation and laboratory
		"findings (smear test and Candida cultures). In addition, Candida species were"
		"isolated and identified for further analysis. RESULTS: In total, 9769 (6.09%) of"
		"the 160,357 patients screened were diagnosed with oral candidiasis on the basis"
		of both clinical manifestations and laboratory testing. The ratio of females to
		"males was 1:0.61, and females had higher overall infection rates than males in"
		"all age subgroups. Patients with HIV infection, anaemia-related stomatitis,"
		"Sjögren's syndrome/xerostomia, pemphigoid, and radiation-induced stomatitis were"
		"highly susceptible to oral candidiasis. Of the 11,161 isolated Candida strains,"
		"C. albicans remained the most common species (75.37%), followed by C. tropicalis"
		"(6.06%), C. krusei (2.79%), and C. glabrata (2.02%). Surprisingly, both the"
		proportion and the number of C. glabrata isolates increased dramatically over the
		"4 consecutive years. CONCLUSIONS: In this large-scale population-based study, the"
		features of oral candidiasis prevalence and the species profile among patients
		with oral mucosal diseases were summarized. The information gleaned will enhance
		the understanding of and improve management strategies for oral candidiasis and
		the underlying systemic and oral conditions.

		antifungal susceptibility pattern.
PG	-	3292-3303
LID	-	10.1111/jog.15442 [doi]
AB	-	"AIM: Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), is a common fungal infection that remains a"
		global concern. The objectives of this study were molecular identification and
		"assessment of the antifungal susceptibility profile of Candida species, causing"
		VVC in southeast Iran. METHODS: A cross-sectional investigation was carried out
		on 119 nonpregnant females suspected of VVC between February 2019 and May 2021.
		Yeast samples were characterized to the species level by conventional and
		molecular methods. All Candida isolates were examined for in vitro susceptibility
		profile to six conventional antifungal drugs using Clinical and Laboratory
		"Standards Institute guidelines. RESULTS: Out of 119 subjects, 52 (43.7%) cases"
		"were affected by VVC, out of whom 11 (21.15%) cases had recurrent vulvovaginal"
		candidiasis (RVVC). The species distribution was as follows; Candida albicans
		"(n = 21; 40.4%), C. glabrata (n = 11; 21.2%), C. tropicalis (n = 9; 17.3%), C."
		"parapsilosis (n = 5; 9.7%), C. africana (n = 3; 5.7%), C. famata (n = 1; 1.9%),"
		"C. lusitaniae (n = 1; 1.9%), and C. dubliniensis (n = 1; 1.9%). The resistance"
		"rate of Candida isolates to fluconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole were"
		"15.38%, 11.5%, and 3.8%, respectively. Resistance to fluconazole was obtained in"
		46% (5/11) of RVVC cases but only in 7% (3/41) of VVC cases. CONCLUSION: This
		study demonstrated that the majority of VVC cases were caused by non-albicans
		"Candida species which also were resistant to some antifungal agents. Hence, our"
		findings revealed the importance of conducting periodical epidemiological studies
		"to determine changes in species distribution. Moreover, for effective management"
		"of treatment and infection, it is imperative to evaluate the susceptibility"
		profiles of Candida species isolated from VVC patients.

PG	-	292-298
LID	-	10.4103/ijdr.IJDR_827_20 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: The study was undertaken to estimate the species-specific prevalence
		"of oral candidiasis in diabetic individuals in India, and further find the"
		relationship of oral carriage of Candida in diabetes with degree of diabetic
		"control, duration of disease, type of diabetes and its effect on the status of"
		"oral hygiene status and decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMFT) score."
		METHODOLOGY: The prospective cross-sectional study involved 900 individuals (470
		diabetic and 430 non-diabetic) visiting a tertiary care hospital. Informed
		consent was obtained from all the individuals participating in the study. The
		"demographic details, medical history and oral cavity examination were recorded in"
		a specially designed proforma. Swabs were taken for microbiological evaluation
		for specific prevalence of Candida. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of Candida in
		"diabetics was 22.1% as compared to 9.7% in non-diabetic individuals. However,"
		"among the type 1 and type 2 diabetics, the prevalence of Candida was equally"
		"distributed as 22.6% and 20.8%, respectively. C. albicans was the most common"
		"species (97.1%), while isolated cases of other species like C. rugosa, C."
		"tropicalis, C. glabrata were also observed. The individuals with higher glycaemic"
		score (HbA1c >7) showed higher prevalence of oral candidiasis. Oral hygiene
		status was observed to be lower among diabetics as compared to non-diabetic
		individuals. CONCLUSION: Oral candidiasis was more prevalent in diabetic
		"patients, and C. albicans was the most common species. The diabetics also showed"
		higher mean DMFT with lower oral hygiene status as compared to non-diabetic
		individuals.

AB	-	Vaginal candidiasis (VC) continues to be a health problem to women worldwide.
		"Although the majority of VC cases are caused by Candida albicans (C. albicans),"
		non-albicans Candida spp. like C. glabrata and C. tropicalis are emerging as

		incidence of VC significantly increased from 10.76% in 2005 to 17.61% in 2011;
		"average prevalence was 13.88%. C. albicans occurred at a frequency of 83.02%, C."
		glabrata at 16.5% and C. tropicalis at 1.2%. A single C. dubliniensis isolate was
		identified in the sample population. The percentage of C. albicans significantly
		decreased from 83.02% in the sample population as a whole to 60.8% in subjects
		"over 45 years of age (P < 0.01) and that of C. glabrata, C. tropicalis and C."

AB	-	The risk factors and clinical features of patients with Candida tropicalis
		fungaemia have not been fully defined. We performed a case-control study
		comparing 59 cases of C. tropicalis fungaemia with 177 episodes of fungaemia
		caused by other species of Candida in our hospital over a 24-year period (January
		1985 to December 2008). Patients with C. tropicalis fungaemia were more likely to
		"be older (median age, 67 vs. 56 years; p 0.01), to have cancer (45.5% vs. 31.6%,"
		"p 0.04), and to have the abdomen as the portal of entry (32.2% vs. 11.9%, p"
		"0.001), and had a higher in-hospital mortality rate (61% vs. 44%, p 0.03)."
		Multivariate analysis showed that the independent risk factors for C. tropicalis
		fungaemia were cancer (OR 4.5; 95% CI 1.05-3.83; p 0.03) and the abdomen as the
		portal of entry (OR 13.6; 95% CI 1.9-8.2; p <0.001). When survivors were compared
		"with non-survivors, the risk factors associated with a poor outcome were"
		"neutropenia (19.4% vs. 0; p 0.03), corticosteroid treatment (36% vs. 13%; p"
		"0.07), and septic shock (50% vs. 17.4%; p 0.01). The independent risk factors for"
		mortality in the multivariate analysis were corticosteroid treatment (OR 8.2; 95%
		"CI 0.9-27.7; p 0.04) and septic shock (OR 14.6; 95% CI 2.4-90.2; p 0.004),"
		whereas urinary tract infection (OR 0.07; 95% CI 0.01-0.8; p 0.03) and catheter
		removal (OR 0.06; 95% CI 0.01-0.4; p 0.002) were protective factors. C.
		tropicalis is the fourth most common cause of fungaemia in our hospital. It is
		"associated with underlying malignancy, the abdomen as the portal of entry, and"
		poor outcome.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To assess the current clinical features and determinants of outcome of
		Candida tropicalis bloodstream infection (BSI). METHODS: A population-based
		surveillance on Candida BSI was conducted from May 2010 to April 2011 in 29
		Spanish hospitals. Antifungal susceptibility testing (EUCAST methodology) was
		centrally performed. The characteristics and outcome of C. tropicalis BSI
		episodes were compared with those due to other species. RESULTS: Fifty-nine out
		of 752 episodes (7.8%) were due to C. tropicalis (annual incidence: 0.62 cases
		"per 100,000 population). Resistance to fluconazole and voriconazole was found in"
		23.2% and 26.8% of isolates. Breakthrough BSI occurred in 10.5% of episodes. Risk
		"factors for C. tropicalis BSI were age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.01; P-value = 0.05),"
		underlying leukaemia (OR: 4.77; P-value = 0.001) and chronic lung disease (OR:
		2.62; P-value = 0.002). There were no differences in clinical failure (persistent
		BSI for ≥72 h after initiation of therapy and/or 30-day all-cause mortality)
		between C. tropicalis (39.6%) and non-C. tropicalis groups (45.6%). The
		appropriateness of antifungal therapy or the fluconazole MIC values had no
		"significant impact on outcome, whereas early central venous catheter removal"
		exerted a protective effect. CONCLUSIONS: C. tropicalis BSI was associated with
		"advanced age, haematological malignancy and respiratory comorbidity. We found no"
		correlation between the unexpectedly high resistance rate to azoles observed and
		outcome.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Pregnant women are more susceptible to vaginal colonization and
		infection by yeast. The role of Candida colonization in the occurrence of preterm
		birth is well established. The knowledge of local epidemiology and identification
		of risk factors for preterm birth is important for the prevention and management
		strategies. The purpose of the study was to determine the prevalence of
		Candida sp. in vaginal swabs of pregnant women. METHODS: Pregnant women attending
		routine antenatal visits in three primary health centres in Bobo-Dioulasso
		(Burkina Faso) were enrolled into a cross-sectional study carried out from
		February to April 2015. Vaginal swabs samples were taken from participants after
		obtaining oral consent. The swabs were inoculated into Sabouraud's glucose agar
		supplemented with chloramphenicol and incubated at 37°C for 24 to 48hours under
		aerobic conditions in order to perform fungal culture. The identification of the
		Candida species was done by culture on HiCrome Candida Differential Agar at 35°C
		for 48h for production of species-specific colors. RESULTS: A total of
		229 pregnant women were included. The prevalence of vulvovaginal candidiasis
		"(VVC) was 22.71%, (95% CI [17.45-28.69]). Candida albicans accounted for 40.39%"
		"and non-Candida albicans species for 59.61% of the isolates, with mainly"
		"C. glabrata (32.69%), C. tropicalis (15.38%) and C. krusei (11.54%). CONCLUSIONS:"
		This study revealed a high prevalence of non-C. albicans species. The syndromic
		management guidelines for VVC in Burkina Faso will be revised to include a
		specific protocol for pregnant women.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Outbreaks of fungal bloodstream infection (BSI) are uncommon among
		hemodialysis patients. We investigated an outbreak of Candida tropicalis BSIs
		involving patients at 3 of 4 affiliated hemodialysis units. METHODS: An
		"investigation included a review of records of patients with C tropicalis BSI, a"
		"case-control study, and cultures of medications, hands of personnel, dialysis"
		"equipment, and water samples. RESULTS: Eight patients developed C tropicalis BSIs"
		"in a 3-month period. Compared to controls, cases had a higher proportion of"
		preceding dialyses performed on a machine with a contaminated saline prime bucket
		(SPB) (P= .02). Observations revealed that SPBs at units A-C were rinsed with tap
		"water, were not routinely disinfected, and that priming tubing was allowed to"
		contact fluid in SPBs. C tropicalis was recovered from the main compartment and
		hollow handle of SPBs and from other environmental samples. C tropicalis isolates
		"from patients, SPBs and other environmental samples had indistinguishable"
		pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns. Following routine disinfection of
		"SPBs, the outbreak terminated. CONCLUSIONS: This outbreak was likely due to"
		inadequate disinfection of SPBs. The findings emphasize the importance of
		disinfection of SPBs. Current use of identical SPBs warrants further evaluation
		of hollow SPB handles as a potential infection risk.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Imaging of the urinary tract by ultrasonography (USG) or
		computerized tomography scanning is recommended for detecting structural
		"abnormalities, hydronephrosis, abscesses, emphysematous pyelonephritis, or fungus"
		ball formation. Limited studies on the epidemiology and the imaging results of
		candiduria were present in the children. AIM: This study aimed to evaluate the
		results of renal ultrasonography imaging in hospitalized pediatric patients with
		"candiduria. STUDY DESIGN: In this descriptive study, we reviewed our"
		ultrasonography findings with hospitalized children and infants who with
		candiduria. The study included the period between January 2012 and December 2019.
		"Demographic data, the previous medical history, the clinical features of the"
		"patients, ultrasonographic findings of the urinary tract system, presence of an"
		"indwelling urinary catheter, type of urinary samplings, type of candida species"
		were retrospectively recorded. The study was approved by Institutional Review
		"Board with the registration number 2019/366. RESULTS: During the study period,"
		220 children with nosocomial candiduria were evaluated. The most common isolated
		candida species was Candida albicans (68.2%) and followed by C. tropicalis
		"(9.1%). Among all patients, 2 (0.9%) had renal fungal balls associated with C."
		Albicans. Twenty-five patients (11.4%) had findings including internal
		"echogenicity in the bladder (n = 12), uroepithelial thickening of the kidney"
		"(n = 10), and sediments in the renal pelvis (n = 3). DISCUSSION: Candida albicans"
		was the most prominent candida isolated from the patients. The fungal ball is an
		uncommon infection especially in children and predominantly caused by Candida
		species. Fungal ball in the kidney was reported as case reports especially in
		"neonates, in immunosupressed patients, and in patients who had undergone surgical"
		"procedures. In our study, none of the patients with the fungal ball were in the"
		"neonatal period, however, the patients with fungus ball had underlying disease or"
		"condition. Our study has several limitations including a retrospective study, and"
		"the USG were not performed by a single radiologist. Besides these limitations,"
		our findings are important to give information about the place of USG for
		diagnosis of the renal fungal ball in children adding valuable information to a
		topic in which data came from mainly case reports. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the low
		"incidence of fungal balls reported, considering the high consequences of missing"
		"a fungal ball and elimination of it, a non-invasive method such as the renal"
		bladder USG is still necessary for detection of fungal ball especially. More
		prospective studies are required for high risk groups to establish the diagnostic
		value of renal USG.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Biliary obstruction and cholangitis are common problems in
		gastroenterology. Infections of the biliary tract with Candida and other fungal
		species have increasingly been seen in the last few years. OBJECTIVE: To
		"investigate the prevalence, associations, and trends of biliary-tract"
		"candidiasis. DESIGN: A prospective, observational, diagnostic study. SETTING:"
		"University Hospital, Muenster, Germany. PATIENTS: Consecutive patients undergoing"
		"ERCP for various indications. RESULTS: In 54 of 123 patients, we found Candida"
		"species in bile samples (44%). In only 7 patients, candidiasis was suspected on"
		endoscopy before mycologic proof. Only 4 of these 7 patients were correctly
		diagnosed with biliary candidiasis by simple morphologic aspects. The fungus was
		mainly differentiated as Candida albicans or Candida glabrata and rarely as
		"Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, or other subspecies. Immunosuppression"
		for various reasons was significantly associated with bile-duct candidiasis (P <
		.02). No significant association was found between positive fungal cultures and
		prior endoscopic sphincterotomy (P = .0824) or prior ERCP (P = .1152). Biliary
		candidiasis was neither associated with positive fungal cultures of buccal smears
		(P = .0722) nor with positive findings in stool samples (P = .0860). LIMITATIONS:
		Highly selected patient population. Buccal smears and stool samples were not
		obtained from all patients. Contamination artifacts cannot totally be excluded
		with the ERCP procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Candida species very frequently can be
		detected in the bile. Positive fungal cultures of bile samples are not just
		contamination artifacts. This has to be taken into account when designing an
		anti-infectious treatment for recurrent cholangitis or even more cholangiosepsis.
		Especially in immunosuppressed patients or recipients of long-term antibiotic
		"therapy, physicians should screen for biliary-tract candidiasis during endoscopic"
		examination.

		candidemia isolates from inpatients in various parts of the world: a systematic
		review.
PG	-	e954-66
LID	-	10.1016/j.ijid.2010.04.006 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candidemia is among the leading causes of nosocomial bloodstream
		infections and is associated with significant mortality. Several centers have
		published data regarding the incidence and relative frequency of Candida spp.
		OBJECTIVE: We performed a systematic review to summarize and evaluate the
		available evidence regarding the distribution of the relative frequency of
		"Candida spp isolated from blood, according to geographic region and study design,"
		during the period 1996 to 2009. METHODS: We searched PubMed and Scopus and
		retrieved 81 relevant articles reporting data on the relative frequency of
		Candida spp. RESULTS: C. albicans was the predominant species in almost all
		studies. The highest proportion of C. albicans was found in North and Central
		"Europe and the USA. Non-albicans species were more common in South America, Asia,"
		and South Europe. C. glabrata was commonly isolated in the USA and North and
		"Central Europe; C. parapsilosis in South America, South Europe, and several parts"
		of Asia; and C. tropicalis in South America and Asia. The relative frequency of
		C. krusei was low in all regions. Significant differences were noted depending on
		"study design (surveillance study, multicenter or single centre, prospective or"
		retrospective) and setting (hospital or intensive care unit). CONCLUSIONS:
		Significant geographic variation is evident among cases of candidemia in
		different parts of the world. Local epidemiological data continue to be of major
		significance.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs) are life-threatening
		surgical emergencies associated with high morbidity and mortality. Fungal NSTIs
		are considered rare and have been largely understudied. The purpose of this study
		was to study the impact of fungal NSTIs and antifungal therapy on mortality after
		NSTIs. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed on patients with NSTIs
		"from 2012 to 2018. Patient baseline characteristics, microbiologic data,"
		"antimicrobial therapy, and clinical outcomes were collected. Patients were"
		excluded if they had comfort care before excision. The primary outcome measured
		was in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: A total of 215 patients met study criteria
		with a fungal species identified in 29 patients (13.5%). The most prevalent
		fungal organism was Candida tropicalis (n = 11). Fungal NSTIs were more prevalent
		"in patients taking immunosuppressive medications (17.2% versus 3.2%, P = 0.01). A"
		"fungal NSTI was significantly associated with in-hospital mortality (odds ratio,"
		"3.13; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-8.40; P = 0.02). Furthermore, fungal NSTI"
		"patients had longer lengths of stay (32 d [interquartile range, 16-53] versus"
		"19 d [interquartile range, 11-31], P < 0.01), more likely to require initiation"
		"of renal replacement therapy (24.1% versus 8.6%, P = 0.02), and more likely to"
		"require mechanical ventilation (64.5% versus 42.0%, P = 0.02). Initiation of"
		antifungals was associated with a significantly lower rate of in-hospital
		"mortality (6.7% versus 57.1%, P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Fungal NSTIs are more"
		common in patients taking immunosuppressive medications and are significantly
		associated with in-hospital mortality. Antifungal therapy is associated with
		decreased in-hospital mortality in those with fungal NSTIs. Consideration should
		"be given to adding antifungals in empiric treatment regimens, especially in those"
		taking immunosuppressive medications.

TI	-	Oral Candidiasis in children and adolescents with cancer. Identification of
		Candida spp.
PG	-	E419-23
AB	-	Oral candidiasis represents a serious problem for children with cancer. The
		"mortality rate of this infection has increased due to fungal septicemia,"
		associated with a primary buccal infection. OBJECTIVE: Identify the Candida spp.
		"in buccal lesions of patients with cancer, establish the predominant species and"
		"correlate them to age and sex of the patient, clinical presentation, type of"
		"neoplasic disease and cytostatic therapy received. STUDY DESIGN: 62 patients,"
		"between 0-16 years, were investigated in a cross sectional study. SAMPLE"
		INCLUSION CRITERIA: Patients with malignant neoplasic disease that were receiving
		cytostatic treatment and had suspicious lesions of oral candidiasis. Patients
		"with antifungal therapy, active caries, calculus or intraoral appliances were"
		excluded. A clinical evaluation was carried out. The lesion sample was taken and
		studied by direct exam and culture in CHROMagar-Candida and Sabouraud-Dextrose
		Agar with chloramphenicol. The identification of the isolated yeast was done by
		"the filamentation test, carbohydrate fermentation and assimilation. RESULTS: Most"
		"of the cases (69.35%) were positive to oral candidiasis, C. albicans was the most"
		"frequent species found, followed by C. parapsilosis (14.89%), C. tropicalis"
		"(12.77%), C. krusei (4.26%), C. glabrata (2.13%) and C. lusitaniae (2.13%). In"
		some cases more than one specie were isolated (9.30%). The most frequent location
		of the lesion was in the tongue (72.70%). The pseudomembranous candidiasis was
		the most frequent clinical presentation found (78.71%). There were not
		"significant statistically differences with regard to sex and age of the patient,"
		type of neoplasic disease and cytostatic agent received. CONCLUSION: The results
		suggest that oral candidiasis is a frequent complication in the pediatric

		characterization of invasive candidiasis in a teaching hospital in China between
		2006 to 2011.
PG	-	353

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive candidiasis is an important nosocomial infection associated
		with high mortality among immunosuppressive or critically ill patients. We
		described the incidence of invasive candidiasis in our hospital over 6 years and
		showed the antifungal susceptibility and genotypes of the isolated yeast. METHOD:
		The yeast species were isolated on CHROMagar Candida medium and identified using
		"an yeast identification card, followed by analysis of the D1/D2 domain of 26S"
		"rDNA. The susceptibilities of the isolates to flucytosine, amphotericin B,"
		"fluconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole were tested using the ATB FUNGUS 3"
		"system, and that to caspofungin was tested using E-test strips. C. albicans was"
		genotyped using single-strand conformation polymorphism of CAI (Candida albicans
		I) microsatellite DNA combined with GeneScan data. RESULTS: From January 2006 to
		"December 2011, a total of 259 isolates of invasive Candida spp. were obtained"
		"from 253 patients, among them 6 patients had multiple positive samples."
		"Ninety-one stains were from blood and 168 from sterile fluids, accounting for"
		6.07% of all pathogens isolated in our hospital. Most of these strains were C.
		"albicans (41.29% in blood/59.06% in sterile body fluids), followed by C."
		"tropicalis (18.06%/25.72%), C. parapsilosis (17.42%/5.43%), C. glabrata"
		(11.61%/3.99%) and other Candida spp. (11.61%/5.80%). Most Candida spp. were
		isolated from the ICU. The new species-specific CLSI candida MIC breakpoints were
		applied to these date. Resistance to fluconazole occurred in 6.6% of C. albicans
		"isolates, 10.6% of C. tropicalis isolates and 15.0% of C. glabrata isolates. For"
		"the 136 C. albicans isolates, 54 CAI patterns were recognized. The C. albicans"
		strains from blood or sterile body fluids showed no predominant CAI genotypes. C.
		albicans isolates from different samples from the same patient had the same
		genotype. CONCLUSIONS: Invasive candidiasis has been commonly encountered in our
		"hospital in the past 6 years, with increasing frequency of non-C. albicans."
		Resistance to fluconazole was highly predictive of resistance to voriconazole.
		CAI SSCP genotyping showed that all C. albicans strains were polymorphic.
		Invasive candidiasis were commonly endogenous infection.

LID	-	10.1111/myc.12488 [doi]
AB	-	Major burn patients have characteristics that make them especially susceptible to
		"candidemia, but few studies focused on this have been published. The objectives"
		"were to evaluate the epidemiological, microbiological and clinical aspects of"
		"candidemia in major burn patients, determining factors associated with a poorer"
		prognosis and mortality. We conducted a retrospective observational study of
		candidemia between 1996 and 2012 in major burn patients admitted to the La Fe
		"University Hospital, Valencia, Spain. The study included 36 episodes of"
		"candidemia in the same number of patients, 55.6% men, mean age 37.33 years and"
		low associated comorbidity. The incidence of candidemia varied between 0.26 and
		6.09 episodes/1000 days stay in the different years studied. Candida albicans was
		the most common species (61.1%) followed by Candida parapsilosis (27.8%).
		"Candidemia by C. krusei, C. glabrata or C. tropicalis were all identified after"
		2004. Central vascular catheter (CVC) was established as a potential source of
		"candidemia in 36.1%, followed by skin and soft tissues of thermal injury (22.2%)"
		and urinary tract (8.3%). Fluconazole was used in 19 patients (52.7%) and its in
		"vitro resistance rate was 13.9%. The overall mortality was 47.2%, and mortality"
		related to candidemia was 30.6%. Factors associated with increased mortality were
		those related to severe infection and shock. CVC was the most usual focus of
		candidemia. Fluconazole was the most common antifungal drug administered. The
		management of candidemia in major burn patients is still a challenge.

PG	-	157-63
AB	-	"This retrospective study included 18 pediatric cases (median age, 3 years) with"
		pathologically proved hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) from a single institution
		"during 1992 and 2001. There were 9 males and 9 females. Prolonged fever,"
		"cytopenia, liver dysfunction and hepatomegaly were the most common features at"
		presentation. Sixteen (88.9%) cases were previously healthy. The case fatality
		"rate was 61.1%, and all fatal cases died within 2 months of disease onset. The"
		"infectious agents associated with HPS were identified in 11 cases (61.1%), and 8"
		(72.7%) of them had evidence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection or
		reactivation. Underlying immunologic disorder or neoplastic disease was
		identified in 11.1% of the cases. Children less than 3 years of age with HPS were
		more vulnerable to neutropenia-associated bloodstream infection (85.7% vs 27.3%;
		p=0.025). Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3) and Candida tropicalis (2) were the 2 most
		"commonly isolated pathogens. Regarding specific management of HPS, intravenous"
		immunoglobulin and steroids were the first-line agents and were administered in
		"16 cases and 11 cases, respectively, while etoposide was administered in 5"
		refractory cases during the late phase of disease. Most HPS occurred in
		"previously healthy children, and a substantial proportion of cases rapidly"
		"progressed to death. Most cases were associated with viral infection,"
		"particularly EBV, and young children tended to develop neutropenia-associated"
		bacteremia during the active phase of the disease.

		study.
PG	-	1387-1395
LID	-	10.1111/myc.13297 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Considering the emergence of fungaemia due to rare yeasts at our
		"centre, we performed a systematic epidemiologic study on fungaemia due to rare"
		yeast. OBJECTIVES: We undertook the present prospective observational study to
		explore the epidemiological features and clinical characteristics of fungaemia
		due to rare yeasts in paediatric ICUs at our centre. METHODS: The successive
		yeasts isolated from blood at our PICUs during December 2017 through March 2019
		were identified by molecular methods. Fungaemia due to yeasts other than
		"C. albicans, C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, C. krusei and C. parapsilosis was"
		categorised as rare yeasts. Antifungal susceptibility testing of the yeast
		isolates was performed as per clinical and laboratory standards institute (CLSI)
		guidelines. We also compared different clinical parameters of fungaemia due to
		"common versus rare yeasts, and rare yeasts in neonates versus non-neonates."
		"RESULTS: During the study period, 212 yeast isolates were obtained from 159"
		"patients at PICUs of our hospital, and 127 isolates from 98 patients (61.6%) were"
		categorised as rare yeasts. Neonates acquired fungaemia significantly earlier
		after ICU admission than non-neonates (median:4 vs 6 days; p = .005). Regarding
		"epidemiology study of rare yeast fungaemia, Wickerhamomyces anomalus (43.8%) and"
		Candida utilis (40.8%) were common isolates; surgical intervention and
		"gastrointestinal disease were significantly associated; overall, azole,"
		"echinocandin and amphotericin B resistance was at 9.1%, 1.02% and 1.02%,"
		respectively; overall mortality was 65.3%. CONCLUSIONS: The emergence of rare
		yeasts especially W. anomalus and C. utilis causing fungaemia in our children
		demands urgent attention to control the spread.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Leprosy represents a chronic progressive debilitating disease. The
		severe morbidity associated with leprosy predisposes the patients to
		opportunistic infections. To assess the oral candida prevalence and species
		specificity in lepromatous leprosy patients. METHODS: The cross-sectional study
		included 70 lepromatous leprosy patients under a multi-drug regimen for less than
		1 year (group 1) and 70 healthy volunteers (group 2). Both group 1 and 2 were
		"matched for potential confounding factors including age, gender, ethnicity,"
		absence of HIV co-infection. Oral swab samples obtained from both groups were
		subjected to a series of conventional and molecular diagnostic modalities.
		RESULTS: Yeast growth was statistically higher (0.0006) in group 1 (45.7%) than
		in group 2 (18.5%). 28 of the 32 yeast growth in group 1 and all 13 yeast growth
		"in group 2 were identified as candida. Among the 28 candida species in group 1,"
		"23 (71.88%) were Candida albicans, 3 (9.37%) were Candida parapsilosis, 1 (3.13%)"
		"was Candida lusitaniae and 1 (3.13%) was Candida nivariensis. Among group 2, 11"
		"(84.6%) were Candida albicans, 1 (7.7%) was Candida parapsilosis and 1 was"
		Candida tropicalis. CONCLUSION: Oral candida prevalence is higher in leprosy
		"patients than in healthy individuals, indicating a predisposition towards"
		opportunistic infections. The increasing prevalence of the non-candida albicans
		species in leprosy is a major concern as they have shown to possess inherent
		resistant towards common anti-fungal agents.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at providing original data on fungemia in the Centre
		"Hospitalier de Mayotte in terms of prevalence, epidemiological characteristics of"
		"infected patients, yeast species distribution and profile of in vitro antifungals"
		susceptibility. METHODS: A total of 223 positive blood cultures for yeasts were
		retrospectively reported during the period April 2010-April 2020. RESULTS:
		Ninety-five episodes were identified corresponding to an incidence rate of 3.7
		"cases/100,000 inhabitants. The average age of patients was 33.5 years, and 63.3%"
		patients were hospitalized in intensive care unit. The main co-morbidities were
		"surgery in the 30 days prior to fungemia (27.8%), neoplasia (22.8%), parenteral"
		"nutrition (17.7%), diabetes (16.5%) and immunosuppressive medications (31.6%)."
		Candida spp accounted for the majority of isolates (92.4%) with a predominance of
		"non-albicans species (55.8% vs 33.7%), including C. albicans (33.7%),"
		C. tropicalis (30.5%) and C. parapsilosis (20%). The antifungal susceptibility
		profiles did not differ from expected results for each species and did not change
		significantly over time. DISCUSSION: Fungemia remain frequent hospital infections
		associated with high mortality in Mayotte. The vast majority of fungemia was due
		to Candida spp. Non-albicansCandida species reach half of the Candida isolates
		"with a high percentage of C. tropicalis. Surprisingly, no case of candidemia due"
		to C. glabrata were identified. The management of candidemia remains satisfactory
		and the treatment was adapted according to the international recommendations.
		"However, the high susceptibility of Candida spp. isolates to fluconazole may"
		invite to reconsider the use of this molecule as empirical and first-line
		treatment of candidemia in Mayotte.

AB	-	"OBJECTIVES: To determine the epidemiology of Candida bloodstream infections,"
		"variables influencing mortality, and antifungal resistance rates in ICUs in"
		"Spain. DESIGN: Prospective, observational, multicenter population-based study."
		SETTING: Medical and surgical ICUs in 29 hospitals distributed throughout five
		metropolitan areas of Spain. PATIENTS: Adult patients (≥ 18 yr) with an episode
		of Candida bloodstream infection during admission to any surveillance area ICU
		from May 2010 to April 2011. INTERVENTIONS: Candida isolates were sent to a
		reference laboratory for species identification by DNA sequencing and
		susceptibility testing using the methods and breakpoint criteria promulgated by
		the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing. Prognostic
		factors associated with early (0-7 d) and late (8-30 d) mortality were analyzed
		using logistic regression modeling. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We detected
		"773 cases of candidemia, 752 of which were included in the overall cohort. Among"
		"these, 168 (22.3%) occurred in adult ICU patients. The rank order of Candida"
		"isolates was as follows: Candida albicans (52%), Candida parapsilosis (23.7%),"
		"Candida glabrata (12.7%), Candida tropicalis (5.8%), Candida krusei (4%), and"
		others (1.8%). Overall susceptibility to fluconazole was 79.2%. Cumulative
		mortality at 7 and 30 days after the first episode of candidemia was 16.5% and
		"47%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that early appropriate antifungal"
		"treatment and catheter removal (odds ratio, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.08-0.91), Acute"
		"Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (odds ratio, 1.11; 95% CI,"
		"1.04-1.19), and abdominal source (odds ratio, 8.15; 95% CI, 1.75-37.93) were"
		independently associated with early mortality. Determinants of late mortality
		"were age (odds ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.07), intubation (odds ratio, 7.24; 95%"
		"CI, 2.24-23.40), renal replacement therapy (odds ratio, 6.12; 95% CI,"
		"2.24-16.73), and primary source (odds ratio, 2.51; 95% CI, 1.06-5.95)."
		CONCLUSIONS: Candidemia in ICU patients is caused by non-albicans species in 48%
		"of cases, C. parapsilosis being the most common among these. Overall mortality"
		remains high and mainly related with host factors. Prompt adequate antifungal
		treatment and catheter removal could be critical to decrease early mortality.

LID	-	10.1007/s00134-014-3408-3 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: To analyze trends in incidence and mortality of candidemia in intensive
		care units (ICUs) vs. non-ICU hospitalized patients and to determine risk factors
		for infection by specific species and for death. METHODS: Active hospital-based
		surveillance program of incident episodes of candidemia due to common species in
		"24 tertiary care hospitals in the Paris area, France between October 2002 and"
		"September 2010. RESULTS: Among 2,507 adult cases included, 2,571 Candida isolates"
		"were collected and species were C. albicans (56 %), C. glabrata (18.6 %), C."
		"parapsilosis (11.5 %), C. tropicalis (9.3 %), C. krusei (2.9 %), and C. kefyr"
		"(1.8 %). Candidemia occurred in ICU in 1,206 patients (48.1 %). When comparing"
		"ICU vs. non-ICU patients, the former had significantly more frequent surgery"
		"during the past 30 days, were more often preexposed to fluconazole and treated"
		"with echinocandin, and were less frequently infected with C. parapsilosis. Risk"
		factors and age remained unchanged during the study period. A significant
		increased incidence in the overall population and ICU was found. The odds of
		being infected with a given species in ICU was influenced by risk factors and
		preexposure to fluconazole and caspofungin. Echinocandins initial therapy
		"increased over time in ICU (4.6 % first year of study, to 48.5 % last year of"
		"study, p < 0.0001). ICU patients had a higher day-30 death rate than non-ICU"
		patients (odds ratio [OR] 2.12; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.66-2.72; p <
		0.0001). The day-30 and early (<day 8) death rates increased over time in ICU
		(from 41.5 % the first to 56.9 % the last year of study (p = 0.001) and 28.7-38.8
		"% (p = 0.0292), respectively). Independent risk factors for day-30 death in ICU"
		"were age, arterial catheter, Candida species, preexposure to caspofungin, and"
		lack of antifungal therapy at the time of blood cultures results (p < 0.05).
		CONCLUSIONS: The availability of new antifungals and the publication of numerous
		guidelines did not prevent an increase of candidemia and death in ICU patients in
		the Paris area.

TI	-	Epidemiology and reporting of candidaemia in Belgium: a multi-centre study.
PG	-	649-655
LID	-	10.1007/s10096-016-2841-3 [doi]
AB	-	The primary aim of this study was to collect national epidemiological data on
		candidaemia and to determine the reporting time of species identification and
		antifungal susceptibility in clinical practice. During a 1-year period (March
		"2013 until February 2014), every first Candida isolate from each episode of"
		candidaemia was included prospectively from 30 Belgian hospitals. Identification
		and susceptibility testing were performed according to local procedures and
		isolates were sent to the National Reference Center for Mycosis. Species
		identification was checked by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation
		time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and internal transcribed spacer
		(ITS) sequencing in case no reliable identification was obtained by MALDI-TOF MS.
		Antifungal susceptibility testing was performed according to the European
		Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) methodology. A total
		of 355 isolates were retrieved from 338 patients. The mean incidence rate of
		candidaemia was 0.44 (range: 0.07 to 1.43) per 1000 admissions or 0.65 (range:
		"0.11 to 2.00) per 10,000 patient days. Candida albicans was most frequently found"
		"(50.4 %), followed by C. glabrata (27.3 %) and C. parapsilosis sensu lato"
		"(9.8 %). The overall resistance to fluconazole was 7.6 %, ranging from 3.9 % in"
		C. albicans to 20.0 % in C. tropicalis. Only one C. glabrata isolate was
		"resistant to the echinocandins. Four days after blood culture positivity, 99.7 %"
		of the identifications and 90.3 % of the antifungal profiles were reported to the
		treating clinician. Candidaemia incidence rates differed up to 20-fold among
		Belgian hospitals; no clear factors explaining this difference were identified.
		The overall antifungal resistance rates were low but high azole resistance rates
		were recorded in C. tropicalis.

PG	-	777-785
LID	-	10.1111/myc.12816 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To identify the epidemiology and antifungal susceptibilities of
		Candida spp. among blood culture isolates to identify the epidemiology and
		antifungal susceptibilities of Candida spp. among blood culture isolates in
		"Sweden. METHODS: The study was a retrospective, observational nationwide"
		laboratory-based surveillance for fungaemia and fungal meningitis and was
		"conducted from September 2015 to August 2016. RESULTS: In total, 488 Candida"
		blood culture isolates were obtained from 471 patients (58% males). Compared to
		"our previous study, the incidence of candidaemia has increased from 4.2/100 000"
		(2005-2006) to 4.7/100 000 population/year (2015-2016). The three most common
		"Candida spp. isolated from blood cultures were Candida albicans (54.7%), Candida"
		glabrata (19.7%) and species in the Candida parapsilosis complex (9.4%). Candida
		"resistance to fluconazole was 2% in C. albicans and between 0% and 100%, in"
		non-albicans species other than C. glabrata and C. krusei. Resistance to
		"voriconazole was rare, except for C. glabrata, C. krusei and C. tropicalis."
		Resistance to anidulafungin was 3.8% while no Candida isolate was resistant to
		amphotericin B. CONCLUSIONS: We report an overall increase in candidaemia but a
		minor decrease of C. albicans while C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis remain
		constant over this 10-year period.

PG	-	549-55
LID	-	10.1016/j.archoralbio.2010.11.018 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: The goal of the study was to measure the prevalence of Candida spp. in
		the oral cavity of patients with diabetes types 1 and 2 when compared to healthy
		individuals and to study antifungal resistance profile of the isolates. DESIGN:
		There were 162 subjects in the study: diabetes type 1 (n=39); control group 1
		"(n=50): healthy individuals matched in gender, age, and oral conditions to"
		diabetes type 1 patients; diabetes type 2 (n=37); control group 2 (n=36) who were
		matched to each patient of the diabetes type 2 group. Stimulated saliva was
		collected and isolates were identified with phenotypic tests. The presence of C.
		dubliniensis was determined by multiplex PCR. RESULTS: There were no
		statistically significant differences in Candida spp. frequency between the
		diabetes 1 group and its control (p=0.443) nor between the diabetes 2 group and
		its control (p=0.429). C. albicans was the most frequently isolated yeast in all
		"groups. In the diabetes groups, C. stellatoidea, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis,"
		"C. lipolytica, C. glabrata, and C. krusei were also identified. Additionally, in"
		"control groups, C. kefyr was also detected. None of the isolates were resistant"
		to amphotericin B and flucytosine. A low percentage of the isolates were
		resistant to ketoconazole. CONCLUSIONS: No differences were detected in
		colonization of Candida spp. oral isolates from type 1 and type 2 diabetes when
		compared to matched controls. The antifungal resistance of Candida spp. isolates
		for ketoconazole from type 1 diabetes patients was significantly higher than that
		of its matched control.

		patients with candidemia. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study at Centro
		"Hospitalar Universitário de São João, Portugal, between January 2016 and December"
		2017. RESULTS: A total of 117 candidemia episodes (n=114 patients) were included.
		"Median age was 65 years, with an increased prevalence of older ages. Candida"
		"albicans (51.3%) was the most prevalent species, followed by C. glabrata (22.2%),"
		"C. parapsilosis (15.4%), C. tropicalis (4.3%) and C. lusitaniae (2.6%). Forty-two"
		patients (35.9%) did not receive antifungal drugs after diagnosis of candidemia.
		Echinocandins were used as first-line drug therapy in half of the treated
		patients (50.7%). The median EQUAL Candida Score was 6/17 (IQR 6-9) for patients
		without central venous catheter (CVC) and 11/20 (IQR 6-14) for patients with CVC.
		"The 30 days-mortality was 31,6% and was not significantly associated with the"
		timing of antifungal therapy and the EQUAL Candida Score. CONCLUSION: The
		"distribution of Candida species has changed in recent years, with an increase in"
		"the proportion of C. albicans and C. glabrata. Rapid diagnostic tests, empiric"
		antifungal therapy and source control are essential to improve the prognosis of
		patients with candidemia. More multicentric prospective studies are needed to
		evaluate the association of mortality with the timing of antifungal therapy or
		the EQUAL Candida Score.

AB	-	"PURPOSE: Candidemia is an important issue of nosocomial bloodstream infections,"
		"and is associated with a high mortality rate. However, little information is"
		"available before final species identification, which takes days after the episode"
		of candidemia. This study tried to determine whether time to positivity (TTP) for
		yeast helps in predicting the species of candidemia. METHODS: A retrospective
		"cohort study was conducted in Taiwan, which included 434 episodes of"
		nonduplicated candidemia during the period between 2006 and 2009. The demographic
		"features, clinical characteristics, TTP for yeast, and acute illness scores were"
		included for analysis. RESULTS: The mean age of patients with candidemia was 70.4
		"± 15.2 years, and the 30-day crude mortality rate was 48.2%. Forty-five percent"
		of patients suffered from shock status with a mean Acute Physiological and
		Chronic Health Evaluation II score of 27.0 ± 8.7 and a mean Sequential Organ
		"Failure Assessment score of 9.7 ± 4.5, whereas 50% were admitted to the intensive"
		care units. Candida albicans was still the most commonly identified pathogen
		"(58.1%), followed by C. tropicalis (14.7%), C. parapsilosis (13.1%), and C."
		glabrata (8.3%). Results of multivariate logistic regression showed that TTP for
		"yeast within 48 hours would more favor C. tropicalis (p = 0.044), and less favor"
		C. glabrata (p = 0.025) and C. parapsilosis (p < 0.001). Patients with parenteral
		nutrition usage were more frequently associated with a TTP for yeast within 48
		"hours, whereas those with previous exposure to an antifungal agent had a longer"
		TTP for yeast. CONCLUSION: The TTP for yeast might provide a hint of the
		responsible Candida species before final identification among critical patients
		with candidemia. The association between antifungal agents and TTP would need
		more evidence for elucidation.

AB	-	"PURPOSE: To evaluate the incidence, clinical course, and management of fungal"
		interface keratitis (IK) after Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK).
		METHODS: This is a single-center retrospective observational case series of 3950
		eyes undergoing DMEK. Six eyes with fungal IK were detected and analyzed.
		"Analysis included graft storage condition, incidence of fungal IK, identification"
		"of the pathogenic agent, topical/systemic and surgical treatment regimen, and"
		best-corrected visual acuity. RESULTS: Fungal IK after DMEK occurred in 6 of 3950
		cases (0.15%). Corneal grafts were either stored in Optisol-GS (n = 4) or in
		"organ culture (n = 2). In all cases, Candida species were isolated (Candida"
		"tropicalis, Candida albicans, Candida orthopsilosis, and Candida guilliermondii)."
		Four eyes developed fungal IK during the early postoperative period (3-5 d) and 2
		eyes later at 16 to 42 days after surgery. All patients received topical and
		systemic antifungal treatment and intracameral application of antifungal agents.
		"In the case of an early infection, graft removal was performed in 3 of 4"
		patients. Late infections were eradicated without graft exchange. Recurrence of
		fungal infection was observed in 1 case after early IK and in both cases after
		late IK. Final visual acuity ranged from 20/200 to 20/20. CONCLUSIONS: Fungal IK
		"is a rare complication after DMEK. Based on our experience, we believe that"
		treatment of early fungal IK with aggressive presentation should include both
		immediate graft exchange and intracameral application of voriconazole and
		"amphotericin, in addition to topical and systemic antifungal treatment. Graft"
		exchange seems not to be mandatory in late infections.

		tropicalis candidaemia: A retrospective cohort study.
PG	-	473-480
LID	-	10.1111/myc.13429 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candida tropicalis is the most common non-albicans Candida species
		"found in Asia-Pacific countries, including Thailand. The pathogen is known for"
		"its great virulence, which causes a high case-fatality rate. Associations between"
		"case fatality and patient characteristics, infectious disease unit consultation"
		and EQUAL Candida score were investigated. METHODS: This retrospective cohort
		study was conducted with 160 cases of C. tropicalis bloodstream infection between
		"2015 and 2019 at a single, large, tertiary centre in Thailand. Clinical"
		"characteristics, clinical presentations, patient outcomes (30-day case-fatality"
		rate) and independent predictive factors were analysed. RESULTS: The 30-day
		case-fatality rate was 68.1%. The median of the EQUAL Candida score was 8.
		Independent factors for the prediction of case fatality were septic shock (hazard
		"ratio, 1.84), the use of mechanical ventilation (hazard ratio, 2.03) and the"
		"EQUAL Candida score (hazard ratio, 0.75). CONCLUSIONS: The predictive factors for"
		"30-day case fatality were septic shock, mechanical ventilation use and the EQUAL"
		Candida score. It is recommended that the EQUAL score be considered for patients
		infected with C. tropicalis candidaemia to reduce the case-fatality rate.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Different yeast species have different susceptibilities to commonly
		"prescribed antifungal drugs. Thus, it is important to accurately determine the"
		"species of pathogenic yeasts, especially when more than one species are in a"
		specimen. METHODS: Clinically significant yeast isolates were collected via the
		Taiwan Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance of Yeasts from July to September
		in 2010. The identifications of isolates were assessed in the core laboratory at
		"the National Health Research Institutes. RESULTS: Of the 1127 isolates recovered,"
		"1088 were of Candida genus, accounting for 96.53% of the total isolates, followed"
		"by Cryptococcus (15, 1.33%), Trichosporon (12, 1.06%), Kodamaea (4, 0.35%),"
		"Pichia (4, 0.35%), and three others. In all, 38 out of 1116 (3.4%) specimens had"
		"mixed yeast cultures. One ascites specimen had three species, Candida albicans,"
		"Candida glabrata, and Candida tropicalis. In the remaining 37 specimens, 16 had a"
		"combination of C. albicans and C. glabrata, eight C. albicans and C. tropicalis,"
		"five C. glabrata and C. tropicalis, three Candida krusei and C. tropicalis, and"
		five with different combinations. CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of cultures
		"with mixed yeasts may be an emerging issue. Thus, to determine mixed yeast"
		"cultures in the same specimen, we highly recommend CHROMagar Candida medium to"
		culture yeast isolates directly from the specimen.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating
		autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system. Since immune system
		"plays a key role in this disease, patients with MS can present higher risk of"
		infections. PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of Candida
		spp. in the oral cavity of MS patients in relation to a control group METHODS: In
		"total, 100 individuals were selected: 55 diagnosed with MS and 45 healthy"
		individuals (control group). Saliva samples were collected and seeded in culture
		"media selecting for Candida. Following an incubation period of 48 h,"
		colony-forming units (CFU mL(-1)) were counted and colonies were isolated for
		Candida species identification by multiplex PCR. The results were analysed by
		chi-squared and Mann-Whitney U statistical tests considering a significance level
		of 5%. RESULTS: Candida spp. were confirmed in the oral cavity of 50.09% patients
		in the MS group and 35.55% individuals in the control group. In individuals
		"positive for the growth of Candida spp., the median values of Candida colonies"
		were 220 CFU mL(-1) for the MS group and 120 CFU mL(-1) for the control group.
		"However, no statistically significant differences were observed between groups"
		"for both prevalence and CFU mL(-1) count. Of the Candida species identified,"
		"73.91% were C. albicans, 21.73% C. glabrata, 2.17% C. tropicalis, and 2.17% C."
		krusei. CONCLUSIONS: The colonization of Candida spp. in the oral cavity of
		individuals with multiple sclerosis was higher than in the control group; however
		these findings were not proven to be statistically significant.

TI	-	Bilateral polymicrobial osteomyelitis with Candida tropicalis and Candida krusei:
		a case report and an updated literature review.
PG	-	e16-22
LID	-	10.1016/j.ijid.2011.10.001 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: We present a case of bilateral polymicrobial osteomyelitis with
		"Candida tropicalis and Candida krusei, and review the literature on Candida"
		osteomyelitis. METHODS: PubMed was searched for cases of Candida osteomyelitis
		published in the English-language literature between 1970 and 2010. CASE: A
		60-year-old previously healthy man was hospitalized with gallstone pancreatitis.
		"Between 3 weeks and 6 months after hospitalization, he developed bilateral"
		osteomyelitis of the feet with C. tropicalis and C. krusei. The patient was
		"treated with surgery, fluconazole, and a liposomal formulation of amphotericin B."
		"The left lower limb was amputated, and at a 2-year follow-up, the patient had"
		almost no pain in his right foot. LITERATURE REVIEW: We identified 40 new cases
		in the literature since the latest review in 2004. Most cases of Candida
		"osteomyelitis are caused by Candida albicans, but an increasing number are caused"
		"by non-albicans species. The prognosis is favorable, with full recovery in the"
		majority of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Candida osteomyelitis should be considered when a
		"patient presents with risk factors and pain without previous trauma, because"
		"Candida, despite being part of the normal flora, is the fourth leading cause of"
		hematogenous nosocomial infections. The recommended treatment is surgery and
		"fluconazole as monotherapy or initially combined with a fungicidal agent, either"
		a different amphotericin B formulation or an echinocandin.

AB	-	Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC) is a major health problem for sexually
		active women because of its severe effect on their quality of life. A thorough
		"knowledge of their epidemiology leads to their efficient management. Therefore, a"
		cross-sectional study was conducted in 2014 in women with leucorrhoea associated
		or not with other clinical signs. Recurrence was based on the occurrence of at
		least four annual episodes of Candida vulvo-vaginitis. An individual interview
		based on a questionnaire was conducted to identify the socio-demographic
		parameters that could be associated with the RVVC. Vaginal samples were collected
		at the obstetrical gynaecology department of the University Hospital of Cocody
		"and at the Pasteur Institute of Côte d'Ivoire. On each sample, a direct"
		examination and culture on Sabouraud-chloramphenicol medium with or without
		actidione were performed. Yeast identification was performed using chromogenic
		media (CandiSelect(®)4 [Bio-Rad]) and the study of sugar assimilation using the
		Auxacolor(®) 2 gallery (Bio-Rad). A total of 400 patients were included. The
		"average age was 29.2 years (SD=7.2 years). Of these, 94 had recurrent"
		"vulvovaginal candidiasis, with a prevalence of 23.5% (CI(95%): 19.49-28.02). Five"
		"species of the genus Candida have been identified: Candida albicans (59.6%),"
		"Candida glabrata (19.1%), Candida tropicalis (16%), Candida krusei (4.2%) and"
		"Candida inconspicua (1.1%). Some factors such as education level, history of"
		"sexually transmitted infection, type of underwear used, frequency of personal"
		hygiene and type of product used for these hygiene have been associated with the
		occurrence of RVVCs. The occurrence of RVVCs is relatively high in our study
		population. Non-albicansCandida species occupy a significant place in this
		disease epidemiology. By addressing the factors associated with the occurrence
		"and/or persistence of RVVCs, it will be possible to reduce their incidence in"
		sexually active women.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: The outcomes of deep-seated abscesses attributed to chronic
		disseminated candidiasis (CDC) in patients with hematological malignancies have
		rarely been reported in recent years. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed and
		analyzed the data of patients with hematological malignancies who received a
		diagnosis of CDC at a medical center in Taiwan between 2008 and 2013. RESULTS:
		Sixty-one patients (32 men and 29 women) were diagnosed with CDC. The median age
		was 51 years (range: 18-83). The overall incidence of CDC was 1.53 per 100
		patient-years in patients with hematological malignancies between 2008 and 2013.
		The highest incidence of CDC was 4.3 per 100 patient-years for acute
		"lymphoblastic leukemia, followed by 3.6 for acute myeloid leukemia. We detected 3"
		"(4.9%) proven, 13 (21.3%) probable, and 45 (73.8%) possible cases of CDC. A total"
		of 13 patients had positive blood cultures for Candida species: C. tropicalis
		"(8), C. albicans (2), C. glabrata (2), and C. famata (1). The median duration of"
		antifungal treatment was 96 days (range: 7-796 days). Serial imaging studies
		revealed that the resolution rate of CDC was 30.0% at 3 months and 54.3% at
		6 months. Five patients (8.2%) had residual lesions that persisted beyond one
		year. A multivariate analysis of the 90-day outcome revealed that shock was the
		only independent prognostic factor of 90-day survival in patients with CDC.
		CONCLUSION: The incidence of CDC did not decrease between 2008 and 2013. Patients
		with acute leukemia had a higher risk of CDC than those with other hematological
		malignancies. Imaging studies conducted at 6 months after diagnosis revealed that
		only half of the patients showed complete resolution. CDC requires prolonged
		"treatment, and serial imaging at 6 months interval is suggested. Shock is the"
		only independent prognostic factor of 90-day survival in patients with CDC.

AB	-	"Systematic candidemia studies, especially in southern Iran, are scarce. In the"
		"current prospective study, we investigated candidemia in three major healthcare"
		"centers of Shiraz, the largest city in southern Iran. Yeast isolates from blood"
		and other sterile body fluids were identified by matrix-assisted laser
		desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and subjected to
		antifungal susceptibility testing (AFST) using the broth microdilution method.
		"Clinical data were retrieved from patients' medical records. In total, 113 yeast"
		"isolates were recovered from 109 patients, over 60% of whom received fluconazole."
		Antifungal drugs were prescribed without considering species identification or
		AFST. The all-cause mortality rate was 28%. Almost 30% of the patients were from
		intensive care units (ICUs). Candida albicans (56/113; 49.5%) was the most
		"prevalent species followed by C. glabrata (26/113; 23%), C. parapsilosis (13/113;"
		"11.5%), C. tropicalis (7/113; 6.2%), and C. dubliniensis (5/113; 4.4%). Only five"
		isolates showed antifungal resistance or decreased susceptibility to fluconazole:
		"one C. orthopsilosis isolate from an azole-naïve patient and two C. glabrata, one"
		"C. albicans, and one C. dubliniensis isolates from patients treated with azoles,"
		who developed therapeutic failure against azoles later. Our results revealed a
		low level of antifungal resistance but a notable rate of azole therapeutic
		"failure among patients with candidemia due to non-albicans Candida species, which"
		"threaten the efficacy of fluconazole, the most widely used antifungal in southern"
		regions of Iran. Candidemia studies should not be confined to ICUs and treatment
		should be administered based on species identification and AFST results.

		"extensively explored the epidemiology of candidemia. However, candidemia data"
		"from the other regions are notoriously scarce, which precludes from reaching a"
		"consensus regarding species distribution, the burden of antifungal resistance,"
		"and the clinical features of infected patients. Therefore, we conducted the"
		"current prospective candidemia study in Shiraz, one of the largest cities located"
		"in the south of Iran, from April 2016 to April 2018. More than 63% of the"
		candidemia infections were treated by fluconazole and species identification and
		antifungal susceptibility testing were not used for decision making regarding the
		choice of antifungal treatment. Approximately 70% of the candidemia cases
		"occurred in the wards outside of the ICUs. Candida albicans, C. glabrata, C."
		"parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, and C. dubliniensis were the five leading causative"
		agents of candidemia. Antifungal resistance was rare and fluconazole resistance
		"and/or non-wild type phenotypes were noticed in five isolates, only one was C."
		"albicans and the rest were non-albicans Candida (NAC) species, including C."
		"glabrata, C. dubliniensis, and C. orthopsilosis. Except for C. orthopsilosis,"
		"which was isolated from an azole-naïve patient, the rest of isolates were"
		recovered from patients treated with azoles and all showed therapeutic failure to
		"azoles. Collectively, our data will complete the candidemia picture in Iran and"
		"show that, although the level of resistance was rare, the therapeutic failure was"
		"notable among NAC species, which threatens the efficacy of fluconazole, the most"
		"widely used antifungal in Southern regions of Iran. Moreover, we showed that"
		candidemia is poorly managed in Iran since species identification tools along
		with antifungal susceptibility testing were not used to select appropriate
		antifungal treatment.

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: Due to the increase in isolation of Candida spp. in critically ill
		"patients, and the high mortality and economic costs which this infection entails,"
		a study was made of the risk factors associated to candidemia in critically ill
		patients from 7 intensive care units in Colombia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A
		multicenter matched case-control study was conducted in 7 intensive care units of
		3 university hospitals. Data on overall length of hospital stay (including both
		general wards and the intensive care unit) were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 243
		subjects (81 cases and 162 controls) between January 2008 and December 2012 were
		"included. In order of frequency, C. albicans, C. tropicalis and C. parapsilosis"
		were isolated. The main identified risk factors were: overall length of hospital
		"stay>25 days (OR 5.33, 95% CI 2.6-10.9), use of meropenem (OR 3.75, 95% CI"
		"1.86-7.5), abdominal surgery (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.39-6.06) and hemodialysis (OR"
		"3.35, 95% CI 1.5-7.7). No differences in mortality between patients with"
		"candidemia and controls were found (39.5 vs. 36.5%, respectively, P=.66) were"
		"found. CONCLUSIONS: In Colombia, a long hospital stay, abdominal surgery, the use"
		of meropenem and hemodialysis were identified as risk factors for candidemia.

LID	-	10.1016/j.burns.2008.05.028 [doi]
AB	-	AIM: To evaluate the diversity and antifungal susceptibilities of Candida
		"isolates from wounds and blood of burn victims, and the associated mortality"
		rates compared with those of controls without candidaemia. METHODS: We performed
		a nested case-control study within a database of clinical data for all patients
		admitted to our burn unit from January 2001 to December 2005. Each candidaemic
		patient was compared with two matched controls. Bloodstream cultures were
		"performed if the core temperature was >39 degrees C, and three sites were"
		"cultured weekly for fungal identification (burn wound, pharynx, urinary tract)."
		RESULTS: At least one episode of candidaemia was diagnosed among 20 of 851
		persons admitted during the study period. Isolates in bloodstream infection were
		"Candida albicans (65%), C. parapsilosis (25%) and C. tropicalis (10%). The median"
		time between admission and onset of candidaemia was greater with C. albicans
		infection (42.6+/-31 days) than with infection by other yeasts (18+/-12 days).
		Candidaemia was associated with more extensive burn and longer duration of
		"hospital stay but with similar mortality, compared with controls. CONCLUSION:"
		Candidaemia in burn cases is mostly due to fluconazole-susceptible C. albicans
		and is not associated with increased mortality.

TI	-	Epidemiology and predictive factors for early and late mortality in Candida
		bloodstream infections: a population-based surveillance in Spain.
PG	-	O245-54
LID	-	10.1111/1469-0691.12380 [doi]
AB	-	"A prospective, multicentre, population-based surveillance programme for Candida"
		bloodstream infections was implemented in five metropolitan areas of Spain to
		"determine its incidence and the prevalence of antifungal resistance, and to"
		"identify predictors of death. Between May 2010 and April 2011, Candida isolates"
		were centralized to a reference laboratory for species identification by DNA
		sequencing and for susceptibility testing by EUCAST reference procedure.
		Prognostic factors associated with early (0-7 days) and late (8-30 days) death
		were analysed using logistic regression modelling. We detected 773 episodes:
		"annual incidence of 8.1 cases/100 000 inhabitants, 0.89/1000 admissions and"
		1.36/10 000 patient-days. Highest incidence was found in infants younger than 1
		year (96.4/100 000 inhabitants). Candida albicans was the predominant species
		"(45.4%), followed by Candida parapsilosis (24.9%), Candida glabrata (13.4%) and"
		"Candida tropicalis (7.7%). Overall, 79% of Candida isolates were susceptible to"
		fluconazole. Cumulative mortality at 7 and 30 days after the first episode of
		"candidaemia was 12.8% and 30.6%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that"
		therapeutic measures within the first 48 h may improve early mortality:
		"antifungal treatment (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27-0.95) and central venous catheter"
		"removal (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.21-0.87). Predictors of late death included host"
		"factors (e.g. patients' comorbid status and signs of organ dysfunction), primary"
		"source (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.03-2.61), and severe sepsis or septic shock (OR 1.77,"
		"95% CI 1.05-3.00). In Spain, the proportion of Candida isolates non-susceptible"
		to fluconazole is higher than in previous reports. Early mortality may be
		improved with strict adherence to guidelines.

TI	-	Factors Influencing Non-albicans Candidemia: A Case-Case-Control Study.
PG	-	665-672
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-017-0146-4 [doi]
AB	-	The study identified factors predisposing to non-albicans candidemia with special
		"interest to prior antimicrobial treatment. A retrospective, case-case-control"
		"study was performed at the University Hospital of Heraklion, Greece, from"
		November 2007 through September 2011 including adult patients. The study had
		"three groups. The first included 58 patients with non-albicans candidemia, the"
		"second 48 with C. albicans candidemia, while the third (control) 104 without"
		candidemia. Each of the two candidemia groups was compared with the control using
		"multivariate logistic regression model. The mean (SD) age of the non-albicans,"
		"the albicans and the control patients was 67 (12), 67 (18) and 59 (19) years,"
		respectively. The most common non-albicans Candida spp. isolated were C.
		"parapsilosis in 19 patients (33%), C. glabrata in 17 (29%) and C. tropicalis in"
		15 (26%). Independent risk factors for non-albicans candidemia were prior
		"treatment with quinolones (p < 0.001), b-lactam-b-lactamase inhibitors"
		"(p = 0.011) and presence of central venous catheter (p = 0.05), while for C."
		"albicans candidemia were prior treatment with quinolones (p < 0.001), carbapenems"
		(p = 0.003) along with cardiac disease (p < 0.001). Neither duration of
		hospitalization nor in-hospital mortality [41% for the non-albicans vs 29% for C.
		albicans group (p = 0.192)] was significantly different between the two
		candidemia groups. The study reveals the role of antimicrobial exposure as a risk
		factor for candidemia caused by different species. Prior treatment with
		"b-lactam-b-lactamase inhibitors was associated with non-albicans, while with"
		carbapenems with C. albicans candidemia. Prior use of quinolones was associated
		with candidemia in general.

PG	-	652-662
LID	-	10.1007/s00134-017-4743-y [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: To assess the risk factors and outcomes associated with fungemia caused
		by the six most commonly occurring Candida species in patients with and without
		malignancies. METHODS: Analysis of the episodes of fungemia due to common Candida
		"species in adults, based on an active hospital-based surveillance program (Paris"
		"area, France, 2002 to 2014). RESULTS: Of the 3417 patients (3666 isolates), 1164"
		(34.1%) had a solid tumor (45.7% digestive tract) and 586 (17.1%) a hematological
		"malignancy (41.8% lymphoma, 33.5% acute leukemia). The hematology patients were"
		"significantly younger, more often pre-exposed to antifungals, more often infected"
		"by C. tropicalis, C. krusei, or C. kefyr, and more often treated in the first"
		instance with an echinocandin. Compared with inpatients who were not in ICU at
		"the time of fungemia, those in ICU were less frequently infected by"
		"C. parapsilosis (p < 0.02), had more recent surgery (p < 0.03), and died more"
		frequently before day 8 and day 30 (p < 0.0001). An increase in crude mortality
		over time in ICU was observed only in oncology patients (p < 0.04). For all
		"patients, lack of prescription of antifungals despite knowledge of positive blood"
		culture increased the risk of death. The odds of being infected by a given
		"Candida species compared with C. albicans were uneven regarding age, gender, type"
		"of malignancy, hospitalization in ICU, central venous catheter, HIV status,"
		"intravenous drug addiction, and previous exposure to antifungal drugs. Compared"
		"with C. albicans, C. glabrata (OR = 0.69 [0.54-0.89]) and C. parapsilosis"
		(OR = 0.49 [0.35-0.67]) were associated with a decreased risk of death by day 8
		and day 30. CONCLUSION: The clinical context of underlying malignancy and
		hospitalization in ICU may be relevant to the initial management of candidemia.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive candidiasis (IC) is the most common invasive fungal
		infection. The epidemiology of IC in hospitalized patients has been widely
		"investigated in many metropolitan cities; however, little information from medium"
		and small cities is known. METHODS: A 5-year retrospective study was carried out
		"to analyze the prevalence, species distribution, antifungal susceptibility, risk"
		factors and mortality of inpatients with invasive Candida infection in a regional
		tertiary teaching hospital in Southwest China. RESULTS: A total of 243 inpatients
		with invasive Candida infection during the five-year study period were
		"identified, with a mean annual incidence of 0.41 cases per 1000 admissions and a"
		"30-day mortality rate of 12.3%. The species distributions of Candida albicans,"
		"Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, Candida krusei, Candida parapsilosis and"
		"other Candida species was 45.3, 30.0, 15.2, 4.9, 2.1 and 2.5%, respectively. The"
		"total resistance rates of fluconazole (FCA), itraconazole (ITR) and voriconazole"
		"(VRC) were 18.6, 23.1 and 18.5%, respectively. Respiratory dysfunction, pulmonary"
		"infection, cardiovascular disease, chronic/acute renal failure, mechanical"
		"ventilation, abdominal surgery, intensive care in adults, septic shock and IC due"
		to C. albicans were associated with 30-day mortality (P < 0.05) according to the
		"univariate analyses. Respiratory dysfunction [odds ratio (OR), 9.80; 95%"
		"confidence interval (CI), 3.24-29.63; P < 0.001] and IC due to C. albicans (OR,"
		"3.35; 95% CI, 1.13-9.92; P = 0.029) were the independent predictors of 30-day"
		mortality. CONCLUSIONS: This report shows that the incidence and mortality rates
		are lower and that the resistance rates to azoles are higher in medium and small
		cities than in large cities and that the species distributions and risk factors
		in medium and small cities are different from those in large cities in China. It
		is necessary to conduct epidemiological surveillance in medium and small cities
		to provide reference data for the surveillance of inpatients with IC infections.

AB	-	A retrospective analysis of fungal infections was carried out in a health-care
		burn center between 2011 and 2014 using the patients' medical records (n = 36).
		"Patients ranged from 18 to 87 years of age, with 23 (63.9%) being women. The most"
		prevalent widespread total body surface area affected (TBSA) was 30-50% (p =
		"0.03), and 71-100% in younger patients, mainly associated with femicide. Fourth"
		"degree burns were revealed in 69.4% of the patients while in 50%, inhalation"
		injuries were observed to represent a higher mortality rate (p = 0.04). The
		Candida score was 3 in 77.7% of cases respectively. Central venous catheter and
		mechanical ventilation were used. All patients received antibiotic treatment and
		91.7% antifungal treatment. Surgical excision of the burn was performed in 33
		"(91.7%) patients, and skin autografting in 29 (80.6%). The median of the fungal"
		infection developed was 21.4 days after admission to the ICU. The specimens
		analyzed involved 52 yeast samples isolated from different cultures: urine
		"(42.3%), blood (26.9%), skin biopsy (9.6%), catheter tip (15.4%) and tracheal"
		aspirate (5.8%). The use of microbiological culture and molecular methods allowed

TI	-	Antifungal susceptibility of invasive Candida bloodstream isolates from the
		Asia-Pacific region.
PG	-	471-7
LID	-	10.1093/mmy/myv114 [doi]
AB	-	Bloodstream infections caused by Candida species are of increasing importance and
		associated with significant mortality. We performed a multi-centre prospective
		observational study to identify the species and antifungal susceptibilities of
		invasive bloodstream isolates of Candida species in the Asia-Pacific region. The
		"study was carried out over a two year period, involving 13 centers from Brunei,"
		"Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam."
		"Identification of Candida species was performed at each study center, and"
		reconfirmed at a central laboratory. Susceptibility testing was performed using a
		"commercial broth dilution panel (Sensititre YeastOne YST-010, Thermofisher,"
		"United Kingdom) with susceptibility categorisation (S = susceptible, S-DD ="
		susceptible dose-dependent) applied using breakpoints from the Clinical
		Laboratory Standards Institute. Eight hundred and sixty-one Candida isolates were
		"included in the study. The most common species were C. albicans (35.9%),"
		"C. tropicalis (30.7%), C. parapsilosis (15.7%), and C. glabrata (13.6%)."
		Non-albicans species exceeded C. albicans species in centers from all countries
		except Taiwan. Fluconazole susceptibility was almost universal for C. albicans
		"(S = 99.7%) but lower for C. tropicalis (S = 75.8%, S-DD = 6.1%), C. glabrata"
		"(S-DD = 94.9%), and C. parapsilosis (S = 94.8%). Echinocandins demonstrated high"
		"rates of in vitro susceptibility (S>99%) against C. albicans, C. tropicalis, and"
		C. parapsilosis This study demonstrates that non-albicans species are the most
		common isolates from bloodstream infections in most countries in the Asia-Pacific
		"region, with C. tropicalis as the predominant species. Because of the prevalence"
		"of reduced susceptibility to fluconazole in non-albicans species, the study"
		indicates that echinocandins should be the antifungal of choice in clinically
		unstable or high-risk patients with documented candidemia.

TI	-	Species-specific prevalence of vaginal candidiasis among patients with diabetes
		mellitus and its relation to their glycaemic status.
PG	-	162-6
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: Non- C. albicans Candida species are increasingly being recognized as
		the cause of vulvo-vaginal candidiasis. These species are often less susceptible
		to antifungal agents. Patients with diabetes mellitus are at risk for
		vulvo-vaginal candidasis. We assessed the species-specific prevalence rate and
		risk of candidiasis in patients with diabetes mellitus and healthy controls.
		"METHODS: Genital tract examination, direct microscopy and fungal cultures of"
		discharge collected by high vaginal swab were undertaken among 78 consecutive
		patients with diabetes mellitus (mean (+/-sd) age 32+/-12 years and body mass
		index (BMI) 22.3+/-5.5kg/m(2)) and 88 age- and BMI-matched healthy females.
		Glycaemic control in the diabetic cohort was assessed by measuring total
		glycosylated haemoglobin. RESULTS: Candida species were isolated in 36 of 78
		(46%) subjects with diabetes mellitus and in 21 of 88 (23%) healthy subjects
		"(Chi-squared 9.11, P=0.0025). The predominant Candida species isolated in"
		"diabetics with vulvo-vaginal candidiasis were Candida glabrata (39%), C. albicans"
		"(26%) and C. tropicalis (17%). In contrast, in the control group, C. albicans, C."
		"glabrata and C. hemulonii comprised 30% each, with none having C. tropicalis"
		"infection (for C. tropicalis: diabetic vs. control; 17% vs. nil, P=0. 05). Among"
		"the diabetic group, subjects with vulvo-vaginal candidiasis had significantly"
		higher mean HbA1 when compared to those who had no such infection (12.8+/-2.6%
		"vs. 9.7+/-1.7% respectively, P=0.001). The overall accuracy of direct microscopy"
		and clinical examination for predicting vulvo-vaginal candidiasis was only 77%
		"and 51%, respectively, in the diabetic group, and 83% and 65% in the control"
		group. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with diabetes mellitus had a high prevalence rate
		(46%) of vulvo-vaginal candidiasis with relative risk of 2.45. The non- C.
		albicans species such as C. glabrata and C. tropicalis were the predominant
		species isolated among them. There seems to be a significant link between
		hyperglycaemia and vulvo-vaginal candidiasis.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Vaginitis, an infection of the lower genital tract in women, is known"
		to be triggered by the overgrowth of the vagina's naturally occurring
		microorganisms. OBJECTIVE: This study looked at the prevalence of Candida spp.
		and age-related disparities amongst women presenting with vaginitis at the
		"Obstetrics and Gynaecology (O&G) clinic in a tertiary hospital in Port Harcourt,"
		Nigeria. METHODS: One hundred high vaginal swabs were collected from pregnant and
		non-pregnant women and examined microscopically and microbiologically. RESULTS:
		Age-group 20-29 years had the highest incidence of candidal vaginitis. There was
		a higher occurrence of yeast cells in pregnant than in non-pregnant participants
		while the non-pregnant women had a greater level of bacterial cells. Forty (40)
		of the samples contained yeasts of Candida species representing a 40% prevalence.
		Three species of Candida were identified with C. albicans dominating. Of the 40
		"samples positive for Candida spp., 30 (75.0%) were confirmed to be C. albicans."
		The remaining isolates were C. tropicalis (15.0%) and C. parapsilosis (10.0%).
		CONCLUSION: The findings in this study would play a role in the future management
		of Candida-induced vaginitis.

TI	-	Prolonged Outbreak of Candida krusei Candidemia in Paediatric Ward of Tertiary
		Care Hospital.
PG	-	257-268
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-020-00427-y [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: A sudden rise of Candida krusei candidemia cases was noticed in our
		hospital within 1 year with maximum cases from paediatric unit. The present study
		reports the results of epidemiological investigation of possible outbreak of
		candidemia by C. krusei in paediatric unit at our tertiary care centre. METHODS:
		Clinical characteristics and risk factors associated with C. krusei candidemia
		were evaluated. Yeast identification and antifungal susceptibility testing was
		performed according to standard protocol. To find the potential source of C.
		"krusei in hospital environment and hand colonization, swabs were collected from"
		"different fomites (n = 40) and hand washings from 24 health care workers (HCW),"
		respectively. Infection control and prevention practices were intensified
		following the recognition of outbreak. Genetic typing was done by fluorescent
		amplified fragment length polymorphism (FAFLP) technique. Case-control comparison
		was performed with C. tropicalis and C. pelliculosa cases. RESULTS: Candida
		"krusei fungaemia significantly affected paediatric group (82/186, 44%) as"
		"compared to adults (14/130, 10.8%; p < 0.001). Among paediatric group, maximum"
		isolation was reported from neonatal unit of paediatric emergency (NUPE). C.
		krusei was isolated from hands of one HCW and washbasin in NUPE. FAFLP revealed
		clonality between blood and environmental isolates indicating cross-transmission
		"of C. krusei. Gastrointestinal disease (p = 0.018), previous antibiotics"
		"(p = 0.021) especially to carbapenems (p = 0.039), was significant among C."
		krusei candidemia cases compared to C. pelliculosa cases. CONCLUSION: We report
		the largest outbreak of C. krusei candidemia in paediatric unit within 1 year
		with isolation of related strains from environment and hands of HCW. Routine
		screening of hand hygiene practices revealed non-compliance to standard practices
		leading to the increase in C. krusei candidemia cases.

LID	-	8453
AB	-	The invasion of pathogenic fungi poses nonnegligible threats to the human health
		and agricultural industry. This work exploited a family of hydroxyethyl
		naphthalimides as novel antifungal species with synergistic potential of chemical
		and dynamic treatment to combat the fungal resistance. These prepared
		naphthalimides showed better antifungal potency than fluconazole towards some
		"tested fungi including Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida tropicalis and Candida"
		"parapsilosis 22019. Especially, thioether benzimidazole derivative 7f with"
		excellent anti-Candida tropicalis efficacy (MIC = 4 μg/mL) possessed low
		"cytotoxicity, safe hemolysis level and less susceptibility to induce resistance."
		Biochemical interactions displayed that 7f could form a supramolecular complex
		"with DNA to block DNA replication, and constitute a biosupermolecule with"
		cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) from Candida tropicalis to hinder CPR biological
		"function. Additionally, 7f presented strong lipase affinity, which facilitated"
		"its permeation into cell membrane. Moreover, 7f with dynamic antifungal potency"
		promoted the production and accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in
		"cells, which destroyed the antioxidant defence system, led to oxidative stress"
		"with lipid peroxidation, loss of glutathione, membrane dysfunction and metabolic"
		"inactivation, and eventually caused cell death. The chemical and dynamic"
		antifungal synergistic effect initiated by hydroxyethyl naphthalimides was a
		reasonable treatment window for prospective development.

LID	-	e59373
AB	-	BACKGROUND: The epidemiology of candidemia varies depending on the geographic
		region. Little is known about the epidemiology of candidemia in Latin America.
		METHODS: We conducted a 24-month laboratory-based survey of candidemia in 20
		centers of seven Latin American countries. Incidence rates were calculated and
		the epidemiology of candidemia was characterized. RESULTS: Among 672 episodes of
		"candidemia, 297 (44.2%) occurred in children (23.7% younger than 1 year), 36.2%"
		in adults between 19 and 60 years old and 19.6% in elderly patients. The overall
		"incidence was 1.18 cases per 1,000 admissions, and varied across countries, with"
		the highest incidence in Colombia and the lowest in Chile. Candida albicans
		"(37.6%), C. parapsilosis (26.5%) and C. tropicalis (17.6%) were the leading"
		"agents, with great variability in species distribution in the different"
		"countries. Most isolates were highly susceptible to fluconazole, voriconazole,"
		amphotericin B and anidulafungin. Fluconazole was the most frequent agent used as
		"primary treatment (65.8%), and the overall 30-day survival was 59.3%."
		CONCLUSIONS: This first large epidemiologic study of candidemia in Latin America
		"showed a high incidence of candidemia, high percentage of children, typical"
		"species distribution, with C. albicans, C. parapsilosis and C. tropicalis"
		"accounting for the majority of episodes, and low resistance rates."

AB	-	PURPOSE: A systematic epidemiological study on intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired
		"candidemia across India. METHOD: A prospective, nationwide, multicentric,"
		observational study was conducted at 27 Indian ICUs. Consecutive patients who
		acquired candidemia after ICU admission were enrolled during April 2011 through
		September 2012. Clinical and laboratory variables of these patients were
		recorded. The present study is an analysis of data specific for adult patients.
		"RESULTS: Among 1,400 ICU-acquired candidemia cases (overall incidence of 6.51"
		"cases/1,000 ICU admission), 65.2 % were adult. Though the study confirmed the"
		"already known risk factors for candidemia, the acquisition occurred early after"
		"admission to ICU (median 8 days; interquartile range 4-15 days), even infecting"
		patients with lower APACHE II score at admission (median 17.0; mean ± SD 17.2 ±
		5.9; interquartile range 14-20). The important finding of the study was the vast
		spectrum of agents (31 Candida species) causing candidemia and a high rate of
		isolation of Candida tropicalis (41.6 %). Azole and multidrug resistance were
		seen in 11.8 and 1.9 % of isolates. Public sector hospitals reported a
		significantly higher presence of the relatively resistant C. auris (8.2 vs. 3.9
		%; p = 0.008) and C. rugosa (5.6 vs. 1.5 %; p = 0.001). The 30-day crude and
		"attributable mortality rates of candidemia patients were 44.7 and 19.6 %,"
		respectively. Logistic regression analysis revealed significant independent
		"predictors of mortality including admission to public sector hospital, APACHE II"
		"score at admission, underlying renal failure, central venous catheterization and"
		steroid therapy. CONCLUSION: The study highlighted a high burden of candidemia in
		"Indian ICUs, early onset after ICU admission, higher risk despite less severe"
		physiology score at admission and a vast spectrum of agents causing the disease
		with predominance of C. tropicalis.

TI	-	Prevalence of candiduria in diabetic patients attending Gondar University
		"Hospital, Gondar, Ethiopia."
PG	-	102-7
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: About 10% to 15% of in-hospital urinary tract infections (UTIs) are
		"due to Candida species, and the prevalence is still increasing. A cross-sectional"
		study was conducted to determine fungal causative agents of UTI in asymptomatic
		and symptomatic diabetic patients and associated risk factors. MATERIALS AND
		"METHODS: Between May and June 2010, a total of 422 diabetic patients with"
		asymptomatic UTI (n = 387) and symptomatic UTI (n = 35) were investigated for UTI
		at Gondar University Hospital. Clean-catch midstream urine specimens were
		collected from each participant. Fungal urine culture and identification were
		done using standard microbiologic procedure. RESULTS: The age range of the
		"participants was 20 to 84 years (mean, 42.3 years). Significant candiduria was"
		"detected in 7.5% and 17.1% of asymptomatic and symptomatic diabetic patients,"
		respectively. The overall prevalence of significant candiduria in both groups was
		"8.3%. Candida species were isolated in 38 urine samples. Of these, 84.2% were"
		from the asymptomatic diabetic patients and the remaining 15.8% were from the
		"symptomatic patients. The most common species were C albicans (42.0%), C glabrata"
		"(34.2%), and C tropicalis (15.8%). Significant candiduria was strongly associated"
		with being female. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of candiduria in diabetic patients
		should not be neglected. Although C albicans is the organism most often
		"associated with serious fungal infection, other Candida species are also isolated"
		as clinically important opportunistic pathogens in type 2 diabetic patients.

AB	-	"Demographic information, risk factors, therapy, and outcome for all patients who"
		"had candidemia at Barnes Hospital, St. Louis, between 1 September 1988 and 1"
		September 1989 were retrospectively reviewed. One hundred six candidemic patients
		"were identified, representing 0.5% of all medical and surgical discharges and"
		0.33% of total patient discharges. These percentages represent a 20-fold increase
		in the incidence of candidemia at our hospital in comparison with that during
		"1976-1979. Candida albicans was the most frequently isolated species (63%),"
		"followed by Candida tropicalis (17%), Candida glabrata (13%), Candida"
		"parapsilosis (6.5%), and Candida krusei (0.9%). Overall mortality was 57%, and 14"
		(23%) of 60 deaths occurred within 48 hours of the detection of candidemia.
		Mortality was associated with higher APACHE II scores (25 for nonsurvivors vs. 16
		"for survivors; P = .0001), the presence of a rapidly fatal underlying illness (P"
		"= .0009), and sustained positivity of blood cultures (P = .02). In cases of"
		"sustained candidemia, the isolation of non-albicans Candida species also"
		correlated with increased mortality (8 of 8 vs. 10 of 21; P = .005). Thirty
		"candidemic patients (28%) did not receive any antifungal therapy, and 19 (63%) of"
		these untreated patients died. Eleven untreated patients (37%) survived without
		sequelae. There has been a marked increase in the incidence of candidemia in our
		institution that is associated with a high overall mortality. Candidemia lasting
		less than 24 hours was associated with a lower mortality than was that of longer
		duration. Severity of illness and duration of candidemia should be used as
		stratifying factors in prospective studies to determine optimum therapy.

AB	-	The surveillance and analysis of candidemia risk factors are necessary to reduce
		treatment failures in cancer patients. By understanding the geographic
		distribution of Candida spp. and their in vitro minimal antifungal inhibitory
		"concentrations in cancer patients, optimal treatment protocols may be developed."
		On reviewing the candidemia data of cancer patients in Tianjin Medical University
		"Cancer Institute and Hospital (TMUCIH), we found that the incidence rate was"
		"0.34-0.53 cases per 1,000 admissions from 2008-2010, and the crude mortality was"
		"31.7% during 2006-2010. Candida albicans was the most common species (48.8%),"
		"followed by C. parapsilosis (24.4%), C. glabrata (9.8%), C. tropicalis (9.8%), C."
		"lusitaniae (4.9%), and C. famata (2.3%). All species were susceptible to azoles"
		and showed low MICs to amphotericin B. Surgery was an independent risk factor in
		"candidemia caused by C. albicans. Furthermore, among all cancer patients, those"
		with digestive system neoplasms were most likely to develop candidemia. In
		"addition, cancer patients with metastasis to distant organs were significantly"
		more prone to non-C. albicans Candida infection. This study provided data on the
		epidemiology of candidemia in cancer patients in North China which may be of
		value in such individuals with yeast infections.

AB	-	This study reviews data on patients with fungemia and confirms the high
		prevalence (50%) of infections caused by non-albicans species of Candida.
		Fungemia due to C. albicans or Torulopsis glabrata occurred significantly more
		"often in patients with a solid tumor, while fungemia due to Candida tropicalis or"
		Candida krusei was significantly more common in patients with hematologic
		"malignancy (P = .001). For 31% of patients, only a single blood culture was"
		"positive for yeasts, and the prognosis for these patients was not significantly"
		different than that for patients with three or more positive blood cultures (P =
		"1), including those who had C. albicans fungemia. The overall mortality rate was"
		"41.8%, which is much lower than that previously reported in studies of patients"
		with cancer. No significant difference was observed between patients treated with
		amphotericin B and those treated with fluconazole in this retrospective analysis.
		Although no significant difference was observed in the mortality rate among
		"patients who had fungemia with or without neutropenia, the incidence of"
		disseminated candidiasis was significantly higher among neutropenic patients (P =
		.03).

AB	-	AIM: The present retrospective study was carried out to investigate the
		epidemiological characteristics and the prognostic factors of candidemia among
		"elderly patients. METHODS: From 2009 to 2012, elderly patients with candidemia"
		"were identified at the Chi Mei medical center, a 900-bed regional hospital in"
		"southern Taiwan, and their medical records retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS:"
		"During the 4-year period, a total of 175 episodes of candidemia among elderly"
		patients were identified. The patients ranged in age from 65 to 98 years (mean
		76.4 years) and the mean (±standard deviation) Charlson Comorbidity Index score
		"was 7.6 (±2.7). Cancer was the most common underlying disease (n = 127, 72.6%),"
		"followed by diabetes mellitus (n = 69, 39.4%). Candida albicans (n = 96, 54.9%)"
		"was the most common pathogen, followed by C. tropicalis (n = 39, 22.3%),"
		"C. parapsilosis (n = 24, 13.7%), C. glabrata (n = 22, 12.6%), C. guilliermondii"
		"(n = 2, 1.1%) and Candida species (n = 3, 1.7%). The ratio of C. albicans causing"
		candidemia was significantly higher in young-old than old-old patients (64.1% vs
		"47.4%, P = 0.027). The overall in-hospital mortality was 50.3%. Multivariate"
		analysis showed that the in-hospital mortality was only significantly associated
		"with jaundice (P = 0.004), no use of antifungal agent (P = 0.021) and intensive"
		care unit admission (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Candidemia can develop in elderly
		"patients, especially patients with cancer or other risk factors. C. albicans is"
		"the most common Candida species causing candidemia among elderly patients,"
		followed by C. tropicalis. The mortality of candidemia among elderly patients
		remains high.

AB	-	PURPOSE: This study examined the prevalence of Candida species in the saliva of
		oral squamous cell carcinoma patients and its effect on the mortality rate.
		MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred patients with oral cavity squamous cell
		carcinoma undergoing protocol treatment at Helsinki University Hospital were
		"recruited into the study from March 2011 through 2014. For comparison, 75"
		age-matched controls with no current or previously treated oral cancer were
		recruited. Paraffin-stimulated whole saliva samples were collected and cultivated
		"on CHROMagar Candida medium (CHROMagar, Paris, France) to establish possible"
		"Candida growth. The API ID 32C yeast identification kit (bioMérieux, Lyon,"
		"France) and Bichro-Dubli Fumouze latex agglutination test (Fumouze Diagnostics,"
		"Levallois-Perret, France) were used for further identification of different"
		Candida species. Patients' medical records were studied for information on their
		"health habits and general health status, as well as tumor-related data. The"
		patients' status regarding being alive and cancer free was checked at a follow-up
		point in December 2017. Descriptive statistics and cross tabulation were carried
		"out, and the P value was set at .05. RESULTS: Candida species were detected in"
		"74% of the oral cancer patients' samples, with C. albicans being the most common"
		"species (84%). Other species identified were C. dubliniensis (8%), C. tropicalis"
		"(4%), C. glabrata (3%), C. parapsilosis (3%), C. sake (3%), C. krusei (1%), and"
		"C. guilliermondii (1%). After the follow-up period, 63% of the patients were"
		alive and 86% of them were cancer free. Harboring Candida species in the saliva
		was not associated with any increase in the mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS: C.
		albicans was common in the oral cavity of the oral squamous cell carcinoma
		"patients. However, in this patient population, we did not observe a statistically"
		significant effect of the yeast on the mortality rate.

AB	-	Candida parapsilosis complex (CPC) is the third Candida species isolated in blood
		"cultures of patients from our Hospital, following C. albicans and C. tropicalis."
		"From 2006 to 2010, the median annual distribution of CPC was 8 cases/year."
		Records of 36 patients were reviewed. CPC were 31 (86.1%) C. parapsilosis; 4
		(11.1%) C. orthopsilosis; and 1 (2.8%) C. metapsilosis. Clinical characteristics
		"were central venous catheter, 34 (94.4%); parental nutrition, 25 (70%); surgery,"
		"27 (57.9%); prior bacteremia, 20 (51.3%); malignancy, 18 (50%). General mortality"
		was 47.2%. Death was higher in immunosuppressed patients (17 vs. 11; p = 0.003).
		Three out four (75%) patients with C. orthopsilosis and 14 out 31 (45.2%) with C.
		parapsilosis died (p = 0.558). Thirty-nine individual isolates were tested for
		"susceptibility to seven antifungal drugs, with MICs values showing susceptibility"
		"to all of them. Two isolates, one C. orthopsilosis and one C. parapsilosis, had"
		fluconazole MIC = 4 μg/mL. Differentiation among CPC has implication in caring
		"for patients with invasive candidiasis since there are differences in virulence,"
		pathogenicity and drug susceptibility. A method targeting the topoisomerase II
		gene based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) was developed. LAMP
		emerges as a promising tool for the identification of fungal species due to the
		"high sensitivity and specificity. LAMP can be performed at the point-of-care,"
		"being no necessary the use of expensive equipment. In our study, the method was"
		successful comparing to the DNA sequencing and proved to be a reliable and fast
		assay to distinguish the three species of CPC.

LID	-	10.1007/s11046-021-00569-7 [doi]
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Candida species is the most common cause of invasive fungal
		infection. With the wide variation in species distribution and antifungal
		"susceptibility of causative agents, local epidemiological profiles are needed to"
		provide effective guidelines for the treatment of invasive candidiasis.
		OBJECTIVE: To find out the species distribution and antifungal susceptibilities
		of Candida strains isolated from patients in an intensive care unit (ICU) of
		Vietnam. METHODS: All patients in ICU of Vietnam National Hospital of Burn with
		Candida isolation reported from January 2017 to December 2019 were
		retrospectively studied. Species identification and antifungal susceptibility
		testing were performed using VITEK 2 Compact. The identification was reconfirmed
		by sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer regions when needed. RESULTS: A
		total of 186 yeasts belonging to ten species were collected. The most common
		"agent was C. tropicalis (45.7%), followed by C. albicans (42.4%), and C."
		parapsilosis (7.53%). The isolated yeasts showed less susceptibility to
		"fluconazole (resistant rate R 10.7%) than to micafungin, caspofungin, flucytosine"
		"and amphotericin B (R 0%, 0.6%, 2.3% and 3.4%, respectively, p < 0.05). C."
		albicans isolates were more susceptible to fluconazole (R 5.2%) than C.
		tropicalis (R 15.7%). Resistance to voriconazole was seen only among C. albicans
		(3.9%) and C. tropicalis isolates (9.9%). CONCLUSION: Non-albicans species
		"(especially C. tropicalis) is the predominant species, and there is a significant"
		proportion of isolates with reduced susceptibility to azole but not to
		echinocandin.

PG	-	576-81
LID	-	10.1111/myc.12077 [doi]
AB	-	Significant changes in the frequency of candidaemia and the distribution of
		causative species have been noted worldwide in the last two decades. In this
		"study, we present the results of the first multicentre survey of fungaemia in"
		Polish hospitals. A total of 302 candidaemia episodes in 294 patients were
		identified in 20 hospitals during a 2-year period. The highest number of
		"infections was found in intensive care (30.8%) and surgical (29.5%) units,"
		"followed by haematological (15.9%), 'others' (19.2%) and neonatological (4.6%)"
		units. Candida albicans was isolated from 50.96% of episodes; its prevalence was
		"higher in intensive care unit and neonatology (61.22% and 73.33%, respectively),"
		and significantly lower in haematology (22%; P < 0.001). The frequency of C.
		krusei and C. tropicalis was significantly higher (24% and 18%) in haematology
		"(P < 0.02); whereas, the distribution of C. glabrata (14.1%) and C. parapsilosis"
		(13.1%) did not possess statistically significant differences between compared
		departments. Obtained data indicates that species distribution of Candida blood
		"isolates in Polish hospitals reflects worldwide trends, particularly a decrease"
		in the prevalence of infections due to C. albicans.

TI	-	Epidemiology and predictors of mortality in cases of Candida bloodstream
		"infection: results from population-based surveillance, barcelona, Spain, from"
		2002 to 2003.
PG	-	1829-35
AB	-	We conducted population-based surveillance for Candida bloodstream infections in
		"Spain to determine its incidence, the extent of antifungal resistance, and risk"
		factors for mortality. A case was defined as the first positive blood culture for
		"any Candida spp. in a resident of Barcelona, from 1 January 2002 to 31 December"
		2003. We defined early mortality as occurring between days 3 to 7 after
		candidemia and late mortality as occurring between days 8 to 30. We detected 345
		"cases of candidemia, for an average annual incidence of 4.3 cases/100,000"
		"population, 0.53 cases/1,000 hospital discharges, and 0.73 cases/10,000"
		"patient-days. Outpatients comprised 11% of the cases, and 89% had a central"
		venous catheter (CVC) at diagnosis. Overall mortality was 44%. Candida albicans
		"was the most frequent species (51% of cases), followed by Candida parapsilosis"
		"(23%), Candida tropicalis (10%), Candida glabrata (8%), Candida krusei (4%), and"
		other species (3%). Twenty-four isolates (7%) had decreased susceptibility to
		"fluconazole (MIC > or = 16 microg/ml). On multivariable analysis, early death was"
		"independently associated with hematological malignancy (odds ratio [OR], 3.5; 95%"
		"confidence interval [CI], 1.1 to 10.4). Treatment with antifungals (OR, 0.05; 95%"
		"CI, 0.01 to 0.2) and removal of CVCs (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1 to 0.9) were"
		"protective factors for early death. Receiving adequate treatment, defined as"
		"having CVCs removed and administration of an antifungal medication (OR, 0.2; 95%"
		"CI, 0.08 to 0.8), was associated with lower odds of late mortality; intubation"
		"(OR, 7.5; 95% CI, 2.6 to 21.1) was associated with higher odds. The incidence of"
		candidemia and prevalence of fluconazole resistance are similar to other European
		"countries, indicating that routine antifungal susceptibility testing is not"
		warranted. Antifungal medication and catheter removal are critical in preventing
		mortality.

LID	-	e99103
AB	-	AIM: The study of candidemia in cancer patients has been limited. This
		retrospective study aims to investigate the epidemiologic characteristics and
		prognostic factors of candidemia among cancer patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
		"From 2009 to 2012, cancer patients with candidemia were identified at a hospital"
		in Taiwan. The medical records of all patients with bloodstream infections due to
		Candida species were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: During the four-year
		"period, a total of 242 episodes of candidemia were identified among cancer"
		"patients. Half of these patients were classified as elderly (≥65 years old), and"
		more than 95% of the candidemia episodes were classified as healthcare-associated
		"infections. Among the 242 cancer patients with candidemia, head and neck cancer"
		"was the most common, followed by gastrointestinal tract and lung cancer."
		"Additionally, most of the patients had variable underlying conditions, such as"
		the presence of CVC (99%) or prior exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics (93%)
		"and were receiving an immunosuppressant (86%). Overall, C. albicans (n = 132,"
		"54.5%) was the most common pathogen, followed by C. tropicalis (n = 52, 21.5%),"
		"C. parapsilosis (n = 38, 15.7%), and C. glabrata (n = 29, 12.0%). Seventeen"
		"patients had polycandidal candidemia, and 77 patients had concomitant bacteremia."
		Approximately one-third of the patients required admission to the intensive care
		"unit (ICU) or mechanical ventilation, and the overall in-hospital mortality was"
		50.8%. Multivariable analysis showed that the in-hospital mortality was
		significantly associated with only the non-use of antifungal agents and acute
		respiratory failure (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Candidemia can develop in patients
		"with both solid cancer and hematological malignancy, especially for patients with"
		"underlying conditions. Overall, the associated morbidity and mortality due to"
		Candidemia remain high. It was also determined that the non-use of antifungal
		agents and acute respiratory failure conditions were associated with in-hospital
		mortality.

AB	-	Candida blood steam infection is a life-threatening disease that seems to be
		under estimated. Understanding epidemiology of such disease is crucial for
		"improved diagnosis, optimized treatment, and better outcome. Through this"
		"retrospective study, we aimed to determine the incidence of candidemia in a"
		"secondary care hospital, and to describe the epidemiology and outcome of"
		candidemia among adult patients. The incidence of candidemia for all age groups
		"was 0.24, 0.16 and 0.15 cases/1000 patient-days in 2014, 2015 and 2016"
		"respectively. Among adult patients, 82 cases were identified. The patients had"
		"the following clinical characteristics with varying proportions: old age,"
		"diabetes, antibiotic exposure, use of vascular catheter, abdominal surgery, ICU"
		"hospitalization, haemodialysis, and total parenteral nutrition. All-cause 30-day"
		mortality was 54% and ICU hospitalization was a recognized risk factor for death.
		"The leading causative agents were Candida albicans (32%), and Candida"
		"parapsilosis (32%), followed by Candida tropicalis (20%), Candida glabrata (13%)"
		"and one each by Candida dubliniensis, Candida famata, and Candida auris. Almost"
		all tested isolates were susceptible to caspofungin and amphotericin B. With
		"regard to fluconazole, C. glabrata showed variable susceptibility. Other species"
		"were susceptible except one isolate, each of C. parapsilosis and C. auris. The"
		study highlights the growing importance of non-C. albicans Candida species in the
		etiology of candidemia. Emergence of C. auris is a warning sign and needs to be
		closely monitored.

		retrospective study of Candida spp. profiles and their in vitro antifungal
		susceptibility was based on analysis requests for 186 Candida non-albicans and 61
		"C. albicans during three periods (2005-2007, 2009-2011, and 2012-2014) over the"
		span of the last 10 years at the American University of Beirut Medical Center
		"(AUBMC), a major tertiary care center in Lebanon. Identification of Candida was"
		"done using the API 20C AUX system, and the E-test was used to determine the"
		minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of antifungal agents. RESULTS: Among the
		"1,300-1,500 Candida isolates recovered yearly, C. albicans rates decreased from"
		"86% in 2005 to around 60% in 2014. Simultaneously, the non-albicans rates"
		"increased from 14% in 2005 to around 40% in 2014, revealing 11 species, the most"
		"frequent of which were C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, and C. parapsilosis. All these"
		"demonstrated high resistance (35%-79%) against itraconazole, but remained"
		uniformly susceptible (100%) to amphotericin B. Though C. albicans and the other
		"species maintained high susceptibility against fluconazole and voriconazole,"
		"their MIC90 showed an elevated trend over time, and C. glabrata had the highest"
		resistance rates. CONCLUSIONS: The observed rise in resistance among Candida spp.
		in Lebanon mandates the need for close surveillance and monitoring of antifungal
		drug resistance for both epidemiologic and treatment purposes.

		"microbiology, outcomes, and risk factors for mortality of candidemia in adult"
		surgical patients in Shenyang from 2012 to 2018. METHODS: We designed a
		retrospective observational study of adult patients with candidemia in a teaching
		hospital including three hospital campuses. Data regarding clinical and
		demographic characteristics were collected from the patient's medical records.
		"RESULTS: Of the 236 cases of candidemia, 172 (72.9%) were identified in surgical"
		"patients, including 146 (84.9%) general surgeries, 11 (6.4%) urologic surgeries,"
		"6 (3.5%) thoracic surgeries, and others. Higher proportions of solid tumors,"
		"total parenteral nutrition, the presence of a urinary catheter, and the presence"
		of a gastric tube were observed in surgical patients with candidemia versus
		"non-surgical ones, whereas the percentages of hematological malignancy, diabetes"
		"mellitus, and renal replacement therapy were relatively lower in surgical"
		"patients. Renal failure, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia were less common"
		laboratory findings in surgical patients with candidemia than compared to
		"non-surgical ones. Among surgical patients with candidemia, Candida parapsilosis"
		"was the predominant species (43%), followed by C. albicans (33.7%), C. glabrata"
		"(11%), C. tropicalis (8.1%), and others (4.1%). Overall susceptibility,"
		"susceptible dose dependent or intermediate susceptibility, and resistance to"
		"fluconazole were detected in 73.3, 19.8, and 3.5% Candida isolates from surgical"
		"patients, respectively, but no resistance to amphotericin B was observed."
		"Overall, the 30-day mortality in surgical patients was 19.2%. At multivariable"
		"analysis, independent risk factors for death in surgical patients with candidemia"
		"were ICU stay, thrombocytopenia, and C. albicans infection. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical"
		patients account for the majority of candidemia cases. Among patients with recent
		"surgery, risk factors for species distribution, antifungal sensitivity patterns"
		"of Candida isolates causing candidemia, and independent risk factors for"
		mortality should be evaluated and considered for a better outcome in the
		antifungal treatment.

AB	-	Candidemia has been considered a persistent public health problem with great
		impact on hospital costs and high mortality. We aimed to evaluate the
		epidemiology and prognostic factors of candidemia in a tertiary hospital in
		Northeast Brazil from January 2011 to December 2016. Demographic and clinical
		data of patients were retrospectively obtained from medical records and
		antifungal susceptibility profiling was performed using the broth microdilution
		method. A total of 68 episodes of candidemia were evaluated. We found an average
		incidence of 2.23 episodes /1000 admissions and a 30-day mortality rate of 55.9%.
		"The most prevalent species were Candida albicans (35.3%), Candida tropicalis"
		"(27.4%), Candida parapsilosis (21.6%) and Candida glabrata (11.8%). Higher"
		mortality rates were observed in cases of candidemia due to C. albicans (61.1%)
		"and C. glabrata (100%), especially when compared to C. parapsilosis (27.3%)."
		Univariate analysis revealed some variables which significantly increased the
		"probability of death: older age (P = 0.022; odds ratio [OR] = 1.041), severe"
		"sepsis (P < 0.001; OR = 8.571), septic shock (P = 0.035; OR = 3.792), hypotension"
		"(P = 0.003; OR = 9.120), neutrophilia (P = 0.046; OR = 3.080), thrombocytopenia"
		"(P = 0.002; OR = 6.800), mechanical ventilation (P = 0.009; OR = 8.167) and"
		greater number of surgeries (P = 0.037; OR = 1.920). Multivariate analysis showed
		"that older age (P = 0.040; OR = 1.055), severe sepsis (P = 0.009; OR = 9.872) and"
		hypotension (P = 0.031; OR = 21.042) were independently associated with worse
		"prognosis. There was no resistance to amphotericin B, micafungin or itraconazole"
		"and a low rate of resistance to fluconazole (5.1%). However, 20.5% of the Candida"
		isolates were susceptible dose-dependent (SDD) to fluconazole and 7.7% to
		"itraconazole. In conclusion, our results could assist in the adoption of"
		strategies to stratify patients at higher risk for developing candidemia and
		"worse prognosis, in addition to improve antifungal management."

		"(IC) in a Beijing hospital, to identify risk factors associated with IC caused by"
		"non-C. albicans Candida (NAC), and to determine risk factors for infection caused"
		by NAC species not susceptible to fluconazole. Clinical data from 141 patients
		admitted to Beijing Chaoyang Hospital (from 2001-2010) diagnosed with IC were
		retrospectively analyzed. The incidence of IC increased during the 10-year
		"period, but the proportion due to NAC did not change significantly in that of 141"
		"cases, 55 (39%) were due to NAC and 86 (61%) to C. albicans (CA). The NAC species"
		"isolated included C. tropicalis (25 of 141, 18%), C. glabrata (14 of 141, 9.9%),"
		"C. parapsilosis (eight of 141, 5.7%), C. krusei (three of 141, 2.1%) and C."
		"lusitaniae (one of 141, 0.71%); other Candida species accounted for four of the"
		141 cases (2.8%). Twenty-one isolates (38%) of NAC were not susceptible to
		fluconazole. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) (OR 4.2; 95% CI 3.5-58; P < 0.001)
		and previous fluconazole therapy (OR 7.7; 95% CI 2.2-27; P = 0.001) were risk
		"factors for invasive NAC candidiasis, whereas patient age ≥65 years (OR 0.37; CI"
		0.16-0.88; P = 0.025) and invasive mechanical ventilation (OR 0.22; CI
		0.069-0.70; P =0.010) were connected with invasive CA candidiasis. Prior
		fluconazole therapy was a risk factor (P = 0.007) for infections caused by NAC
		"not susceptible to fluconazole. In conclusion, TPN and prior fluconazole therapy"
		"are independent risk factors for NAC infection, while prior fluconazole therapy"
		is a risk factor for infection due to NAC not susceptible to fluconazole.

		as a guide for implementation of T2MR (T2CANDIDA®) for rapid diagnosis of
		candidemia.
PG	-	350-354
LID	-	10.1093/mmy/myaa056 [doi]
AB	-	The aim of this work was to study the epidemiology of candidemia in our hospital
		in order to determine whether the T2MR system might be a useful tool for early
		diagnosis of candidemia in selected units. We perform a retrospective review of
		all candidemia episodes registered in the last 12 years in selected units of our
		hospital in adult and pediatric patients. Candida species and antifungal
		"susceptibility patterns were registered. A total of 686 isolates were registered,"
		of which 625 were infections due to the five most common species of Candida. C.
		albicans (45.6%) and C. parapsilosis (33.1%) were the predominant species found
		in our institution. In adults these species were closely followed by C. glabrata
		(12-21%) in all units. While in pediatric medical and intensive care units
		"(PICU), these species were followed by other uncommon yeasts. Resistance rates to"
		triazoles were low in C. albicans and C. parapsilosis. In C. glabrata and C.
		tropicalis the resistance rates to fluconazole ranged from 10.86 to 6.67%.
		Resistance rates for echinocandins were very low and all strains were susceptible
		to amphotericin B. T2Candida® might be useful to guide antifungal targeted
		treatment and discontinuation of antifungal empirical treatment in those units
		where the five most common Candida species represent more than the ninety percent
		of the isolates. The selection of medical and surgical units should be based on
		local epidemiology and antifungal susceptibility patterns. Incidence should be
		taken into account in order to make clinical decisions based on negative results.
		LAY ABSTRACT: T2Candida® might be useful selectively in clinical units according
		"to their local epidemiology, antifungal resistance patterns, and incidence of"
		candidemia. It optimizes the clinical value of positive results supporting
		decisions about targeted therapies or discontinuations based on negative results.

AB	-	AIM: The aim of the present study was to investigate predominant pathogens and
		predictors of 28-day mortality of older Chinese patients with nosocomial urinary
		tract infections (NUTI). METHODS: We retrospectively studied 1122 older patients
		"(aged ≥60 years) with culture-positive NUTI in Guangdong General Hospital,"
		"Guangzhou, China, from January 2009 to December 2014. The clinical features,"
		microbial distributions and outcomes of these patients were recorded and compared
		between survival and death patients. Multivariate logistic regression was carried
		out to identify independent predictors of 28-day mortality. RESULTS: The present
		"results showed the all-cause mortality was 8.3%, and NUTI mortality was 1.43%."
		"The proportions of Candida albicans (P = 0.004), Acinetobacter baumannii (P"
		= 0.045) and Candida tropicalis (P < 0.001) in the death group were significantly
		higher than those in the survival group. Multivariate analysis showed two novel
		"risk factors for mortality of older patients with NUTI, which were higher"
		"Charlson Comorbidity Index (odds ratio [OR] 1.205, 95% confidence interval (CI)"
		"1.088-1.334] and lower level of serum prealbumin (OR 0.995, 95% CI 0.990-0.999)."
		"Furthermore, previous use of antibiotics (OR 1.984, 95% CI 1.106-3.559),"
		"inappropriate antimicrobial therapy (OR 1.883, 95% CI 1.144-3.098), intensive"
		"care unit stay (OR 4.082, 95% CI 2.469-6.749) and higher concentration of serum"
		"C-reactive protein (OR 1.005, 95% CI 1.001-1.010) were independent prognostic"
		factors for 28-day mortality in older patients with NUTI. CONCLUSIONS: NUTI is
		associated with a high 28-day in-hospital mortality rate in older patients. We
		"should evaluate the comorbidity, nutritional status, inflammatory markers,"
		"department staying and drug sensitivity test, and choose systematic therapy"
		strategies for these older patients with NUTI. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2019; 19:

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Oral candidiasis is one of the most common opportunistic infection
		in HIV/AIDS patient and it is caused by Candida species. The low absolute
		CD4+T-lymphocyte count has traditionally been cited as the greatest risk factor
		for the development of Oral Candidiasis. The aim of this study was to identify
		"Candida species isolated from the oral cavity of HIV/AIDS patients, to determine"
		their in vitro antifungal susceptibility and to investigate the possible risk
		factors associated with oral candidiasis. METHODS: This was a hospital based
		cross sectional study that was carried out for a period of 3 months amongst
		"HIV/AIDS patients in Kumba District Hospital, whether on HAART or not. Mouth"
		swabs were collected from 378 participants using sterile cotton wool swabs and
		5ml venous blood were collected for determination of CD4 cell. Candida species
		were isolated and identified. Antifungal sensitivity testing was performed using
		modified kirby-bauer susceptibility testing technique. RESULTS: Candida species
		were present in 42.86% of the samples and Candida albicans was the most prevalent
		"(60.2%) amongst the six Candida isolates identified, followed by Candida glabrata"
		"(16.9%), Candida krusei (12.3%), Candida tropicalis (6.4%), Candida parapsilosis"
		"(2.3%) and Candida pseudotropicalis (1.8%). Pregnancy, oral hygiene and"
		antibiotic usage were significantly associated with oral candidiasis in HIV/AIDS
		patients (P<0.05). Oral candidiasis was mostly frequent in HIV/AIDS patients
		between 21-40 years. A CD4 cell count less than 200 cells/μl was a significant
		risk factor for acquiring oral candidiasis in HIV/AIDS patients (P<0.001).
		Nystatin was the most sensitive drug (83.6%) meanwhile ketonazole was the most
		"resistant drug (29.2%), followed by fluconazole (24.6%) to all oral Candida"
		isolates. CONCLUSION: Oral Candida colonization occurs more frequently in
		HIV/AIDS patients and the is a need for the government to implement regular
		"checks for opportunistic infections in HIV/AIDS patients, including oral"
		candidiasis in HIV/AIDS patients to monitor disease progression and prevent
		subsequent complications such as candidemia and diarrhea.

		"infections (BSI), responsible for significant mortality and morbidity among"
		hospitalized patients. The epidemiology and species distribution vary from
		different regions. The goals of this study were to report the current
		epidemiology of Candida BSI in a Shanghai Teaching Hospital and estimate the

		"2008 to December 2012, all consecutive patients who developed Candida BSI at"
		"Ruijin University Hospital were enrolled. Underlying diseases, clinical severity,"
		"species distribution, antifungal therapy and its impact on the outcome were"
		"analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 121 episodes of Candida BSI were identified, with"
		"an incidence of 0.32 episodes/1,000 admissions (0.21 in 2008 and 0.42 in 2012)"
		"The proportion of candidemia caused by non-albicans species (62.8%), including C."
		"parapsilosis (19.8%), C. tropicalis (14.9%), C. glabrata (7.4%), C."
		"guilliermondii (5.8%), C. sake (5.0%) was higher than that of candidemia caused"
		by C. albicans (37.2%). The overall crude 28-day mortality was 28.1% and
		significantly reduced with appropriate empiric antifungal therapy administered
		"within 5 days (P = 0.006). Advanced age (OR 1.04; P = 0.014),"
		neutropenia < 500/mm3 (OR 17.44; P < 0.001) were independent risk factors for
		"28-day mortality, while appropriate empiric antifungal therapy (OR 0.369;"
		P = 0.035) was protective against 28-day mortality. CONCLUSION: The epidemiology
		of candidemia in Shanghai differed from that observed in Western countries.
		Appropriate empiric antifungal therapy influenced the short-term survival.

		"nine antifungal drugs of Candida parapsilosis species complex, Candida"
		"tropicalis, Candida glabrata species complex and Candida krusei isolates from"
		patients with invasive candidiasis at 11 hospitals over 3 years. Isolates were
		identified by MALDI-TOF MS supplemented by DNA sequencing. MICs were determined
		by Sensititre YeastOne(TM) using current clinical breakpoints/epidemiological
		"cut-off values to assign susceptibility (or WT), and by CLSI M44-A2 disc"
		"diffusion for fluconazole and voriconazole. RESULTS: Of 1072 isolates, 392"
		"(36.6%) were C. parapsilosis species complex. C. tropicalis, C. glabrata species"
		"complex and C. krusei comprised 35.4%, 24.3% and 3.7% of the isolates,"
		respectively. Over 99.3% of the isolates were of WT phenotype to amphotericin B
		and 5-flucytosine. Susceptibility/WT rates to azoles among C. parapsilosis
		"species complex were ≥97.5%. However, 11.6% and 9.5% of C. tropicalis isolates"
		"were non-susceptible to fluconazole and voriconazole, respectively (7.1% were"
		resistant to both). Approximately 14.3% of C. glabrata sensu stricto isolates
		"(n = 258) were fluconazole resistant, and 11.6% of C. glabrata sensu stricto"
		isolates were cross-resistant to fluconazole and voriconazole. All C. krusei
		"isolates were susceptible/WT to voriconazole, posaconazole and itraconazole."
		"Overall, 97.7%-100% of isolates were susceptible to caspofungin, micafungin and"
		"anidulafungin, but 2.3% of C. glabrata were non-susceptible to anidulafungin."
		There was no azole/echinocandin co-resistance. Disc diffusion and Sensititre
		YeastOne(TM) methods showed >95% categorical agreement for fluconazole and
		"voriconazole. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, reduced azole susceptibility was seen"
		among C. tropicalis. Resistance to echinocandins was uncommon.

TI	-	Characteristics and outcomes of patients with postoperative Candida versus
		bacterial mediastinitis: a case-matched comparative study.
PG	-	523-530
LID	-	10.1093/ejcts/ezab437 [doi]
AB	-	"OBJECTIVES: Postoperative mediastinitis, a feared complication after cardiac"
		"surgery, is associated with high mortality, especially of critically ill"
		"patients. Candida species infections are rare and severe, with poorly known"
		"outcomes. We conducted a case-control study to describe the characteristics,"
		management and outcomes of patients with postoperative Candida mediastinitis.
		"METHODS: This French, monocentre, retrospective study included all patients with"
		postoperative Candida mediastinitis (January 2003-February 2020) requiring
		intensive care unit admission. Candida mediastinitis patients (henceforth cases)
		"were matched 1:1 with postoperative bacterial mediastinitis (henceforth control),"
		"based on 3 factors during mediastinitis management: age >40 years, cardiac"
		transplantation and invasive circulatory device used. The primary end point was
		the probability of survival within 1 year after intensive care unit (ICU)
		admission. RESULTS: Forty cases were matched to 40 controls. The global
		"male/female ratio was 2.1, with mean age at admission 47.9 ± 13.8 years. Candida"
		"species were: 67.5% albicans, 17.5% glabrata, 15% parapsilosis, 5.0% tropicalis,"
		2.5% krusei and 2.5% lusitaniae. The median duration of mechanical ventilation
		"was 23, 68.8% of patients received renal replacement therapy and 62.5%"
		extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. The probability of survival within
		the first year after ICU admission was 40 ± 5.5% and was significantly lower for
		"cases than for controls (43 ± 8% vs 80 ± 6.3%, respectively; Log-rank test: P <"
		0.0001). The multivariable Cox proportional hazards model retained only renal
		"replacement therapy [hazard ratio (HR) 3.7, 95% confidence interval (CI)"
		"1.1-13.1; P = 0.04] and Candida mediastinitis (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.1-5.6; P = 0.04)"
		as independently associated with 1-year mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Candida
		mediastinitis is a serious event after cardiac surgery and independently
		associated with 1-year mortality. Further studies are needed to determine whether
		deaths are directly attributable to Candida mediastinitis.

TI	-	Change in species distribution and antifungal susceptibility of candidemias in an
		intensive care unit of a university hospital (10-year experience).
PG	-	325-333
LID	-	10.1007/s10096-020-03994-6 [doi]
AB	-	Candidemia is a nosocomial infection mostly found in critically ill patients. Our
		objectives were to evaluate the change in distribution and resistance profile of
		Candida spp. isolated from candidemic patients in our intensive care unit over
		two 5-year periods spanning 15 years and to evaluate the risk factors. Records
		"from the microbiology laboratory were obtained, from January 2004 to December"
		"2008 and from January 2013 to December 2017, retrospectively. Antifungal"
		susceptibility was performed by E-test and evaluated according to EUCAST
		breakpoints. A total of 210 candidemia cases occurred; 238 Candida spp. were
		"isolated in 197 patients (58.8% male; mean age, 59.2 ± 19.6 years). The most"
		predominant risk factor was central venous catheter use. Species distribution
		"rates were 32%, 28%, 17%, and 11% for C. albicans (n = 76), C. parapsilosis"
		"(n = 67), C. glabrata (n = 40), and C. tropicalis (n = 27), respectively."
		Resistance rate to anidulafungin was high in C. parapsilosis over both periods
		and increased to 73% in the second period. Fluconazole showed a remarkable
		decrease for susceptibility in C. parapsilosis (94 to 49%). The prevalence of MDR
		C. parapsilosis (6%/33%) and C. glabrata (0%/44%) increased in the second period.
		"We observed a predominance of non-albicans Candida spp., with C. parapsilosis"
		being the most frequent and C. glabrata infections presenting with the highest
		mortality. High level of echinocandin resistance in C. parapsilosis and
		increasing prevalences of MDR C. parapsilosis and C. glabrata seem emerging
		challenges in our institution.

TI	-	Type 2 diabetes mellitus and oral Candida colonization: Analysis of risk factors
		in a Sri Lankan cohort.
PG	-	508-516
LID	-	10.1080/00016357.2019.1607547 [doi]
AB	-	Aims: Oral candidiasis is a major oral manifestation of uncontrolled diabetes
		"mellitus, and a number of cofactors are associated with the pathogenesis of this"
		"infection. Here, we describe the prevalence of oral Candida in a Sri Lankan"
		cohort of type 2 diabetes mellitus and risk factors that predispose them to this
		common fungal infection. Methods: A case-control study was conducted in 250
		diabetics with type 2 diabetes and 81 nondiabetic controls. Clinical and
		"demographic data were collected using an interviewer administered questionnaire,"
		and patient records. Oral rinse samples were collected to determine the candidal
		"carriage, and the resultant yeast growth was quantified and speciated using"
		multiplex-PCR and phenotypic analyses. Chi-square test (χ(2) test) and Fisher
		exact test were used for the determination of the significant relationships
		between risk factors and oral candidiasis. Results: The oral prevalence of
		Candida species among both groups was similar (81%) although a significantly
		higher proportion of diabetics (32.8%) yielded >2000 CFU/mL of yeasts compared
		with only 12.3% of the healthy controls (p < .05). Significant associations were
		"noted between oral candidal carriage amongst diabetics, and (i) denture wearing,"
		"(ii) female gender and (iii) cigarette smoking (all, p < .05). Amongst both"
		"groups, C.albicans was the most common Candida species isolated followed by C."
		"parapsilosis, C. tropicalis and C. glabrata. Conclusions: The oral infestation of"
		Candida in our Sri Lankan cohort of diabetics is significantly higher than their
		"healthy counterparts, and co-carriage of multiple yeast species is a common"
		finding in the study population. As there are no previous such reports of the
		"latter phenomenon particularly from the Asian region it is noteworthy, mainly in"
		view of the recent data on the emergence of drug-resistant yeast species the
		world over.

TI	-	Fungemia in patients with leukemia.
PG	-	225-32
AB	-	A nine-year retrospective study on fungemia in patients with leukemia was
		conducted. A total of 79 episodes of fungemia in 77 patients with leukemia were
		documented. Candida parapsilosis fungemia was associated more frequently with the
		presence of a central venous line and to the use of parenteral nutrition than the
		"other fungal species (p = 0.00026 and p = 0.01, respectively). The same fungus"
		was isolated from both blood and surveillance cultures in 95% of Candida albicans
		"and in 89% of Candida tropicalis fungemia (p < 0.01 and p = 0.02, respectively)."
		The neutropenia and fungus colonization that resulted was associated
		"significantly with the presence of invasive disease (p = 0.0024 and p = 0.0028,"
		"respectively). Conversely, central venous catheterization and parenteral"
		nutrition appeared to be associated with episodes without deep tissue invasion (p
		"= 0.000037 and p = 0.001, respectively). Invasive mycosis due to the fungus"
		"isolated from blood was documented in 51 patients with a mortality rate of 69%,"
		"whereas in 20 patients without invasive mycosis, mortality rate was 21% (p ="
		"0.000059). In patients with fungemia, related or unrelated to the presence of a"
		"central venous catheter, mortality was 24% and 64%, respectively (p = 0.00042)."
		Mortality was highest with C. tropicalis (p = 0.0017) and lowest with C.
		parapsilosis (p = 0.057). Severe neutropenia (polymorphonuclears < 100/mmc)
		"appeared associated with a higher mortality rate (p = 0.012), whereas the"
		recovery of neutropenia was related adversely to a fatal outcome (p < 0.01). With
		"antifungal therapy, there was no statistically significant difference whether"
		antifungal therapy was given or not.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

		"Northern Kenya, and the implications on tuberculin skin test screening for"
		DOPT-P.
PG	-	609-13
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To determine the pattern of opportunistic infections such as TB and
		Candida species in HIV infected patients in Northern Kenya. DESIGN:
		"Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Five health facilities in Moyale (n=224), Mandera"
		"(n=121) and Turkana Kakuma; (n=83), Lopiding; (n=94) districts during different"
		periods in 2003. SUBJECTS: Five hundred and fifty two patients. RESULTS: In total
		"94 (18%) patients were found to be HIV positive (Moyale=42, Mandera=13, Turkana;"
		"Kakuma=8, Lopiding=31). Only 65 of 94 HIV positive patients provided saliva"
		"samples. Of these, 11 (17%) were TB smear positive and 19 (29.2%) were colonized"
		by oral Candida species. The Candida isolates were as follows; Co-infection of
		"Candida species and TB (n=4), C. albicans only (n=12), C. tropicalis only (n=1),"
		"C. albicans and C. glabarata (n=1) and C. albicans, C. glabarata and C."
		tropicalis. co-infection (n=1). CONCLUSION: The findings provides an important
		insight into the differences in mucosal susceptibility to bacteria (TB) infection
		"and fungal (Candida species) colonization during HIV immunosuppression, based on"
		"collected blood, sputum and saliva specimens. Further studies are needed to"
		elucidate the comparative transmission dynamics and pathogenetic mechanisms of
		these opportunistic infections-in different regions of Kenya. Such studies would
		improve the efficiency of directly observed preventive therapy programme (DOPT-P)
		whose implementation involves screening by tuberculin skin testing.

		Two Tertiary Care Centers.
PG	-	542-553
LID	-	10.1177/0885066618767835 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive candidiasis is not uncommon in critically ill patients but
		has variable epidemiology and outcomes between intensive care units (ICUs). This
		"study evaluated the epidemiology, characteristics, management, and outcomes of"
		patients with invasive candidiasis at 6 ICUs of 2 tertiary care centers. METHODS:
		This was a prospective observational study of all adults admitted to 6 ICUs in 2
		different hospitals between August 2012 and May 2016 and diagnosed to have
		invasive candidiasis by 2 intensivists according to predefined criteria. The
		"epidemiology of isolated Candida and the characteristics, management, and"
		outcomes of affected patients were studied. Multivariable logistic regression
		analyses were performed to identify the predictors of non-albicans versus
		albicans infection and hospital mortality. RESULTS: Invasive candidiasis was
		"diagnosed in 162 (age 58.4 ± 18.9 years, 52.2% males, 82.1% medical admissions,"
		and admission Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score 24.1 ± 8.4)
		"patients at a rate of 2.6 cases per 100 ICU admissions. On the diagnosis day, the"
		Candida score was 2.4 ± 0.9 in invasive candidiasis compared with 1.6 ± 0.9 in
		"Candida colonization (P < .01). The most frequent species were albicans (38.3%),"
		"tropicalis (16.7%), glabrata (16%), and parapsilosis (13.6%). In patients with"
		"candidemia, antifungal therapy was started on average 1 hour before knowing the"
		"culture result (59.6% of therapy initiated after). Resistance to fluconazole,"
		"caspofungin, and amphotericin B occurred in 27.9%, 2.9%, and 3.1%, respectively."
		The hospital mortality was 58.6% with no difference between albicans and
		"non-albicans infections (61.3% and 54.9%, respectively; P = .44). The independent"
		predictors of mortality were renal replacement therapy after invasive candidiasis
		diagnosis (odds ratio: 5.42; 95% confidence interval: 2.16-13.56) and invasive
		candidiasis leading/contributing to ICU admission versus occurring during
		critical illness (odds ratio: 2.87; 95% confidence interval: 1.22-6.74).
		"CONCLUSIONS: In critically ill patients with invasive candidiasis, non-albicans"
		"was responsible for most cases, and mortality was high (58.6%). Antifungal"
		therapy was initiated after culture results in 60% suggesting low preclinical
		suspicion. Study registration: NCT01490684; registered in ClinicalTrials.gov on
		"February 11, 2012."

AB	-	Candidemia is one of the significant causes of mortality amongst critically ill
		patients in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). This study aimed to assess the
		"incidence, risk factors and antifungal susceptibility pattern in candidemia cases"
		"admitted in ICU in a tertiary care hospital in Jaipur, Rajasthan from June 2021"
		to November 2021. Candida species isolated from blood culture of clinically
		suspected patients of sepsis were defined as candidemia cases. Blood culture and
		antifungal susceptibility testing were performed as per standard laboratory
		protocol. Analyses of risk factors was done between candidemia cases and matched
		controls in a ratio of 1 : 3. Forty-six candidemic cases and 150 matched controls
		were included in the study. C. tropicalis was the most prevalent species (22/46;
		48%) followed by C. auris (8/46; 17%) and C. albicans (7/46; 15%). Candida
		species showed good sensitivity to echinocandins (97%) followed by amphotericin B
		"(87%) and voriconazole (80%). In multivariate analysis, longer stay in ICU,"
		"presence of an indwelling device, use of immunosuppressive drugs and positive"
		SARS-CoV-2 infection were associated with increased risk of candidemia. The
		constant evaluation of risk factors is required as prediction of risks associated
		with candidemia may help to guide targeted preventive measures with reduced
		morbidity and mortality.

AB	-	Candidemia is the main invasive fungal disease among hospitalized patients.
		"Several breakthrough candidemia (BrC) cases have been reported, but few studies"
		"evaluate the epidemiology, risk factors, molecular characterization, antifungal"
		"susceptibility profile and outcome of those patients, especially in developing"
		countries and including patients using broad spectrum antifungals. We conducted a
		"retrospective study from 2011 to 2016, including patients aged 12 years or older"
		with candidemia. Epidemiological characteristics and risk factors for candidemia
		were evaluated and compared with patients with BrC using univariate and
		multivariate analysis. Sequential Candida isolates from BrC were identified by
		"internal transcribed spacer sequencing, genotyped with amplified fragment length"
		"polymorphism fingerprinting (AFLP), and tested for antifungal susceptibility."
		"From 148 candidemia episodes, 27 breakthrough episodes (18%) were identified,"
		with neutropenia and mucositis being independent risk factors for BrC. Candida
		non-albicans was more frequent in the BrC group (P < .001). AFLP showed high
		correlation with conventional methods of identification among breakthrough
		isolates and a high genetic similarity among isolates from the same patient was
		observed. C. albicans was the most susceptible species with low MIC values for
		"all antifungal agents tested. In contrast, we found isolates of C. glabrata, C."
		parapsilosis and C. tropicalis resistant to triazoles and echinocandins. In
		"conclusion, BrC occurred mainly in severely immunosuppressed patients, with"
		neutropenia and mucositis. Mortality did not differ between the groups. Candida
		"non-albicans species were more recovered from BrC, with C. albicans being the"
		most susceptible to antifungals.

AB	-	Candidemia is a growing problem in hospitals all over the world. Despite advances
		"in the medical support of critically ill patients, candidiasis leads to prolonged"
		"hospitalization, and has a crude mortality rate around 50%. We conducted a"
		multicenter surveillance study in 16 hospitals distributed across five regions of
		"Brazil to assess the incidence, species distribution, antifungal susceptibility,"
		and risk factors for bloodstream infections due to Candida species. From June
		"2007 to March 2010, we studied a total of 2,563 nosocomial bloodstream infection"
		(nBSI) episodes. Candida spp. was the 7th most prevalent agent. Most of the
		"patients were male, with a median age of 56 years. A total of 64 patients (46.7%)"
		were in the ICU when candidemia occurred. Malignancies were the most common
		underlying condition (32%). The crude mortality rate of candidemia during the
		hospital admission was 72.2%. Non-albicans species of Candida accounted for 65.7%
		"of the 137 yeast isolates. C. albicans (34.3%), Candida parapsilosis (24.1%),"
		Candida tropicalis (15.3%) and Candida glabrata (10.2%) were the most prevalent
		species. Only 47 out of 137 Candida isolates were sent to the reference
		"laboratory for antifungal susceptibility testing. All C. albicans, C. tropicalis"
		and C. parapsilosis isolates were susceptible to the 5 antifungal drugs tested.
		"Among 11 C. glabrata isolates, 36% were resistant to fluconazole, and 64% SDD."
		All of them were susceptible to anidulafungin and amphotericin B. We observed
		that C. glabrata is emerging as a major player among non-albicans Candida spp.
		and fluconazole resistance was primarily confined to C. glabrata and C. krusei
		strains. Candida resistance to echinocandins and amphotericin B remains rare in
		Brazil. Mortality rates remain increasingly higher than that observed in the
		"Northern Hemisphere countries, emphasizing the need for improving local practices"
		"of clinical management of candidemia, including early diagnosis, source control"
		and precise antifungal therapy.

TI	-	Prevalence and antifungal susceptibility of 442 Candida isolates from blood and
		other normally sterile sites: results of a 2-year (1996 to 1998) multicenter
		"surveillance study in Quebec, Canada."
PG	-	949-53
AB	-	"During a 2-year surveillance program (1996 to 1998) in Quebec, Canada, 442"
		strains of Candida species were isolated from 415 patients in 51 hospitals. The
		"distribution of species was as follows: Candida albicans, 54%; C. glabrata, 15%;"
		"C. parapsilosis, 12%; C. tropicalis, 9%; C. lusitaniae, 3%; C. krusei, 3%; and"
		"Candida spp., 3%. These data, compared to those of a 1985 survey, indicate"
		"variations in species distribution, with the proportions of C. glabrata and C."
		"parapsilosis increasing by 9 and 4%, respectively, and those of C. albicans and"
		"C. tropicalis decreasing by 10 and 7%, respectively. However, these differences"
		are statistically significant for C. glabrata and C. tropicalis only. MICs of
		"amphotericin B were > or =4 microg/ml for 3% of isolates, all of which were"
		non-C. albicans species. Three percent of C. albicans isolates were resistant to
		flucytosine (> or =32 microg/ml). Resistance to itraconazole (> or =1 microg/ml)
		"and fluconazole (> or =64 microg/ml) was observed, respectively, in 1 and 1% of"
		"C. albicans, 14 and 9% of C. glabrata, 5 and 0% of C. tropicalis, and 0% of C."
		parapsilosis and C. lusitaniae isolates. Clinical data were obtained for 343
		"patients. The overall crude mortality rate was 38%, reflecting the multiple"
		serious underlying illnesses found in these patients. Bloodstream infections were
		"documented for 249 patients (73%). Overall, systemic triazoles had been"
		administered to 10% of patients before the onset of candidiasis. The frequency of
		isolation of non-C. albicans species was significantly higher in this group of
		"patients. Overall, only two C. albicans isolates were found to be resistant to"
		"fluconazole. These were obtained from an AIDS patient and a leukemia patient,"
		"both of whom had a history of previous exposure to fluconazole. At present, it"
		appears that resistance to fluconazole in Quebec is rare and is restricted to
		patients with prior prolonged azole treatment.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the prevalence of Candida spp. in
		diabetics and nondiabetics with and without denture stomatitis (DS). STUDY
		DESIGN: Mycologic samples were taken from the dentures of 90 healthy subjects
		"(control group [CG]), 80 denture stomatitis nondiabetics (DSND), and 40 denture"
		stomatitis diabetics (DSD; well controlled type 2) for identification of Candida
		"spp. Results were analyzed by Fisher exact test, Bonferroni-corrected confidence"
		"interval, and χ(2) test (α = .05). RESULTS: Candida albicans was the predominant"
		"species isolated (81.9%; P < .016), with C. tropicalis and C. glabrata"
		"demonstrating similar prevalence (15.71% and 15.24%, respectively). The"
		prevalence of C. albicans and C. tropicalis in the DS groups were significantly
		higher (P < .01) than in the CG. The prevalence of C. tropicalis significantly
		increased with the highest degree of inflammation (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The
		prevalence of Candida spp. was similar between diabetic and nondiabetic patients
		with DS. Candida tropicalis may play a role in the progression of DS.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: This paper aimed to identify and quantify Candida on head and neck
		irradiated patients with two comparative elderly populations. MATERIALS AND
		METHODS: Saliva was sampled from 29 head and neck irradiated patients (group 1)
		34 non-institutionalized elderly patients (group 2) and 29 institutionalized
		"elders (group 3) and matched by age. For quantification, the obtained saliva was"
		"sewed on CHROMagar Candida(®), which was used also for presumptive identification"
		"of Candida, API 20C AUX(®), microculture and RAPD (OPE-18) were used for the"
		"final identification. RESULTS: Among the 92 patients surveyed, 51 (55.4%) had"
		"scores classified as positive for Candida, and among individuals of groups 1 and"
		"3, 58.6% had Candida. There was higher positive/carrier conditions (CFU/sample)"
		"in groups 1 and 3, comparing with group 2 (P=0.011). Gender was not associated"
		with Candida portability (P=0.334). Candida portability was significantly
		associated with the presence of candidosis (P=0.031) and xerostomic state
		"(P=0.007). The isolates and definitive confirmed colonies were Candida albicans,"
		"Candida dubliniensis, Candida tropicalis, Candida krusei, Candida glabrata,"
		"Candida parapsilosis, Candida guilliermondii, Candida lusitaniae, and Candida"
		"kefyr. Among the species identified, C. albicans was the most frequent, followed"
		"by C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis and C. glabrata. C. albicans was more prevalent"
		"in group 2 and 3, 45% and 41.2%, respectively, whereas, the most prevalent"
		"species in group 1 were C. tropicalis (27%), C. albicans and C. parapsilosis"
		"(16.2% for both). On multiple statistical models, only radiotherapic treatment"
		was associated with positiveness to Candida. CONCLUSIONS: Diversification and
		major prevalence of non-albicans species were observed in irradiated patients on
		head and neck and this treatment is straightly associated with fungus
		positiveness.

		active surveillance program.
PG	-	1519-27
AB	-	To determine the incidence of Candida bloodstream infections (BSI) and antifungal
		"drug resistance, population-based active laboratory surveillance was conducted"
		from October 1998 through September 2000 in two areas of the United States
		"(Baltimore, Md., and the state of Connecticut; combined population, 4.7 million)."
		"A total of 1,143 cases were detected, for an average adjusted annual incidence of"
		"10 per 100,000 population or 1.5 per 10,000 hospital days. In 28% of patients,"
		Candida BSI developed prior to or on the day of admission; only 36% of patients
		were in an intensive care unit at the time of diagnosis. No fewer than 78% of
		"patients had a central catheter in place at the time of diagnosis, and 50% had"
		undergone surgery within the previous 3 months. Candida albicans comprised 45% of
		"the isolates, followed by C. glabrata (24%), C. parapsilosis (13%), and C."
		tropicalis (12%). Only 1.2% of C. albicans isolates were resistant to fluconazole
		"(MIC, > or = 64 microg/ml), compared to 7% of C. glabrata isolates and 6% of C."
		tropicalis isolates. Only 0.9% of C. albicans isolates were resistant to
		"itraconazole (MIC, > or = 1 micro g/ml), compared to 19.5% of C. glabrata"
		isolates and 6% of C. tropicalis isolates. Only 4.3% of C. albicans isolates were
		"resistant to flucytosine (MIC, > or = 32 microg/ml), compared to < 1% of C."
		parapsilosis and C. tropicalis isolates and no C. glabrata isolates. As
		"determined by E-test, the MICs of amphotericin B were > or = 0.38 microg/ml for"
		"10% of Candida isolates, > or =1 microg/ml for 1.7% of isolates, and > or = 2"
		microg/ml for 0.4% of isolates. Our findings highlight changes in the
		epidemiology of Candida BSI in the 1990s and provide a basis upon which to
		conduct further studies of selected high-risk subpopulations.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To report a case of Candida glabrata and tropicalis pneumonia in an
		immunocompetent patient. CASE SUMMARY: A 72-year-old male was transferred from an
		"outside institution due to worsening respiratory status, acute kidney injury"
		"secondary to intravenous contrast media, sepsis, and pneumonia with fever and"
		"leukocytosis. Upon admission, he was initiated on treatment for hospital-acquired"
		"pneumonia, but was also concomitantly tested for many other opportunistic"
		infections due to his recent month-long trip to Ecuador where he participated in
		a tribal treatment for neuropathy that involved direct exposure to dead guinea
		"pigs. With completion of cultures and bronchoalveolar lavage, C. glabrata was"
		identified in the blood culture and C. glabrata and C. tropicalis in the
		"bronchoalveolar lavage specimen. One month later, he was admitted due to"
		recurrent pneumonia. The patient unfortunately expired during the second
		"admission, due to complications from chronic respiratory pulmonary disease and"
		"pneumonia. DISCUSSION: Initially, this patient was treated for hospital-acquired"
		"pneumonia, but due to a recent trip to Ecuador, it was soon discovered that this"
		patient had developed an invasive Candida pneumonia. His pulmonary biopsies
		"showed growth of invasive C. glabrata and C. tropicalis, while his blood culture"
		showed C. glabrata. Candida-related lower respiratory tract infections are
		exceptionally rare in immunocompetent patients and require histopathologic
		evidence to confirm the diagnosis. A second blood culture showed that the C.
		"glabrata was still present and the patient had worsening leukocytosis, so"
		micafungin was added to his antimicrobial therapy. CONCLUSION: It is understood
		that pneumonia is rarely caused by Candida species in patients who are admitted
		"to the hospital. However, health care professionals should be aware that Candida"
		pneumonia should be suspected as part of the differential diagnosis even in
		"immunocompetent patients, particularly if they have recently traveled outside the"
		United States.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: There is no data available on the prevalence of oral mucosal lesion
		and candida infection among DM patients which necessitate conducting a local or
		nation-wide study to assess the oral mucosa lesions and candida prevalent in
		"diabetic patients in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. OBJECTIVES: The objective of the"
		"present study was to characterize oral mucosa lesions, and the prevalence of"
		yeasts in diabetic patients and their association with the risk factors in
		comparison with a group of non-diabetic controls. METHODS: Study design: A
		cross-sectional comparative study was conducted assuming 50% of the diabetic
		patients have oral lesions compared to nondiabetic patients and a power of 80%
		"with 5% level of significance, the minimum required sample size was estimated to"
		be 115 in each group. The buccal swabs were collected to isolate Candida species
		from the individual patient with a current and former history of diabetes. The
		laboratory findings were collected and the clinical examination of the oral
		mucosa was processed at the department of microbiology. RESULTS: The results
		inferred a significant presence of oral mucosa alterations in the diabetic group.
		A majority of the patients were suffering from type 2 diabetes for the past 10
		"years. C. albicans was the predominant yeast, followed by. C. tropicalis and C."
		krusei nonalbicans species that were most frequently isolated. Diabetes and
		smoking habit were the two risk factors for oral mucosa alterations. CONCLUSIONS:
		The study found a significant presence of oral mucosa alterations in the diabetic
		group and the fungal infection tended to be more in the diabetic group with a
		high incidence of C. albicans. The presence of diabetes and smoking habit were
		two risk factors identified as significant for oral mucosa alterations. The
		significant variation in education level in groups indicates that education would
		help to enhance the prognosis in diabetic patients and healthcare behavior.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of oral candidiasis and multiple oral
		"Candida infections in patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome (SS), and the"
		clinical and drug susceptibility profile. METHODS: Thirty patients with primary
		SS were enrolled in our study. The diagnosis of oral candidiasis was based on the
		"clinical manifestation, and confirmed by a concentrated rinse culture. Candida"
		spp. assessment was accomplished using standard methods: Sabouraud dextrose agar
		with 50 mg/l chloramphenicol and CHROMagar were used for the rapid screening of
		"clinical species, followed by the API 20C system for further species"
		identification. In vitro antifungal drug susceptibility of Candida isolates was
		"determined by the minimal inhibitory concentrations. RESULTS: In our study, 87%"
		"(26/30) of subjects had oral candidiasis, in which 42% (11/26) had multiple"
		"Candida spp. infection. Although C. albicans remains the predominant isolate,"
		"other rare species such as C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, and C."
		"krusei were present, alone or in combination. Chronic atrophic candidiasis is the"
		most common clinical type of oral candidiasis in patients with SS. The
		susceptibilities of the 44 Candida isolates to 7 antifungal agents varied
		"dramatically. The resistance to azoles was remarkable, and the phenomenon of"
		cross-resistance between itraconazole and fluconazole was observed. CONCLUSION:
		Patients with primary SS carry a high risk of oral candidiasis and a high
		frequency of multiple Candida infections. The azole resistance patterns of
		Candida spp. support the necessity for drug susceptibility testing as a routine
		procedure for patients with oral Candida infections.

PG	-	1328-35
LID	-	10.1017/S0950268809991531 [doi]
AB	-	The incidence of nosocomial candidaemia was evaluated in a retrospective study in
		"a Turkish tertiary-care hospital. Over a 12-year period (1996-2007), a total of"
		"743 episodes of candidaemia occurred in 743 patients, accounting for an average"
		incidence of 1.9 episodes/1000 admissions and 2.9 episodes/10 000 patient-days
		per year. The annual incidence was almost constant during the study period except
		for 1996 when it was significantly higher in comparison with other years
		"(P<0.05). The most common species isolated was Candida albicans (45%), followed"
		"by C. parapsilosis (26%), C. tropicalis (7%), C. krusei (7%), and C. glabrata"
		(3.5%). A significant increase in C. albicans isolates causing candidaemia linked
		to a decrease in C. parapsilosis isolates in adult patients and C. krusei
		isolates in children was found between the two 6-year study periods. This trend
		reflects improved infection control at Uludağ University Hospital. Ninety percent
		of isolates were susceptible to fluconazole (8 microg/ml) and resistance was
		found only in C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis isolates. Regular local
		surveillance of Candida spp. is important in order to develop empirical treatment
		protocols to reduce the incidence and mortality of candidaemia.

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of
		Candida in the buccal cavity of diabetic and non-diabetic individuals in and
		"around Pondicherry, India and to analyse the antifungal susceptibility profile of"
		"the selected isolates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 400 buccal samples, 200"
		each from diabetic and non-diabetic healthy individuals were included in the
		study. Sabouraud's dextrose agar was used for isolation of Candida species.
		"Identification was performed through microscopy, germ tube test, sugar"
		"fermentation test, sugar assimilation test and by using Hichrome agar. Distinct"
		and phenotypically representative colonies were selected and subjected to ITS
		analysis. In vitro antifungal susceptibility testing for the isolated Candida
		species was performed using E-test. RESULTS: Results revealed that the prevalence
		of Candida species in diabetic individuals was higher when compared with
		non-diabetic healthy individuals. The most predominantly isolated species in
		diabetic and non-diabetic individuals from buccal cavity was Candida albicans.
		C. tropicalis was predominant among the non-albicans Candida isolated from both
		diabetic and non-diabetic individuals. Among denture wearers C. glabrata was
		"predominant. In vitro antifungal susceptibility testing shows that ketoconazole,"
		fluconazole and itraconazole were effective against the isolated Candida species.
		CONCLUSIONS: The rate of candidal carriage in diabetic individuals is higher.
		Different species of Candida are present in the oral cavity of diabetic
		individuals. There may be a positive correlation between glycemic control and
		candidal colonization. In vitro antifungal susceptibility testing of Candia
		species are required for proper management and treatment of candidal infections.

		treatment. objective: to determine the prevalence of different Candida species
		colonising or infecting the oral mucosa (OM) of diabetic (DM) and non-diabetic
		"(non-DM) chronic kidney disease patients, comparing both groups and exploring"
		potential risk factors. METHODS: 56 DM and 80 non-DM patients on chronic dialysis
		were examined. OM swabs were cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar plates. Candida
		species were identified with API® galleries. OC was confirmed by exfoliative
		"cytology. Statistical associations were analysed using χ2, Fisher's exact test"
		"(ET), and multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: Candida prevalence was 43.4%:"
		"53.6% DM and 36.3% non-DM, (p=.045). The species identified were C. albicans"
		"74.6%, C. glabrata 22.0%, C. tropicalis 15.2%, C. parapsilosis 3.4 %, C. kefyr"
		3.4% and C. famata 1.7% without difference between groups. DM patients had a
		higher xerostomia prevalence (p=.002) and lower salivary flow (p=.008) and lower
		"serum albumin (p=.018). 16.9% of patients had OC, 23.2% DM compared with 12.5%"
		"non-DM, (p=.101). The following were associated with the presence of Candida in"
		"the OM: the use of dental prostheses (odds ratio [OR] 25.6, 95% confidence"
		"interval [CI] 2.5 to 253, P=.001), xerostomia (OR 9.6, 95% CI 2.4 to 38.1,"
		"P=.001) and low serum albumin values (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.98, P=.044)."
		CONCLUSIONS: The presence of Candida sp. in the OM was associated with dental
		"prostheses, xerostomia and low serum albumin."

		nosocomial infections.
PG	-	e17-24
LID	-	10.1086/589298 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive fungal infections pose a serious threat to hospitalized
		"patients worldwide. In particular, the prevalence of clusters of nosocomial"
		infection among patients with candidemia remains unknown. The aim of this study
		was to investigate the molecular epidemiology of candidemia in a nationwide
		setting in Iceland during a 16-year period. METHODS: The genotypes of all
		available fungal bloodstream isolates during 1991-2006 (n = 219) were determined
		by polymerase chain reaction fingerprinting with use of 4 separate primers.
		Clusters were defined as isolation of > or =2 strains with genotypes that had >
		or =90% relatedness in the same hospital within a period of 90 days. RESULTS:
		"Candida albicans represented 61.6% of isolates, followed by Candida glabrata"
		"(13.7%), Candida tropicalis (9.1%), and Candida parapsilosis (8.7%). Polymerase"
		"chain reaction fingerprinting revealed 35 clones of C. albicans, 10 clones of C."
		"glabrata, 7 clones of C. tropicalis, 4 clones of C. parapsilosis, and 5 clones of"
		"Candida dubliniensis. Overall, 18.7%-39.9% of all infections were part of"
		"nosocomial clusters, most commonly caused by C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, and C."
		tropicalis. Most clusters involved 2 cases and disproportionately affected
		patients in adult and neonatal intensive care units (P = .045). The 7-day (16%)
		and 30-day (32%) case-fatality rates among cluster-associated cases did not
		differ statistically significantly from those for sporadic nosocomial infections.
		None of the clusters were identified by the hospital surveillance team.
		"CONCLUSIONS: In an unselected patient population, as many as one-third of all"
		cases of candidemia may be attributable to nosocomial clusters. The risk is
		dependent on hospital wards and patient populations; it is highest in intensive
		care units. Small clusters are not identified by routine hospital surveillance.

PG	-	1445-1452
LID	-	10.1007/s10096-020-03863-2 [doi]
AB	-	The incidence of mixed candida/bacterial blood infections (BSIs) has been
		"reported to account for 20% of all cases of candidaemia. However, its clinical"
		characteristics and implications in patients with hematological diseases are not
		clear. We conducted a retrospective case-control study of hematological patients
		complicated with candidaemia over the past 5-year period to identify the risk
		factors and clinical implications of mixed candidia/bacterial BSIs (case group)
		vs. monobacterial candidiasis (control group). Of all 65 enrolled patients with
		"candidaemia, 20 cases (30.8%) met the diagnostic criteria for mixed"
		candida/bacterial BSIs. Candida tropicalis was the most common candida species in
		all patients. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most detected bacteria (35%) in case
		"group. Previous hospital stay ≥ 28 days, organic damage during candidaemia, and"
		positive procalcitonin (PCT) test were the risk factors of mixed
		candida/bacterial BSIs. Cumulative mortality of all patients enrolled was 26.2%
		"at day 30, with significant differences between case and control group. In"
		"multivariate analysis, organic damage and granulocyte recovery were the two"
		predictive factors for 30-day mortality. Mixed candida/bacterial BSIs are fatal
		complications of infection which account for a considerable part of candidaemia;
		multicenter and large-scale clinical studies are required in the future.

AB	-	Vaginal swab samples were collected both from women with signs of acute
		vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC; n=270) and from healthy controls (n=100). The
		microscopic examination revealed a significant difference in the proportion of
		positive cultures of Candida between the VVC (33%) and control (21%) groups. To
		"determine the frequency of different species, positive cultures were analyzed"
		"using the germ tube test, CHROMagar medium, API 20 AUX System and DNA analysis."
		CHROMagar and API 20 AUX System tests identified 67% of samples as C. albicans.
		"Out of these, 42% appeared to be C. dubliniensis when the specific primers in the"
		polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used. We observed the prevalence of Candida
		species isolated from the vagina in descending order as follows: C. albicans
		"(38-39%), C. glabrata (32-33%), C. dubliniensis (28-29%) and C. tropicalis (0-1%)"
		for both the VVC and the control group.

AB	-	"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the incidence, risk factors, causative fungi, and"
		"outcomes of fungemia in adult, non-HIV-infected patients. DESIGN: We studied 147"
		episodes of fungemia due to Candida spp and Trichosporon spp in adult patients
		admitted to a university hospital in Northeast Thailand between 1999 and 2003.
		"RESULTS: The overall incidence of fungemia was 14.1 per 10,000 hospital"
		"admissions. Candida was the most common isolate (138 episodes, 93.9%) with"
		non-albicans Candida accounting for 68.7%. The major non-albicans Candida
		isolates were Candida parapsilosis and Candida tropicalis. Fungemia caused by
		"Trichosporon accounted for 6.1% of the cases, but their clinical features could"
		not be distinguished from fungemia due to Candida. The overall in-hospital
		mortality rate was 56.1%. The independent factors related to mortality were high
		"APACHE II score (odds ratio (OR) 1.12 per 1-point increments, 95% confidence"
		"interval (CI) 1.03-1.23), assisted ventilation (OR 3.49, 95% CI 1.04-11.64), and"
		"neutropenia (OR 7.47, 95% CI 1.25-44.74). CONCLUSIONS: Candidemia, especially"
		"that caused by non-albicans Candida, was an important nosocomial infection in"
		"this tertiary care hospital in Northeast Thailand. The mortality rate was high,"
		particularly in patients who were critically ill. Rapid diagnosis and early
		treatment are therefore important challenges for improving clinical outcomes.

AB	-	Candida tropicalis is the second most common Candida species causing fungaemia in
		"Taiwan, and decreased susceptibility to fluconazole has been reported. This study"
		analysed the clinical characteristics of adult patients with C. tropicalis
		fungaemia and the antifungal susceptibilities of isolates at five tertiary
		hospitals in Taiwan (1 July 2011 to 30 June 2014). A standardised case record
		"form was used retrospectively to collect demographic, clinical and"
		"microbiological characteristics, antifungal treatment and outcomes. MICs of"
		non-duplicate isolates were determined using Sensititre(TM) YeastOne(TM) and were
		interpreted using cut-off values recommended by the CLSI. A total 248 patients
		were diagnosed over the study period; 30-day crude mortality was 52.0%.
		"Multivariate analysis showed that high Charlson comorbidity index ≥4 (OR = 2.09,"
		"95% CI 1.22-3.59; P = 0.008), neutropenia (OR = 4.61, 95% CI 1.42-15.00;"
		"P = 0.011) and treatment with an azole-based regimen (OR = 0.39, 95% CI"
		0.17-0.90; P = 0.028) were significantly associated with 30-day mortality. A
		"total of 33.9% of isolates were non-susceptible to fluconazole (MIC(50), 2 mg/L;"
		"MIC(90), 16 mg/L; MIC range, 0.25 to >256 mg/L), whilst 56.9% to voriconazole"
		"(MIC(50), 0.25 mg/L; MIC(90), 1 mg/L; MIC range, 0.015 to >8 mg/L) according to"
		CLSI clinical breakpoints. There was no significant correlation between overall
		mortality and MICs of fluconazole or voriconazole. This study showed high
		"mortality in patients with C. tropicalis fungaemia, and azole-based antifungal"

AB	-	"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although not all candidemias are hospital-acquired, data"
		on clinical epidemiology for the community-onset candidemia are limited. This
		retrospective study was conducted to describe predisposing factors and outcomes
		of community-onset candidemias. METHODS: Medical records of patients who were
		"admitted to the National Taiwan University Hospital between January 1, 1995 and"
		"May 31, 2005 and had Candida isolated from their blood in the outpatient setting"
		and/or within 48 h of hospitalization (community-onset) were reviewed. RESULTS: A
		"total of 56 episodes of candidemia were reviewed, which included 8 episodes"
		(14.3%) of true community-acquired candidemia occurring in patients with no
		record of hospitalization within the previous 30 days and without histories of
		"invasive procedures either just before or at the time of admission, and 48"
		episodes (85.7%) that were health care-associated. The latter included 24
		episodes (42.9%) in patients recently discharged from hospitals (within 2-30 days
		"of current admission), 23 episodes (41.1%) associated with invasive procedures"
		"and/or central intravascular lines placed for outpatient therapy, and 1 episode"
		(1.8%) in patients admitted from nursing homes. Gastrointestinal bleeding
		"(46.4%), immunosuppressive therapy (42.9%) and previous antibiotics use (37.5%)"
		were the most common predisposing factors. Diabetes was the single most important
		predisposing factor in true community-acquired candidemia (62.5%) and had a
		significantly higher prevalence among these patients than in those with health
		care-associated candidemias (p=0.035). Candida albicans was the most common
		"isolate (39.7%), followed by Candida tropicalis (22.4%) and Candida glabrata"
		"(17.2%). The overall case fatality rate was 55.4% (31/56), and 58.1% (18/31) of"
		this was attributable to candidemia. Multivariate analysis identified higher
		severity score and lack of antifungal therapy as having an independent and
		adverse influence on outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Up to 85.7% of community-onset
		candidemias are health care-associated. There is a conceptual and practical need
		"for a new classification for the spectrum of acquisition of infection, wherein"
		the new category of health care-associated infection will have implications for
		the selection of empirical therapy.

		"rate, epidemiology, and predictors of mortality."
PG	-	570-6
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Studies conducted in tertiary care hospitals of different European
		countries and the United States have shown incidence rates of candidemia ranging
		"from 0.17 to 0.76 and 0.28 to 0.96 per 1,000 admissions, respectively. So far,"
		only 1 study has evaluated the incidence rates of candidemia in tertiary care
		hospitals in Latin American countries. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the epidemiology of
		"candidemia in 4 tertiary care hospitals in São Paulo, Brazil. DESIGN:"
		"Multicenter, laboratory-based surveillance of candidemia. RESULTS: A total of"
		"7,038 episodes of bloodstream infection were identified, and Candida species"
		accounted for 282 cases (4%). The incidence rate of candidemia was 1.66
		"candidemic episodes per 1,000 hospital admissions. Candida albicans was the most"
		"frequently isolated Candida species in all hospitals, but Candida species other"
		"than C. albicans accounted for 62% of isolates, including predominantly Candida"
		parapsilosis and Candida tropicalis. Azole resistance was restricted to only 2%
		of all Candida isolates (1 isolate of Candida glabrata and 4 isolates of Candida
		rugosa). Candidemia was mostly documented in surgical patients with long
		"durations of hospital stay. The crude mortality rate was 61%, and advanced age"
		and high Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score were both
		conditions independently associated with risk of death. CONCLUSIONS: We observed
		in our series a higher incidence rate of candidemia than that reported in
		European countries and the United States. Advanced age and a high Acute
		Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score were factors associated with a
		higher probability of death in candidemic patients. Fluconazole-resistant Candida
		strains are still a rare finding in our case-based study of candidemia.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: More than one-third of candidemia episodes occur in Internal Medicine
		Wards (IMWs) but only few studies have focused on this setting and specific data
		"about epidemiology, clinical characteristics and risk factors for mortality are"
		scant. OBJECTIVE: To describe epidemiology and to assess risk factors for
		in-hospital mortality among patients with candidemia in IMWs. METHODS:
		Multicenter retrospective cohort study on patients with candidemia cared for in
		IMWs of an Italian region (Emilia Romagna) from January 2012 to December 2013.
		Non survivors were compared with survivors; variables with p≤0.1 at univariate
		analysis were entered into a multivariate Cox regression model. RESULTS: 232
		patients were included. Overall candidemia incidence was 2.2 cases/1000
		admissions. Candida albicans accounted for 59% of cases. Antifungal treatment was
		"started <24h, 24-72h, and >72h from blood cultures in 47%, 27% and 12% of"
		"patients, respectively; 13.8% of patients received no antifungal treatment."
		"In-hospital mortality was 40%. At multivariate analysis,"
		"chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease (HR 2.72, 95%CI 1.66-4.45, p<0.001) and"
		"isolation of C. tropicalis (HR 2.18, 95%CI 1.19-3.99, p=0.01) were the"
		independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality; central-venous-catheter
		"removal (HR 0.59, 95%CI 0.36-0.96, p=0.03) and adequate and timely (within 72h"
		"from blood drawing) empirical therapy (HR 0.42, 95%CI 0.25-0.69, p=0.001) were"
		protective factors. CONCLUSIONS: The present study conducted in a relatively
		large geographic area confirms high incidence and mortality of candidemia in
		"IMWs, with a worrisome rate of inappropriateness in patient management. Specific"
		interventions aimed to increase awareness of IMWs about candidemia are needed.

LID	-	10.1111/jop.12260 [doi]
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to investigate Candida carriage and
		species in Maras powder users and non-users. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study
		"included 100 volunteering men in 12 cafés in the city of Kahramanmaras, Turkey. A"
		questionnaire composed of questions about socio-demographic features and Maras
		powder use was filled in by the participants. Culture specimens were obtained
		from bilateral buccal mucosa and dorsum of the tongue with a sterile
		cotton-tipped swap. The specimens were inoculated in Sabouraud Dextrose Agar
		"(SDA). RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 48.0 ± 12.5 years (min = 20,"
		max = 70). Fifty-four percent of the Maras powder users and 22% of the non-users
		were Candida carriers. The difference between the groups was significant (P =
		0.001). The most frequently isolated species was Candida albicans at a rate of
		44% in the Maras powder users and at a rate of 18% in the non-users. Other
		frequent species were Candida glabrata at a rate of 6% in the Maras powder users
		and 2% in the control group and Candida tropicalis at a rate of 4% in the Maras
		powder users and 2% in the nonusers. CONCLUSION: We found that a significantly
		high rate of the Maras powder users was Candida carriers. It should be kept in
		mind that opportunistic infections may be caused by Candida species in Maras
		powder users especially with immunosuppressive conditions since Candida species
		are likely to lead to such infections in cases of immunosuppressive diseases.

AB	-	Candidemia studies have documented geographic differences in rates and
		"epidemiology, underscoring the need for surveillance to monitor trends. We"
		"conducted prospective candidemia surveillance in Spain to assess the incidence,"
		"species distribution, frequency of antifungal resistance, and risk factors for"
		acquiring a Candida infection. Prospective laboratory-based surveillance was
		conducted from June 2008 to June 2009 in 40 medical centers located around the
		country. A case of candidemia was defined as the isolation of a Candida species
		"from a blood culture. Incidence rates were calculated per 1,000 admissions."
		Antifungal susceptibility tests were performed by using broth microdilution assay
		according to the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute.
		"We detected 984 cases, for an overall incidence of 1.09 cases per 1,000"
		admissions. The crude mortality was 20.20%. Candida albicans was the most common
		"species (49.08%), followed by C. parapsilosis (20.73%), C. glabrata (13.61%), and"
		"C. tropicalis (10.77%). Overall, decreased susceptibility to fluconazole occurred"
		"in 69 (7.01%) incident isolates. Antifungal resistance was rare, and a moderate"
		linear correlation between fluconazole and voriconazole MICs was observed. This
		is the largest multicenter candidemia study conducted to date and shows the
		substantial morbidity and mortality of candidemia in Spain.

PG	-	e442-7
LID	-	10.1016/j.ijid.2012.02.005 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candidemia affects patient populations from neonates to the elderly.
		"Despite this, little information is available about the epidemiology of"
		candidemia in elderly patients. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of
		987 episodes of candidemia in adults (>14 years of age) from the databases of
		three laboratory-based surveys of candidemia performed at 14 tertiary care
		"hospitals. Patients aged ≥60 years were considered elderly (group 1, n=455, 46%)"
		"and were compared to younger patients (group 2, n=532, 54%) regarding"
		"demographics, underlying diseases, comorbidities, exposure to medical procedures,"
		"species, treatment, and outcome. RESULTS: The median APACHE II score was"
		"significantly higher in the elderly patients (19 vs. 15, p=0.03). Variables that"
		were observed significantly more frequently in elderly patients included
		"admission to an intensive care unit, diabetes mellitus, renal failure, cardiac"
		"disease, lung disease, receipt of antibiotics or H2 blockers, insertion of a"
		"central venous catheter, mechanical ventilation, and candidemia due to Candida"
		tropicalis. The 30-day mortality of elderly patients was significantly higher
		"than that of younger patients (70% vs. 45%, p<0.001). Factors associated with"
		higher mortality by multivariate analysis included APACHE II score and being in
		group 1 (elderly). Factors associated with mortality in elderly patients were
		lung disease and the receipt of mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: Elderly
		patients account for a substantial proportion of patients with candidemia and
		have a higher mortality compared to younger patients.

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to determine the frequency of Candida species in
		women of different age groups as well as to suggest the criteria for the
		diagnosis of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC). STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study of
		"vulvovaginal candidiasis was carried out using laboratory diagnosis, with the"
		estimation of vaginal pH and the direct microscopic and biochemical examination
		of vaginal discharge/secretions. Vaginal cultures for Candida species were
		"collected from 1050 women with vulvovaginal symptoms. RESULTS: Out of 1050 women,"
		"215 (20.47%) were positive for Candida species. Of 215 women, 172 (80%) had pH"
		within the normal range and 167 (77.67%) were showing yeast cells and mycelia on
		"direct microscopic examination. Candida albicans accounted for 46.9% of cases,"
		"Candida glabrata 36.7%, Candida parapsilosis 10.2%, Candida tropicalis 2.8%,"
		"Candida krusei 1.4%, and Candida kiefer 1.9%. The frequency of culture positivity"
		"was related to pregnancy (P<0.001), an increase in parity (P<0.001), and use of"
		oral contraceptives (P<0.001) and antibiotics (P<0.001). The most common signs
		and symptoms in 215 women with positive cultures were pruritus with or without
		vaginal discharge and vaginal erythema. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that
		vulvovaginal candidiasis can only be diagnosed by using clinical criteria in
		correlation with vulvovaginal symptoms and Candida cultures.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: The virulence of isolates among different Candida species causing
		"candidemia may play a role in the prognosis of the patients. Furthermore, the"
		potential relationship between genotype and virulence is still unclear and need
		to be further studied. AIMS: We aim to assess the relationship between genotype
		and virulence in Candida species using a Galleria mellonella larvae infection
		model. METHODS: One hundred and ninety-four isolates from 68 clusters (Candida
		"albicans, 114/41; Candida parapsilosis, 74/24; Candida tropicalis, 6/3) were"
		compared against the same number of each species singleton genotypes in terms of
		survival of G. mellonella larvae. RESULTS: The median of survival and the IQR
		"ranges of clusters and singleton were as follows: C. albicans (2 days, IQR 1.5-2"
		"vs. 2 days, IQR 1-2.25), C. parapsilosis (2 days, IQR 1.5-2.6 vs. 2 days, IQR"
		"2-3.3), and C. tropicalis (1 day, IQR 1-3.5 vs. 2 days, IQR 2-3.5; p<0.05). High"
		intra-cluster variability in terms of median of survival was found regardless the
		species. CONCLUSIONS: No relationship between genotype and virulence in Candida
		was observed with the G. mellonella model.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Blood cultures are approximately 50% sensitive for diagnosing
		invasive candidiasis. The T2Candida nanodiagnostic panel uses T2 magnetic
		resonance and a dedicated instrument to detect Candida directly within whole
		"blood samples. METHODS: Patients with Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida"
		"parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, or Candida krusei candidemia were identified at"
		14 centers using diagnostic blood cultures (dBCs). Follow-up blood samples were
		collected concurrently for testing by T2Candida and companion cultures (cBCs).
		"T2Candida results are reported qualitatively for C. albicans/C. tropicalis, C."
		"glabrata/C. krusei, and C. parapsilosis. T2Candida and cBCs were positive if they"
		detected a species present in the dBC. RESULTS: Median time between collection of
		"dBC and T2Candida/cBC samples in 152 patients was 55.5 hours (range, 16.4-148.4)."
		"T2Candida and cBCs were positive in 45% (69/152) and 24% (36/152) of patients,"
		"respectively (P < .0001). T2Candida clinical sensitivity was 89%, as positive"
		results were obtained in 32/36 patients with positive cBCs. Combined test results
		"were both positive (T2+/cBC+), 21% (32/152); T2+/cBC-, 24% (37/152); T2-/cBC+, 3%"
		"(4/152); and T2-/cBC-, 52% (79/152). Prior antifungal therapy, neutropenia, and"
		C. albicans candidemia were independently associated with T2Candida positivity
		and T2+/cBC- results (P values < .05). CONCLUSIONS: T2Candida was sensitive for
		diagnosing candidemia at the time of positive blood cultures. In patients
		"receiving antifungal therapy, T2Candida identified bloodstream infections that"
		were missed by cBCs. T2Candida may improve care by shortening times to Candida
		"detection and species identification compared to blood cultures, retaining"
		sensitivity during antifungal therapy and rendering active candidemia unlikely if
		results are negative. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: NCT01525095.

TI	-	Trends in candidemia and antifungal susceptibility in a university hospital in
		Northern Ireland 2001-2006.
PG	-	174-8
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To describe the species distribution and antifungal susceptibility
		"trends for documented episodes of candidemia at the Royal Hospitals, Belfast,"
		2001-2006. METHODS: Laboratory-based retrospective observational study of all
		episodes of candidemia. RESULTS: There were 151 episodes of candidemia. The
		species recovered were: 96 C. albicans; 26 C. glabrata; 18 C. parapsilosis; five
		C. tropicalis; four C. guilliermondii; one C. famata and one C. dubliniensis. We
		separated the data into two periods 2001-2003 and 2004-2006; contrary to the
		"findings of other investigators, there was a notable trends toward increasing"
		frequency of C. albicans and decreasing frequency of non-albicans species over
		"time. Although the proportion of C. albicans, C. parapsilosis and C. tropicalis"
		"isolates susceptible to fluconazole was unchanged over time, a trend of decreased"
		susceptibility of C. glabrata to fluconazole was noted over the six-year period.
		"Overall, 73% and 7.7% of C. glabrata isolates had susceptible-dose-dependent and"
		"resistant phenotypes, respectively. The percentage of C. glabrata isolates"
		susceptible to fluconazole (MIC <8 microg/ml) decreased from 36% in 2001-2003 to
		0% in 2004-2006. Flucytosine resistance was detected in only 4 (2.7%) isolates.
		None of the isolates had an amphotericin B MIC <1 microg/ml. CONCLUSION: A shift
		towards increasing dominance of C. albicans contrasts both with reports from
		other countries and previous data from Northern Ireland. Upwards fluconazole MIC
		drift among C. glabrata has important implications for empirical therapeutic
		decisions.

		common and serious disease. AIM: To analyze incidence and susceptibility profile
		of species from the genus Candida in Hospital Base Valdivia. MATERIAL AND
		METHODS: All candidemia cases presented between March 2009 and August 2011 in our
		institution were identified. Species distribution and susceptibility were studied
		through the disk diffusion method. RESULTS: Twenty-seven candidemia episodes were
		studied. Incidence varied from 0.3 to 0.7 by a thousand discharges (according to
		"clinical service). Risk factors were hospitalization, preliminary use of"
		"antibiotics, aged people and underlying disease (renal failure, heart and lung"
		"disease). The most frequent species was C. albicans, followed by C. tropicalis,"
		C. glabrata and C. krusei. Voriconazole was the antifungal showing the best in
		"vitro performance. Amphotericin B, fluconazole and itraconazole presented"
		variable results. DISCUSSION: Incidence found was superior to that described in
		"developed countries. Candida albicans constitute the most frequent species, with"
		high sensitivity levels to fluconazole; Candida no albicans species must be
		monitored. Developing new research on the topic appears as fundamental to detect
		potential epidemiological variations.

AB	-	Yeast strains obtained from blood cultures and catheters from intensive care
		units (ICU) and hospitalised oncology paediatrics were studied. Yeast were the
		"first cause of catheter colonisation (51/627), and the third cause of bloodstream"
		"infection (44/6065). In catheter, the most frequent species were Candida albicans"
		"(34%), C. parapsilosis (27.7%) and C. tropicalis (15%). In blood, C. albicans"
		"(40.8%), C. parapsilosis (26.6%), C. tropicalis (15%). Malassezia furfur and"
		Malassezia sympodialis were isolated from catheters from ICU patients. All
		"isolates were susceptible to amphotericin B, 88.8% to itraconazole and 91.9% to"
		fluconazole. Candida albicans and C. tropicalis strains resistant to fluconazole
		and itraconazol were detected. These results reveal a change in the predominant
		role of C. albicans as cause of candidemia in hospitalised children and the
		emergence of antifungal resistant species. These variations emphasise the
		importance of performing a permanent surveillance to observe and assess them.

		vaginal candidiasis.
PG	-	226-34
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To identify Candida strains isolated from Tanzanian women (13 to 45
		years) with vaginal candidiasis. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. SETTING:
		"Antenatal clinic in Ilala district hospital in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania from March"
		1998 to December 2000. RESULTS: The identities of the 272 isolates tested with
		"API Candida were: Candida albicans 180(66.2%), Candida tropicalis 13(4.7%),"
		"Candida glabrata 20(7.35%), Candida famata 6(2.2%), Candida parapsilosis 6 (2.2%)"
		and Candida lusitaniae one (0.37%). API Candida could not speciate 43 (15.8%)
		"isolates of these; two (0.7%) fell between C. albicans and C. tropicalis,"
		"17(6.25%) C. lusitaniael, C. guilliermondii/C. famata, 14(5.15%) C. krusei, C."
		"inconspicua, and C. norvegensis and nine (3.3%) either C. parapsilosis, C."
		"krusei, C. incospicua or Geotrichum spp. Four (1.5%) isolates had an assimilation"
		"pattern of Trichosporo spp, but were all germ tube positive and had morphological"
		features on cornemeal agar that were consistent with C. albicans. API 20C AUX was
		"used for testing 29 isolates and results showed: 11/29 (37.9%) C. albicans, 1/29"
		"(3.4%) C. tropicalis, 4/29 (13.8%) C. glabrata, 1/29 (3.4%) C. parapsilosis, 1/29"
		"(3.4%) C. famata, 1/29 (3.4%) C. lusitaniae, 1/29 (3.4%) C. colliculosa/C."
		"magnoliae, 5/29(17.2%) C. albicans/ C. tropicals 2/29 (6.8%) C. norvegensis/C."
		"parapsilosis, and 2/29(6.8%) C. kruseil/C. inconspicua. Results of 20 isolates"
		identified by Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPID) technique showed a 95%
		agreement with API Candida and a 100% agreement with API 20C AUX. CONCLUSION:
		Although most (66.3%) of the species isolated from Dar es Salaam women with
		"vaginal candidiasis were C. albicans, a considerable percentage (33.7%) were"
		"non-albicans, mainly C. glabrata, C. krusei and C. tropicalis. The high"
		prevalence of non-albicans Candida spp observed in this population may have
		therapeutic implications.

AB	-	"OBJECTIVE: Candidaemia is a life-threatening infectious disease, associated with"
		"septic shock, multiple organ failure, and a high mortality rate. In France,"
		reported data on the incidence of ICU-acquired candidaemia and the causative
		Candida species are scarce. The objective of this study was to determine temporal
		trends in epidemiology and risk factors of intensive care unit-acquired
		candidaemia (ICU-Cand) and ICU mortality among a very large population of ICU
		"patients. METHOD: Demographics, patient risk factors, invasive device exposure"
		and nosocomial infection in ICU patient were collected from 2004 to 2013 in a
		national network of 213 ICUs: REA-RAISIN. Incidence and risk factors for
		"candidaemia and ICU mortality were assessed. RESULTS: Out of 246,459 ICU"
		"patients, 851 developed an ICU-cand, representing 0.3 per 1000 patients-days. The"
		incidence rose sharply over time. Candida albicans was the main species. The
		overall and ICU mortality was 52.4% in ICU-cand patients. The main risk factors
		"of ICU-cand were length of stay, severity of illness and antimicrobial therapy at"
		"ICU admission, immune status and use of invasive procedure. ICU-cand was an"
		independent risk factor of mortality (OR: 1.53; 95%CI [1.40-1.70]); in a
		"sub-group analysis, independent effects on mortality were observed with C."
		"albicans (OR: 1.45 [1.23-1.71]), Candida tropicalis (OR: 2.11 [1.31-3.39]) and"
		"""other"" Candida species (OR: 1.64 [1.09-2.45]). CONCLUSION: ICU candidaemia"
		"ranked sixth among bloodstream infections, and its average annual incidence was"
		0.3 per 1000 patients days. Despite of new therapy and international
		"recommendation, the incidence rose sharply during the study period, and ICU"
		mortality remained high.

AB	-	"Many uncommon Candida spp. (species other than C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, C."
		"glabrata, C. tropicalis, and C. krusei) have been shown to emerge in tertiary"
		care facilities. We aimed to investigate these uncommon candidemia in children.
		Forty-six cases of candidemia caused by uncommon Candida spp. were identified
		during 2003-2015 from a medical center in Taiwan. The most common specie was C.
		"guilliermondii (31.2%), followed by C. lusitaniae (18.8%) and C. metapsilosis"
		(18.8%). These cases were analyzed and compared with 148 episodes of C. albicans
		candidemia. The incidence density of uncommon Candida spp. candidemia and the
		proportion to all candidemia episodes increased substantively during the study
		"period. Prior exposure to azoles was uncommon in the 30 days prior to infection,"
		"but fluconazole resistant strains were significantly more common (n = 19, 41.3%)."
		The increased incidence density of uncommon Candida spp. candidemia was
		associated with increasing use of antifungal agents. No differences in
		"demographics, underlying comorbidities, risk factors, clinical features,"
		"dissemination, and 30-day mortality were found between uncommon Candida spp. and"
		C. albicans candidemia. Patients with uncommon Candida spp. candidemia were more
		likely to require modifications in antifungal treatment and receive echinocandin
		"drugs (43.5% vs 21.6%, p = 0.007). Candidemia caused by uncommon Candida spp. had"
		"poorer response to antifungal treatment, led to longer duration of candidemia"
		"(median 4.0 versus 2.5 days, p = 0.008), and had a higher treatment failure rate"
		"(56.5% vs 38.5%, p = 0.040)."

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Studies on candidemia occurring among adults in Southern African are
		limited. We aimed to document the epidemiology of candidemia among adults in
		Soweto. METHODS: This was a retrospective hospital-based study in three discrete
		"periods, involving 9 years, from 1990 to 2007. RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty-six"
		patients were identified. Case rates were 2.8 cases/10 000 admissions in
		"1998-2002 and 3.6 episodes/10 000 hospitalizations in 2005-2007. In 1990, Candida"
		"albicans caused 62% and Candida tropicalis caused 23% of episodes. In 2005-2007,"
		"major species were C. albicans (46%), Candida parapsilosis (25%), and Candida"
		"glabrata (23%), with little change compared to 1998-2002. Major predisposing"
		"conditions were abdominal surgery (43%), HIV infection (19% in 2005-2007), trauma"
		"(16%), diabetes mellitus (12%), and cancer (8%). General wards superseded"
		intensive care as the major diagnostic setting in 2005-2007. The crude mortality
		"was 60%. Among 22 HIV-infected patients with a median CD4 cell count of 68/μl,"
		three were of community-onset. C. albicans caused 73% of cases. Five patients had
		another predisposing condition and five had central venous catheters. The
		mortality was 73%. CONCLUSIONS: Soweto has a pattern of Candida species different
		from other continents. HIV infection and trauma were important predisposing
		conditions.

PG	-	157-61
AB	-	Polymicrobial endocarditis is more frequent in intravenous drug user (IVDU).
		"Combined therapy--medical and surgical--represents the standard of care, but"
		long-term suppressive therapy duration in fungal endocarditis is still debated.
		The polymicrobial endocarditis is rare: 1-3%. It is being observed with
		increasing frequency among drug users; a predominance of tricuspid valve
		involvement exists. We report a case of dual etiology infective endocarditis (IE)
		- Candida tropicalis and Staphylococcus aureus - in a IVDU; the treatment was
		"combined, medical and surgical, and was followed by a suppressive antifungal"
		therapy. We review the other published Candida tropicalis endocarditis cases and
		discuss their optimal management.

AB	-	"The infection rate of arteriovenous (AV) grafts is high, but fungal etiology is"
		rare. Only five cases of graft infection due to Candida albicans (C. albicans) or
		"C. tropicalis have been described in the literature. Herein, we report the first"
		case of AV graft infection caused by C. glabrata. A 60-year-old woman on
		maintenance hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease was admitted because of
		"intermittent fever, for 10 days. Upon physical examination, tenderness over the"
		AV graft site was noticed. Blood culture yielded C. glabrata and her clinical
		"symptoms improved after she was treated with micafungin for 1 month. However, C."
		glabrata candidemia reoccurred 5 weeks later. Cure was achieved after removal of
		"the AV graft and anidulafungin treatment. Pus was observed in the removed graft,"
		from which C. glabrata was isolated. The outcome of our case and patients from
		the literature review suggest that removal of the infected graft is important for
		treatment success of AV graft Candida infection.

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of Candida
		spp. in periodontitis patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS: This
		cross-sectional study included 42 diabetic patients with periodontitis (aged
		21-70 years; 18 males and 24 females). Clinical measurements included probing
		"pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)"
		levels. Sub-gingival samples were collected from the mesio-buccal aspect of 3
		"teeth for fungal analysis. Candida species, including Candida albicans, Candida"
		"dubliniensis, Candida tropicalis and Candida glabrata, were identified using Gram"
		"staining, the germ tube test, CHROMagar, Staib agar and API 20C AUX. RESULTS: The"
		overall prevalence of Candida in diabetic patients with periodontitis observed in
		our study was 52%. The most common spp. of Candida identified were C. albicans
		"(38%), followed by C. dubliniensis (9.5%), C. tropicalis (4.7%) and C. glabrata"
		"(4.7%). Compared to females, male patients were characterized by increased levels"
		of Candida infections. Our results also indicate that individuals over the age of
		40 had increased levels of Candida infections compared to patients younger than
		40. Candida infections were higher among subjects with elevated blood sugar
		levels (HbA1c>9) compared to individuals with well-controlled blood sugar levels
		(HbA1c<6). Patients with PPDs≥5 had an increased risk of Candida infection
		compared to patients with PPDs between 3 and 4. CONCLUSION: This study indicates
		that the frequency of C. albicans is higher than the frequencies of C.
		"dubliniensis, C. tropicalis and C. glabrata in diabetic patients with"
		periodontitis. Candida infections were observed at increased frequencies among
		subjects with high blood sugar levels and PPDs≥5.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: It was aimed to investigate the frequency of Candida infections
		"(CI) in the intensive care units (ICU), to determine typing of candida to"
		"evaluate risk factors associated with CI and mortality, and to evaluate influence"
		of CI on mortality. METHODS: The prospective cohort study was carried out between
		"Jan 1, 2009 and Dec 31, 2010 in ICUs, and the patients were observed with active"
		"surveillance. VITEK 2 Compact System (BioMerieux, France) kits were used for the"
		identification of isolates from various clinical samples. RESULTS: A total of
		2362 patients had enrolled for 16135 patients-days into the study. During the
		"study, 63 (27,5%) of patients developed 77 episodes of CI were observed. Of the"
		"patients; 54% were male, 46% were female. Duration of hospitalization (OR = 1,03,"
		"p = 0,007), hyperglycemia (OR = 17,93, p = 0,009), and co-infections (OR = 3,98,"
		"p = 0,001) were identified as independent risk factors for CI. The most common"
		infections were bloodstream (53%). 77 of 135 candida strains was isolated as
		"causative pathogens. C. albicans (63,6%) was the most frequent species. Overall"
		mortality rate was 78%. The rates of mortality attributable to CI and candidemia
		"were 27%, and 18,3% respectively. Species- specific mortality rates of C.albicans"
		"and C.tropicalis were determined as 12%. High APACHE II scores (OR = 1,37; p ="
		"0,002), and the use of central venous catheter (OR = 9,01; p = 0,049) were"
		assigned as independent risk factors for mortality. CONCLUSION: CI is an
		important problem in our hospital. CI and associated mortality can be prevented
		by controlling of risk factors. Updating of epidemiological data is required for
		successful antifungal treatment.

LID	-	10.1111/myc.12700 [doi]
AB	-	Candida bloodstream infections (BSI) are a significant cause of mortality in
		"intensive care units (ICU), hereof the prospective 12-months (2014-2015)"
		hospital- and laboratory-based survey was performed at the Serbian National
		Reference Medical Mycology Laboratory (NRMML). Candida identification was done by
		a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry
		"and a susceptibility test, according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards"
		"Institute methodology. Among nine centres (265 beds; 10 820 patient admissions),"
		"four neonatal/paediatric (NICU/PICUs) and five adult centres (ICUs) participated,"
		"representing 89 beds and 3446 patient admissions, 166 beds and 7347 patient"
		"admissions respectively. The NRMML received 43 isolates, 17 from NICU/PICUs and"
		"26 from adult ICUs. C. albicans dominated highly in NICU/PICUs (~71%), whereas"
		"C. albicans and C. parapsilosis were equally distributed within adults (46%,"
		"each), both accounting for ~90% of received isolates. The resistance to"
		"itraconazole and flucytosine were 25% and 2.4% respectively. In addition, the 2"
		C. albicans were azole cross-resistant (4.6%). The overall incidence of
		CandidaBSI was ~3.97 cases/1000 patient admissions (4.93 in NICU/PICU and 3.53 in
		"adult ICU). The 30-day mortality was ~37%, most associated with C. tropicalis and"
		C. glabrataBSI. Data from this national survey may contribute to improving the
		Balkan and Mediterranean region epidemiology of CandidaBSI within ICUs.

		consultation.
PG	-	1671-6
LID	-	10.1016/j.ophtha.2011.01.038 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: Hematogenous dissemination of fungus of the eyes can manifest as
		chorioretinitis or endophthalmitis. Early reports of this condition describe the
		"prevalence to range from 10% to 40%; however, more recent studies have suggested"
		"a declining prevalence, presumably because of widespread use of prophylactic"
		antifungal therapy and earlier diagnosis and treatment of systemic illness before
		ocular symptoms become apparent. This study estimates the current prevalence and
		microbial profile of fungal chorioretinitis and endophthalmitis among patients
		with positive fungal cultures at a tertiary care medical center. DESIGN:
		Retrospective case series. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 211 adult and pediatric
		inpatients with fungemia. METHODS: All inpatient consultations at our institution
		"to evaluate for ocular involvement by fungal organisms from June 3, 2006, to"
		"September 3, 2009, were reviewed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The presence or absence"
		of ocular lesions consistent with disseminated fungus. RESULTS: A total of 211
		"patients (83 pediatric, 128 adult) had consult requests indicating concern for"
		ocular fungal infection. More than 97% of these patients had at least 1 positive
		"fungal culture. In decreasing order of frequency, the organisms identified were"
		"Candida albicans, C. parapsilosis, C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, and others. More"
		than 98% of all patients were receiving systemic antifungal therapy (average
		duration 6.5 days) at the time of examination. No pediatric patients and only 2
		"adult patients had positive findings (i.e., chorioretinitis or endophthalmitis);"
		1 of these 2 patients was able to verbalize symptoms and reported floaters and
		"blurring, whereas the other patient was unable to verbalize. Visual symptoms were"
		rare (3.5%) among patients with negative findings who could verbalize visual
		symptoms. Three adults had nonspecific fundus lesions that were considered
		inconsistent with chorioretinitis. CONCLUSIONS: Disseminated ocular fungal
		infection is rare in the current era of widespread prophylactic antifungal
		therapy. Less than 1% of patients in our study had ocular involvement from
		"fungus, and no patients who were asymptomatic had involvement. We suggest that"
		routine ophthalmic consultation on fungemic inpatients is not an efficient use of
		"clinical resources; however, validation of these findings via a prospective study"
		is desired. FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE(S): The author(s) have no proprietary or

TI	-	Candidemia in HIV-infected subjects.
PG	-	478-83
AB	-	The epidemiological features of 37 episodes of candidemia in HIV-infected
		subjects were analysed in a retrospective matched case-control study conducted
		over an 8-year period (1990-1997). Univariate analysis identified eight risk
		factors that were significantly associated with candidemia (P<0.05): i) use of
		central venous catheters; ii) administration of total parenteral nutrition; iii)
		previous antifungal therapy; iv) previous therapy with glycopeptides; v) presence
		of oral/ esophageal candidiasis; vi) concomitant bacterial infections; vii)
		neutropenia; and viii) concomitant AIDS dementia complex. Stepwise logistic
		regression analysis revealed that the only independent risk factor for developing
		candidemia was the use of central venous catheters (P = 0.0001). Candida albicans
		"was the most frequently isolated pathogen, accounting for 18 (48%) episodes of"
		"candidemia, followed by Candida tropicalis (19%) and Candida glabrata (11%). The"
		crude mortality rate was 62%. On univariate analysis concomitant opportunistic
		"infections, presence of non-Candida albicans species of Candida and neutropenia"
		were shown to be predictive of death. Multivariate analysis revealed that the
		presence of non-Candida albicans strains of Candida was the only significant
		"factor associated with a worse prognosis (P = 0.001). In conclusion, candidemia"
		appears to be more common in patients with advanced HIV disease. Of the factors
		"which influenced the onset of candidemia, use of central venous catheters seemed"
		to be the most important one.

PG	-	369-74
AB	-	"OBJECTIVE: To examine the incidence, epidemiology, and clinical characteristics"
		of candidemia in a pediatric intensive care unit. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort
		study. SETTING: Pediatric intensive care unit of a tertiary care teaching and
		referral hospital in north India. SUBJECTS: All patients with candidemia from
		March 1993 to December 1996. INTERVENTIONS: Patient-related data were analyzed to
		"study candidemia in relation to reason for fungal culture, underlying medical"
		"conditions, predisposing factors, Candida isolates, antimicrobial and antifungal"
		"treatment, and deaths. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Sixty-four patients with"
		candidemia were identified. The Candida species isolated were Candida tropicalis
		"(48.4%), C. albicans (29.7%), C. guillermondii (14.1%), C. krusei (6.3%), and C."
		glabrata (1.6%). Thirty-three patients were detected by a high-risk surveillance
		"blood culture, whereas 31 patients were detected while undergoing septic workup."
		Sixteen (25%) patients were asymptomatic; they recovered without any antifungal
		"therapy and without any sequelae. Of 48 symptomatic patients, 11 died before"
		institution of antifungal therapy; 37 received oral itraconazole (10
		mg.kg(-1).day(-1)). Seven (19%) of these 37 patients died. Those who recovered
		"had sterile culture on average by day 14 (range, 4-30) and received the"
		"antifungal therapy on average for 24 days (range, 9-42 days). Overall mortality"
		"rate was 28.1%, and bivariate analysis showed significant association with"
		"Pediatric Risk of Mortality score (p =.0001), presence of symptoms (p =.003),"
		isolation of nonalbicans Candida in general (p =.04) and C. tropicalis
		"specifically (p =.001), and failure to give presumptive antifungal therapy (p"
		"=.055). On multivariate analysis, Pediatric Risk of Mortality score and isolation"
		of C. tropicalis were the only significant predictors of mortality. CONCLUSIONS:
		Nonalbicans Candida accounted for 70% of candidemia in a pediatric intensive care
		unit. High-risk surveillance blood cultures aided diagnosis in about half the
		patients. Severity of illness and isolation of C. tropicalis were significant
		predictors of mortality.

TI	-	Factors associated with candiduria and related mortality.
PG	-	450-5
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Although candiduria and bacteriuria have many attributes in common,"
		little data is available regarding factors associated specifically with
		"candiduria. Despite the high mortality in subjects with candiduria, factors"
		associated with such mortality have not been studied. METHODS: We undertook a
		single-center case-control study to evaluate factors associated with candiduria
		over a 10.5 month period. Cases and controls were prospectively recruited from
		"hospitalized subjects with candiduria and bacteriuria, respectively. A subgroup"
		analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mortality following
		"candiduria. RESULTS: Among 145 subjects with candiduria, Candida tropicalis"
		"(30.5%) and other non-albicans species accounted for 71% of isolates. Among them,"
		clinical characteristics and associations were studied among 80 hospitalized
		"subjects. Prior antimicrobial use was documented in 92% with candiduria, with"
		cephalosporins used most commonly. Independent associations with candiduria were
		demonstrated for use of antimicrobial agents in the preceding 30 days (odds ratio
		(OR) 8.1; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1-31.9) and plasma glucose > 180 mg/dL
		(OR 3.1; 95% CI 1.1-9.1). Death occurred among 21 (26.2%) subjects with
		candiduria. Factors associated with death included use of urinary diversion
		"devices (OR 8.8; 95% CI 1.1-70.5), > or = 2 classes of antimicrobials (OR 4.1;"
		"95% CI 1.2-13.9), intensive care (OR 3.3; 95% CI 1.1-9.3), and renal failure (OR"
		2.9; 95% CI 1.1-8.2). CONCLUSIONS: Many risk factors traditionally linked to
		candiduria may be associated with urinary tract infections in general. Factors
		"which predicted occurrence of candiduria, as opposed to bacteriuria, included"
		prior use of antimicrobial agents and elevated plasma glucose. Since factors
		found to have associations with death in candiduria were those expected in
		"seriously ill patients, the high mortality may be a function of the severity of"
		underlying diseases.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to investigate the pattern of oral yeast colonization
		"of Sjögren's syndrome patients and its correlation to salivary flow rates, age,"
		and time of the disease progression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Saliva and swab
		specimens were obtained from 45 patients (primary Sjögren's syndrome = 15/
		secondary Sjögren's syndrome = 15/ healthy controls = 15). Yeast species were
		identified using culture method through chromogenic medium followed by polymerase
		chain reaction and Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: Eleven species from six different
		genera were detected. The most prevalent species found was Candida albicans
		"followed by Candida tropicalis, Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis, and"
		Candida krusei. Both groups of Sjögren's syndrome showed higher counts of
		"C. albicans (Total and CFU counts) when compared to control group. In contrast, a"
		greater variety of yeast species was identified on samples of the control group.
		"CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that C. albicans is the most prevalent yeast, but"
		also that a variety of other yeast species can colonize the oral cavity of
		Sjogren's syndrome patients. The identification of most of the colonies was not
		obtained by culturing-PCR methods combined.

LID	-	10.4103/1319-2442.318533 [doi]
AB	-	Fungal peritonitis (FP) is a rare complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD).
		Candida tropicalis infections are rarely reported in literature. The authors
		present the first case of FP with peritoneal abscess due to C. tropicalis in a
		22-year-old woman admitted to our hospital with septic shock. Abdominal
		tomography demonstrated an abscess in peritoneal space and intraluminal bubble
		appearance in femoral venous and arterial circulation. PD fluid specimens and
		matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry
		(MALDI-TOF MS) analysis revealed fungus growth of C. tropicalis. Fluconazole
		therapy was administered accompanied by catheter removal and mechanical
		ventilation with vasopressor support. The patient recovered after 23 days of
		hospitalization and was discharged. FP represents high mobility and mortality
		unless infection source control and appropriate antimicrobial therapy are
		implemented accompanied by PD catheter removal. The use of MALDI-TOF MS for
		PD-related peritonitis pathogen identification can promote early identification
		"and appropriate antibiotic therapy, especially in C. tropicalis infection."

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive Candida spp. infections have been described more frequently.
		AIM: To characterize the epidemiological data of candidemia in recent years.
		METHODS: A retrospective study of adult patients in a University Hospital in
		"Santiago, Chile, with 1 or more documented episodes of candidemia, from January"
		2000 to December 2013. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty episodes of candidemia
		"were identified in 120 patients, annual incidence of 0.4 cases per 1000"
		"discharges, 53.3% were male patients, 58.3% > 60 years, 77,5% had at least one"
		"co-morbidity. Candida albicans was the species most frequently identified 55%,"
		"followed by C. glabrata 18.3%, C. tropicalis 11.7% and C. parapsilosis 9.2%."
		"Comparing 2000-2006 vs 2007-2013, increased the frequency of C. parapsilosis"
		among non-albicans and echinocandins prescription. Patients with C. albicans
		"showed higher APACHE-II, more requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation,"
		"greater association with CVC, and shorter incubation time compared with"
		non-albicans species. The 30-day mortality was 31.7%. CONCLUSIONS: During this
		14-years period we observed that C. albicans was the predominant specie and more
		recently a change among C. non-albicans increasing C. parapsilosis and decreasing
		C. glabrata 30-days and attributable mortality decreased together with more
		echinocandins prescription.

PG	-	537-543
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-020-00457-6 [doi]
AB	-	Candida species are common in the human oral microbiota and may cause oral
		candidiasis (OC) when the microbiota equilibrium is disturbed. Immunosuppressed
		individuals are susceptible to oral infections as individuals with Down syndrome
		"(IDS) due to particularities of their mouth morphoanatomy, saliva and"
		comorbidities. This study aimed to analyze the molecular epidemiology of Candida
		spp. from the oral cavity of IDS and their relatives. A case-control study with
		80 IDS and 80 non-syndromic (non-DS) was evaluated by oral swab collection for
		"culture on Sabouraud dextrose agar, selection of yeast colonies to Gram staining"
		and culturing on chromogenic media. DNA extraction was performed with the
		phenol/chloroform method for screening of 6 Candida species medically important
		"in PCR, applying SPSS for statistics. We confirmed four species in 46 IDS without"
		"use of antimicrobials (57.54%), with a high prevalence of C. albicans/Ca"
		"(93.48%/43) and 3 C. glabrata/Cg (6.52%), being 25 of these IDS (31.25%)"
		"colonized by species other than C. albicans: Ca + Cg (16), Ca + C. tropicalis/Ct"
		(7) and Ca + C. krusei/Ck (2). Only 10 non-DS were colonized by one species
		"(11.25%): 6 C. albicans, 2 C. glabrata, 1 C. tropicalis and 1 C. krusei. Previous"
		"OC was reported by 39 IDS (48.75%), being 33 positives for Candida spp. (84.61%)"
		and 17 with active OC (21.25%). Five non-DS reported OC previously and had no
		active lesions. Behavioral changes and buccal health programs directed to IDS may
		"help prevent OC and its recurrence, providing information on oral hygiene for"
		self-care.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candida is the commonest opportunistic fungi in human. Candida
		species cause diverse types of diseases. Vaginal candidiasis has been reported as
		one of the most common type of fungal diseases among pregnant women. However; In
		"Ethiopia, due to scarcity of data, much has not been documented regarding the"
		prevalence of Candida among pregnant women. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to
		"determine the prevalence, possible risk factors and antifungal susceptibility"
		profile of Candida species among pregnant women attending Debre Markos Referral
		"Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was conducted from"
		February to May 2017. A total of 384 pregnant women were included using a
		"systematic random sampling technique. Vaginal specimens were collected,"
		inoculated on Candida HiV eg culture Medium and incubated at 37 °C for
		24 h.Colonies were identified using standard microbiological methods and selected
		for further Candida Species identification using Hi Chrome agar and germ tube
		test. Fungal suspensions were made and adjusted at 0.5% MacFarland standard.
		Modified Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion technique was used for antifungal
		"susceptibility. Data was entered, cleaned using Ep info version 7.1and"
		transported to Statistical Packages for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21 for
		analysis. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were performed. P. value
		< 0.05 at 95% confidence interval was considered as statistically significant.
		"RESULT: From a total of 384 study participants, 96 (25%) were positive for"
		Candida species. The predominant Candida species was Candida albicans 54(56.25%)
		"followed by Candida krusei 21(21.9%), Candida glabrata 17(17.7%), Candida"
		tropicalis 1(1%) and 3(3.1%) were other Candida species. Contraceptive use (AOR:
		0.394; 95% CI = 0.20-0.74) and prolonged antibiotic uses (AOR: 0.393; 95%
		CI = 0.21-0.72) were risk factors. All isolates except Candida krusei were 100%
		susceptible to amphotericin-B. Resistance rate was high against itraconazole and
		Ketoconazole 55(57.3%). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of Candida species among
		symptomatic pregnant women was significantly higher than asymptomatic pregnant
		women. Age group between 26 and 40 years was significantly associated with
		Candida infection. Amphotericin B was the most sensitive antifungal drug. High
		rate of multiple drugs resistant Candida species was detected. Therefore
		Symptomatic women should be routinely screened and treated.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Opportunistic infections are frequent in people living with the human
		immunodeficiency virus who either do not have access to antiretroviral therapy
		(ART) or use it irregularly. Tuberculosis is the most frequent infectious disease
		in PLHIV and can predispose patients to severe fungal infections with dire
		consequences. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the case of a 35-year-old Brazilian
		man living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 10 years. He reported no
		adherence to ART and a history of histoplasmosis with hospitalization for 1 month
		"in a public hospital in Natal, Brazil. The diagnosis was disseminated"
		Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. He was transferred to the health service in
		"Recife, Brazil, with a worsening condition characterized by daily fevers,"
		"dyspnea, pain in the upper and lower limbs, cough, dysphagia, and painful oral"
		lesions suggestive of candidiasis. Lymphocytopenia and high viral loads were
		"found. After screening for infections, the patient was diagnosed with tuberculous"
		pericarditis and esophageal candidiasis caused by Candida tropicalis. The
		isolated yeasts were identified using the VITEK 2 automated system and
		matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight-mass spectrometry.
		"Antifungal microdilution broth tests showed sensitivity to fluconazole,"
		"voriconazole, anidulafungin, caspofungin, micafungin, and amphotericin B, with"
		resistance to fluconazole and voriconazole. The patient was treated with COXCIP-4
		"and amphotericin deoxycholate. At 12 days after admission, the patient developed"
		sepsis of a pulmonary focus with worsening of his respiratory status. Combined
		"therapy with meropenem, vancomycin, and itraconazole was started, with fever"
		"recurrence, and he changed to ART and tuberculostatic therapy. The patient"
		remained clinically stable and was discharged with clinical improvement after
		30 days of hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Fungal infections should be considered in
		patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome as they contribute to worsening
		health status. When mycoses are diagnosed early and treated with the appropriate
		"drugs, favorable therapeutic outcomes can be achieved."

		"included C. albicans in 65% of patients, C. glabrata in 21%, C. tropicalis in 9%,"
		"C. parapsilosis in 3%, and C. guilliermondii in 3%. Patients with C. albicans"
		infections were less likely to have received antifungal prophylaxis than those
		"with non-albicans Candida infections (13.6% vs. 50%, P=0.04). The mortality rate"
		"was 36.1% for the cases and 2.8% for the controls (OR 25.0, 95% confidence"
		"interval, 6.2-100.5, P=0.0002). Non-albicans Candida infections (P=0.04) and"
		prior antifungal prophylaxis (P=0.05) correlated with poorer outcome in the
		cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our study has identified predictors for Candida infections in
		the current era that have implications relevant for targeting the prophylaxis
		toward the high-risk patients. Routine use of antifungal prophylaxis warrants
		concern given the emergence of non-albicans Candida spp. as significant pathogens
		after liver transplantation and higher mortality in patients with these
		infections.

PG	-	e759-63
LID	-	10.1016/j.ijid.2011.06.006 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To review the epidemiology of candidemia in a UK tertiary referral
		center. METHODS: Clinical and laboratory data from patients with candidemia were
		"collected prospectively from October 1, 2005 to June 30, 2008 (a 33-month"
		period). RESULTS: A total of 107 episodes were identified. The incidence was 10.9
		episodes/100 000 bed-days. The most common predisposing factors were the use of
		"broad-spectrum antibiotics (92%), the presence of an intravascular device (IVD)"
		"(82%), admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) (51%), and recent surgery (50%)."
		"Non-Candida albicans species accounted for 58% of the episodes, which is higher"
		than the percentage reported from other UK centers. C. albicans was the most
		"common species, accounting for 43% of episodes, followed by C. glabrata (31%) and"
		"C. parapsilosis (20%). Overall C. tropicalis, C. krusei, C. norvegensis, and C."
		lusitaniae caused 7% of episodes. The crude 30-day mortality rate was 37%.
		Advanced age (p = 0.003) and the presence of septic shock (p = 0.038) were
		associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Candidemia continues to be associated
		with a high mortality. Preventative measures should be targeted against high-risk
		"hospitalized patients, especially those in ICUs, the elderly, and those"
		undergoing major surgery. Local surveillance of candidemia is important to
		optimize management.

AB	-	Candidaemia still continues to be a serious medical concern and the epidemiology
		of candidaemia varies according to geographical areas. We aim to determine the
		"incidence, local epidemiology, Candida species distribution and crude mortality"
		rates of candidaemia. We retrospectively evaluated candidaemia episodes in
		"between January 2007 and August 2014. We compared demographic, clinical,"
		microbiological findings and mortality rates of episodes caused by Candida
		albicans and non-albicans Candida species. Overall the candidaemia incidences
		were 1.23 episodes/1000 admissions. A significant negative slope among
		candidaemia episodes and years was determined. Overall C. albicans (54.6%) was
		"the most common species followed by Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis and"
		Candida parapsilosis respectively. Preinfection hospital stay and length of
		hospital stay were statistically longer in patients with non-albicans Candida
		candidaemia than in patients with C. albicans candidaemia. The source of
		candidaemia was unknown in 52.5% of all episodes. Central venous catheters among
		non-albicans Candida candidaemia episodes and urinary system among C. albicans
		candidaemia episodes were common source of candidaemia compared to each other.
		Previous antifungal therapy preceding candidaemia and concomitant bacteraemia
		were significantly associated with non-albicans Candida candidaemia. Continuous
		local surveillance will preserve its pivotal importance in formulating empirical
		antifungal therapy and improving management of candidaemia.

		discharge from ICU or death. Primary BSI was defined as per CDC criteria 1988.
		Data of patients with BSI was compared with those without BSI with respect to
		"demographic details, PRISM III, primary diagnosis, nutritional status, device"
		utilization and invasive procedures to identify risk factors for BSI. Variables
		significant on univariate analysis were subjected to multiple logistic regression
		analysis. Outcome was measured as length of PICU stay (LOS) and survival or
		death. There were 116 episodes of primary BSI in 86 (30%) patients; the incidence
		being 31.2 episodes/1000 patient days. The mean age of the patients with BSI was
		3.7 +/- 3.5 years. Predominant isolates were Gram-negative (53.5%); Klebsiella
		pneumoniae (n = 21) being the commonest. Staphylococcus aureus (n = 18) was the
		most common Gram-positive organism. Seven of the 9 (77.8%) yeast isolates were
		"Candida tropicalis. Younger age, higher PRISM III, lower hemoglobin, pre-existing"
		"infection, higher frequency and duration of device utilization (CVC, urinary"
		"catheter, endotracheal tube, mechanical ventilation) were significant risk"
		"factors on univariate analysis. On multiple logistic regressions, hemoglobin (OR"
		"1.24, 95% CI 1.1-1.4, p = 0.002) duration of urinary catheter (OR 0.91, 95% CI"
		"0.84-0.98, p = 0.015) and pre-existing infection (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.23-0.93, p ="
		0.03) were independent risk factors for primary BSI. The median LOS was
		significantly longer in patients with BSI compared to those without (16 vs. 7
		"days, p = 0.0001) 47% of patients with BSI died as compared to 26% deaths in the"
		whole cohort (p = 0.002). Just over half the cases of BSI in our PICU were caused
		"by Gram-negative bacteria. Lower hemoglobin, pre-existing infection and prolonged"
		duration of urinary catheter were independent risk factors identified on
		multivariate analysis. BSI was associated with significantly higher mortality and
		longer stay in our PICU.

AB	-	"INTRODUCTION: Larger populations at risk, broader use of antibiotics and longer"
		hospital stays have impacted on the incidence of Candida sp. bloodstream
		infections (CBSI). OBJECTIVE: To determine clinical and epidemiologic
		characteristics of patients with CBSI in two tertiary care reference medical
		institutions in Mexico City. DESIGN: Prospective and observational
		laboratory-based surveillance study conducted from 07/2008 to 06/2010. METHODS:
		All patients with CBSI were included. Identification and antifungal
		"susceptibility were performed using CLSI M27-A3 standard procedures. Frequencies,"
		Mann-Whitney U test or T test were used as needed. Risk factors were determined
		with multivariable analysis and binary logistic regression analysis. RESULTS:
		CBSI represented 3.8% of nosocomial bloodstream infections. Cumulative incidence
		was 2.8 per 1000 discharges (incidence rate: 0.38 per 1000 patient-days). C.
		"albicans was the predominant species (46%), followed by C. tropicalis (26%). C."
		"glabrata was isolated from patients with diabetes (50%), and elderly patients."
		Sixty-four patients (86%) received antifungals. Amphotericin-B deoxycholate
		(AmBD) was the most commonly used agent (66%). Overall mortality rate reached
		"46%, and risk factors for death were APACHE II score ≥ 16 (OR = 6.94, CI95% ="
		"2.34-20.58, p<0.0001), and liver disease (OR = 186.11, CI95% = 7.61-4550.20, p ="
		"0.001). Full susceptibility to fluconazole, AmBD and echinocandins among C."
		"albicans, C. tropicalis, and C. parapsilosis was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The"
		cumulative incidence rate in these centers was higher than other reports from
		tertiary care hospitals from Latin America. Knowledge of local epidemiologic
		patterns permits the design of more specific strategies for prevention and
		preemptive therapy of CBSI.

AB	-	This analysis describes the epidemiology and outcomes of invasive candidiasis
		caused by non-albicans species of Candida in patients enrolled in the Prospective
		Antifungal Therapy Alliance (PATH Alliance) registry from 2004 to 2008. A total
		"of 2,496 patients with non-albicans species of Candida isolates were identified."
		"The identified species were C. glabrata (46.4%), C. parapsilosis (24.7%), C."
		"tropicalis (13.9%), C. krusei (5.5%), C. lusitaniae (1.6%), C. dubliniensis"
		(1.5%) and C. guilliermondii (0.4%); 111 infections involved two or more species
		of Candida (4.4%). Non-albicans species accounted for more than 50% of all cases
		of invasive candidiasis in 15 of the 24 sites (62.5%) that contributed more than
		"one case to the survey. Among solid organ transplant recipients, patients with"
		"non-transplant surgery, and patients with solid tumors, the most prevalent"
		"non-albicans species was C. glabrata at 63.7%, 48.0%, and 53.8%, respectively. In"
		"1,883 patients receiving antifungal therapy on day 3, fluconazole (30.5%) and"
		echinocandins (47.5%) were the most frequently administered monotherapies. Among
		"the 15 reported species, 90-day survival was highest for patients infected with"
		either C. parapsilosis (70.7%) or C. lusitaniae (74.5%) and lowest for patients
		infected with an unknown species (46.7%) or two or more species (53.2%). In
		"conclusion, this study expands the current knowledge of the epidemiology and"
		outcomes of invasive candidiasis caused by non-albicans species of Candida in
		North America. The variability in species distribution in these centers
		underscores the importance of local epidemiology in guiding the selection of
		antifungal therapy.

		candidaemia.
PG	-	352-360
LID	-	10.1111/myc.13049 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candidaemia is a common life-threatening disease among hospitalised
		"patients, but the effect of the Candida biofilm-forming ability on the clinical"
		outcome remains controversial. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to determine the impact of
		"biofilms, specifically focusing on biofilm mass and metabolic activity, on the"
		mortality in candidaemia. PATIENTS/METHODS: The clinical data of patients
		"(n = 127) treated at the University of Debrecen, Clinical Centre, between January"
		"2013 and December 2018, were investigated retrospectively. Biofilm formation was"
		"assessed using the crystal violet and XTT assays, measuring the biofilm mass and"
		"metabolic activity, respectively. Isolates were classified as low, intermediate"
		and high biofilm producers both regarding biofilm mass and metabolic activity.
		"The susceptibility of one-day-old biofilms to fluconazole, amphotericin B,"
		"anidulafungin, caspofungin and micafungin was evaluated and compared to"
		planktonic susceptibility. RESULTS: Intermediate/high biofilm mass was associated
		"with significantly higher mortality (61%). All Candida tropicalis, Candida"
		parapsilosis and Candida glabrata isolates originating from fatal infections were
		"intermediate/high biofilm producers, whereas this ratio was 85% for Candida"
		albicans. Solid malignancy was associated with intermediate/high biofilm
		producers (P = .043). The mortality was significantly higher in infections caused
		by Candida strains producing biofilms with intermediate/high metabolic activity
		"(62% vs. 33%, P = .010). The ratio of concomitant bacteraemia was higher for"
		"isolates forming biofilms with low metabolic activity (53% vs 28%, P = .015)."
		CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that the Candida biofilms especially
		with intermediate/high metabolic activity are related to higher mortality in
		candidaemia.

AB	-	"This study was planned to determine the risk factors of candidemia, and the most"
		common Candida species causing bloodstream infections. A case-control study which
		included adult patients was conducted over a 1-year period at tertiary-care
		educational hospitals in Turkey. A total of 83 candidemia episodes were
		identified during the study period. Candida albicans was the most common species
		recovered (45.8%) followed by Candida tropicalis (24.1%) Candida parapsilosis
		(14.5%) and Candida glabrata which was isolated from only four (4.8%) patients.
		Presence of a urethral catheter (odds ratio [OR] 2.38; 95% confidence interval
		"[CI] 1.09-5.19; P = 0.02), previous use of antibiotics (OR 2.61; 95% CI"
		"1.05-6.46; P = 0.03), RBC transfusions (OR 2.14; 95% CI 1.16-3.94; P = 0.01) and"
		parenteral nutrition (OR 4.44; 95% CI 2.43-8.11; P < 0.01) were found as
		independent risk factors for candidemia. TPN (Total Parenteral Nutrition) was an
		independent risk factor for both C. albicans and non-Candida albicans Candida
		species (P < 0.001). Most of the risk factors were invasive procedures and former
		medications. We conclude that a great number of candidemia cases are preventable
		by means of reduction of unnecessary invasive procedures and the use of
		antimicrobials.

PG	-	697-703
AB	-	All consecutive patients with positive blood culture for Candida species over a
		6-year period were evaluated to define recent epidemiologic characteristics of
		"candidemia, and to assess the prevalence of late complications. We encountered"
		106 cases; medical records were available for 99 of them. The rate of candidemia
		"was increasing until 1990, after which it declined. C. albicans was the most"
		"common species, but in the last 2 years, C. tropicalis and C. parapsilosis were"
		emerging. Overall mortality rate was 54.5% without significant variation during
		the study period. Antifungal therapy was withheld in 24/99 cases (24.2%).
		Decision to withhold treatment was taken in 19/59 cases (32.2%) before the
		"availability of fluconazole in 1990, compared with 5/40 cases (12.5%) afterward"
		(p < 0.05). Follow-up was possible in 35 instances for an average period of 17.1
		"months (range: 1-48 months); 7 of these individuals, all with transient"
		"candidemia, were untreated. None of the survivors developed late complications."
		"These findings demonstrate that candidemia appears to be declining since 1990,"
		with a noticeable decrease in the prevalence of C. albicans but an increase in
		"that of C. tropicalis and C. parapsilosis, that fewer patients are left untreated"
		"since fluconazole became available, and that the risk of late complications among"
		the survivors is low.

PG	-	19-28
AB	-	The incidence of nosocomial candidemia increased 27-fold over the past 13 years
		at National Taiwan University Hospital. In order to investigate its predisposing
		"factors, clinical manifestations and prognostic determinants, a prospective"
		observational study of nosocomial candidemia was undertaken at the hospital. From
		"1 May 1994 to 30 April 1995, 118 consecutive adult patients with 120 Candida spp"
		blood isolates were analyzed. Clinical presentations included fever (100%) with a
		"median duration of 3 days, diarrhea within 7 days of candidemia (27.9%) and"
		macronodular skin emboli (7.6%). Laboratory studies showed worsening azotemia
		"(35.6%), elevation of aminotransferase (28.3%), leukocytosis (27.1%) and"
		"thrombocytopenia (23.3%). Use of multiple antibiotics, retained vascular"
		catheters and parenteral nutritional support were the three most common
		predisposing factors for candidemia. C. albicans was the most common isolate
		"(50%), followed by C. tropicalis (20%), C. glabrata (14%), C. parapsilosis"
		"(9.2%). C. guilliermondii (2.5%), and C. Krusei (1.7%). C. tropicalis was more"
		"frequently the cause of candidemia in patients with leukemia and neutropenia,"
		while C. glabrata was more commonly seen in patients receiving fluconazole
		prophylaxis. A severity scoring system adopted from prospective bacteremia
		studies proved to be highly predictive of mortality in candidemic patients. The
		"overall case fatality rate was 70/118 (59.3%), and 51/70 (72.9%) were"
		"attributable to candidemia. In a multivariate analysis, the prognostic factors"
		"adversely influencing outcome were: higher severity scores, no removal of the"
		"catheter, persistent candidemia and lack of antifungal therapy."

TI	-	Neonatal invasive candidiasis: a prospective multicenter study of 118 cases.
PG	-	153-63
AB	-	A prospective multicenter study was conducted to assess the epidemiology of
		"neonatal invasive candidiasis in Spain. In a total of 20,565 admissions to the 27"
		"participating neonatal units over an 18-month period, systemic candidiasis was"
		diagnosed in 118 (0.57%) neonates. Candida species were isolated from the blood
		"in 79 infants, from the urine in 33, and from the cerebrospinal fluid in 4; in 2"
		"cases, histologic evidence of deep tissue candidiasis was found at autopsy."
		Very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants (< or = 1500 g) showed a significantly
		higher incidence of systemic candidiasis (4.8%) than infants weighing > 1500 g
		(0.2%) ( p < 0.001). Candida albicans was the most frequent species (52.5%)
		"followed by C. parapsilosis (23.7%), and C. tropicalis (7.6%). Only seven infants"
		"were treated with amphotericin B (initial dose 0.18 +/- 0.3 mg/kg, maximal daily"
		dose 1.7 +/- 0.9 mg/kg) but treatment was stopped in three of them (43%) due to
		nephrotoxicity. Liposomal amphotericin B was given to 81 neonates and
		amphotericin B lipid complex to 29. There were no differences in mortality rate
		and in the incidence of adverse effects in relation to treatment with liposomal
		amphotericin B or amphotericin B lipid complex. The mortality rate was 10.2% and
		all deaths occurred in the VLBW cohort with candidemia.

TI	-	Fungal endophthalmitis: fourteen years' experience from a center in India.
PG	-	1400-7
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: As fungal endophthalmitis is an emerging challenge, the study was"
		carried out to determine the prevalence and the spectrum of fungal agents causing
		"endophthalmitis from a single center, to identify the risk factors, and to"
		correlate clinical course of illness with the agents involved. METHODS: The
		microbiological and clinical records of all fungal endophthalmitis diagnosed
		during January 1992 through December 2005 at a tertiary center in India were
		"reviewed retrospectively. During this period, treatment protocol of the patients"
		"with fungal endophthalmitis was pars plana vitrectomy, instillation of"
		intravitreal amphotericin B (5 microg) and dexamethasone (400 microg).
		"Additionally, oral fluconazole (27 patients) or itraconazole (78 patients) was"
		given in 105 patients. RESULTS: Fungal endophthalmitis was diagnosed in 113
		"patients and they were categorized into: postcataract surgery (53 patients),"
		"posttrauma (48), and endogenous (12) groups. Aspergillus species was the most"
		"common (54.4%) agent isolated, followed by yeasts (24.6%), and melanized fungi"
		"(10.5%). Among Aspergilli, Aspergillus flavus was the most common (24.6%) species"
		whereas Candida tropicalis (8.8%) was in the yeast. Other rare agents isolated
		"include Fonsecaea pedrosoi, Fusarium solani, Paecilomyces lilacinus,"
		"Pseudallescheria boydii, Colletotrichum dematium, Cryptococcus neoformans, and"
		"Trichosporon cutaneum. Visual acuity after therapy remained <20/400 in 77.4%,"
		"64.3%, 50.0%, and 16.7% patients infected with Aspergillus species, yeasts,"
		"melanized fungi and other mycelial fungi, respectively. The outcome was"
		"unfavorable in 52.8%, 66.7%, and 33.3% patients with postoperative, posttrauma,"
		"and endogenous groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the largest"
		series of fungal endophthalmitis from a single center and highlights the fact
		that a vast array of fungi can cause endophthalmitis though Aspergilli are the
		common agents. The combination of pars plana vitrectomy and intravitreal
		amphotericin B with or without fluconazole/itraconazole was the common mode of
		"therapy in such patients. However, the main challenge is suspecting fungal"
		etiology at the time of presentation and accurately diagnosing those patients.

PG	-	587-90
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To describe an outbreak of Candida tropicalis fungemia in a neonatal
		"intensive care unit (NICU), to evaluate the risk factors associated with this"
		infection and the possible mode of nosocomial transmission. DESIGN: Descriptive
		and case-control study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Surveillance cultures were taken
		"from hospitalized patients, personnel, and inanimate objects in the NICU. Six"
		patients with C tropicalis fungemia (cases) were compared with C tropicalis
		culture-negative patients matched for duration of exposure to the NICU
		"(controls). RESULTS: During a five-month period, C tropicalis was isolated from"
		29 blood cultures of six premature infants. The same organism also was isolated
		"from fingernail samples taken from the ward housekeeper, who had a mild"
		"onychomycosis, and an asymptomatic nurse. Other potential reservoirs of C"
		tropicalis were not identified among all the other infants or in the hospital
		environment. The six patients with C tropicalis fungemia were more likely to have
		"received a larger number of antibiotics (4.0 versus 1.8, P < 0.001) and to have"
		been subjected to a longer duration of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) therapy
		"(8.5 versus 2.67 days, P = 0.004) than the controls. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of"
		fungemia in this outbreak can be attributed to a larger number of antibiotics and
		a longer period of TPN administered to the patients. Analysis of events suggests
		that the outbreak may have been the result of cross-infection between staff and
		patients.

		1-infected cells with intranuclear inclusions and multinucleation on the 7th day.
		"Moreover, the patient showed microscopic hematuria. Urine cytology also revealed"
		"HSV type 1-infected cells. The patient was treated with antiviral (acyclovir),"

		admission. We describe a case of HSV type 1 pneumonia and urinary tract infection
		in an older adult patient.

TI	-	Distribution and epidemiology of Candida species causing fungemia at a Saudi
		"Arabian hospital, 1996-2004."
PG	-	239-44
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate the Candida species and
		the change over time in the organisms causing candidemia at Saudi Aramco Medical
		Services Organization in Saudi Arabia. We also describe the risk factors
		associated with mortality. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of candidemia
		over nine years (1996-2004). RESULTS: A total of 98 distinct episodes of
		candidemia were identified over the study period. The annual incidence of
		candidemia ranged between 0.2 and 0.76 cases/1000 hospital discharges with an
		incidence per 10 000 patient-days per year of 0.45 to 1.6. The most frequent
		"Candida species were Candida albicans (53%), Candida tropicalis (19%), Candida"
		"parapsilosis (16%), and Candida glabrata (7%). In relation to predisposing"
		"factors, 83% of candidemia occurred in patients with central venous catheters and"
		96% had received broad-spectrum antibiotics. Other predisposing factors included
		"complicated abdominal surgeries (22%), total parenteral nutrition (52%),"
		"neutropenia (9%), acute renal failure (24%), malignancy (26%) and burns (15%)."
		"However, prior fluconazole use was low (8%). The overall crude mortality rate was"
		43% for all candidemia. Logistic regression analysis identified two independent
		"determinants of death, C. albicans (OR 5.91, 95% CI 1.50, 23.24, p=0.01) and"
		"acute renal failure (OR 5.15, 95% CI 1.18, 22.55, p=0.03). CONCLUSION: The study"
		showed that the rate of candidemia was low in our hospital and that C. albicans
		was the major species followed by C. tropicalis and C. parapsilosis. Future
		studies are needed to evaluate the antifungal susceptibility pattern in our
		hospital.

PG	-	140-8
LID	-	10.1111/myc.12288 [doi]
AB	-	The aim of this study is to identify differences in distribution of Candida
		"species, resistance to antifungals and clinical outcome, as well as the"
		identification of potential risk factors associated with candidaemia in children.
		We conducted a retrospective analysis in children ≤18 years with blood culture
		proven candidaemia identified between 2004 and 2012. Patients were divided into
		"two groups (Group 1, <3 months, n = 51; Group 2, ≥3 months, n = 197) to identify"
		any potential difference between the neonatal and early infantile periods in
		terms of risk factors and distribution of Candida species. A total of 248
		distinct episodes of candidaemia were identified over the study period. The most
		"frequently isolated Candida species were C. albicans (53.2%), followed by C."
		"parapsilosis (26.2%), C. tropicalis (8.1%). Of the 248 episodes, 71 episodes"
		(28.6%) resulted in death within 30 days from the onset of candidaemia. In Group
		"1, failure of central venous catheter (CVC) removal was found to be associated"
		"with a 20.5-fold increase in mortality [95% CI (3.9, 106.5); P < 0.001], compared"
		"to a 5.9-fold increased risk with hypoalbuminaemia [95% CI (1.03, 34.1); P ="
		"0.046]. For Group 2, the increased risk was 23-fold for failure of CVC removal"
		"[95% CI (7.48, 70.77); P < 0.001], 7.4-fold for mechanical ventilation [95% CI"
		"(2.64, 21.08); P < 0.001], 4.4-fold for hypoalbuminaemia [95% CI (1.56, 12.56); P"
		"= 0.005], 3.1-fold for neutropaenia [95% CI (1.31, 7.69); P = 0.010] and 2.2-fold"
		"for male gender [95% CI (1.02, 4.71); P = 0.043]. Therapeutic choices should be"
		guided by sound knowledge of local epidemiological trends in candidaemia. Removal
		of CVC significantly reduces mortality and is an essential step in the management
		of candidaemia.

		Reference Center: Epidemiology and associated factors.
PG	-	812-822
LID	-	10.1111/myc.13106 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive fungal disease is a significant cause of morbidity and
		mortality in immunosuppressed children. The recognition of patients at risk for
		candidaemia is paramount to a better prognosis. OBJECTIVES: To characterize
		Candida spp bloodstream infections (BSI) in a reference centre for paediatric
		oncology and to describe the most prevalent risk factors associated with candida
		infections. PATIENTS/METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study carried out
		"with paediatric patients followed up with at the Institute of Pediatric Oncology,"
		"Brazil, who presented positive blood culture for Candida spp from January 2004 to"
		December 2016. RESULTS: Ninety episodes of candidaemia were analysed; patients
		"had a median age of 4.5 years, and 57.8% were males, with a diagnosis of solid"
		tumours in 54.5% of cases. The most common Candida species were C albicans
		"(35.6%), C parapsilosis (30.0%) and C tropicalis (16.7%). C tropicalis BSI was"
		associated with neutropenia and skin lesions. Therapy was successful in 67.1% of
		the episodes. Older age and thrombocytopenia were associated with therapeutic
		failure. Death within 30 days occurred in 24.4% of patients; predictive factors
		were older age and admission to an ICU C parapsilosis candidaemia was a
		protective factor for death when compared to C albicans. CONCLUSION: The main
		"species isolated were C albicans, C parapsilosis and C tropicalis. C tropicalis"
		BSI was associated with neutropenia and skin lesions. The death rate was
		"significant, and a worse prognosis was associated with older age,"
		thrombocytopenia and admission to an ICU C parapsilosis infection proved to be a
		protective factor against mortality.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Few studies exist on prevalence of fungemia by Candida orthopsilosis,"
		"with variable results. AIMS: To study the incidence, epidemiology and antifungal"
		susceptibility of C. orthopsilosis strains isolated from fungemias over two years
		at a tertiary hospital. METHODS: Candidemia episodes between June 2007 and June
		"2009 in a university hospital (Puerta del Mar, Cádiz, Spain) were studied. The"
		strains initially identified as Candida parapsilosis were genotypically screened
		"for C. parapsilosis sensu stricto, C. orthopsilosis and Candida metapsilosis, and"
		their antifungal susceptibility was evaluated. RESULTS: In this period 52 cases
		of candidemia were documented. Of the 19 strains originally identified as C.
		"parapsilosis, 13 were confirmed as C. parapsilosis sensu stricto and 6 as C."
		"orthopsilosis. Of the 52 isolates, the most frequent species were Candida"
		"albicans (30.8%), C. parapsilosis sensu stricto (25%), C. orthopsilosis, Candida"
		tropicalis and Candida glabrata in equal numbers (11.5%). C. orthopsilosis
		"isolates were susceptible to amphotericin B, caspofungin, voriconazole and"
		"fluconazole, with no significant differences in MIC values with C. parapsilosis"
		sensu stricto. The source of isolates of C. orthopsilosis were neonates (50%) and
		"surgery (50%), and 100% were receiving parenteral nutrition; however C."
		parapsilosis sensu stricto was recovered primarily from patients over 50 years
		(69.2%) and 46.1% were receiving parenteral nutrition. CONCLUSIONS: These
		findings show that C. orthopsilosis should be considered as human pathogenic
		yeast and therefore its accurate identification is important. Despite our small
		sample size our study suggests that a displacement of some epidemiological
		characteristics previously attributed to C. parapsilosis to C. orthopsilosis may
		be possible.

TI	-	Epidemiology of community-onset candidemia in Connecticut and Maryland.
PG	-	32-9
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Almost one-third of patients with bloodstream infections with Candida
		species (candidemia) have onset of disease that occurs outside of the hospital or
		"< or = 2 days after hospital admission (i.e., community-onset candidemia). We"
		compared the characteristics of patients who developed candidemia by the timing
		of onset of infection. METHODS: Incident episodes of candidemia were identified
		"through active, population-based surveillance in Connecticut and in Baltimore and"
		"Baltimore County, Maryland, during 1 October 1998-30 September 2000. The"
		molecular subtypes of a sample of 45 Candida parapsilosis isolates were evaluated
		"using Southern blots hybridized with the complex probe Cp3-13. RESULTS: Overall,"
		356 (31%) of the 1143 incident episodes of candidemia were classified as
		"community-onset disease (occurring < or = 2 days after hospital admission), and"
		"132 (37%) were caused by Candida albicans, 89 (25%) were caused by Candida"
		"glabrata, 57 (16%) were caused by C. parapsilosis, and 53 (15%) were caused by"
		Candida tropicalis. Community-onset disease was less likely to be associated with
		"concurrent immunosuppressive therapy, recent surgery, or use of a central venous"
		"catheter, compared with inpatient disease. Among patients with community-onset"
		"disease, the median time from blood culture to initiation of antifungal treatment"
		"was 2.7 days, the 30-day case-fatality rate was 26%, and 262 patients (75%) had"
		been hospitalized at least once in the previous 3 months. Although there were few
		differences between patients with very recent hospitalization (in the previous 1
		"month), less recent hospitalization (previous 1-3 months), and no documented past"
		"hospitalization, C. parapsilosis was more frequently associated with"
		community-onset disease as hospitalization became more distant. C. parapsilosis
		"strains tended to be unique to the patient, with little similarity found between"
		"strain types, on the basis of epidemiologic classification of patients."
		CONCLUSION: We report that community-onset candidemia is common and occurs in
		patients with extensive contact with the health care system. Disease caused by C.
		parapsilosis tends to involve unique strains.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Despite being associated with a high mortality and economic burden,"
		data regarding candidemia are scant in Algeria. The aim of this study was to
		"unveil the epidemiology of candidemia in Algeria, evaluate the antifungal"
		susceptibility pattern of causative agents and understand the molecular
		"mechanisms of antifungal resistance where applicable. Furthermore, by performing"
		environmental screening and microsatellite typing we sought to identify the
		source of infection. METHODS: We performed a retrospective epidemiological-based
		surveillance study and collected available blood yeast isolates recovered from
		"the seven hospitals in Algiers. To identify the source of infection, we performed"
		environmental screening from the hands of healthcare workers (HCWs) and high
		touch areas. Species identification was performed by API Auxa-Color and MALDI-TOF
		MS and ITS sequencing was performed for species not reliably identified by
		MALDI-TOF MS. Antifungal susceptibility testing followed CLSI M27-A3/S4 and
		included all blood and environmental yeast isolates. ERG11 sequencing was
		performed for azole-resistant Candida isolates. Microsatellite typing was
		"performed for blood and environmental Candida species, where applicable. RESULTS:"
		Candida tropicalis (19/66) was the main cause of candidemia in these seven
		"hospitals, followed by Candida parapsilosis (18/66), Candida albicans (18/66),"
		and Candida glabrata (7/66). The overall mortality rate was 68.6% (35/51) and was
		81.2% for C. tropicalis-infected patients (13/16). Fluconazole was the main
		antifungal drug used (12/51); 41% of the patients (21/51) did not receive any
		systemic treatment. Candida parapsilosis was isolated mainly from the hands of
		"HCWs (7/28), and various yeasts were collected from high-touch areas (11/47),"
		"including Naganishia albida, C. parapsilosis and C. glabrata. Typing data"
		revealed interhospital transmission on two occasions for C. parapsilosis and C.
		"glabrata, and the same clone of C. parapsilosis infected two patients within the"
		same hospital. Resistance was only noted for C. tropicalis against azoles (6/19)
		and fluconazole-resistant C. tropicalis isolates (≥8 μg/ml) (6/19) contained a
		novel P56S (5/6) amino acid substitution and a previously reported one (V234F;
		"1/6) in Erg11p. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our data suggest an urgent need for"
		antifungal stewardship and infection control strategies to improve the clinical
		outcome of Algerian patients with candidemia. The high prevalence of C.
		tropicalis joined by fluconazole-resistance may hamper the therapeutic efficacy
		"of fluconazole, the frontline antifungal drug used in Algeria."

AB	-	Vaginal Candida infection is one of the most common genital tract infections
		reported in pregnant women. This study was designed to determine the prevalence
		of vaginal Candida infection and pattern of Candida species isolates in the
		genital tract of pregnant women during antenatal period and in early labour; and
		the associated fetal outcome. The study was conducted at the antenatal clinic and
		"labor ward of Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital Sagamu, Ogun State,"
		Nigeria. High vaginal swabs were collected from 408 pregnant women at the
		antenatal clinic and repeated in early labour. The samples were processed to
		isolate Candida species. Data were analysed using Statistical Package for Social
		"Science (SPSS) windows version 21.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Prevalence of"
		Candida infection was significantly higher in early labour (46%) than during
		"antenatal period (38%) (P=0.02). Candida albicans was the predominant isolate,"
		followed by Candida glabrata and Candida tropicalis. Candida infection was
		"associated with increased likelihood of low birth weight babies (AOR 2.8, CI:"
		1.1-6.8; P= 0.03). However there was no statistically significant effect of
		"Candida infection on the likelihood of preterm delivery (AOR 1.4, CI: 0.7-2.6; P="
		0.35). Routine screening and prompt treatment of women at risk of delivering low
		birth weight babies is advocated.

		"characteristics of candidemic IMW patients and to study the incidence, species"
		"distribution, and outcomes of these patients compared to surgical and intensive"

		"candidemic patients in IMWs, general surgery wards, and an ICU at Beilinson"
		Hospital during the period 2007-2014 was analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 118
		"patients with candidemia were identified in six IMWs, two general surgery wards,"
		and one ICU in the hospital. Candida albicans was the leading causative agent
		(41.1%). Higher proportions of Candida parapsilosis and Candida tropicalis
		isolates were observed in the IMW patients. IMW patients were significantly
		"older, with poorer functional capacity, and had more frequently been exposed to"
		"antibiotic therapy within 90 days, in particular β-lactam-β-lactamase inhibitor"
		"combinations and cephalosporins. At onset of candidemia, a significantly lower"
		number of IMW patients were mechanically ventilated (p<0.01); these patients did
		not have central line catheters comparable to ICU and surgical patients
		(p<0.001). They were less likely to receive adequate antifungal therapy within
		"48h, and this was the only significant predictor of survival in these patients"
		(p=0.028): hazard ratio 3.7 (95% confidence interval 1.14-12.5) for therapy
		delayed to >48h. CONCLUSIONS: IMW candidemic patients account for a substantial
		proportion of candidemia cases and have unique characteristics and high mortality
		rates.

TI	-	Epidemiology of candidemia--a nationwide survey in Israel.
PG	-	26-9
AB	-	Bloodstream infections with Candida are often lethal and have been reported to be
		increasing in frequency. The current retrospective study describes the magnitude
		and epidemiological characteristics of candidemia in all western-type hospital
		facilities in Israel in 1994. Comprehensiveness of the data from the reporting
		hospitals was checked by cross-study of the data from the infectious diseases
		records and from the hospitalization records. Vital status of all reported cases
		was evaluated 1 year after the diagnosis. Data on 298 newly diagnosed cases of
		candidemia were received from 14 of the 18 general hospitals in Israel. The
		proportion of candidemia in the Israeli hospitals ranged from 0.1 to 0.01% of all
		"admissions, with a mean of 0.05%. The incidence of candidemia differed"
		"significantly between the wards from 4-5/10,000 in general surgery and internal"
		"medicine wards to about 60/10,000 and 80/10,000 in intensive care and preterm"
		"units, respectively. Of all detected cases 53.6% were Candida albicans. Another"
		"nine specific species of Candida (mainly Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis"
		"and Candida glabrata) were detected, with major differences between the various"
		hospitals. The species of Candida differed significantly by sex and age. Of the
		cases of candidemia 21.5% died within 30 days of the isolation of the pathogen.
		The one-year mortality rate was 31.9%. Species-specific 30-day mortality rate was
		"highest for C. glabrata. Throughout the analysis, C. glabrata emerged as a unique"

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive candidiasis (IC) is the most common cause of invasive fungal
		infections. Identification of risk factors for such infection may help in the
		empirical therapeutic decision-making process. We conducted this study to
		characterize the clinical epidemiology of such infection and to differentiate
		risk factors between Candida albicans and Candida non-albicans species. METHODS:
		"We retrospectively evaluated patients with IC from 2011 to 2013. Clinical data,"
		"antibiotic therapy, underlying condition, and invasive procedures were analyzed"
		and compared between C. albicans and C. non-albicans species. RESULTS: C.
		albicans was the most frequently isolated Candida species (48.6% of all IC
		"patients), although C. non-albicans spp. were more commonly isolated overall. C."
		"albicans, Candida tropicalis, and Candida parapsilosis have a high susceptibility"
		"rate to all antifungal agents (>90%), whereas Candida glabrata showed decreased"
		susceptibility to fluconazole and itraconazole. Amphotericin B demonstrated
		excellent antifungal activity against all Candida species. Univariate analyses
		showed that IC patients with C. albicans had a higher ratio of older age
		"(p = 0.008), solid tumor (p = 0.029), and hypoproteinemia (p = 0.019), whereas"
		those with C. non-albicans spp. had a higher ratio of hospital length of stay
		"(p = 0.005), usage of corticosteroids (p = 0.011), duration on corticosteroids"
		"(p = 0.005), chemotherapy (p = 0.022), hematologic malignancy (p = 0.039),"
		"neutropenia (p = 0.030), and usage of glycopeptides (p = 0.002). Multivariate"
		analyses showed that a significant predictor of IC due to C. albicans was
		"hypoproteinemia [odds ratio (95% confidence interval) = 2.133 (1.164-3.908),"
		p = 0.014]. CONCLUSION: C. albicans was the most frequently isolated Candida
		species. The risk factors between C. albicans and C. non-albicans species are
		different.

		"intestine, potentially leading to bowel obstruction, gangrene and perforation. It"
		"is a rare condition, especially in adults. CASE PRESENTATION: A 30-year-old man"
		was retrieved from the jungle with severe weight loss and abdominal symptoms. He
		succumbed to death despite 22 days of intensive medical treatment. An autopsy
		revealed a ruptured gangrenous ileal volvulus with peritonitis and
		subdiaphragmatic abscess. Further laboratory analysis detected systemic Candida
		"tropicalis and intestinal gramnegative bacterial sepsis, systemic Zika virus"
		"viremia, leptospirosis complicating rhabdomyolysis and disseminated intravascular"
		"coagulopathy, Type I Herpes Simplex virus infection of the tongue and upper"
		"gastrointestinal tract. The cause of death was the ruptured ileal volvulus,"
		complicated with upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to Herpes simplex virus
		esophagitis in a malnourished patient with resolving leptospirosis and underlying
		Zika virus co-infection. CONCLUSION: Rare clinical scenarios of adult-onset
		intestinal volvulus with concomitant multiple infections precludes clinical
		"diagnosis and early treatment, leading to devastating consequences of clinical"
		outcome. The positive clinical and postmortem correlation is a good learning
		lesson in many disciplines of medicine and science.

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: The aim of this cross-sectional observational study was to compare
		the prevalence of different oral Candida spp. in patients with Type 2 Diabetes
		and chronic periodontitis in two oral sites: dorsal surface of the tongue and
		subgingival area. In order to determine subgingival areas as potential reservoirs
		"of yeasts, this study aimed to find differences in the yeasts' detection between"
		"the dorsum of the tongue, as the oral site most commonly inhabited with"
		"microorganisms, and subgingival samples. Additionally, potential predictors for"
		the yeasts prevalence were determined. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Subjects (N = 146)
		were divided into four groups: group A- healthy individuals without
		"periodontitis, group B- healthy individuals with chronic periodontitis, group C-"
		Type 2 Diabetes patients with good glycoregulation and Chronic periodontitis and
		group D- Type 2 Diabetes patients with poor glycoregulation and Chronic
		periodontitis. Samples were obtained from the tongue by swabbing. Subgingival
		plaque samples were taken by paper points and periodontal curette. Isolation and
		identification of different Candida spp. was done using ChromAgar medium. In
		"addition, germ-tube production and carbohydrate assimilation tests were"
		performed. RESULTS: The prevalence of Candida spp. was higher in diabetics with
		poor glycoregulation. The most frequently isolated species was Candida albicans
		"followed by Candida glabrata and Candida tropicalis. In 15.6% of cases, Candida"
		spp. was present in the subgingival area while absent on the tongue. Multivariate
		regression model showed that HbA1c was Candida spp. predictor for both locations.
		CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirmed that there are Candida spp. carriers among
		"subjects with clinically healthy oral mucosa. Also, this study identified"
		subgingival areas as potential reservoirs of these pathogenic species.
		Glycoregulation has been recognized as a positive predictor factor of Candida
		spp.

		period.
PG	-	390-6
AB	-	In a retrospective analysis of 128 cases of Candida bloodstream infections in a
		"London teaching hospital between 1995 and 2001, the incidence of candidaemia"
		increased from 0.2/1000 admissions in 1995 to 0.5 and 0.4/1000 admissions in 2000
		"and 2001, respectively. Risk factors for candidaemia included the presence of"
		"intravascular (IV) lines (88%), admission to intensive care (51%), parenteral"
		"nutrition (35%), multiple antibiotics (74%), corticosteroid therapy (12%), cancer"
		"chemotherapy (11%), renal transplantation (5%) and neutropenia (3%). The sources"
		"of infection were IV lines (77%), the urinary tract (7%) and the gastrointestinal"
		"tract (7%). Serious infective complications (endocarditis, endophthalmitis or"
		brain abscess) were noted in 6% of cases. The most frequently isolated species
		"were Candida albicans (64%), C. glabrata (20%), C. tropicalis (9%) and C."
		parapsilosis (5%). The overall fluconazole-resistance rate of Candida spp. was 7%
		(MIC > or = 64 mg l-1). All the C. albicans isolates were sensitive to
		fluconazole (MIC < or = 8 mg l-1) whereas 20% of non-C. albicans isolates (27% of
		C. glabrata and 14%C. tropicalis) were resistant. The mortality rate (35%) was
		lower than in other reports and may be due to the early recognition of
		candidaemia and the prompt removal of IV lines together with the initiation of
		"appropriate antifungal therapy. Regular surveillance of local Candida species,"
		resistance profiles and risk factors is important in order to identify patients
		at risk and to develop empirical treatment protocols to reduce the incidence and
		mortality of candidaemia.

PG	-	243-5
AB	-	"Candida meningitis, a previously rare occurrence, has been increasing in"
		prevalence and often is a result of complications of neurosurgery. We describe
		"the case of a 49-year-old man who presented with headache, vertigo, intermittent"
		"blurred vision, and multiple episodes of nausea and vomiting. Computed tomography"
		(CT) showed a left cerebellar hemorrhage with obliteration of the fourth
		ventricle causing hydrocephalus. He had an occipital craniotomy with
		transcondylar evacuation of the hemorrhage and placement of a temporary
		ventriculostomy. The hospital stay was prolonged because of postsurgical
		"complications, and Candida tropicalis meningitis developed. Treatment was started"
		with 400 mg of fluconazole administered intravenously every 12 h. In vitro
		susceptibility testing showed a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) to
		fluconazole of 1 microg/mL. Fluconazole was therefore continued orally for a
		"total of 60 days, and the patient remained asymptomatic for 2 years. He then"
		presented with increased vertigo and ataxia. Cerebrospinal fluid cultures grew C.
		"tropicalis, which again showed susceptibility to fluconazole with a MIC of 1"
		"microg/mL, identical to that in the previous infection. However, a second course"
		of fluconazole failed to control the infection despite adequate cerebrospinal
		fluid levels.

TI	-	Clinical profile and risk factors for oral candidosis in sick newborns.
PG	-	299-303
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To provide the clinical profile and assess the significance of
		various risk factors contributing to the occurrence of oral candidosis in
		newborns. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Neonatal Intensive Care Unit
		(NICU). SUBJECTS: Twenty newborns with oral candidosis and an equal number of age
		and weight matched controls. INTERVENTIONS: All cases of oral candidosis were
		treated with local application of 1% Clotrimazole. RESULTS: Oral candidosis was
		documented in 3.2% (20/650) cases in the NICU. Acute pseudomembranous candidosis
		was the most common presentation. The mean age of onset was 10.5 days. Candida
		"albicans was isolated in 50% cases in addition to C. tropicalis, C."
		"paratropicalis, C. krusei, C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis. On univariate"
		"analysis, male sex, birth asphyxia and prolonged antibiotic therapy had a"
		significant correlation with occurence of oral candidosis in neonates. Out of
		"these, birth asphyxia was the only factor significantly associated with oral"
		"candidosis (OR 8.09, 95% CI 1.34-48.8, p = 0.0226) on multivariate analysis."
		CONCLUSIONS: C. albicans was the predominant isolate in this series of oral
		candidosis. Clinical manifestations were evident in the second week of life and
		birth asphyxia was the most important associated perinatal event.

		asphyxia was the only significant factor responsible for oral thrush in newborns
		(odds ratio = 8.09; p = 0.0226). These findings show that the most important
		perinatal event associated with oral thrush in newborns was birth asphyxia.

TI	-	Association of fungal infection and increased mortality in liver transplant
		recipients.
PG	-	426-30
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive fungal infection is associated with increased morbidity and
		mortality following orthotopic liver transplantation (OLTx). Understanding the
		risk factors associated with fungal infection may facilitate identification of
		high-risk patients and guide appropriate initiation of antifungal therapy.
		OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of fungal
		"infections, identify the most common fungal pathogens, and determine the risk"
		factors associated with fungal infections and mortality in OLTx recipients.
		METHODS: Medical records from 96 consecutive OLTx in 90 American veterans (88
		"males, 2 females; mean age 48 years, range 32 to 67) performed from January 1994"
		to December 1997 were retrospectively reviewed for fungal infection in the first
		120 days after transplantation. Infection was defined by positive cultures from
		"either blood, urine (<105 CFU/mL), cerebrospinal or peritoneal fluid, and/or deep"
		tissue specimens. Superficial fungal infection and asymptomatic colonization were
		"excluded from study. All patients received cyclosporine, azathioprine, and"
		prednisone as maintenance immunosuppressive therapy. Fungal prophylaxis consisted
		"of oral clotrimazole (10 mg) troches, five times per day during the study period."
		RESULTS: Thirty-five patients (38%) had documented infection with one or more
		"fungal pathogens, including Candida albicans (25 of 35; 71%), C torulopsis (7 of"
		"35; 20%), C tropicalis (2 of 35; 6%), non-C albicans (2 of 35; 6%), Aspergillus"
		"fumigatus (4 of 35; 11%), and Cryptococcus neoformans (1 of 35; 3%). The crude"
		"survival for cases with or without fungal infection was 68% and 87%, respectively"
		(P <0.0001). The median intensive care unit stay and overall duration of
		hospitalization were significantly longer for patients with fungal infection (P
		<0.01). The mean time interval from transplantation to the development of fungal
		infection was 15 days (range 4 to 77) with a mean survival time from fungal
		infection to death of 21 days (range 3 to 64). Fungal infections occurred
		significantly more often in patients with renal insufficiency (serum creatinine
		">2.5 mg/dL), biliary/vascular complications, and retransplantation. CONCLUSIONS:"
		Fungal infections were associated with increased morbidity and mortality
		"following OLTx, with Candida albicans being the most common pathogen. Treatment"
		strategies involving antifungal prophylaxis for high-risk patients and earlier
		initiation of antifungal therapy in cases of presumed infection are warranted.

		prognosis of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) complicated with
		"candida tropicalis bloodstream infection (CTBI), so as to improve the"
		"understanding of this disease. Methods: The general information, clinical"
		"manifestation, auxiliary examination, treatment and outcome of 14 childhood ALL"
		who were diagnosed with tropical candidemia between January 2015 and December
		2018 in 6 hospitals were analyzed retrospectively. Clinical data of non invasive
		fungal disease (IFD) ALL (28 cases) and other IFD children (9 cases) admitted in
		the same period were collected as control group. Logistic regression model was
		"used to analyze the risk factor of CTBI. Results: Among 14 cases, there were 7"
		"males and 7 females, with the age ranged from 17 months to 13 years. All the"
		"cases had fever, 9 cases had digestive system symptoms and stool fungal culture"
		were positive in 3 of them; 7 cases had respiratory system symptoms and sputum
		fungal culture was positive in 1 of them; 2 cases had central nervous system
		symptoms and 10 cases progressed into septic shock. All 14 cases had neutropenia
		"and the neutropenia duration was 1 to 53 days. Among 14 cases, the C-reactive"
		"protein was>50 mg/L in 8 cases, in which the proportion was significantly higher"
		"than that in other invasive fungal disease(IFD) (8/14 vs. 1/9, P<0.05), meanwhile"
		"the 1, 3-β-D-glucan detection, galactomannan detection and pulmonary imaging were"
		not remarkable in all 14 cases. The blood culture results of 14 cases were all
		"candida tropicalis, among which 13 cases finished drug susceptibility tests, the"
		"isolates of all cases were sensitive to flucytosine and amphotericin B, and the"
		"isolates of 4 cases were sensitive to fluconazole, voriconazole and itraconazole."
		"Among 14 cases, 1 case lost to follow-up after giving up treatment, 1 case died"
		before antifungal therapy and the remaining 12 cases received antifungal therapy;
		7 of the 14 cases died. Univariate analysis showed that between ALL with CTBI
		"group (14 cases) and ALL without invasive fungal disease (IFD) group (28 cases),"
		"the differences in variables such as ALL not in remission (χ²=37.847, P<0.01),"
		"length of hospital stay>15 days (χ(2)=8.351, P=0.004), neutropenia (χ²=14.280,"
		"P<0.01), neutropenia duration>10 days (χ²=10.254, P=0.001), use of broad-spectrum"
		"antibiotics (χ²=13.888, P<0.01), skin and mucous membrane damage (χ²= 5.923,"
		P=0.015) were statistically significant. Conclusions: In childhood ALL
		"complicated with tropical candidemia, the drug resistance rate and mortality rate"
		"were high. For azole-resistant tropical candida, amphotericin B liposome or"
		echinocandins(caspofungin) -fluorocytosine combined therapy was recommended to
		reduce treatment-related deaths.

TI	-	Epidemiology and risk factors for nosocomial Non-Candida albicans candidemia in
		adult patients at a tertiary care hospital in North China.
PG	-	684-90

AB	-	"Nosocomial candidemia extends the length of hospital stay, increases the costs of"
		"medical care, and is associated with a high mortality rate. Epidemiological data"
		that assist in the choice of initial therapy may help to improve the prognosis.
		The present study was undertaken to investigate the epidemiology of nosocomial
		candidemia and identify risk factors for nosocomial candidemia caused by C.
		albicans and non-albicans Candida species (NAC). A retrospective chart review was
		undertaken to analyze cases of nosocomial candidemia treated at the Beijing
		Friendship Hospital between January 2008 and December 2012. All cases of
		candidemia were identified using the previously published criteria. Among 106
		"patients analyzed, 53.8% had nosocomial candidemia caused by NAC. Candida"
		"albicans was the most common causative agent, accounting for 46.2% of all cases,"
		"followed by C. glabrata (25.5%), C. tropicalis (15.1%), C. parapsilosis (10.4%)"
		and C. Krusei (0.9%). Comparison of nosocomial C. albicans and NAC candidemia by
		multivariate logistic regression showed that factors independently associated
		with nosocomial NAC candidemia included exposure to azole agents (odds ratio
		[OR]: 3.359; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.136-10.154; P = .031) and artificial
		surgical implants (OR: 37.519; 95% CI: 2.5-562.998; P = .009). A significant risk
		factor for nosocomial C. albicans candidemia was cancer surgery (OR: 0.075; 95%
		CI: 0.013-0.437; P = .004). Clinical and epidemiological differences in the risk
		factors between nosocomial candidemia caused by C. albicans and NAC should be
		considered when selecting an initial antifungal regimen for the treatment of
		adult patients. This should be undertaken before the availability of species
		identification and/or antifungal susceptibility results.

AB	-	"INTRODUCTION: The incidence of Candida spp. infections is worrisome, particularly"
		in critically ill patients. Previous reports suggested that increasing use of
		antifungal therapy might affect resistance profiles of invasive strains. The
		study objective was to describe the distribution resistance profile of Candida
		"spp. strains, and to correlate it with antifungal consumptions within one ICU."
		METHOD: Antifungal drug consumption was measured as the number of defined daily
		doses per 1000 hospital days. The distribution of Candida spp. over a 10 year
		period 2004-2013 and the MICs of antifungal drugs over 2007-2013 were determined.
		Time series analyses were performed. RESULTS: Of 2403 identified Candida spp.
		"from 5360 patients, Candida albicans predominated (53.1%), followed by Candida"
		"glabrata (16.2%), Candida parapsilosis (7.9%) and Candida tropicalis (7.5%). C."
		parapsilosis increased from 5.7% in 2004 to 8.4% in 2013 (P = 0.02). The increase
		in caspofungin use is correlated with the increase in caspofungin MICs of C.
		"parapsilosis (P = 0.01), C. glabrata (P = 0.001) and C. albicans (P = 0.02)."
		Polyenes consumption correlated with an increase in amphotericin B MICs of C.
		glabrata (P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Previous history of antifungal prescription
		within an ICU influences Candida species distribution and susceptibility profile
		to antifungal agents. The significant selective pressure exerted by caspofungin
		and amphotericin B on C. glabrata is a concern.

AB	-	While performing molecular confirmation of phenotypically identified Candida
		"tropicalis isolates, we re-identified a few isolates as Kodamaea ohmeri. This led"
		us to the present epidemiological investigation of K. ohmeri fungaemia cases. All
		phenotypically identified C. tropicalis blood isolates during October 2008
		through to December 2009 at our advanced paediatric centre were included for
		molecular identification by sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer and
		D1/D2 regions of rDNA. After identifying a large cluster K. ohmeri fungaemia
		"cases, a case-control study was carried out retrospectively to analyse potential"
		risk factors for K. ohmeri fungaemia. Molecular typing of the isolates was
		performed using a fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (FAFLP)
		technique. The antifungal susceptibility testing was performed as per the M27-A3
		protocol of CLSI. Thirty-eight (25.7%) of 148 phenotypically identified
		C. tropicalis isolates were confirmed as K. ohmeri by sequencing and FAFLP. By
		"case-control analysis, piperacillin-tazobactam was significantly associated with"
		the K. ohmeri fungaemia. The FAFLP analysis showed that all K. ohmeri isolates
		had >92% similarity. The azoles and echinocandins had good in vitro activity
		"against K. ohmeri, though 86.8% of the isolates had MIC of 1 mg/L for"
		amphotericin B. The response to antifungal therapy could be evaluated in 27
		patients and 70.4% of patients recovered after antifungal therapy. The present
		study reports the largest cluster of K. ohmeri fungaemia from a single centre.
		The study also stresses the need for accurate identification of clinical yeast
		isolates.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Bloodstream Candida infection is a life-threatening event among ICU
		admitted patients. This infection is caused by a diverse range of Candida species
		having varied minimum inhibitory concentrations. OBJECTIVES: To identify Candida
		species causing bloodstream infections with their antifungal susceptibility
		determination. METHODS: Candida species isolated from the blood of ICU admitted
		patients were identified by phenotypic as well as by molecular methods including
		PCR-RFLP using MspI restriction enzyme and MALDI TOF MS. The minimum inhibitory
		"concentration of fluconazole, voriconazole, amphotericin B and caspofungin was"
		determined against isolated Candida species by CLSI M27A(3) guidelines. RESULTS:
		"A total of 119 Candida species were isolated. Among them, C. tropicalis(n=29) was"
		"the predominant isolate followed by C. parapsilosis(n=18), C. glabrata (n=12), C."
		krusei (n=11) and C. albicans(n=11). Uncommon Candida species isolated were;
		"Wickerhamomyces anomalus(n=15), Kodaemia ohmeri(n=8), C. lusitaniae (n=5) and C."
		auris (n=2). A varied antifungal MIC values were observed. Caspofungin had the
		lowest MIC among the tested antifungals. Increased fluconazole MIC was observed
		against the isolated Candida species including C. tropicalis. All the isolated C.
		lusitaniae and C. auris strains have ≥1mcg/ml amphotericin B MIC. In comparison
		"to fluconazole, voriconazole was more effective when tested in vitro. CONCLUSION:"
		Emergence of uncommon Candida species having varied antifungal MIC warns the
		"physicians to have a prompt, accurate identification with antifungal MIC"
		determination in each case of bloodstream Candida infections.

		molecular typing of causative isolates.
PG	-	745-50
AB	-	A prospective observational study of invasive candidiasis was conducted in the
		neonatal intensive care unit of Aristotle University in Hippokration Hospital
		"between 1994 and 2000. During this period, 59 neonates developed invasive"
		"candidiasis (58 cases of candidemia and 1 case of peritonitis), resulting in an"
		overall incidence of 1.28% that showed a decreasing trend over the study period.
		Eleven (18.6%) cases developed within the first week of life and the others
		within a mean (+/-SEM) of 13.4+/-1.7 days after birth. The three most frequent
		"causative species were Candida albicans (65.5%), Candida parapsilosis (15.5%),"
		and Candida tropicalis (7%). C. albicans was the predominant species between 1994
		"and 1998, whereas, non-albicans Candida spp., particularly C. parapsilosis, were"
		the most frequent species during the period 1999-2000 (P<0.001). While the
		"overall mortality due to candidemia was 29% (17 of 59 cases), mortality"
		"associated with C. albicans and C. parapsilosis was 39.5% and 11.1%, respectively"
		"(P=0.032), and that observed in the 1999-2000 period was 0% (P=0.011). Virtually"
		"all isolates were susceptible to amphotericin B, flucytosine, fluconazole, and"
		"itraconazole, and no increases in minimal inhibitory concentrations were observed"
		during these years. With the exception of a limited cluster of cases due to
		"genotypically identical isolates, no clonal relation of C. albicans isolates was"
		"found. Moreover, no clonal persistence of C. albicans and no decrease in"
		antifungal drug susceptibility occurred over the 6-year study period.
		"Non-albicans Candida spp., mostly C. parapsilosis, have emerged as important"
		"pathogens in neonatal intensive care units, with infected patients having better"
		outcomes as compared to patients infected with C. albicans.

AB	-	"INTRODUCTION: Legionnaires' disease is caused by Legionella bacteria, and"
		commonly manifests as pneumonia and has a high fatality rate. PATIENT CONCERNS:
		"This case study reports on the fatal incident of a patient, initially diagnosed"
		"with pneumonia, and subsequently diagnosed with Legionnaires' disease caused by a"
		new sequence type (ST) of Legionella. DIAGNOSIS: It is speculated that the
		patient acquired Legionnaires' disease from a contaminated water source.
		Legionnaires' disease was diagnosed using the Legionella urinary antigen assay
		and bacterial cultures of respiratory secretions; Legionella pneumophilia Type 1
		was also identified through serological testing. Sequence-based typing of the
		"cultured bacterium revealed it to be a previously unidentified species, and it"
		was named ST2345 new-type. INTERVENTIONS: In addition to the treatment of
		"Legionnaires' disease, blood samples taken on the second day of admission showed"
		"a co-infection of Candida tropicalis, which was treated with anti-fungal"
		"treatment. The patient improved after a week, however, on the seventh day of"
		administration lower respiratory secretions showed the growth of Klebsiella
		"pneumonia, indicative of ventilator-associated pneumonia. OUTCOMES: Despite"
		"active treatment, the patient passed away due to multiple organ failure. As this"
		"was a fatal case, further research is needed to determine whether the critical"
		condition of this case was related to the virulence of the novel Legionella
		strain. CONCLUSION: A key finding of this study is that treatment for suspected
		"Legionnaires' disease must be administered rapidly, as infection with Legionella"
		may give rise to secondary pathogenic infections.

		1992-1994. Fungal Disease Registry of the Canadian Infectious Disease Society.
PG	-	493-9
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candida species are important bloodstream pathogens that are being
		isolated with increasing frequency. Despite the availability of effective
		"antifungal therapy, the mortality rate associated with Candida infection remains"
		"high. With the objective of describing the epidemiology of candidemia, the"
		Canadian Infectious Disease Society conducted a study of candidemia in Canada.
		METHODS: Fourteen medical centres across Canada identified all patients with
		candidemia from March 1992 to February 1994 through blood culture surveillance
		for Candida spp. Patient-related data for invasive fungal infection were compiled
		retrospectively by chart review using a standardized data-recording form
		developed for the Fungal Disease Registry of the Canadian Infectious Disease
		Society. Cases of Candidemia were studied in relation to underlying medical
		"conditions, predisposing factors, concurrent infection, antimicrobial agents,"
		"antifungal treatment and deaths. RESULTS: In total, 415 cases of candidemia were"
		"identified, 48 (11.6%) in children and 367 (88.4%) in adults. The causative"
		"pathogens were C. albicans in 286 cases (68.9%), C. parapsilosis in 43 (10.4%),"
		"C. glabrata in 34 (8.2%), C. tropicalis in 27 (6.5%) and other Candida species in"
		18 (4.3%); polymicrobial candidemia occurred in 7 cases (1.7%). The overall
		"mortality rate was 46%, and the rate of deaths clinically related to candidemia"
		"was 19%. However, only 13 (27%) of the children died. A univariate analysis"
		"indicated that significant risk factors for death were age greater than 60 years,"
		"therapy for concomitant bacterial infection, stay in an intensive care unit,"
		"concurrent malignant disease, cytotoxic chemotherapy and granulocytopenia,"
		although only age and stay in an intensive care unit emerged as significant risk
		factors in the multivariate analysis. After adjustment for other predictors of
		"death, only infection with C. parapsilosis was associated with a lower mortality"
		rate than infection with C. albicans. Treatment was given in 352 (84.8%) of
		cases. Amphotericin B was the preferred agent in 244 cases (69.3% of those
		treated); fluconazole was used in 101 cases (28.7%) and ketoconazole in 5 cases
		(1.4%). INTERPRETATION: Candidemia in Canada is caused predominantly by C.
		"albicans. The mortality rate associated with candidemia is high, but it varies"
		with the species of Candida and is lower in children than in adults. Age greater
		than 60 years and stay in an intensive care unit were the most significant risk
		factors for overall mortality.

TI	-	Distributions and antifungal susceptibility of Candida species from mucosal sites
		in HIV positive patients.
PG	-	282-7
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Mucocutaneous candidiasis (almost endogenous) is one of the most
		common manifestations of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The aim of
		"this study was the investigation of colonization patterns of Candida species,"
		"particularly C. dubliniensis, among mucosal sites of HIV-positive patients and"
		determining corresponding in vitro susceptibility patterns to the antifungals.
		"METHODS: From July 2006 to May 2008, specimens from the mucosal sites of 273"
		seropositive HIV patients were collected for Candida colonization. All isolates
		were identified by standard methods and carbohydrate assimilation patterns.
		Isolates phenotypically identified as C. albicans or C. dubliniensis were
		subjected to molecular identification. Susceptibility patterns of the isolated
		species to seven antifungal agents were determined using the broth microdilution
		method. RESULTS: The 359 samples from mucosal sites which consisted of 273 oral
		and 86 vaginal were collected and evaluated for Candida species distributions and
		their corresponding susceptibility patterns. The most commonly isolated species
		"were: C. albicans (50%) followed by C. glabrata (21.4%), C. dubliniensis (13.3%,"
		"reported for the first time in Iran), C. krusei (9.8%), C. kefyr (3.1%), C."
		"parapsilosis (1.6%), and C. tropicalis (0.8%). All species were sensitive to"
		"amphotencin B, ketoconazole, nystatin, voriconazole, and caspofungin. In some"
		"isolates, resistance to fluconazole and itraconazole was noted. CONCLUSION: As"
		"demonstrated, resistance to fluconazole and itraconazole, the most frequent"
		antifungals in use in the region suggests regular investigation into antifungal
		resistance in medical centers should be undertaken in order to promote the
		effective management of invasive candidiasis in HIV/AIDS patients.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: To describe the clinical profile, risk factors, and outcomes that are"
		associated with candida infection among critically ill children. PATIENTS AND
		METHODS: A retrospective case-control study wherein 109 children admitted to the
		pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) in the years between 2015 and 2017 with the
		"growth of candida from blood, urine, endotracheal (ET) aspirate, and pus swabs"
		were included and compared to 97 age and sex-matched controls chosen from the
		"same time period. RESULTS: Of the 124 candida isolates from 109 children, 37%"
		"were from blood, 24% from urine, and 14% in pus; 40% of the isolates were from ET"
		aspirate. Candida non-albicans types (70%) predominated with Candida tropicalis
		causing 50% of the infections. Risk factors for candida infection were
		"neutropenia [OR 20.01, 95% CI (0.94-422.32)], mechanical ventilation [OR 5.97,"
		"95% CI (2.44-14.62)], peritoneal dialysis [OR 5.81, 95% CI (1.27-26.50)],"
		"institution of amino acids [OR 5.41, 95% CI (0.85-34.13)], presence of central"
		"venous catheter [OR 3.83, 95% CI (1.59-9.19)], antibiotic use >5 days [OR 3.58,"
		95% CI (1.38-9.29)]. Candida Cases (95.4%) had a septic shock with acute kidney
		injury in 34% and had significantly lower survival than controls [72 (66%) of 109
		vs. 74 (80%) of 92] (p = 0.023). CONCLUSIONS: The rate of candida infection in

		pediatric population.
PG	-	664-8
LID	-	10.1097/INF.0b013e318213da0f [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Non-albicans Candida (NAC) species have been implicated as major
		pathogens in patients with hospital-acquired candidemia. Few studies have
		investigated the impact of NAC fungemia among pediatric patients outside of the
		"neonatal age group. MATERIALS/METHODS: Between 2000 and 2009, we performed a"
		retrospective case-control study in children aged 6 months to ≤18 years with
		"blood culture proven candidemia at Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX."
		RESULTS: A total of 276 episodes of candidemia occurred in 226 patients. The
		overall incidence ranged between 0.06 and 0.3 per 1000 inpatient days. The median
		"patient age was 50 months (range, 6 months to ≤18 years) with 55.4% males; 40.2%"
		Hispanics; and 31.8% whites. Candida albicans (CA) was the most common (44.2%)
		"species although, collectively, NAC was more frequently (55.8%) isolated. Among"
		"the NAC group, Candida parapsilosis was most common (23.9%) followed by Candida"
		"tropicalis (14.8%), Candida glabrata (6.5%), and Candida lusitaniae (5.4%). No"
		"difference was found between CA and NAC candidemia in terms of demographics,"
		"underlying diagnosis, risk factors, clinical features, dissemination, or 30-day"
		mortality. Disseminated candidiasis was independently associated with the use of
		"vasopressors (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 4.58; confidence interval [CI]:"
		"1.03-20.5; P = 0.05), prolonged fungemia (≥3 days of persistently positive"
		"cultures) after catheter removal (OR, 3.2; CI: 1.08-9.3; P = 0.04), and"
		"neutropenia (OR, 4.06; CI: 1.2-13.2; P = 0.02), but not with NAC fungemia."
		"CONCLUSIONS: Though CA was the single most common species, NAC species"
		collectively have emerged as the predominant pathogens responsible for candidemia
		"in non-neonatal patients at our institution. Risk factors, clinical features, and"
		outcomes were not different between the 2 groups.

		lesions.
PG	-	550-5
AB	-	BACKGROUND: A diagnosis of systemic candidiasis is often delayed or missed owing
		"to the absence of sensitive, specific, and timely diagnostic tools. Skin lesions"
		"are not common, but they can help to rapidly establish a diagnosis. We report on"
		a 14-year experience of systemic candidiasis with skin lesions in our
		"institution. We report the prevalence, clinical findings, histologic findings,"
		"etiologic Candida species, underlying conditions, treatment modalities, and"
		outcomes of the cases and compare them with the previous reports. METHODS: We
		reviewed the medical records and laboratory data of patients diagnosed with
		"systemic candidiasis from June 1989 to September 2002 at Asan Medical Center,"
		"Seoul, Korea. We thoroughly reviewed the data on those patients with"
		characteristic skin lesions. We included the cases in which Candida organisms
		were either shown or cultured from the skin. We also included the patients who
		had developed the characteristic rash at the onset of infection if there was no
		other possible explanation for the rash. RESULTS: Of 53 documented systemic
		"candidiasis cases, 19 (35.8%) had the characteristic skin lesions. Fifteen"
		patients (78.9%) had hematologic problems and were neutropenic. The skin lesions
		were a maculopapular or nodular rash and plaques. In addition to the trunk and
		"proximal extremities, the rash also involved the face and distal extremities. The"
		"rashes were mostly purpuric, not consistently associated with underlying"
		thrombocytopenia but also associated with underlying vascular damage as a result
		of Candida organisms. The underlying vascular damage also caused intraepidermal
		necrotic and vesicular change. One case of transepidermal elimination of
		organisms was newly found. The most common causative species was Candida
		"tropicalis in the 19 patients with skin lesions, in contrast with Candida"
		albicans in a total of 53 patients. The mortality rate was 84.2%. CONCLUSIONS:
		The prevalence of systemic candidiasis-associated skin lesions may be higher than
		previously reported. Dermatologists should be familiar with the clinical
		appearance of skin lesions and suspect this fatal infection when seeing
		neutropenic patients with a resistant fever and accompanying rash.

TI	-	Risk factors for disseminated candidiasis in children with candidemia.
PG	-	635-41
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk factors for disseminated infection in
		hospitalized children with candidemia. METHODS: We performed a nested
		case-control study within a cohort of hospitalized children with candidemia. The
		cohort was defined by all patients with positive blood cultures for Candida
		"species in a large, urban, academic, tertiary care children's hospital from 1998"
		"to 2001. Cases were patients with clinical, microbiologic or radiographic"
		evidence of disseminated candidiasis. Controls were patients with no evidence of
		"disseminated candidiasis. RESULTS: Among 168 total children with candidemia, the"
		"median age was 3.5 years (interquartile range, 0.6-14.3). There were 189 episodes"
		"of candidemia. Candida species included:Candida albicans (41%), Candida"
		"parapsilosis (24%), Candida glabrata (13%) and Candida tropicalis (9%). The most"
		"common underlying diagnoses were oncologic (24%), gastrointestinal (15%) and"
		cardiac (10%) diseases. Eighty-nine patients (53%) were admitted to an intensive
		"care unit, 46 (27%) to a general pediatric or surgical ward and 33 (20%) to the"
		"oncology ward. Of the 168 patients with candidemia, 153 were included in the"
		"analysis of risk factors for disseminated candidiasis. Of 153 (17%) patients, 26"
		had evidence of organ dissemination. Organ involvement was most commonly
		"identified in the lung (58%), followed by the liver (23%), kidney (16%), brain"
		"(12%), spleen (8%), eye (8%) and heart (8%). Eight of the 26 patients had"
		evidence of dissemination to more than 1 organ. Independent risk factors for
		disseminated candidiasis were persistently positive blood cultures for Candida
		"(>3 days) with a central venous catheter in place (odds ratio, 3.0; 95%"
		"confidence interval, 1.2, 7.8; P = 0.02) and immunosuppression (odds ratio, 2.9;"
		"95% confidence interval, 1.2, 7.0; P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged duration of"
		candidemia with a central venous catheter in place and immunosuppression were
		independent risk factors for disseminated candidiasis in children with
		candidemia. Furthermore review of the epidemiology of candidemia at our
		institution revealed a heterogeneous population of children at risk for
		candidemia and a predominance of non-albicans species as the cause of these
		infections. Future studies are needed to determine the extent of evaluation
		needed for detecting dissemination among children with candidemia and to explore
		interventions for its prevention.

AB	-	"OBJECTIVE: To describe the evolving epidemiology, management, and risk factors"
		for death of invasive Candida infections in intensive care units (ICUs). DESIGN:
		"Prospective, observational, national, multicenter study. SETTING: One hundred"
		"eighty ICUs in France. PATIENTS: Between October 2005 and May 2006, 300 adult"
		patients with proven invasive Candida infection who received systemic antifungal
		therapy were included. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: One
		"hundred seven patients (39.5%) with isolated candidemia, 87 (32.1%) with invasive"
		"candidiasis without documented candidemia, and 77 (28.4%) with invasive"
		"candidiasis and candidemia were eligible. In 37% of the cases, candidemia"
		occurred within the first 5 days after ICU admission. C. albicans accounted for
		"57.0% of the isolates, followed by C. glabrata (16.7%), C. parapsilosis (7.5%),"
		"C. krusei (5.2%), and C. tropicalis (4.9%). In 17.1% of the isolates, the"
		causative Candida was less susceptible or resistant to fluconazole. Fluconazole
		"was the empirical treatment most commonly introduced (65.7%), followed by"
		"caspofungin (18.1%), voriconazole (5.5%), and amphotericin B (3.7%). After"
		"identification of the causative species and susceptibility testing results,"
		treatment was modified in 86 patients (31.7%). The case fatality ratio in ICU was
		45.9% and did not differ significantly according to the type of episode.
		Multivariate analysis showed that factors independently associated with death in
		ICU were type 1 diabetes mellitus (odds ratio [OR] 4.51; 95% confidence interval
		"[CI] 1.72-11.79; p = 0.002), immunosuppression (OR 2.63; 95% CI 1.35-5.11; p ="
		"0.0045), mechanical ventilation (OR 2.54; 95% CI 1.33-4.82; p = 0.0045), and body"
		"temperature >38.2 degrees C (reference, 36.5-38.2 degrees C; OR 0.36; 95% CI"
		0.17-0.77; p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: More than two thirds of patients with
		invasive candidiasis in ICU present with candidemia. Non-albicans Candida species
		reach almost half of the Candida isolates. Reduced susceptibility to fluconazole
		is observed in 17.1% of Candida isolates. Mortality of invasive candidiasis in
		ICU remains high.

AB	-	PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence of Candida auris candidaemia in our ICU
		patients and its molecular epidemiology. METHODS: A prospective observational
		study was conducted on candidaemia in our ICU patients over 18 months during
		"2016-2017. Demographics, underlying disease, risk factors, antifungal therapy and"
		outcome were studied. Risk factors of C. auris and non-auris candidaemia were
		"compared. RESULTS: During the study period, among 108 candidaemia cases recorded,"
		"the incidence was 6.75/1000 ICU bed days. C. auris topped the list (n = 42,"
		"39.9%), followed by C. tropicalis (34.3%), and C. parapsilosis (15.7%). On"
		"bivariate analysis prior antibiotic therapy, long central line days, mechanical"
		ventilation and length of ICU stay were significant risk factors for C. auris
		candidaemia compared to non-auris candidaemia. Multivariate analysis showed
		underlying respiratory and neurological diseases as significantly associated with
		"risk of C. auris candidaemia. Fluconazole, amphotericin B, and caspofungin"
		"resistance were noted in 97.0%, 93.7% and 3% of C. auris isolates respectively."
		"CONCLUSION: Longer duration of central line days, prior antibiotic use,"
		mechanical ventilation and prolonged ICU stay were important risk factors
		associated with C. auris candidaemia along with underlying respiratory or
		"neurological disease. The isolates are non-clonal in origin, but they belong to a"
		single clade.

PG	-	1672-8
AB	-	"STUDY OBJECTIVES: To analyze the clinical spectra, pathogenesis, treatment,"
		"outcome, and prognostic factors of fungal empyema thoracis. DESIGN: The medical"
		records of patients with positive fungal cultures from pleural effusions were
		retrospectively analyzed. SETTING: A university-based tertiary care hospital in
		"Taipei, Taiwan. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 1990 through December 1997,"
		patients diagnosed with fungal empyema were included in this study. The criteria
		for diagnosis of fungal empyema thoracis were as follows: (1) isolation of a
		"fungal species from the pleural effusion; (2) significant signs of infection,"
		such as fever (body temperature > 38.3 degrees C) and leukocytosis (white blood
		"cell > 10,000/microL); and (3) isolation of the same mold species from pleural"
		"effusion on more than one occasion, or from pleural effusion and other specimens"
		"such as blood, sputum, or surgical wounds that showed evidence of tissue"
		invasion. RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients with fungal empyema thoracis were
		"included. Their mean age was 54 years (range, 2 weeks to 93 years), and 64% (43"
		"patients) were men. Fifty-seven patients (85%) had various underlying diseases,"
		and 18 (27%) had more than one immunocompromising condition. A total of 73 fungal
		isolates were recovered from pleural effusion; the most commonly encountered were
		"Candida species (47 isolates, 64%), Torulopsis glabrata (13 isolates, 18%), and"
		"Aspergillus species (9 isolates, 12%). Candida albicans (28 isolates) was the"
		"most common Candida species, followed by Candida tropicalis (13 isolates). Six"
		"patients (9%) had two fungal strains isolated, and 16 (24%) had concomitant"
		bacterial empyema thoracis. Eighteen patients (27%) had concurrent fungemia. Most
		"(56 patients, 84%) cases of fungal empyema thoracis were nosocomial, and many"
		"case (43 patients, 64%) were acquired in ICUs. Abdominal disease (20 patients,"
		"30%), especially previous abdominal surgery and GI perforation (12% and 10%,"
		"respectively), was the most common cause of fungal empyema thoracis, followed by"
		"bronchopulmonary infection (15 patients, 22%) and chest surgery (12 patients,"
		"18%). Forty-nine patients (73%) received systemic antifungal therapy, and 38"
		(57%) underwent closed drainage therapy. Eleven patients (16%) underwent pleural
		"irrigation with normal saline solution, povidone-iodine solution, or antifungal"
		agents. Six patients (9%) finally received decortication. All patients receiving
		surgery or pleural irrigation with antifungal agents survived. Despite the
		"aforementioned management, the crude mortality was high (73%). Multivariate"
		analysis showed a significantly increased risk of death in immunocompromised
		"patients (relative risk, 1.58; p < 0.005) and those with respiratory failure"
		"(relative risk, 2.31; p < 0.001). Systemic antifungal therapy was associated with"
		"a significantly lower risk of death (relative risk, 0.69; p < 0.05). CONCLUSION:"
		These data imply an increasing incidence of fungal empyema thoracis in recent
		years and the necessity for aggressive treatment of patients with this disease.

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: We aimed to describe the epidemiology of Candida bloodstream
		infection in an intensive care unit (ICU) in Reunion Island. METHODS: We
		"performed a retrospective cohort study and evaluated 63 candidemia episodes,"
		which occurred between January 2004 and December 2015 in the ICU of a University
		Hospital in St-Pierre. RESULTS: The incidence rate of candidemia in the ICU was
		estimated at 7.6%. Candida albicans was the most common yeast pathogen species
		"recovered (54%), followed by Candida glabrata (17%), Candida tropicalis (12%) and"
		"Candida parapsilosis (10%). Between 2012 and 2015, we also observed a"
		modification of antifungal use. CONCLUSION: The epidemiology of candidemia in
		Reunion Island is characterized by the predominance of Candida albicans and by
		the relative importance of Candida tropicalis. This pattern corresponds to a
		model of epidemiological transition between the one usually observed in tropical
		areas and the one observed in temperate countries.

TI	-	Epidemiology of candidemia in Brazil: a nationwide sentinel surveillance of
		candidemia in eleven medical centers.
PG	-	2816-23
AB	-	Candidemia studies have documented geographic differences in rates and
		"epidemiology, underscoring the need for surveillance to monitor trends. We"
		"conducted prospective candidemia surveillance in Brazil to assess the incidence,"
		"species distribution, frequency of antifungal resistance, and risk factors for"
		fluconazole-resistant Candida species. Prospective laboratory-based surveillance
		was conducted from March 2003 to December 2004 in 11 medical centers located in 9
		major Brazilian cities. A case of candidemia was defined as the isolation of
		"Candida spp. from a blood culture. Incidence rates were calculated per 1,000"
		"admissions and 1,000 patient-days. Antifungal susceptibility tests were performed"
		"by using the broth microdilution assay, according to the Clinical and Laboratory"
		"Standards Institute guidelines. We detected 712 cases, for an overall incidence"
		"of 2.49 cases per 1,000 admissions and 0.37 cases per 1,000 patient-days. The"
		"30-day crude mortality was 54%. C. albicans was the most common species (40.9%),"
		"followed by C. tropicalis (20.9%) and C. parapsilosis (20.5%). Overall, decreased"
		"susceptibility to fluconazole occurred in 33 (5%) of incident isolates, 6 (1%) of"
		which were resistant. There was a linear correlation between fluconazole and
		voriconazole MICs (r = 0.54 and P < 0.001 [Spearman's rho]). This is the largest
		multicenter candidemia study conducted in Latin America and shows the substantial
		"morbidity and mortality of candidemia in Brazil. Antifungal resistance was rare,"
		but correlation between fluconazole and voriconazole MICs suggests
		cross-resistance may occur.

LID	-	10.1111/myc.12470 [doi]
AB	-	Candidemia remains a major cause of disease worldwide and is associated with a
		high mortality rate. We conducted a retrospective study of candidemia at Nantes
		"Hospital, France, between 2004 and 2010. A total of 191 episodes (n = 188"
		"patients) were reviewed. Incidence, demographics, risk factors, antifungal"
		"management, species identification, in vitro susceptibility and 12 weeks survival"
		were analysed. Global incidence of candidemia was 0.37‰ admissions. Higher
		incidences were observed in haematology (6.65‰) and intensive care units (2‰).
		Central venous catheter and antibiotic exposure were the most frequent risk
		factors (77% and 76% respectively). Candida albicans was the predominant species
		"(51.8%) followed by C. parapsilosis (14.5%), C. glabrata (9.8%), C. tropicalis"
		"(9.8%) and C. krusei (4.1%). However, species distribution differed significantly"
		between medical units with frequency of C. tropicalis being higher in haematology
		compared to other medical units. Fluconazole and caspofungin were the main
		"antifungals given as first-line therapy. Although not significant, 12 weeks"
		"mortality rate was 30.9%, being higher for C. tropicalis (44.4%) than for C."
		parapsilosis (16%). Acquired azole or echinocandin resistance was noted in some
		"isolates, underlining the need for systematic antifungal susceptibility testing"
		in patients with candidemia. These epidemiological findings will be of interest
		for antifungal stewardship at our hospital.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: This retrospective study investigated clinical manifestations of
		candidemia caused by uncommon Candida species and antifungal susceptibility of
		the isolates in a regional hospital in Taiwan. METHODS: The uncommon Candida
		"species was initially defined as Candida species other than C. albicans, C."
		"tropicalis, C. glabrata complex, C. parapsilosis complex and C. krusei. All"
		uncommon Candida isolates were identified and confirmed by molecular methods.
		In vitro susceptibility testing of the uncommon Candida species to nine
		antifungal agents was conducted using the broth microdilution method with the
		"Sensititre YeastOne (SYO) system (Trek Diagnostic Systems, Ltd., East Grimstead,"
		"UK). RESULTS: Twenty-one patients, comprising 11 males and 10 females with a"
		"median age of 69 years, were recruited. Cancer (n = 11) was the most common"
		"underlying disease, 19 (90.5%) cases had prior antibiotic exposure, and only two"
		patients had prior antifungal use. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was
		"38.1% (n = 8). C. guilliermondii (n = 11) was the most common pathogen, followed"
		by C. curvata (n = 3). C. guilliermondii isolates exhibited relatively high rates
		of azole minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) above epidemiological cut-off
		"values (ECVs), whereas C. pelliculosa and C. lusitaniae isolates all remained"
		susceptible to azoles. All three C. curvata isolates had high caspofungin
		(>8 mg/L) and fluconazole MICs (8 mg/L) and could be defined as
		multidrug-resistant. CONCLUSIONS: Uncommon Candida species frequently exhibit
		high rates of non-susceptibility to antifungals. Identification of all Candida
		isolates at the species level from blood samples is of value for treatment.

TI	-	Global distribution and outcomes for Candida species causing invasive
		candidiasis: results from an international randomized double-blind study of
		caspofungin versus amphotericin B for the treatment of invasive candidiasis.
PG	-	470-4
AB	-	"In a randomized study, caspofungin was compared with amphotericin B for the"
		treatment of invasive candidiasis in a total of 239 adults from 56 sites in 20
		countries. This study provided a unique opportunity to assess the frequency and
		"outcome of invasive candidiasis caused by different Candida species worldwide,"
		and the results are presented here. Efficacy was primarily assessed at the end of
		intravenous therapy using a modified intent-to-treat (MITT) analysis. This
		analysis was performed on 224 of the 239 patients enrolled in the study. Attempts
		were made to collect baseline Candida isolates from all patients for species
		identification at a central laboratory. Yeasts were identified to the species
		level using two commercial systems and microscopic examination. Viable baseline
		isolates were recovered from 210 of the 224 (94%) patients included in the MITT
		analysis. Candida albicans was the most frequently isolated species in all
		"regions and was responsible for 45% of cases overall. Nevertheless, the majority"
		of cases of infection were caused by non- albicans Candida species. In the USA
		"and Canada, Candida glabrata was the second most commonly isolated pathogen"
		"(18%). In contrast, Candida parapsilosis and Candida tropicalis accounted for 55%"
		of cases in Latin America. Outcomes were comparable for patients treated with
		caspofungin (74% overall; 64% and 80% for infections due to Candida albicans and
		non- albicans species) and amphotericin B (62% overall; 58% and 68% for
		"infections due to Candida albicans and non- albicans species), and were generally"
		similar across continents. The distribution of Candida species isolated from
		patients enrolled in a clinical trial may not be representative of pathogens
		"causing invasive candidiasis in the general population. Nevertheless, our"
		findings may affect the regional choice of empirical antifungal therapy for
		seriously ill patients with suspected or documented invasive candidiasis since
		different Candida species have varying susceptibility to conventional antifungal
		drugs.

AB	-	Candida infection is seen in patients with weak or disrupted host responses.
		Cutaneous candidiasis typically affects the intertriginous areas and presents
		with a red plaque surrounded by satellite lesions. Diagnosis of cutaneous
		candidiasis is made by visual inspection followed by potassium hydroxide normal
		saline microscopic preparation (wet mount) and polymerase chain reaction
		identification or culture of fungal organism. The following case describes a
		38-year-old patient with limited mobility who presented with a peri sacral lesion
		"that was first assumed to be a decubitus ulcer by nursing facility staff, but"
		"proved to be a cutaneous infection by Candida tropicalis, a less common Candida"
		species. The unusual location as well as the characteristic C. tropicalis micro-
		and macroscopic appearance are described which ultimately led to the diagnosis of
		a cutaneous fungal infection in an otherwise immunocompetent individual that was
		resolved with fluconazole therapy. Our case report emphasizes the need for early
		diagnosis of cutaneous lesions in patients with limited mobility in consideration
		that not all Candida species thrive in similar environments and can present in
		"unusual locations of the human body. Although rare, C. tropicalis could be found"
		in this vulnerable population.

AB	-	This study aimed to describe the effect of initial antifungal therapy on patient
		mortality and to detail the current distribution and resistance patterns of
		Candida spp. among patients with candidaemia. A prospective observational study
		was performed among consecutive patients with candidaemia from 10 Turkish medical
		centres between January 2015 and November 2018. The primary outcome was 10-day
		mortality. Species were identified using MALDI-TOF/MS. A total of 342 patients
		"with candidaemia were included, of which 175 (51.2%) were male and 68 (19.9%)"
		"were aged <18 years. The most common species were Candida albicans (47.4%),"
		"Candida parapsilosis (26.6%), Candida tropicalis (9.6%) and Candida glabrata"
		"(7.6%). Among all Candida spp., the 10-day case fatality rate (CFR) was 32.2%."
		The CFR was highest in patients with C. albicans (57.3%) and lowest in patients
		with C. parapsilosis (21.8%). The resistance rate to fluconazole was 13% in C.
		"parapsilosis, with no significant effect on mortality. No resistance to"
		"echinocandins was detected. In the multivariate analysis, being in the ICU"
		"[OR = 2.1 (95% CI 1.32-3.57); P = 0.002], renal failure [OR = 2.4 (1.41-3.97);"
		"P = 0.001], total parenteral nutrition [OR = 2 (1.22-3.47); P = 0.006], C."
		albicans infection [OR = 1.7 (1.06-2.82); P = 0.027] and echinocandin as primary
		agent [OR = 0.6 (0.36-0.99); P = 0.047] were significantly associated with
		"mortality. Candidaemia is a deadly infection. Fluconazole resistance is emerging,"
		although it was not significantly related to mortality. Using an echinocandin as
		the primary agent could be life-saving.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Prediction rules for invasive Candida infection (ICI) are available
		for adult but not for infants and children managed in pediatric intensive care
		units (PICU). METHODS: Observational study in 24 PICU with prospective phase (all
		children admitted during 1 year) and retrospective review of ICI records. Four
		"logistic regression models were performed using ICI by Candida spp., Candida"
		"albicans, Candida parapsilosis or Candida tropicalis as dependent variables."
		Scores were constructed. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty five ICI (47 C.
		"albicans, 37 C. parapsilosis, 19 C. tropicalis and 22 others) and 1022 controls"
		"were included. Incidence (cases/100 PICU admissions): 4.22 (all Candida), 2.44"
		"(C. albicans), 1.41 (C. parapsilosis), 0.19 (C. tropicalis). ICI was associated"
		"[Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) = 0.764, 95%"

		"≥ 15 days [odds ratio (OR) = 3.3; score: +3], fever (OR = 2.6; +2), thrombopenia"
		"(OR = 2.0; +1) and parenteral nutrition (OR=2.4; +2). Additionally, the following"
		"associations were noted: C. albicans ICI (AUC = 0.716, 95% CI = 0.640-0.792, P <"
		"0.001) with chronic metabolic disease (OR = 10.7; score:+4), surgical digestive"
		"process (OR = 2.8; +1), fever (OR = 2.8; +1) and parenteral nutrition (OR = 2.3;"
		"+1); C. parapsilosis ICI (AUC = 0.808, 95% CI = 0.739-0.877, P < 0.001) with"
		"previous colonization (OR = 7.1; score:+3), tracheostomy (OR = 5.1; +2),"
		"parenteral nutrition (OR = 4.3; +2), thrombopenia (OR = 3.6; +1) and previous"
		"bacterial infection (OR = 3.0; +1) and ICI by C. tropicalis (AUC = 0.941, 95%"

		"(OR = 7.2; +1), pre-PICU hospitalization ≥ 15 days (OR = 17.2; +3) and"
		hematologic (OR = 22.4; +4) and cardiovascular infectious processes (OR = 5.5;
		"+1). Specificity was >90% for cut offs of 5 (all Candida), 3 (C. albicans), 3 (C."
		"parapsilosis) and 11 (C. tropicalis). CONCLUSIONS: Once validated, these scores"
		may help for identification of ICI by specific species allowing adequate

AB	-	BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the epidemiology of oral
		yeast colonization and infection amongst cancer patients. METHODS: Patients with
		"solid tumor, head-neck cancer or hematological malignancy were recruited into the"
		"study. Demographic data on age, gender, type of cancer, preceding treatment with"
		"antibiotics, anti-fungal agents, chemotherapy, radiation or surgery and presence"
		of dentures were recorded on admission. Oral examination and microbial swabs were
		"obtained and yeast culture, identification and antifungal susceptibility"
		performed. RESULTS: Oral yeast colonization was prevalent in 56.8% (227/400) of
		all cancer patients and 18.9% (43/227) of those had clinical and microbiological
		evidence of infection. The incidence of oral candidiasis in yeast colonized
		patients was highest in head neck cancer (29.2%) followed by hematological
		malignancies (20.5%) and solid tumor (17%) patients. Age and dentures were
		identified as independent risk factors associated with yeast carriage. Candida
		albicans was the dominant (74%) species (497.5 per 1000 cancer admissions)
		"followed by C. glabrata (11.5%), C. tropicalis (2.6%), C. krusei (2.6%) and C."
		parapsilosis (1.9%). The overall resistance to azoles was 28.2% (75/266).
		"Resistance to specific drugs was seen for fluconazole (4.5%), itraconazole"
		"(11.7%), ketoconazole (11.3%), voriconazole (0.75%) and caspofungin (41.1%) but"
		none to amphotericin B or nystatin. CONCLUSIONS: The highest incidence of oral
		candidiasis amongst cancer patients was seen in head neck cancers. The majority
		of infections were caused by C. albicans but almost one third of patients
		harbored non-C. albicans strains such as C. glabrata which were often more
		resistant to anti-fungal agents.

PG	-	8828289

LID	-	8828289
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Fungemia due to obstructive urinary tract fungal ball is exceedingly
		"rare. These patients often have multiple predisposing conditions, including"
		diabetes or antimicrobial exposure. While candiduria can be relatively common in
		"this population, urinary tract fungal balls are a rare entity. Hospitalists"
		should be aware of this rare complication in patients presenting with funguria.
		"Case Presentation. We present a case of a 44-year-old male with type II diabetes,"
		"chronic hepatitis C secondary to injection drug use, and chronic kidney disease"
		who developed a urinary tract fungal ball leading to fungemia and subsequent
		"bilateral chorioretinitis, additionally complicated by emphysematous cystitis and"
		pyelonephritis. Additional invasive treatment options beyond typical antifungals
		"are often required in the case of urinary tract fungal ball, and in this case,"
		bilateral nephrostomy tubes and micafungin were employed. Hospital course was
		complicated by C. tropicalis fungemia with subsequent bilateral fungal
		chorioretinitis on dilated fundus exam. This was effectively treated with
		cyclogyl and prednisolone drops along with bilateral voriconazole injections.
		"Follow-up imaging and cultures showed resolution of fungemia, urinary tract"
		"masses, and chorioretinal infiltrates; however, recurrent polymicrobial UTIs"
		continue to be an issue for this patient. CONCLUSIONS: Special multidisciplinary
		management is required in the treatment of urinary tract fungal balls with
		"subsequent fungemia, including nephrostomy tubes, antifungal irrigation,"
		"ureterorenoscopy, and more powerful antifungals such as amphotericin B and"
		"5-flucytosine. This management draws from a myriad of specialties, including"
		"urology, infectious disease, and interventional radiology. Additionally, the"
		literature has demonstrated that only approximately half of patients with
		fungemia receive an ophthalmologic evaluation. Ophthalmologic and urologic
		cooperation is essential in the case of obstructive uropathy leading to fungemia
		as the obstructive uropathy must be relieved and these patients should receive a
		dilated fundus exam.

TI	-	Epidemiology and outcome of Candida bloodstream infection in an intensive care
		unit in Hong Kong.
PG	-	255-61
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To study the epidemiology of Candida bloodstream infection in the
		"Intensive Care Unit. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: A 22-bed, mixed"
		medical and surgical Intensive Care Unit of a 1400-bed university teaching
		hospital in Hong Kong. PATIENTS: All adult patients (>18 years) who had at least
		one blood culture positive for Candida. RESULTS: During the 9 years of the study
		"period, there were 128 patients with episodes of candidaemia (point prevalence,"
		"9.6 per 1000 Intensive Care Unit admissions), 72 entailed albicans candidaemia"
		"and 56 non-albicans candidaemia. Albicans was still the predominant species, but"
		the incidence of tropicalis was increasing. The median lengths of hospital and
		Intensive Care Unit stays prior to taking of the culture revealing candidaemia
		"were 15 and 6 days, respectively. In all, 61% of patients did not have Candida"
		colonisation within 2 weeks of their candidaemia. The main anti-fungal agents
		"used were fluconazole and amphotericin B, but only 89 (70%) of the patients"
		received appropriate anti-fungal treatment. Intensive Care Unit and hospital
		"mortalities were 70% and 78%, respectively. Patients who did not receive"
		appropriate treatment within 3 days had a worse outcome than those who did.
		CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed a high point prevalence of candidaemia in the
		Intensive Care Unit. Albicans was still the predominant species. Candidaemia
		"occurred early during Intensive Care Unit stay, and a significant proportion of"
		patients did not have prior fungal colonisation. Candidaemia in the Intensive
		Care Unit was associated with high morbidity and mortality. Many patients did not
		"receive appropriately early anti-fungal therapy, and endured higher mortality"
		than in the remainder.

		review.
PG	-	523-30
AB	-	Candida species uncommonly cause vertebral osteomyelitis. We present a case of
		lumbar vertebral osteomyelitis caused by Candida albicans and review 59 cases of
		candidal vertebral osteomyelitis reported in the literature. The mean age was 50
		"years, and the lower thoracic or lumbar spine was involved in 95% of patients."
		"Eighty-three percent of patients had back pain for >1 month, 32% presented with"
		"fever, and 19% had neurological deficits. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was"
		"elevated in 87% of patients, and blood culture yielded Candida species for 51%."
		"C. albicans was responsible for 62% of cases, Candida tropicalis for 19%, and"
		Candida glabrata for 14%. Risk factors for candidal vertebral osteomyelitis were
		"the presence of a central venous catheter, antibiotic use, immunosuppression, and"
		"injection drug use. Medical and surgical therapies were both used, and"
		"amphotericin B was the primary antifungal agent. Prognosis was good, with an"
		overall clinical cure rate of 85%.

		Patient.
PG	-	559-564
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-018-0244-y [doi]
AB	-	We report a fatal case of Candida auris that was involved in mixed candidemia
		"with Candida tropicalis, isolated from the blood of a neutropenic patient."
		Identification of both isolates was confirmed by amplification and sequencing of
		internal transcribed spacer and D1/D2 domain of large subunit in rRNA gene.
		Antifungal susceptibility test by E-test method revealed that C. auris was
		"resistant to amphotericin B, anidulafungin, caspofungin, fluconazole,"
		"itraconazole and voriconazole. On the other hand, C. tropicalis was sensitive to"
		all antifungal tested. The use of chromogenic agar as isolation media is vital in
		detecting mixed candidemia.

		cancer.
PG	-	225-9
AB	-	Candidemia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in cancer patients.
		The incidence of candidemia has been reported to have shifted toward nonalbicans
		species. The aim of this study was to determine the distribution of Candida
		species resulting in bloodstream infections or catheter-related blood stream
		infections (CRBSIs) in pediatric hematology-oncology (PHO) patients over a
		7-year-period. Medical and computerized microbiology laboratory records of all
		positive blood fungal cultures during the study period were analyzed
		retrospectively. The ratio of non-albicans Candida species (81.4%) was nearly
		"four times higher than that of C. albicans candidemia (18.5%). Overall, C."
		"parapsilosis caused the majority (61.4%) of candidemia episodes, followed by C."
		"tropicalis (14.8%), C. famata (2.9%), C. ciferrii (1.4%) and C. glabrata (0.7%)."
		The rate of CRBSIs was significantly higher in C. Parapsilosis candidemia. The
		overall rate of 30-day mortality in 135 candidemia episodes was 4.44%. Nearly
		"half of the C. parapsilosis candidemia was associated with CRBSIs, suggesting its"
		"importance in PHO, in which several types of central venous catheters have been"
		used.

AB	-	The epidemiology of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) after liver transplantation
		(LT) is continuing to evolve in the current era of antifungal prophylactic
		therapy. This multicenter retrospective cohort study aimed to evaluate the
		"epidemiology, risk factors, and outcomes of IFIs among LT recipients in the"
		current era.We analyzed a total of 482 LT recipients aged 18 years and older who
		were admitted to 3 tertiary hospitals in Korea between January 2009 and February
		2012.Twenty-four episodes of IFIs occurred in 23 patients (4.77%; 23/482). Of
		"these episodes, 20 were proven cases and 4 were probable cases according to"
		"EORTC/MSG criteria. Among these cases, IFI developed within 30 days of"
		"transplantation in 47.8% of recipients, from 31 to 180 days in 34.8% of"
		"recipients, and from 181 to 365 days in 17.4% of recipients. The most common"
		"isolates were Candida species (n = 12, 52.2%; Candida albicans, 6 cases; Candida"
		"tropicalis, 1 case; Candida glabrata, 1 case; Candida parapsilosis, 1 case; and"
		"unspecified Candida species, 1 case) and Aspergillus species (n = 7, 30.4%). The"
		mortality in patients with IFIs was significantly higher than that in patients
		"without IFIs (47.83% [11/23] vs 7.18% [33/459], P < .001). The incidence of"
		"late-onset IFIs is increasing in the antifungal prophylactic era, and"
		fluconazole-resistant non-albicans Candida species have not yet emerged in Korea.

AB	-	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: We undertook the present study to ascertain the
		contributing risk factors and explore the epidemiological and mycological
		characteristics of opportunistic candidemia among patients with hematological
		malignancies. DESIGN AND SETTINGS: Observational cross-sectional study in a
		tertiary care center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients with
		hematological malignancies reporting to the collaborating medical and pediatric
		units with a febrile episode were recruited and screened for candidemia by blood
		culture. Recovered Candida isolates were speciated and antifungal susceptibility
		testing was performed as per Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute
		guideline (CLSI) guidelines M44-A. Further analysis was done for potential risk
		factors and compared between culture positive and negative patients. RESULTS: Of
		"150 patients recruited, the majority (n=27) were between 51 and 60 years and the"
		male to female ratio was 1.63:1. Fifteen patients (10%) were culture positive.
		The culture positivity was significantly higher in acute lymphocytic leukemia
		(ALL) than in non-ALL patients (p=0.03). There was significant association of
		"candidaemia with leucopenia, chemotherapeutic drugs, corticosteroids and presence"
		of indwelling devices. Duration of disease (p=0.032) and duration of
		hospitalization (p=0.003) were significantly prolonged in culture positive
		"patients. C. tropicalis was the commonest isolate (46.67%), with non- Candida"
		albicans outnumbering C. albicans in all categories of hematological malignancies
		"(2.75:1). All isolates of C. albicans were uniformly sensitive to all the azoles,"
		but only 50% were sensitive to amphotericin B and none to nystatin and
		flucytosine. CONCLUSIONS: This observational study identifies ALL and chronic
		lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) as the forms of hematological malignancy predominantly
		associated with candidemia; specifies risk factors and chemotherapeutic agents
		predisposing patients towards its occurrence; reports a preponderance of C.
		tropicalis among the causative agents and finds voriconazole to be the most
		effective antifungal agent against the recovered isolates. This information could
		assist in tailoring prophylactic and therapeutic antifungal practices for this
		"infection, according to local epidemiological and mycological characteristics."

LID	-	10.3855/jidc.4186 [doi]
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: This study was conducted to determine characteristics of Candida
		colonization and candidemia in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of a
		tertiary care children's hospital. METHODOLOGY: Patients between 6 months and 15
		years of age consecutively admitted to the PICU of Mansoura University Children's
		"Hospital in Mansoura, Egypt, during one year period, were evaluated for Candida"
		colonization and candidemia. Susceptibility of Candida species isolated from
		blood to fluconazole and amphotericin B was determined by Etest. RESULTS:
		Sixty-six patients without prior fluconazole prophylaxis had 88 episodes of
		"candidemia, representing 19% of all cases with blood stream infections (BSIs)."
		Candida albicans (CA) and non-albicans Candida (NAC) species accounted for 40%
		"and 60% of candidemia episodes respectively. C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, and"
		"C. glabrata accounted for 25%, 17%, and 8% of NAC candidemias respectively."
		Fluconazole resistance was detected in 11.4% and 18.9% of CA and NAC isolates
		"respectively. Of the fluconazole resistant NAC isolates, four were C. krusei."
		Amphotericin B resistance was detected in 17% of NAC isolates. Candida
		"colonization was detected in 78.8% of patients. Compared to CA candidemia, higher"
		"risk for NAC candidemia was associated with age older than 1 year, Candida"
		isolation from endotracheal tube (ETT) and from central venous catheter.
		"Mortality rate was 42.4%, attributable mortality of candidemia was 16.7%."
		Regression analysis showed that the most significant independent predictors of
		"death were ETT and mechanical ventilation (MV), MV longer than 7 days, and"
		candiduria. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents important epidemiological features
		of Candida BSIs in a non-neonatal population.

PG	-	1286-91
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To determine the significance of Pneumocystis jirovecii infection in
		the Kenyan paediatric population. DESIGN: Sixty samples of induced sputum from
		"children aged < or =23 months, half of whom were human immunodeficiency virus"
		"(HIV) positive, admitted with severe pneumonia in Nairobi were subjected to"
		immunofluorescent staining for detection of P. jirovecii and microbiological
		culture. RESULTS: P. jirovecii was detected in 8/60 (13%) as a copathogen with
		other respiratory pathogens. Five of eight samples with >5 oocysts were from
		"HIV-positive children aged < or =6 months, while equivocally scored samples (< or"
		=5 oocysts) were from HIV-negative children aged >6 months. Klebsiella pneumoniae
		"was significantly recovered in 26/ 60 (43%), followed by Escherichia coli 11/60"
		"(18%) and Staphylococcus aureus 8/60 (13%). Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus"
		influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated infrequently. Candida
		"albicans was recovered from 27/60 (45%), while the frequency of C. tropicalis, C."
		"glabrata and C. parapsilosis was 7%, 5% and 3% respectively. Multidrug resistance"
		"among E. coli and K. pneumoniae were: sulphamethoxazoletrimethoprim 100% vs. 69%,"
		chloramphenicol 55% vs. 73% and ampicillin 100% vs. 89%. CONCLUSION:
		"Paediatricians in Kenya should be aware of Pneumocystis pneumonia, irrespective"
		of the patient's HIV status.

AB	-	Routine identification of fungal pathogens from positive blood cultures by
		"culture-based methods can be time-consuming, delaying treatment with appropriate"
		antifungal agents. The GenMark Dx ePlex investigational use only blood culture
		identification fungal pathogen panel (BCID-FP) rapidly detects 15 fungal targets
		simultaneously in blood culture samples positive for fungi by Gram staining. We
		aimed to determine the performance of the BCID-FP in a multicenter clinical
		study. Blood culture samples collected at 10 United States sites and tested with
		BCID-FP at 4 sites were compared to the standard-of-care microbiological and
		"biochemical techniques, fluorescence in situ hybridization using peptide nucleic"
		acid probes (PNA-FISH) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of
		flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Discrepant results were analyzed by
		bi-directional PCR/sequencing of residual blood culture samples. A total of 866
		"clinical samples, 120 retrospectively and 21 prospectively collected, along with"
		725 contrived samples were evaluated. Sensitivity and specificity of detection of
		"Candida species (C. albicans, C. auris, C. dubliniensis, C. famata, C. glabrata,"
		"C. guilliermondii, C. kefyr, C. krusei, C. lusitaniae, C. parapsilosis, and C."
		"tropicalis) ranged from 97.1 to 100% and 99.8 to 100%, respectively. For the"
		"other organism targets, sensitivity and specificity were as follows: 100% each"
		"for Cryptococcus neoformans and C. gattii, 98.6% and 100% for Fusarium spp., and"
		"96.2% and 99.9% for Rhodotorula spp., respectively. In 4 of the 141 clinical"
		"samples, the BCID-FP panel correctly identified an additional Candida species,"
		undetected by standard-of-care methods. The BCID-FP panel offers a faster
		turnaround time for identification of fungal pathogens in positive blood cultures
		"that may allow for earlier antifungal interventions and includes C. auris, a"
		highly multidrug-resistant fungus.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: There are few epidemiological studies on candidaemia in the
		paediatric population in Spain. We sought to determine the epidemiology of
		"candidaemia in these patients. METHODS: Prospective, observational and"
		multicentre study in 44 Spanish hospitals. All candidaemia episodes in paediatric
		patients from 0 to 15 years old between January 2009 and February 2010 were
		studied. RESULTS: There were 197 episodes and 200 species were isolated. The most
		"frequent species was Candida parapsilosis sensu stricto (43%), followed by C."
		"albicans (36%), C. tropicalis (6%), C. orthopsilosis, and C. glabrata (4%)"
		"respectively. C. albicans was the most prevalent in newborns, and C. parapsilosis"
		"was most frequent in the other age groups. As regards the regions of Spain, C."
		"albicans was most prevalent in patients from Catalonia, the Balearic Islands and"
		"Canary Islands, and C. parapsilosis in patients from Andalusia, Castilla-León,"
		"Galicia, Valencia, and Madrid. The rate of resistance to fluconazole was 1.5%"
		(4.1% with the new species-specific Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute
		[CLSI] criteria). Fluconazole resistance was lower in neonates than the other age
		groups. The Neonatal Wards were the areas with most episodes (31.5%). In the
		"multivariate analysis, the variables associated independently with candidaemia"
		due to C. albicans were: catheter (OR: 5.967; 95% CI: 1.614-22.057; P=.007) and
		prematurity (OR: 2.229; 95% CI: 1.141- 4.631; P=.020). CONCLUSIONS: The
		"epidemiology of paediatric candidaemia varies between Spanish regions, but,"
		"globally, C. parapsilosis and C. albicans, are respectively, the first and second"
		"most frequently isolated species, and they show resistance rates to fluconazole"
		of less than 5%.

PG	-	5062-5065
LID	-	10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_784_20 [doi]
AB	-	Perinephric and renal abscess are very rare entities with insidious presentation
		"and pose a great diagnostic challenge, common etiology being bacterial. Only less"
		"than 30 cases of fungal etiology have been reported in literature. Herein, we"
		report first case of fungal perinephric abscess caused by Candida tropicalis in a
		young diabetic female who presented with right flank pain and vomiting. Diagnosis
		made by CT imaging and culture of USG guided aspiration of perinephric abscess
		revealed growth of Candida tropicalis. Candida tropicalis perinephric abscess
		requires a very high index of suspicion for diagnosis. Associated high morbidity
		"and mortality rates are likely due to misdiagnosis, therefore fungal perinephric"
		and renal abscess must be kept as differential diagnosis in cases of fever with
		abdominal pain. Prompt diagnosis and early treatment are important for better
		"outcome. Imaging and microbiological investigations are required for diagnosis,"
		and drainage is indicated for successful therapy.

		care unit: a retrospective cohort study.
PG	-	10
LID	-	10.1186/1471-2334-13-10 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: The incidence of fungal healthcare-associated infection (HAI) has
		increased in a major teaching hospital in the northern part of Taiwan over the
		"past decade, especially in the intensive care units (ICUs). The purpose of this"
		study was to determine the factors that were responsible for the outbreak and
		trend in the ICU. METHODS: Surveillance fungal cultures were obtained from
		"""sterile"" objects, antiseptic solutions, environment of infected patients and"
		"hands of medical personnel. Risk factors for comparison included age, gender,"
		"admission service, and total length of stay in the ICU, Acute Physiology and"
		"Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores at admission to the ICU, main"
		"diagnosis on ICU admission, use of invasive devices, receipt of hemodialysis,"
		"total parenteral nutrition (TPN) use, history of antibiotic therapy before HAI or"
		"during ICU stay in no HAI group, and ICU discharge status (ie, dead or alive)."
		Univariable analysis followed by multiple logistic regression analysis was
		performed to identify the independent risk factors for ICU fungal HAIs and ICU
		mortality. RESULTS: There was a significant trend in ICU fungal HAIs from 1998 to
		2009 (P < 0.001). A total of 516 episodes of ICU fungal HAIs were identified; the
		"rates of various infections were urinary tract infection (UTI) (54.8%), blood"
		"stream infection (BSI) (30.6%), surgical site infection (SSI) (6.6%), pneumonia"
		"(4.5%), other sites (3.5%). The fungi identified were: yeasts (54.8%), Candida"
		"albicans (27.3%), Candida tropicalis (6.6%), Candida glabrata (6.6%), Candida"
		"parapsilosis (1.9%), Candida species (0.8%), and other fungi (1.9%). Candida"
		albicans accounted for 63% of all Candida species. Yeasts were found in the
		environment of more heavily infected patients. The independent risk factors (P <
		"0.05) of developing ICU fungal HAIs from all sites were TPN use, sepsis, surgical"
		"patients, mechanical ventilation and an indwelling urinary catheter. The"
		"independent risk factors for ICU fungal UTI included TPN use, mechanical"
		ventilation and an indwelling urinary catheter. The independent risk factors for
		"ICU fungal BSI included TPN use, sepsis, and higher APACHE II score. The"
		"independent risk factors for ICU fungal pneumonia included TPN use, surgical"
		patients. The independent risk factors for ICU fungal SSI included surgical
		"patients, and TPN use. The odds ratios of TPN use in various infection types"
		ranged from 3.51 to 8.82. The risk of mortality in patients with ICU fungal HAIs
		was over 2 times that of patients without ICU HAIs in the multiple logistic
		regression analysis (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: There was a secular trend of an
		increasing number of fungal HAIs in our ICU over the past decade. Patients with
		ICU fungal HAIs had a significantly higher mortality rate than did patients
		without ICU HAIs. Total parenteral nutrition was a significant risk factor for
		"all types of ICU fungal HAIs, and its use should be monitored closely."

		"hospital in Islamabad, Pakistan."
PG	-	986-991
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and antifungal susceptibility pattern of
		"Candida species. METHODS: This prospective, cross-sectional study was conducted"
		"at the Quaid-e-Azam International Hospital, Islamabad, Pakistan, from January"
		"2014 to February 2015, and comprised different clinical samples which were"
		analysed for various types of microbial infections. Species differentiation was
		confirmed by biochemical and molecular methods. Antifungal susceptibility against
		"amphotericin B, fluconazole and voriconazole was determined by Clinical and"
		Laboratory Standards Institute M44-A disk diffusion method. RESULTS: Of the 219
		"Candida isolates, majority of them were isolated from urine 78(35.6%) and vaginal"
		"swabs 59(26.9%). Moreover, 144(65.8%) samples were of females and 75(34.2%) were"
		of males. Candida albicans 128(58.45%) was the most predominant species followed
		"by Candida glabrata 30(13.69%), Candida tropicalis 26(11.87%), Candida krusei"
		"17(7.76%), Candida parapsilosis 12(5.47%), Candida dubliniensis 3(1.37%) and"
		Candida lusitaniae 3(1.37). All isolates were least susceptible to amphotericin B
		with a susceptibility rate of 213(97.26%). The highest resistance was found for
		voriconazole 40(18.26%) compared to fluconazole 32(14.61%). CONCLUSIONS: Candida
		species possessed high resistance rate against various antifungal agents.

TI	-	Time to initiation of fluconazole therapy impacts mortality in patients with
		candidemia: a multi-institutional study.
PG	-	25-31
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Inadequate antimicrobial treatment is an independent determinant of
		"hospital mortality, and fungal bloodstream infections are among the types of"
		infection with the highest rates of inappropriate initial treatment. Because of
		"significant potential for reducing high mortality rates, we sought to assess the"
		impact of delayed treatment across multiple study sites. The goals our analyses
		were to establish the frequency and duration of delayed antifungal treatment and
		to evaluate the relationship between treatment delay and mortality. METHODS: We
		conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with candidemia from 4 medical
		centers who were prescribed fluconazole. Time to initiation of fluconazole
		therapy was calculated by subtracting the date on which fluconazole therapy was
		initiated from the culture date of the first blood sample positive for yeast.
		"RESULTS: A total of 230 patients (51% male; mean age +/- standard deviation, 56"
		+/- 17 years) were identified; 192 of these had not been given prior treatment
		with fluconazole. Patients most commonly had nonsurgical hospital admission (162
		"patients [70%]) with a central line catheter (193 [84%]), diabetes (68 [30%]), or"
		cancer (54 [24%]). Candida species causing infection included Candida albicans
		"(129 patients [56%]), Candida glabrata (38 [16%]), Candida parapsilosis (25"
		"[11%]), or Candida tropicalis (15 [7%]). The number of days to the initiation of"
		"antifungal treatment was 0 (92 patients [40%]), 1 (38 [17%]), 2 (33 [14%]) or >"
		or = 3 (29 [12%]). Mortality rates were lowest for patients who began therapy on
		"day 0 (14 patients [15%]) followed by patients who began on day 1 (9 [24%]), day"
		"2 (12 [37%]), or day > or = 3 (12 [41%]) (P = .0009 for trend). Multivariate"
		"logistic regression was used to calculate independent predictors of mortality,"
		"which include increased time until fluconazole initiation (odds ratio, 1.42; P <"
		.05) and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (1-point
		"increments; odds ratio, 1.13; P < .05). CONCLUSION: A delay in the initiation of"
		fluconazole therapy in hospitalized patients with candidemia significantly
		impacted mortality. New methods to avoid delays in appropriate antifungal
		"therapy, such as rapid diagnostic tests or identification of unique risk factors,"
		are needed.

TI	-	PCR identification of four medically important Candida species by using a single
		primer pair.
PG	-	2962-7
AB	-	A single pair of primers was used in a PCR assay to amplify and identify the DNAs
		"from four medically important Candida species: C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, C."
		"tropicalis, and C. (Torulopsis) glabrata. The report describes the first"
		successful amplification of a chitin synthase-specific fragment from the four
		Candida species responsible for more than 90% of all cases of neonatal
		candidemia. The primer pair sequence was based on that from the C. albicans
		"chitin synthase gene, CHS1 (J. Au-Young and P.W. Robbins, Mol. Microbiol."
		"4:197-207, 1990). Each of the four amplified products is a single band of a"
		"different size. The DNA sequence of each PCR product was determined, and four"
		species-specific probes were synthesized. The DNAs from as few as 10 organisms in
		100 microliters of plasma could be detected after amplification and Southern blot
		analysis. In a retrospective study of 27 paired blood samples from 16 patients
		"with culture-proven candidemia, PCR analysis was successful at detecting and"
		correctly identifying to the species level 26 of the 27 Candida isolates. The
		speed and accuracy of this PCR-based technology make it a very powerful tool for
		detecting and diagnosing candidemia. Implementation of this assay for analyzing
		"blood samples should result in the more timely treatment of neonatal candidemia,"
		thereby reducing morbidity and mortality.

PG	-	485-91
AB	-	The medical records of 620 patients submitted to renal transplant from February
		"1968 to February 1995 were surveyed for Candida infection. Of these, 87 presented"
		107 episodes of candidiasis. In 42.9% the infection appeared up to 6 months after
		"the transplant. The most frequent involved sites were: urinary tract, respiratory"
		"tract, and gastrointestinal tract. The most frequent etiological agents were: C."
		"albicans, C. tropicalis and C. glabrata. Most urinary tract infections occurred"
		in the first 6 months (61.7%) and manifested clinically as a bacterial infection.
		In the respiratory tract infections were characterized by isolation of the agent
		"in sputum. In the gastrointestinal infections, 9/16 episodes were esophageal."
		There were 3 deaths directly related to Candidiasis (one pulmonary and 2
		"disseminated cases). In the urinary tract, and respiratory tract infections there"
		"was association of candidiasis with previous antibiotic treatment (76% and 67%,"
		"respectively), and with concomitant bacterial infections (34% and 64%,"
		respectively). The overall prevalence of Candida infections was 14.5%. The
		"predominant location was in the urinary tract (51.0%), followed by the"
		"respiratory (26.0%) and gastrointestinal tract (15.0%), with a high rate of"
		association with previous antibiotic treatment and bacterial infections.

TI	-	Polymicrobial candidaemia revealed by peripheral blood smear and chromogenic
		medium.
PG	-	196-8
AB	-	Candida spp are the fourth most common group of nosocomial pathogens isolated
		"from patients on medical, surgical, and intensive care wards. Polymicrobial"
		candidaemia has rarely been described. The diagnosis of candidaemia from
		peripheral blood smears has not been widely reported. This report describes the
		case of a young woman suffering from Ewing's sarcoma who developed a syndrome of
		septic shock. Deep fungal infection was diagnosed from a systematic peripheral
		blood smear and yeasts were isolated within 24 hours. A subculture on CHROMagar
		Candida allowed the differentiation and presumptive identification of Candida
		tropicalis and Candida krusei. Species identification was confirmed by the ID 32C
		system. This report underlines the usefulness of peripheral blood smears in the
		"diagnosis of fulminant deep fungal infections, and of a differential isolation"
		medium in the rapid presumptive identification of clinically important yeast
		species from clinical samples. This medium is particularly useful for the
		"detection of mixed fungal infections, allowing early and better adapted"
		antifungal treatment.

PG	-	109-11
AB	-	The case of a 77-year-old woman with acute myeloid leukemia who developed Candida
		tropicalis septic arthritis of the knee after remission-inducing chemotherapy is
		reported. A literature review of C. tropicalis non-prosthetic arthritis is
		included. The isolate was susceptible to fluconazole (MIC 0.25 mg/l). She was
		treated with fluconazole (400 mg orally) and frequent relieving synovial
		aspirations. After 1 month of antifungal therapy the synovial fluid became
		culture negative. Fluconazole concentration in the synovial fluid and serum were
		"20 mg/l and 19.4 mg/l, respectively. The patient was treated for a total of 7"
		months and made a full recovery. This is the first report of the successful use
		of fluconazole in the treatment of septic arthritis due to C. tropicalis.

TI	-	"Epidemiology, risk factors, and outcomes of Candida albicans versus non-albicans"
		candidemia in nonneutropenic patients.
PG	-	568-73
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candidemia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in
		hospitalized patients. OBJECTIVES: To describe the epidemiology of and risk
		factors for non-albicans candidemia (NAC) in nonneutropenic adults and the impact
		of NAC on patient outcomes and treatment cost. METHODS: We conducted a
		retrospective cohort analysis comparing demographics and risk factors for Candida
		albicans candidemia (CAC) versus NAC in 144 nonneutropenic patients with
		candidemia over a 6 year period (1997-2002) at Detroit Receiving Hospital.
		"RESULTS: Candida species distribution included albicans (50%), parapsilosis"
		"(13%), tropicalis (10%), and glabrata (13%). Predominant species varied by"
		"patient care unit, with C. glabrata more common in the medical intensive care"
		"unit (ICU) and C. parapsilosis in the burn ICU. In multivariate analysis, NAC was"
		"associated with the absence of antibiotic use at the onset of candidemia, recent"
		"history of solid tumor, and male sex. NAC was not associated with an increase in"
		"mortality or length of stay compared with CAC, but was found to have a higher"
		cost of antifungal therapy ($2030 vs $780; p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The
		epidemiology of candidemia is complex and varies among the different patient care
		"units. Specifically, patients appear less likely to develop NAC if they are"
		receiving antibiotics at the onset of candidemia. Increased awareness of risk
		factors for NAC can be used to guide adequate initial antifungal therapy.

		patients.
PG	-	550-5
AB	-	"The incidence, risk factors and prognostic factors for candidal infection were"
		determined in a prospective study of 280 infected patients. Thirty-one (11%)
		"patients were infected with Candida spp., sub-divided into 18 (58%) with C."
		"albicans, and 13 (42%) with non-albicans spp. (six C. glabrata, three C."
		"parapsilosis, and one each of C. krusei, C. tropicalis, C. guilliermondii and C."
		lusitaniae). Infection with Candida spp. was always associated with concurrent
		"bacterial infection. By univariate logistic regression analysis, the degree of"
		morbidity and the duration of mechanical ventilation were independent predictive
		"factors for death, but infection with Candida spp., was not. Factors associated"
		"with Candida spp. infection were the degree of morbidity, intensive care unit"
		"length of stay, alterations of immune response, and the number of medical devices"
		"involved. By multivariate logistic regression analysis, the only independent risk"
		factor for candidal infection was intensive care unit length of stay.

		Five-year surveillance of Candida bloodstream infection in a university reference
		hospital in southeast Brazil.
PG	-	225-30
LID	-	10.3109/13693786.2012.708107 [doi]
AB	-	"From 2006 to 2010, a retrospective study was conducted in a university referral"
		tertiary care hospital to study the frequency and distribution of Candida species
		"in different medical specialties. The use of mechanical ventilation, central"
		"venous catheter, and urinary catheter were recorded per 1,000 patient-days and"
		the use of antifungals was calculated using defined daily dose (DDD). A total of
		313 episodes were identified and the overall incidence was 0.54 (0.41-0.71)
		"episodes per 1,000 patient-days. Candida albicans caused 44% of the overall"
		"episodes, followed by C. tropicalis (21.7%), C. parapsilosis (14.4%), C. glabrata"
		"(11.2%), and C. krusei (3.5%). The incidence of C. glabrata significantly"
		increased from 2006-2010 (range: 4.8-23.5%) (P = 0.024). Candida glabrata was
		associated with malignancies (P = 0.004) and C. krusei with hematologic
		malignancies (P < 0.0001). The use of antifungals was higher in the
		hematology/bone marrow transplant units and represented 40% of all fluconazole
		prescription in the hospital. There was no correlation with the use of
		fluconazole and the increasing ratio of C. glabrata (r = 0.60). The use of
		invasive devices was significantly higher in the intensive care units (ICUs) than
		"the medical and surgical emergencies units (P < 0.001). In contrast, the"
		"emergencies had higher incidence of candidemia (2-2.1 episodes/1,000"
		"patient-days) than the ICUs (1.6 episodes 1,000 patient-days). Candida glabrata"
		candidemia showed a significant increase in contrast to the current national
		literature where C. parapsilosis remained the most important non-C. albicans
		Candida species in Brazilian hospitals. Our findings suggested that the
		increasing incidence of C. glabrata was not associated with use of fluconazole
		and other risk factors might play an important role.

TI	-	Economic analysis of inadequate fluconazole therapy in non-neutropenic patients
		with candidaemia: a multi-institutional study.
PG	-	557-62
AB	-	Mortality significantly increases in patients with candidaemia who receive
		inappropriate fluconazole therapy. The goals of this study were to compare
		hospital length of stay and costs for non-neutropenic patients with candidaemia
		treated with fluconazole based on the empirical dose and time until initiation of
		therapy. A retrospective cohort study was conducted of patients with candidaemia
		who were prescribed fluconazole at the onset of candidaemia or later.
		Hospital-related costs were compared based on time to initiation of fluconazole
		therapy and empirical fluconazole dose. A total of 192 non-neutropenic patients
		"(55% male; mean age+/-standard deviation, 56+/-17 years) were identified."
		"Isolated Candida species included C. albicans (59%), C. glabrata (15%), C."
		"parapsilosis (11%), C. tropicalis (6%), C. krusei (3%) or other Candida spp."
		"(6%). Time to initiation of fluconazole was Day 0 (35.4%), Day 1 (14.1%), Day 2"
		(26.6%) or Day >or=3 (23.9%). Thirty-two patients (17%) received a dose of
		fluconazole >or=6 mg/kg on Day 0. Total costs were lowest for patients started on
		"fluconazole on the culture day with adequate doses ($35,459+/-25,988) compared"
		"with all other patients ($52,158+/-53,492) (P=0.0088). After controlling for"
		"covariates, each 1-day delay in fluconazole therapy was associated with increased"
		"total hospital costs of $6392+/-3000 (P=0.0344), and an adequate fluconazole dose"
		"was associated with decreased total hospital costs of $18,744+/-7173 (P=0.0097)."
		A delay or an inadequate dose or fluconazole in patients with candidaemia was
		associated with increased hospital costs. Improved methods to diagnose patients
		with candidaemia quickly are needed.

		Laboratory between 2012 and 2013 using the classic morphological schemes and the
		Vitek 2 automated system. RESULTS: The results of the retrospective analysis
		(2011-2012) indicated that of the 6100 various clinical specimens submitted to
		"the routine microbiology analysis, 143 (2.35%) revealed the presence of Candida"
		spp. The distribution of the 143 Candida spp according to specimens was as
		"follows: urine 72%, sputum 10.5%, endotracheal tube 7%, blood 4.2%, catheter tip"
		"2.1%, throat swab 2.1%, eye swab 0.7%, wound exudates 0.7%, and cerebrospinal"
		"fluid 0.7%. The results of the prospective study (2012-2013), which involved the"

		"albicans 28.6% was the predominant species, followed by Candida parapsilosis"
		"21.4%, Candida tropicalis 14.3%, and Candida lusitaniae 9.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Along"
		"with the commonly encountered Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis, Candida"
		"tropicalis, and Candida lusitaniae were detected with significant rates. Many"
		other Candida species and some other pathogenic yeasts have been detected for the
		first time in the region. Urinary tract samples were the main source of Candida
		species.

		frequently lethal infection.
PG	-	4745-52
LID	-	10.1002/cncr.24507 [doi]
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: The incidence, epidemiology, Candida species distribution, resistance"
		"patterns, and outcome of candidemia in high-risk hematologic malignancy and/or"
		stem cell transplantation patients have not been extensively described since the
		"introduction of new antifungal agents. METHODS: In this retrospective study, the"
		authors reviewed the medical records and microbiologic data of hematologic
		malignancy patients with candidemia at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson
		Cancer Center from March 2001 to February 2007. RESULTS: The authors analyzed 173
		"episodes of candidemia (170 patients), 125 (72%) of which were breakthrough cases"
		"after prior antifungal agents, mainly fluconazole (28 [22%]), caspofungin (25"
		"[20%]), and voriconazole (18 [14%]). The incidence of candidemia (per 100,000"
		"inpatient days) remained relatively stable, from 13.9 in 2001 to 19.2 in 2006."
		"However, compared with the findings of previous studies at the authors'"
		"institution, the frequency of Candida glabrata and C. krusei infection decreased"
		"(to 5% and 17%, respectively) and C. parapsilosis (24%) and C. tropicalis (21%)"
		increased. C. parapsilosis fungemia was associated with prior caspofungin use
		"(P<.001). The overall 30-day crude mortality rate was 38%, and the attributable"
		"mortality rate was 19%, similar to previous findings at the authors' institution."
		The Candida species associated with the highest mortality rate was C. glabrata.
		CONCLUSIONS: Despite the widespread use of antifungal prophylaxis and the
		"introduction of new antifungal agents, the incidence and associated mortality"
		rates of candidemia remained stable in high-risk hematologic malignancy patients.
		"However, its epidemiological characteristics have shifted, with C. parapsilosis"
		and C. tropicalis becoming more common.

		in Turkey: a Multicentre Study].
PG	-	638-646
LID	-	10.5578/mb.69837 [doi]
AB	-	Bloodstream infections due to yeast species especially Candida spp. have been
		reported to be important healthcare associated infections with high mortality and
		morbidity rates. Candidemia causes prolonged hospital stays as well as increased
		cost. In order to prevent or treat these life-threatening bloodstream infections
		"successfully, nationwide epidemiological data should be available about the"
		etiological agents of these infections. Multi-centre national epidemiological
		data on yeast bloodstream infections in Turkey is lacking. A retrospective study
		was designed and data from six different centres in Turkey between 2011 and 2016
		years were gathered and analysed for the distribution and frequency of yeast
		species in order to assist clinicians in their choice of early and appropriate
		antifungal therapy. All laboratories used automated blood culture systems for the
		isolation of blood strains. All the participating centres performed the
		identification of their own isolates by conventional methods using germ tube
		"test, morphology on corn meal agar with tween 80 and chromogenic media and the"
		"identification was confirmed by API 20C AUX, API ID 32C or matrix-assisted laser"
		desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrophotometry (MALDI-TOF MS)
		systems. The analysis of the results was performed on the basis of intensive care
		"units (ICUs), other inpatient clinics (OICs) and totally all clinics (ACs)."
		Totally 2547 yeast isolates were determined from six participating centres during
		"six years. According to the total ACs results, Candida albicans was the most"
		"prevalent species (43.1%), followed by Candida parapsilosis complex (29.1%),"
		"Candida glabrata (10.1%), Candida tropicalis (7.5%), Candida krusei (2.4%) and"
		Candida kefyr (1.6%) and the remaining (6.2%) of them consisted of other yeast
		species. The distribution of the Candida species did not show statistically
		"significant difference between the years, however the increase of C.parapsilosis"
		"complex in 2016 was statistically significant, (p= 0.02). During the study"
		"period, totally 1054 yeast isolates were obtained from the ICUs of the centres."
		C.albicans predominated with 476 (45.2%) isolates and C.parapsilosis complex
		"(28.7%), C.glabrata (10.7%) and C.tropicalis (7.3%) were the other leading"
		species in ICUs. Among 1493 isolates of the OICs of six centres participated in
		"the study, C.albicans was the most prevalent species with 622 (41.7%) isolates."
		"The other frequent species of OICs were C.parapsilosis complex (29.5%),"
		C.glabrata (9.6%) and C.tropicalis (7.6%) resembling ICU results. It can be
		concluded that C.albicans is still the leading cause of bloodstream infections in
		the six different centres located in various geographical areas of Turkey.

		of patients with candidemia].
PG	-	3193-6
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To explore the microbiological and clinical characteristics of
		patients with candidemia and analyze their prognostic risk factors. METHODS: A
		retrospective analysis was conducted for hospitalized patients with candidemia
		"from January 2008 to December 2012 at Affiliated Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan"
		"University. Pathogen spectrum, resistance pattern, underlying diseases, therapy"
		received and patient prognosis were collected by chart review. The univariate and
		multivariate Logistic regression analyses were used to determine the prognostic
		risk factors of candidemia. RESULTS: A total of 138 inpatients were identified.
		There were 98 males and 40 females with a mean age of (61.3 ± 16.6) years. The
		morbidity rate of candidemia in annual discharged patients was 0.034%-0.051%. The
		"most common pathogens were Candida albicans (n = 72, 52.2%), Candida parapsilosis"
		"(n = 29, 21.0%) and Candida tropicalis (n = 16, 11.6%). The antibiotic"
		susceptible rate of azole for Candida was 90.9%-97.4% while 55.6%-83.3% for
		Candida tropicalis. The overall case fatality rate of candidemia was 39.1%
		(54/138) while the attributable case fatality rate 31.9% (44/138). Multivariate
		Logistic regression analysis indicated acute physiology and chronic health
		"evaluation II(APACHE II) score ≥ 20 points (OR = 8.025, 95%CI: 2.032-31.696, P ="
		"0.003), hypoproteinemia (OR = 6.213, 95%CI: 1.849-20.879, P = 0.003), concurrent"
		"bacteremia (OR = 5.541, 95%CI: 1.576-19.487, P = 0.008) and indwelling urethral"
		"catheter (OR = 13.776, 95%CI: 1.402-135.352, P = 0.024) were the independent risk"
		"factors of candidemia-related mortality, while removal or replacement of central"
		"venous catheter (OR = 0.231, 59%CI: 0.075-0.716, P = 0.011) and surgery within 30"
		"days (OR = 0.206, 95%CI: 0.050-0.857, P = 0.030) were the protective factors."
		CONCLUSIONS: Candida albicans is the most common causative agent. The case
		"fatality rate of candidemia has remained high. APACHE II score ≥ 20 points,"
		"hypoproteinemia, indwelling urethral catheter and concurrent bacteremia are"
		independent risk factors attributing to candidemia-related mortality while
		removal or replacement of central venous catheter and surgery within 30 days are
		the protective ones.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of Candida spp.
		and presence of oral lesions in Brazilian leprosy patients under multidrug
		"therapy (MDT). METHODS: Thirty-eight individuals (18 males and 20 females, median"
		age 53 years) clinically and microbiologically diagnosed as leprosy (lepromatous
		"variant), and under MDT for at least 45 days were studied. The control group"
		"constituted by 38 healthy individuals (median age 53.5), matched to the test"
		"group in relation to age, gender and oral conditions. Oral rinses were collected"
		and the Candida identification was performed by phenotypic tests. The existence
		of Candida dubliniensis among the isolates was analyzed using a validated
		multiplex PCR assay. Twenty-nine leprosy patients were examined intra-orally for
		the presence of lesions. Data were analyzed by z- and Mann-Whitney tests (alpha =
		5%). RESULTS: Yeast carriage rate between leprosy patients (65.8%) and controls
		"(47.4%) was similar (P = 0.099), and no significant difference between yeast"
		counts was observed (P = 0.1004). Candida albicans was the most frequently
		"isolated species in both groups. In the leprosy group, Candida tropicalis and"
		"Candida parapsilosis were also identified. In the control group, we additionally"
		"identified Candida tropicalis, Candida glabrata and Candida kefyr. Candida"
		dubliniensis was not detected. No leprosy-related oral lesion was registered.
		"CONCLUSION: Within the limits of the study, we concluded that Brazilian leprosy"
		patients under MDT showed similar levels of carriage and Candida species
		distribution in relation to the controls.

AB	-	Invasive fungal infection is a major threat to chronic granulomatous disease
		(CGD) patients. We present a rare case of invasive mycosis in a CGD boy. An
		"11-year-old preadolescent boy presented with fever, hypoxia, and dyspnea."
		Physical examination revealed left neck enlarged lymph nodes with healed scars.
		The chest revealed bilateral diminished air entry with bilateral coarse crackles.
		"Peripheral blood leukocyte count was 28.260/μL with 84% neutrophil, 11%"
		"lymphocyte, and 4.4% monocyte. The patient's condition deteriorated regardless of"
		the empirical antibacterial against MRSA and suspected tuberculosis. A sputum
		"sample was submitted for mycological investigation, and budding yeasts with"
		pseudohyphae were detected in the direct smear and were isolated in pure culture
		using Sabouraud agar. Candida tropicalis was identified from cultural and
		microscopic features and confirmed by the Vitek 2 automated system. This result
		"confirmed the invasive mycosis, obviously due to the underlying primary"
		"immunodeficiency, chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). Amphotericin was added,"
		and he also received IV methylprednisolone for seven days. The patient improved
		"and was weaned off oxygen with no fever. However, the patient was referred to a"
		"higher center for further workup, which confirmed CGD's diagnosis. He is on the"
		list for HLA-identical bone marrow transplantation (BMT).

TI	-	Candida colonization of the respiratory tract and subsequent pseudomonas
		ventilator-associated pneumonia.
PG	-	110-7
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Recovery of Candida from the respiratory tract of a critically ill
		patient receiving mechanical ventilation (MV) usually indicates colonization
		"rather than infection of the respiratory tract. However, interactions between"
		"Candida and bacteria, particularly Pseudomonas, have been reported. Thus, Candida"
		colonization of the respiratory tract may predispose to bacterial
		ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). METHODS: In a multicenter study of
		"immunocompetent critically ill patients receiving MV for > 2 days, we compared"
		the incidence of pneumonia in patients with and without (exposed/unexposed)
		"respiratory-tract Candida colonization, matched on study center, admission year,"
		"and MV duration. RESULTS: Over the 4-year study period, of the 803 patients"
		"meeting study inclusion criteria in the six study centers, 214 patients (26.6%)"
		had respiratory tract Candida colonization. Candida albicans was the most common
		"species (68.7%), followed by Candida glabrata (20.1%) and Candida tropicalis"
		(13.1%). Extrapulmonary Candida colonization was more common in exposed patients
		"(39.7% vs 8.3%, p = 0.01). Exposed patients had longer ICU and hospital stays but"
		similar mortality to unexposed patients. The matched exposed/unexposed nested
		cohort study identified bronchial Candida colonization as an independent risk
		"factor for pneumonia (24.1% vs 17.6%; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.58; 95%"
		"confidence interval [CI], 0.94 to 2.68; p = 0.0860); the risk increase was"
		"greatest for Pseudomonas pneumonia (9% vs 4.8%; adjusted OR, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.00"

TI	-	Hematogenous infections due to Candida parapsilosis: changing trends in fungemic
		patients at a comprehensive cancer center during the last four decades.
PG	-	6-Nov
AB	-	This study was performed to evaluate trends in species distribution in patients'
		with hematogenous candidiasis at a comprehensive cancer center. The results of a
		"retrospective analysis from January 1, 1993 to December 31, 1998 were compared"
		with prior reports from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in the last forty
		"years. In 570 total episodes since 1974, 43.9% were due to Candida albicans."
		"During 1990's, C. parapsilosis emerged as the most frequent yeast species in the"
		non-C. albicans group (36.1% during 1993-1998 from 20.9% 1974-1982; p < 0.01). An
		increase in C. krusei from 5.9% (1974-1982) to 10.5% during the recent six years
		(1993-1998) was also noticed. The proportion of C. tropicalis among non-albicans
		"fungemia during 1974-1982 was 42.8%, whereas in 1993 to 1998 a marked decline in"
		"C. tropicalis hematogenous infection was observed (27.8%; p < 0.01). During 1998,"
		the incidence of candidemia declined from 7.1% (1972-1973) and 6.5% (1982) to
		"3.4% (p < 0.01), and improved survival among fungemic patients (33% mortality in"
		1998; 77.3% during 1974-1982; p < 0.001) was encouraging. The increase in C.
		parapsilosis bloodstream invasion during 1990's was associated with a significant
		reduction in the endogenous non-albicans Candida tropicalis infection that
		"probably resulted in part due to the common prophylaxis, and/or preemptive"
		fluconazole given routinely in high-risk patients undergoing treatment for
		cancer. The widespread use of extraneous implantable and/or semi-implantable
		indwelling intra-vascular devices may also have played an important role in
		promoting (exogenous) C. parapsilosis infection. This study emphasizes the
		"importance of periodic evaluation of candidemia, especially at centers caring for"
		patients at risk.

		lymphoid leukemia patient.
PG	-	426-8
AB	-	Fungal infections caused by Candida species have increased in incidence during
		"the past two decades in England, North America and Europe. Candidal arthritis is"
		rare in patients who are not intravenous drug users or are who not using a
		"prostheses. We report the case of a 24-year-old man with acute lymphoid leukemia,"
		who developed Candida tropicalis arthritis during an aplastic period after
		chemotherapy. This is the eighth case described in the literature of C.
		tropicalis causing arthritis without intra-articular inoculation. We call
		attention to an unusual first sign of fungal infection: septic arthritis without
		"intra-articular inoculation. However, this case differs from the other seven,"
		since despite therapy a fast and lethal evolution was observed. We reviewed
		"reported cases, incidence, risk factors, mortality and treatment of neutropenic"
		patients with fungal infections.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Candidemia is the worldwide life-threaten disease, especially in"
		cancer patients. This study was aimed to identify and evaluate the risk factors
		"of candidemia in cancer patients, which will prompt the improvement on current"
		"therapeutic strategies and prognosis. METHODS: A retrospective, case-control"
		study was conducted from inpatients of Tianjin Medical University Cancer
		"Institute and Hospital, during 2006 to 2013. Analyses were performed between"
		"cancer patients with candidemia as study case, and patients with bacterial"
		"bloodstream infections as control. Each case was matched up with two controls,"
		"for gender and inpatient duration. Candida species, clinical characteristics,"
		risk factors and outcomes were reviewed in details. RESULTS: Total number of 80
		cases and 160 controls were enrolled and analyzed in this study. Candida albicans
		"was identified as the most prevalent species and account for 55.0% candidemia,"
		"followed by Candida parapsilosis complex (21.3%), Candida tropicalis (8.8%),"
		"Candida glabrata complex (7.5%), Candida lusitaniae (3.8%), and Candida famata"
		"(3.8%). The crude mortality at 30-days of candidemia was up to 30.0%, which is"
		significantly higher than bacterial bloodstream infections (p = 0.006).
		Logistical analysis demonstrated that total parenteral nutrition >5 days
		"(p = 0.036), urinary catheter >2 days (p = 0.001), distant organ metastasis of"
		cancer (p = 0.002) and gastrointestinal cancer (p = 0.042) were the independent
		risk factors for candidemia. CONCLUSIONS: Candidemia showed significant higher
		"mortality than bacterial bloodstream infections, C. albicans was cited as the"
		"primary pathogen. Total parenteral nutrition, urinary catheter, distant organ"
		metastasis of cancer and gastrointestinal cancer are independent predictors for
		"candidemia, this findings provides potential therapeutic targets for improving"
		the outcome.

TI	-	Increased incidence of vulvovaginal candidiasis caused by Candida glabrata in
		Jordan.
PG	-	103-7
AB	-	Due to the rising importance of Candida glabrata and other non-albicans Candida
		"as principle human opportunistic pathogens, 356 women with abnormal vaginal"
		"discharge who attended a private obstetrics and gynecology clinic in Amman,"
		"Jordan, between January 1999 and February 2001 were examined. The isolation rate"
		of Candida spp. from high-vaginal swabs was 44.9%. CHROMagar Candida and
		"conventional mycological methods identified six isolated Candida spp., including"
		"C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, C. krusei, and C."
		"kefyr. The percentages of C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. tropicalis isolates"
		"were 43.1%, 32.5%, and 8.1%, respectively. C. albicans was isolated in"
		combination with C. tropicalis and C. krusei in two patients. Statistical
		analysis of the present results clearly show an increase in the incidence of
		"vulvovaginal candidiasis caused by C. glabrata in the two study periods,"
		"1994-1996 and 1999-2001 (P = 0.0186). In contrast, comparing the proportions of"
		"vulvovaginal candidiasis caused by C. albicans in the two periods, there was no"
		"significant difference. These results may have significant clinical implications,"
		as C. glabrata are innately less susceptible to most antifungal agents than C.
		albicans; these findings support viewing this organism as a major pathogen.

AB	-	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To investigate in vitro microbiological
		susceptibilities of Candida vitreous endophthalmitis isolates using traditional
		and newer antifungal agents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The current study is a
		"retrospective, consecutive case series of 17 vitreous culture-proven Candida"
		endophthalmitis isolates from 2011 to 2017 from Bascom Palmer Eye Institute.
		"Susceptibilities to echinocandins, triazoles, polyenes, and nucleoside analogs"
		"were obtained. RESULTS: The study isolates consisted of 59% C. albicans, 17% C."
		"glabrata, 12% C. tropicalis, and 12% C. parapsilosis. Isolates demonstrated 100%"
		sensitivity to all antifungals tested except anidulafungin (85% sensitive) and
		"fluconazole (88.2% sensitive). Comparing in-class agents, minimum inhibitory"
		"concentration (MIC) values for voriconazole were lower than other triazoles,"
		whereas micafungin had lower MIC values compared with other echinocandins.
		CONCLUSION: Both traditional and newer antifungals included agents that were
		highly efficacious against in vitro Candida species. Although the authors' study
		"data suggest that older, established antifungals are likely adequate for the"
		"treatment of Candida endophthalmitis, newer antifungal agents also can be"
		considered. [Ophthalmic Surg Lasers Imaging Retina. 2019;50:S13-S17.].

TI	-	The epidemiology of Candida species associated with vulvovaginal candidiasis in
		an Iranian patient population.
PG	-	199-203
LID	-	10.1016/j.ejogrb.2010.11.022 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: Vulvovaginal candidiasis is a common infection among women worldwide.
		"According to previous epidemiological studies, Candida albicans is the most"
		"common species of Candida. The prevalence of non-Candida species, however, is"
		increasing. Identification of Candida species among the population will not only
		"help health professionals to choose suitable antifungal treatments, but also"
		"prevent development of drug resistance. The aim of this study was to identify,"
		"using chromogenic agar medium, the Candida species associated with vulvovaginal"
		candidiasis among a sample of the Iranian population. STUDY DESIGN: In a
		"prospective cohort study during a two year period from March 2006 to March 2008,"
		swab samples of vaginal discharge/secretion were taken from 200 patients admitted
		"to the gynecology clinic of Mahdieh Hospital (Tehran, Iran) with a clinical"
		presentation suggestive of vulvovaginal candidiasis. The isolates obtained were
		cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar and chromogenic agar medium. Candida species
		"were also identified by germ tube formation in serum, chlamydospore production on"
		Corn Meal Agar and carbohydrate absorption using the API 20C-AUX kit.
		Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire investigating the risk
		factors associated with candidiasis. An assessment of the different species of
		"recurrent and non-recurrent candidiasis was also made. Descriptive statistics,"
		"chi-square test, and t-test were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: A total of"
		191 isolates were obtained from 175 vaginal specimens. Candida albicans accounted
		for 67% of the strains including single and mixed infections. The other
		"identified species were Candida glabrata (18.3%), Candida tropicalis (6.8%),"
		"Candida krusei (5.8%), Candida parapsilosis (1.6%), and Candida guilliermondii"
		(0.5%) respectively. Mixed infection with two or more species of Candida was seen
		in 10.3% of patients. The most common mixed cause was the combination of Candida
		albicans and Candida glabrata. Participants who were sexually active and those
		who had orogenital sex were more likely to suffer recurrent vulvovaginal
		candidiasis. CONCLUSIONS: Candida albicans was the most common cause of recurrent
		and non-recurrent vulvovaginitis. The second most common species was Candida
		glabrata. This study suggests CHROMagar method as a convenient and cost effective
		yet reliable method to isolate the species of Candida especially in cases where
		more than one species is present.

		Case Report and Review of the Literature.
PG	-	48-51
AB	-	Only a handful of case reports in the literature describe presence of Candida
		albicans in the gut of otherwise healthy subjects who were older adults and
		"presented with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. In this article, the authors"
		describe an interesting case report of a 48-y-old female with Sjogren's syndrome
		and stage II cervical cancer complicated by a rectovaginal fistulae postradiation
		"therapy requiring a colectomy and ileostomy, who presented with a wasting"
		syndrome consisting of unresolving watery diarrhea and a 40-pound (18.14 kg)
		"weight loss in the course of 5 mo. On physical exam, she appeared to be a thin,"
		fragile female with wasting in the subscapular and sternocleidomastoid area with
		benign GI exam. An upper endoscopy was unremarkable for any significant
		pathological entity. A small bowel fluid aspirate was positive for overgrowth of
		Candida tropicalis and also was found to have anti-Candida immunoglobulin A. The
		patient was begun on central parenteral nutrition and she completed a 3-wk course
		of fluconazole. She was gradually weaned off total parenteral nutrition during
		"the next 3 mo, with slow reintroduction of healthy whole foods and had"
		appropriate weight gain and resolution of her GI symptoms. This case shows how
		important dietary interventions can be in managing malnutrition. Adding proper
		nutrients and slowly eradicating the dysbiotic fungi in the small intestine can
		help in resolution of GI symptoms and return to functional status.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Healthcare-associated infections, formerly known as"
		"nosocomial infections, are one of the most important issues in current practice."
		"Understanding trends in overall infection rates, as well as their incidence and"
		"proportion among different causative organisms, can help us to better define our"
		infection control methods and therapy goals. To understand the changing
		"epidemiology of nosocomial bloodstream infections (BSI) in Taiwan, we"
		retrospectively collected nosocomial infection data from 11 hospitals and
		examined the trends and changing patterns of nosocomial BSI. METHODS: Eleven
		major teaching hospitals in Taiwan were invited to participate in the study. The
		"overall density of nosocomial infections and major BSI-causing organisms,"
		"including Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii,"
		"and Candida species, were collected. The distribution of the different Candida"
		"species was also recorded. Background parameters from the 11 hospitals, including"
		"the size of the hospital, hospital capacity, the number of blood stream infection"
		"events, and average length of stay, were also recorded. RESULTS: The incidence of"
		"nosocomial BSI ranged 0.23-2.56 per 1,000 patient-days, which accounted for 8-43%"
		of all nosocomial infections. The most common causative organism of nosocomial
		"bacteremia was S. aureus, ranging 0.88-0.01 per 1,000 patient-days. Overall, the"
		"incidence of S. aureus bacteremia has decreased over the last 13 years, but this"
		difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.053). The rate of Candida
		fungemia (p < 0.01) and A. baumannii (p = 0.03) bacteremia increased
		"significantly. C. albicans accounted for most cases of nosocomial fungemia,"
		"ranging from 40% to 80%, followed by Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis and"
		"Candida glabrata. However, the incidence varied significantly from hospital to"
		"hospital, and the highest incidence was observed in a cancer center. CONCLUSION:"
		The overall incidence rate of S. aureus bacteremia in the 11 major hospitals
		"studied had decreased over the last decade, though the difference was not"
		"statistically significant. However, the rate of Candida fungemia and A. baumannii"
		bacteremia had increased significantly.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: Candida could become the second most frequent cause of nosocomial
		"urinary tract infection. Although Candida albicans is the most important species,"
		others have arisen as emerging pathogens. The aim of this study was to analyze
		the presence of candiduria in inpatients. METHODS: We performed a retrospective
		"study of Candida isolates from adult inpatient urocultures over five years,"
		"gathering and tabulating data on: the species; susceptibility to fluconazole,"
		"amphotericin B, and voriconazole (Vitek2, BioMerieux); presence of catheter;"
		hospital department of origin; and patient age and sex. RESULTS: We detected 289
		"yeast episodes, observing an annual increase: 134 (46.4%) were non-C. albicans"
		"yeasts, with 57 (19.7%) being Candida glabrata, 37 (12.8%) Candida tropicalis, 25"
		"(8.6%) Candida parapsilosis, and 10 (3.5%) Candida lusitaniae. Most isolates"
		"derived from catheterized (240, 83.0%) and Internal Medicine Department (118,"
		"40.8%) patients, observing an annual increase; 152 (52.6%) isolates were from"
		"males, and the mean age was >65 years. Susceptibility to antifungals was >85%."
		CONCLUSIONS: Inpatient urocultures should include data on the presence of
		"Candida, which is more prevalent in Internal Medicine Department inpatients, in"
		"those with urinary catheter, and in over 65-year-olds. Almost half of the"
		"isolates were non-C. albicans yeasts, and we recommend complete identification of"
		the species involved.

AB	-	BACKGROUND Candida albicans is the principal human fungal opportunistic organism
		commonly detected in the gastrointestinal and genitourinary systems. Five species
		"of candida (Glabrata, Tropicalis, Albicans, Parapsilosis, and Kruzei) are"
		"responsible for most cases of invasive candidiasis or candidemia, which is a"
		"growing public health concern due to the increasing complexity of patients,"
		leading to a high fatality rate. CASE REPORT We report an extremely rare case of
		"candida pericarditis due to esophagopericardial fistula in a young, heavy,"
		"alcoholic adult diagnosed by culture of the drained pericardial fluid, which"
		showed a growth of Candida albicans. CONCLUSIONS We highlight the first case of
		candida pericarditis in immunocompetent adult successfully treated by
		pericardiocentesis and oral fluconazole.

PG	-	1164-70
AB	-	"We conducted prospective, active population-based surveillance for candidemia"
		(defined as any Candida species isolated from blood) in Atlanta and San Francisco
		"(total population, 5.34 million) during 1992-1993. The average annual incidence"
		"of candidemia at both sites was 8 per 100,000 population. The highest incidence"
		"(75 per 100,000) occurred among infants </=1 year old. In 19% of patients,"
		candidemia developed prior to or on the day of admission. Underlying medical
		"conditions included cancer (26%), abdominal surgery (14%), diabetes mellitus"
		"(13%), and human immunodeficiency virus infection (10%). In 47% of cases, species"
		"of Candida other than Candida albicans were isolated, most commonly Candida"
		"parapsilosis, Candida glabrata, and Candida tropicalis. Antifungal susceptibility"
		testing of 394 isolates revealed minimal levels of azole resistance among C.
		"albicans, C. tropicalis, and C. parapsilosis. These data document the substantial"
		burden of candidemia and its changing epidemiology. Continued surveillance will
		be important to monitor the epidemiology of candidemia and to detect emergence of
		resistance to azoles.

		Resistance surveillance study in Venezuelan strains.
PG	-	137-43
LID	-	10.1080/13693780802144339 [doi]
AB	-	The aim of this study was to determine in vitro susceptibility profiles of
		Venezuelan strains of Candida spp. to four antifungal agents. One hundred and
		forty five (145) isolates were recovered during a 1-year period (June 2006 to
		June 2007) from clinical specimens of patients with severe Candida spp.
		"infections in 15 hospitals. In vitro susceptibilities to amphotericin B,"
		"fluconazole, itraconazole and voriconazole were determined by modified Etest. Non"
		Candida albicans Candida spp. were the most frequently isolated yeasts (72.4%) in
		comparison with C. albicans (27.6%). Candida spp. strains showed MIC ranges
		between <0.002 and 0.5 mug/ml to amphotericin B. While none were found to be
		"resistant to voriconazole, 5.5% and 27.6% of the test strains were resistant to"
		"fluconazole and itraconazole, respectively. C. albicans remains the most"
		susceptible of the yeasts studied to fluconazole and itraconazole (P<0.05) when
		compared with non C. albicans Candida spp. C. krusei showed the greater
		"cross-resistance to azoles, followed by C. glabrata, C. tropicalis and C."
		"parapsilosis, while C. albicans isolates did not demonstrate this characteristic."
		It is very important to carry out the correct species identification of clinical
		yeast isolates because they show up variations in both distribution and
		"susceptibility profiles according to the hospital, patient's underlying disease,"
		"clinical specimen analyzed, and the geographical region in which the studies were"
		conducted. The Mycology Department of the INHRR is the national reference center
		"responsible for antifungal resistance surveillance, performing the susceptibility"
		tests with isolates recovered from hospitalized patients in public health centres
		which do not have mycological diagnosis laboratories.

AB	-	Contamination of preservation solution (PS) with yeasts during solid organ
		recovery can lead to life-threatening complications in the recipients. The
		prevalence of such a contamination needs to be established. From January 2004 to
		"December 2008, we prospectively investigated the potential fungal contamination"
		of all the PSs collected in our institution using a standardised procedure
		consisting in centrifugation of 10 mL PS and incubation of the pellet seeded on
		"fungal-specific medium for 15 days at 30 degrees C. During the study period, 728"
		"transplantations (397 kidneys, 262 livers and 69 hearts) were performed for which"
		"659 PSs (90.5%) were available. The yeast contamination rate was 0% (0/62), 3.1%"
		"(11/356) and 4.1% (10/241) for heart, kidney and liver transplants, respectively."
		"We identified 10 Candida albicans, five C. glabrata, two C. krusei, one C."
		"tropicalis, one C. valida, one Pichia etchelsii and one Rhodorula sp. Routine"
		bacterial analysis identified only five of these 21 fungal contaminations. Twenty
		recipients were alive after at least one year of follow-up and one died from
		meningeal carcinomatosis at seven months. Three patients were found to have the
		same species of Candida from their surgical drains but did not develop any
		infection or abnormalities upon ultrasound investigation. Fourteen patients
		received antifungal drugs. Yeast contamination occurred in 3.4% of all kidney and
		liver PSs tested. Its clinical consequences and therapeutic management remain to
		be defined. Our study also suggests that optimisation/standardisation of
		"microbiological procedures is warranted, including analysis of large PS volume,"
		seeding of fungal-specific medium and prolonged incubation.

		outcomes of Candida bloodstream infections in three Lima-Callao hospitals.
		METHODS: Candida spp. isolates were identified prospectively at participant
		hospitals between November 2013 and January 2015. Susceptibility testing for
		"amphotericin B, fluconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole and anidulafungin was"
		performed using broth microdilution method. Clinical information was obtained
		from medical records and evaluated. RESULTS: We collected information on 158
		"isolates and 157 patients. Median age of patients was 55.0 yrs., and 64.1% were"
		males. Thirty-eight (24.2%) episodes of candidemia occurred in those <18 yrs. The
		frequency of non-Candida albicans was 72.1%. The most frequently recovered
		"species were C. albicans (n = 44, 27.8%), C. parapsilosis (n = 40, 25.3%), C."
		"tropicalis (n = 39, 24.7%) and C. glabrata (n = 15, 9.5%). Only four isolates"
		"were resistant to fluconazole, 86.7% (n = 137) were susceptible and 17 were"
		susceptible-dose dependent. Decreased susceptibility to posaconazole was also
		"observed in three isolates, and one to voriconazole. All isolates were"
		susceptible to anidulafungin and amphotericin B. The most commonly associated
		"co-morbid conditions were recent surgery (n = 61, 38.9%), mechanical ventilation"
		"(n = 60, 38.2%) and total parenteral nutrition (n = 57, 36.3%). The incidence of"
		"candidemia by center ranged between 1.01 and 2.63 cases per 1,000 admissions,"
		with a global incidence of 2.04. Only 28.1% of cases received treatment within 72
		"hrs. of diagnosis. Overall, the 30-day survival was 60.4% (treated subjects,"
		"67.4%; not-treated patients, 50.9%). CONCLUSIONS: We found a very high proportion"
		"of non-albicans Candida species. Despite this, the decreased"
		susceptibility/resistance to fluconazole was only 13.3% and not seen in the other
		"antifungals. Overall, the incidence of candidemia mortality was high when"
		"compared to other international studies. It is possible, that the delay in"
		"initiating antifungal treatment contributed to the elevated mortality rate, in"
		spite of low antifungal resistance.

		"quantification, and various subtypes of Candida species in oral submucous"
		fibrosis patients and healthy individuals. METHODS:   The study comprised 30
		clinically-diagnosed and -staged oral submucous fibrosis patients aged
		"20-40 years, and 20 age- and sex-matched controls. Buccal mucosa was sampled by"
		sterile swab technique. Each sample was inoculated on Sabouraud's dextrose agar
		and CHROMagar culture media. Candida species identification was done using the
		KB006 Candida identification kit. RESULTS:   Eleven (36.67%) cases in the study
		"group, and two (10%) cases in the control group, yielded Candida on culture. The"
		value of CFU/mL increased with an increased duration of betel quid chewing habit.
		All Candida-positive oral submucous fibrosis patients complained of a burning
		sensation. Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis were the most common species
		in the oral submucous fibrosis cases. Candida dubliniensis was isolated in both
		the study and control groups. CONCLUSIONS:   Our observations in this study
		affirm that oral submucous fibrosis favors the colonization of Candida. Mucosal
		"alterations due to the underlying disease process or betel quid chewing, coupled"
		"with other factors, might lead to candidal colonization, even in the absence of"
		clinically-related mycotic manifestations.

AB	-	Severe pneumonia due to Candida tropicalis infection mainly occurs in
		immunosuppressed patients or those currently receiving broad-spectrum
		"antibiotics. Herein, we report a case of severe pneumonia caused due to C"
		tropicalis in an elderly patient. A 72-year-old man with a previous history of
		"hypertension, ischemic stroke, and facial paralysis sequelae treated with the"
		"botulinic toxin, was admitted to the hospital for dyspnea. Severe acute"
		respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) infection was negative. Computed
		tomography of the chest revealed bilateral consolidation with left predominance.
		"A bronchoalveolar lavage sample was sent to molecular biology, but no"
		"microorganisms were detected using a FilmArray respiratory panel. However,"
		"mamanocandidas test for candida was 166 pg/mL (positive), and fungal structures"
		were identified by the MALDI-TOF Biotyper mass spectrometry and attributed to C
		tropicalis. Antifungal therapy was started using caspofungin 75 mg as the initial
		"dose followed by 50 mg daily. After 10 days of treatment, ventilatory weaning was"
		"achieved. By day 14, the patient was decannulated from the tracheostomy. Oral"
		"antifungal treatment with voriconazole was continued, and he was discharged from"
		intensive care in good clinical condition. Severe pneumonia due to C tropicalis
		"might occur in specific cases, especially in those patients with risk factors,"
		and must thus be considered when approaching such cases.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Bloodstream infections due to Candida species are becoming a major
		cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. The spectrum of
		"candidemia has changed with the emergence of non-albicans Candida species,"
		especially among critically ill patients. METHODOLOGY: In a retrospective study
		"(July 2009 to December 2009) on candidemia, various Candida species isolated from"
		blood cultures were characterized and studied along with the determination of
		"their antifungal susceptibility to amphotericin B, itraconazole, and fluconazole"
		by Etest. Probable risk factors for patients in the intensive care unit (ICU)
		"presenting with candidemia were also analyzed. RESULTS: During the study period,"
		"a total of 4651 samples were received, out of which 468 samples (10.06%) were"
		positive for growth of organisms: 441 (94.20%) aerobic bacterial pathogens and 27
		(5.79%) Candida species. The most common Candida spp. isolate was C. tropicalis
		"(40.8%) followed by C. albicans (29.6%), C. glabrata (18.5%) and others (11.1%)."
		"Out of the 27 Candida strains, 24 (88.9%) were isolated from patients treated in"
		"the ICU. Among these, association of previous use of broad-spectrum antibiotics"
		in 22 patients (91.6%) and central line catheter insertion in 20 patients (83.3%)
		were found to be statistically significant as compared to non-candidemia patients
		(p <0.05). Antifungal susceptibility testing of the isolates revealed a lower
		level of drug resistance to amphotericin B (18.5% of the isolates) versus 77.8%
		"resistance to fluconazole. CONCLUSION: Rapid changes in the rate of infection,"
		"potential risk factors, and emergence of non-albicans Candida demand continued"
		surveillance of this serious bloodstream fungal infection.

		to identify pathogenic Candida species. RESULTS: Candida infection was seen in
		47% of patients with oral leukoplakia. Candida albicans (94.7%) was the most
		common Candida species followed by Candida tropicalis (5.3%). Majority of
		Candida-infected lesions were seen in the buccal mucosa region. Alteration of
		"taste (p = 0.021), having other oral lesions (p = 0.008), angular cheilitis"
		(p = 0.024) and periodontitis (p = 0.041) showed a significant association with
		Candida-associated leukoplakia. Increasing age showed a significant tendency for
		Candida infection (p = 0.020). Smoking (p = 0.026) and betel-quid chewing
		"(p = 0.006) were also found to be significantly associated, although alcohol"
		consumption alone did not show a significant association. Oral leukoplakia
		"patients who had all three habits: alcohol consumption, smoking and betel-quid"
		chewing had a significant association with Candida infection (p = 0.004).
		"CONCLUSIONS: Patients who had a combination of risk factors: smoking, betel-quid"
		chewing and alcohol consumption were seen to have a significant association with
		Candida infection. Further betel-quid chewing alone and smoking singly was also
		significantly associated with Candida infection in oral leukoplakia.

		change in spectrum of agents and antifungal susceptibility.
PG	-	110-116
LID	-	10.4103/ijmm.IJMM_20_112 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: Candidaemia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality of hospitalised
		"patients, especially in developing countries. This study was conducted to monitor"
		any change in species distribution and antifungal susceptibility pattern of
		Candida species causing candidaemia over the last 20 years. MATERIALS AND
		METHODS: The candidaemia cases reported during January 1999 and December 2018 at
		our centre were reviewed. The yeasts were identified by phenotypic characters
		(during 1999-2014) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation-time of flight
		mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) (during 2014-2018). Antifungal susceptibility
		testing (AFST) was performed in accordance with the Clinical and Laboratory
		"Standards Institute guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 602,963 blood samples from"
		patients with suspected sepsis were processed. Candidaemia was diagnosed in 7927
		(1.31%) cases. The frequency of cases rose significantly (P = 0.000) in the last
		"quarter of the study. Candida tropicalis (40.1%) was the most common species,"
		"followed by Candida albicans (15.2%), Wickerhamomyces anomalus (13.1%), Candida"
		"krusei (6.6%), Candida parapsilosis (4.7%) and others. Rare species such as"
		"Candida auris, Candida lambica, Candida orthopsilosis, Candida vishwanathii were"
		identified after the introduction of MALDI-TOF. The minimum inhibitory
		concentrations of amphotericin B rose significantly from the first to last
		quarter (0.5%-4.9%). Fluconazole resistance was fairly constant at 7.4%-8.8%.
		CONCLUSION: Local epidemiology of candidaemia at our centre was distinct
		regarding prevalence and change of spectrum of species. The identification of
		rare species was possible after the introduction of MALDI-TOF. With the emergence
		"of multidrug-resistant C. auris and resistance in other species, routine AFST has"
		become imperative.

		head and neck area.
PG	-	e52-7
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To investigate oral Candida strain diversity in patients receiving
		radiation therapy for head and neck cancer compared to controls by conventional
		"procedures, including cultivation of imprint samples on chromogenic medium and"
		subsequent identification using Analytical Profile Index testing. METHOD AND
		MATERIALS: Twenty-two irradiated patients aged 18 to 55 years were recruited from
		"the Maxillofacial Prosthetic Service, Mahidol University. Concomitantly, 22"
		healthy individuals whose age and sex matched that of the patient group were
		selected for a control group. RESULTS: All patients studied were Candida carriers
		and were predominantly infected with Candida albicans (86.36%). Besides C
		"albicans, other yeasts colonizing the oral cavity of these patients were C"
		"glabrata, C krusei, and C tropicalis. Candida carriage was found relatively less"
		"frequently (45.45%) in control subjects. However, C albicans was still the"
		predominant species detected. No C dubliniensis was found in either group.
		CONCLUSION: Head and neck cancer patients who had received radiotherapy had a
		"high prevalence of Candida colonization in the oral cavity. Consequently,"
		prophylaxis to reduce Candida infection in these patients is required. This may
		improve the quality of life for patients who receive irradiation treatment for
		malignant cancer.

LID	-	10.3109/13693780802709081 [doi]
AB	-	Abstract We conducted a four-year (2003-2006) retrospective study of yeasts
		recovered in a hospital laboratory in the centre of Portugal to evaluate the
		epidemiology of yeast infections. Clinical isolates and data were gathered from
		751 patients corresponding to 906 episodes of yeast infection. The isolates were
		"first identified using classical and commercial methods, routinely employed at"
		the hospital laboratory. We then re-identified the same isolates using RFLP of
		the ITS 5.8S rRNA gene and sequence of the D1/D2 domain of the 26S rRNA gene.
		Candida parapsilosis isolates were re-identified using the Ban I digestion of the
		SADH gene. C. albicans was the most frequently isolated of the yeasts found in
		"the analysed specimens, with an overall incidence of 69.6% and then in decreasing"
		"order, C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis and C. krusei. C. parapsilosis"
		"was most frequently recovered from younger patients, decreasing with age, while"
		C. glabrata occurrence increased with age. We found an increased number of cases
		"of fungemia per 100,000 people per year, reaching a maximum of 4.4 during 2006."

PG	-	955-9
AB	-	Candida species have emerged as important pathogens in human infection. Although
		"a variety of deep-seated candidal infections have been reported, Candida"
		spondylitis has rarely been described. One patient with candida tropicalis
		"spondylitis L I and L II in combination with candida coxitis is presented, and"
		the 31 adult cases with vertebral involvement previously reported are reviewed.
		Candida spondylitis is noted as a simultaneous occurrence or late manifestation
		of hematogenously disseminated candidiasis. Spondylitis may not be prevented by a
		course of Amphotericin B adequate to control the acute episode of disseminated
		"candidiasis, particularly in immune suppressed patients. Spondylitis does not"
		present as a postoperative wound infection. The insidious progression of
		"infection, the nonspecificity of laboratory data, and the failure to recognise"
		Candida as a potential pathogen may lead to diagnostic delay. Diagnosis can be
		made by either open biopsy or CT controlled needle aspiration. Successful
		therapeutic regimes have employed combinations of antifungal therapy
		(Amphotericin B or fluconazole) with radical surgical debridement. Ventral and
		facultatively dorsal instrumentation is required to stabilize the spine. It is
		anticipated that the spondylitis will become a more commonly recognised
		manifestation of hematogenously disseminated candidiasis. A increasing
		significance of candida species as etiologic agents of infection immune
		compromised humans has been recognised in the recent years. In those patients
		"whom an antecedent Candida septicaemia was documented, a striking delay of 3.3"
		months was found between the septicaemia and the onset of symptoms as well as the
		time of diagnosis.

PG	-	65-8
AB	-	The objective of this study was to characterize the epidemiology of candidemia in
		"cancer patients in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. An 18-month survey of"
		fungemia in patients with cancer was undertaken in three Hospitals in Rio de
		"Janeiro. Forty-three episodes of candidemia were identified in 43 patients, 43 of"
		which were episodes of candidemia; in ten case the strains were not available for
		further identification of species and were excluded from this analysis. The
		"overall distribution of fungi causing fungemia was: Candida albicans (5), Candida"
		"tropicalis (16), Candida parapsilosis (6), Candida guilliermondii (4), Candida"
		lusitaniae (1) and Candida stellatoidea (1). Antifungal prophylaxis had been
		administered before the episode of fungemia in only six patients (18.2%): oral
		"itraconazole in three patients and oral nistatin, low dose intravenous"
		amphotericin B and oral fluconazole in one patient each. There was no difference
		"in the presence of risk factors, clinical characteristics or in the outcome"
		"between albicans and non-albicans species, nor between Candida tropicalis and"
		other non-albicans species. There was a clear predominance of non-albicans
		"species, regardless of the underlying disease, antifungal prophylaxis or the"
		presence of neutropenia.

		retrospectively reviewed the medical charts of all 4445 neonatal intensive care
		unit (NICU) admissions in the past 10 years and detected 49 neonates with AFS. We
		then compared their data with those of 49 matched control neonates who did not
		"have AFS. The following details were collected: gestational, perinatal and"
		neonatal courses; bacterial sepsis; antibacterial therapy; laboratory and imaging
		investigations; and antifungal therapy and its complications. RESULTS: The
		incidence of AFS was.4 to 2 cases per 1000 live-births and 3.8% to 12.9% of very
		"low birth weight (VLBW) infants. Compared with 1989 through 1992, between 1993"
		and 1995 the rate of AFS in VLBW neonates significantly increased (3. 8%-5.6% -->
		"9.6%-12.9%), along with a significant increase of NICU admission rate (369-410"
		"--> 496-510 admissions/year). Compared with controls, AFS neonates had"
		"significantly longer hospitalizations, higher rates of mechanical ventilation,"
		"umbilical vein catheterization, and previous treatment with broad-spectrum"
		"antibacterial agents (amikacin, vancomycin, ceftazidime, or imipenem). At the"
		"onset of AFS, 42.8% of patients had hyperthermia and 40.9% had normal white blood"
		"cell count. Causative fungi were as follows: Candida albicans-42.8% of cases,"
		"Candida parapsilosis-26.5%, and Candida tropicalis-20.4%. Fungal dissemination"
		"was rare, complications of antifungal therapy were infrequent, and no deaths"
		"occurred. CONCLUSIONS: First, non-albicans Candida have become more frequent in"
		"neonatal AFS. Second, mechanical ventilation and antibacterial agents are"
		"significant risk factors for AFS. Third, hyperthermia is a frequent presenting"
		"sign of AFS. Fourth, a normal white blood cell count does not rule out AFS."
		"Fifth, meningeal involvement in neonatal AFS should be ruled out before"
		"initiation of antifungal therapy. Sixth, the policy of empiric antifungal therapy"
		"for AFS should be considered on an individual NICU basis.newborn infant, fungal"
		"sepsis, clinical signs, risk factors."

		oral candidosis in the course of HIV infection.
PG	-	691-9
AB	-	"The objective of this case-control study, conducted in a large Italian university"
		"hospital over a 12-month period, was to evaluate the risk factors associated with"
		the emergence of azole resistant oral candidosis in 64 Human Immunodeficiency
		Virus (HIV) infected patients. A swab was obtained from each patient by brushing
		"candidal lesions. Candida albicans was isolated in 41 patients (64%), Candida"
		"glabrata in ten (16%), Candida krusei in five (8%), Candida kefyr in two (3%),"
		"Candida tropicalis in two (3%), and Candida lipolytica and Candida guilliermondii"
		"in one case, respectively. Two patients suffered a double infection i.e. C."
		"albicans+C. krusei and C. albicans+C. glabrata, respectively. Candida species"
		"were tested in vitro for their susceptibility to ketoconazole, fluconazole,"
		itraconazole and amphotericin B. MICs of the four antifungal drugs were obtained
		for each yeast using a microdilution broth method developed in our laboratory.
		Twenty four (37%) of the isolated strains were resistant both to itraconazole and
		"fluconazole, five (8%) to fluconazole alone, and two (3%) to ketoconazole alone,"
		while none of the isolated strains was resistant to amphotericin B. Patients with
		oral candidosis caused by a strain resistant to one or more azole drug were
		compared to control patients with azole-susceptible oral candidosis. On
		"univariate analysis, more than five episodes of oral candidosis in the last year"
		"(P = 0.01), previous use of azole therapy (P = 0.001), C2-3 category of HIV"
		infection (P = 0.01) and low number of circulating CD4+ T-cells (P = 0.03) were
		significantly associated with an increased risk for the development of azole
		"resistance. However, previous use of azole therapy was the only factor selected"
		by a stepwise logistic regression analysis which was independently associated
		with the isolation of azole resistant strains (P = 0.003). Our findings indicate
		"that, in view of the potential risk for the emergence and selection of azole"
		"resistant strains of Candida in patients with AIDS, it is important to carefully"
		choose the antifungal drug for the therapy of mild fungal infections after
		evaluation of the in-vitro susceptibility of the isolated strains.

TI	-	PFGE-based epidemiological study of an outbreak of Candida tropicalis candiduria:
		the importance of medical waste as a reservoir of nosocomial infection.
PG	-	263-7
AB	-	"Between November 2002 and March 2003, an outbreak of candiduria occurred in the"
		surgical intensive care unit (SICU) of a university-affiliated hospital in South
		Korea. This outbreak affected 34 patients and was caused by Candida tropicalis.
		"To determine the source of the epidemic and the risk factors, surveillance"
		"cultures from the SICU, genotyping of Candida isolates by pulsed-field gel"
		"electrophoresis (PFGE), and a case-control study were performed. The surveillance"
		cultures revealed that 6 environmental samples related to the urine disposal
		route were positive for C. tropicalis. The PFGE analysis of genomic DNA
		demonstrated identical band patterns for all of the C. tropicalis isolates
		obtained from SICU patients and the 6 environmental samples during the outbreak
		"period, while epidemiologically unrelated strains showed unique PFGE band"
		"patterns. Although no risk factors were identified by the case-control study,"
		this epidemiological investigation involving the use of molecular techniques
		suggests that improper disposal of infectious medical waste led to the
		cross-transmission of a single clone that was responsible for the outbreak of C.
		tropicalis candiduria in this SICU. After implementing a better urine disposal
		"system and thorough hand washing procedures, no further clusters of candiduria"
		were detected in the SICU.

TI	-	Invasive fungal infections in Chile: a multicenter study of fungal prevalence and
		susceptibility during a 1-year period.
PG	-	333-9
AB	-	During the first year of an ongoing surveillance program of invasive fungal
		infections (IFI) a total of 130 patients (56% male) with fungal strains isolated
		from blood and other sterile sites were reported from 13 hospitals in Chile.
		"Significant yeast isolates were obtained from 118 patients, and molds affected 12"
		"patients. The main patient groups affected were neonates, children less than 1"
		year old and adults aged 50-79 years. All fungal bloodstream infections (BSI)
		were due to yeasts; 79 patients (61%) were affected. The main risk factors
		"recorded were antibiotic therapy (76%), stay in the intensive care unit (ICU)"
		(70%) and presence of a central venous catheter (65%). Nosocomial infections were
		"represented in 83.5% of BSI. Overall, Candida albicans (40.8%), C. parapsilosis"
		"(13.1%), C. tropicalis (10%) and Cryptococcus neoformans (10%) were the most"
		common species. Aspergillus fumigatus (3.1%) was the most frequent mold. C.
		"albicans (48.1%) and C. parapsilosis (17.7%), were the most frequent agents"
		"recovered from blood. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Trichosporon mucoides, two"
		"emerging pathogens, were also isolated. All yeasts tested were susceptible to"
		amphotericin B with minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) < or = 1 microg/ml.
		Resistance to itraconazole (MIC > or = 1 microg/ml) and fluconazole (MIC > or =
		"64 microg/ml) was observed in 4 and 6% of cases, respectively. C. glabrata was"
		"the least susceptible species, with 50% of isolates resistant to itraconazole and"
		"33% resistant to fluconazole, with one strain showing combined resistance."
		Reduction of BSI requires greater adherence to hand-washing and related infection
		control guidelines.

PG	-	4158-63
LID	-	10.1128/JCM.05474-11 [doi]
AB	-	Data on fungemia epidemiology and antifungal susceptibility of isolates from
		"children are scarce, leading frequently to pediatric empirical treatment based on"
		available adult data. The present study was designed to update the
		"epidemiological, mycological, and in vitro susceptibility data on fungal isolates"
		from children with fungemia in Spain. All fungemia episodes were identified
		prospectively by blood culture over 13 months at 30 hospitals. Tests of
		"susceptibility to amphotericin B, flucytosine, fluconazole, itraconazole,"
		"posaconazole, voriconazole, anidulafungin, caspofungin, and micafungin were"
		performed at participant institutions by a microdilution colorimetric method. New
		"species-specific clinical breakpoints for fluconazole, voriconazole, and"
		echinocandins were also applied. A total of 203 episodes of fungemia in 200
		children were identified. A higher proportion of fungal isolates was from general
		"wards than intensive care units (ICU). Candida parapsilosis (46.8%), Candida"
		"albicans (36.5%), Candida tropicalis (5.9%), Candida glabrata (3.9%), and Candida"
		guilliermondii (2.5%) were the leading species. C. parapsilosis was the
		predominant species except in neonates. C. albicans was the most frequent in
		"neonatal ICU settings (51.9%). Intravascular catheter (79.3%), surgery (35%),"
		"prematurity (30%), and neutropenia (11%) were the most frequent predisposing"
		factors. Most Candida isolates (95.1%) were susceptible to all antifungals. When
		"the new species-specific clinical breakpoints were applied, all C. parapsilosis"
		"isolates were susceptible to echinocandins except one, which was micafungin"
		resistant. This is the largest published series of fungemia episodes in the
		"pediatric setting. C. parapsilosis is the most prevalent species in Spain,"
		followed by C. albicans and C. tropicalis. Resistance to azole and echinocandin
		agents is extremely rare among Candida species. The fluconazole resistance rate
		in Spain has decreased in the last 10 years.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: The aim of our study was to evaluate the concordance between the
		two antifungal susceptibility testing of Candida sp. isolates using agar
		diffusion method: Neo-Sensitabs(®) tablets and Bio-Rad(®) disks. MATERIALS AND
		METHODS: This is a prospective study conducted in the Laboratory of Parasitology
		and Mycology of the Mohammed V military teaching hospital from February to August
		"2012. Upon receiving blood cultures and peripheral sites samples, the"
		identification of Candida isolates performed using routine phenotypic standard
		tests and the realization of the antifungal susceptibility was carried out on
		Neo-sensitabs(®) tablets and Bio-Rad(®) disks. RESULTS: A total of 38 Candida
		"strains were isolated: 15 C. albicans (39%), 13 C. glabrata (34%), 5 C."
		"tropicalis (13%), 4 C. krusei (11%) and 1 C. dubliniensis (3%). There were no"
		significant difference (P>0.05) in susceptibility rate between both methods for
		all antifungal agents tested except for 5-fluorocytosine. The concordance
		"percentage between two methods was 100% for amphotericin B, 97.4% for"
		"fluconazole, 94.7% for voriconazole and 73% for 5-fluorocytosine. CONCLUSION:"
		"Both methods are easy to perform, rapid and cost effective. Our results showed"
		the best agreement between the two methods for testing the susceptibility of
		"Candida isolates to amphotericin B, fluconazole and voriconazole while for the"
		"5-fluorocytosine, the concordance rate was low."

TI	-	Evaluation of blood stream infections by Candida in three tertiary hospitals in
		"Salvador, Brazil: a case-control study."
PG	-	36-40
AB	-	Invasive infections caused by Candida spp. are an important problem in
		immunocompromised patients. There is scarce data on the epidemiology of blood
		"stream candidiasis in Salvador, Brazil. This study evaluates the risk factors"
		"associated with candidemia, among patients admitted to three tertiary, private"
		"hospitals, in Salvador, Brazil. We conducted a case-control, retrospective study"
		to compare patients with diagnosis of candidemia in three different tertiary
		"hospitals in Salvador, Brazil. Patients were matched for nosocomial, acquired"
		"infections, according to the causal agent: cases were defined by positive blood"
		cultures for Candida species. Controls were those patients who had a diagnosis of
		"systemic bacterial infection, with a positive blood culture to any bacteria,"
		within the same time period (+/- 30 days) of case identification. The groups were
		compared for the main known risk factors for candidemia and for mortality rates.
		"A hundred thirty-eight patients were identified. Among the 69 cases, only 14 were"
		diagnosed as infected by Candida albicans. Candida species were defined in only
		"eight cultures: C. tropicalis (4 cases), C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, C."
		"guillermondi, C. formata (1 case each). The main risk factors, identified in a"
		"univariate analysis, were: presence of a central venous catheter (CVC), use of"
		"parenteral nutrition support (PNS), previous exposure to antibiotics, and chronic"
		"renal failure (CRF). No association was detected with surgical procedures,"
		"diabetes mellitus, neutropenia or malignancies. Patients were more likely to die"
		"during the hospitalization period, but the rates of death caused by the"
		infections were similar for cases and controls. The length of hospitalization was
		"similar for both groups, as well as the time for a positive blood culture. Blood"
		"stream infection by Candida spp. is associated with CVC, PNS, previous use of"
		"antibiotics, and CRF. The higher mortality rate for cases probably better"
		"reflects the severity of the underlying diseases, than as a direct consequence of"
		Candidemia.

PG	-	970-80
LID	-	10.1002/ppul.21082 [doi]
AB	-	Pertussis carries a high risk of mortality in very young infants. The mechanism
		of refractory cardio-respiratory failure is complex and not clearly delineated.
		We aimed to examine the clinico-pathological features and suggest how they may be
		"related to outcome, by multi-center review of clinical records and post-mortem"
		findings of 10 patients with fulminant pertussis (FP). All cases were less than 8
		"weeks of age, and required ventilation for worsening respiratory symptoms and"
		inotropic support for severe hemodynamic compromise. All died or underwent extra
		corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) within 1 week. All had increased leukocyte
		counts (from 54 to 132 x 10(9)/L) with prominent neutrophilia in 9/10. The
		post-mortem demonstrated necrotizing bronchitis and bronchiolitis with extensive
		areas of necrosis of the alveolar epithelium. Hyaline membranes were present in
		those cases with viral co-infection. Pulmonary blood vessels were filled with
		"leukocytes without well-organized thrombi. Immunodepletion of the thymus, spleen,"
		and lymph nodes was a common feature. Other organisms were isolated as follows;
		"2/10 cases Para influenza type 3, 2/10 Moraxella catarrhalis, 1/10 each with"
		"respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a coliform organism, methicillin-resistant"
		"Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Haemophilus influenzae, Stenotrophomonas"
		"maltophilia, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), and candida"
		tropicalis. We postulate that severe hypoxemia and intractable cardiac failure
		"may be due to the effects of pertussis toxin, necrotizing bronchiolitis,"
		"extensive damage to the alveolar epithelium, tenacious airway secretions, and"
		"possibly leukostasis with activation of the immunological cascade, all"
		contributing to increased pulmonary vascular resistance. Cellular apoptosis
		appeared to underlay much of these changes. The secondary immuno-compromise may
		facilitate co-infection.

TI	-	Molecular and phenotypic analysis of Candida dubliniensis: a recently identified
		species linked with oral candidosis in HIV-infected and AIDS patients.
PG	-	S96-101
AB	-	"The discovery and characterisation of a novel species of Candida, termed Candida"
		"dubliniensis, associated with oral candidosis in HIV-infected individuals is"
		described. These organisms share several phenotypic characteristics in common
		"with Candida albicans and Candida stellatoidea, including the ability to produce"
		"germ tubes and chlamydospores. However, in contrast to these latter two species,"
		"C. dubliniensis isolates produce abundant chlamydospores, which are often"
		"arranged in contiguous pairs, triplets and other multiples suspended from a"
		single suspensor cell. They belong to C. albicans serotype A and exhibit atypical
		substrate assimilation profiles. Genomic DNA fingerprinting analysis with the C.
		albicans-specific probe 27A and five different oligonucleotide probes consisting
		"of short repeat sequence-containing motifs, demonstrated that C. dubliniensis has"
		a distinct genomic organisation relative to C. albicans and C. stellatoidea. This
		was confirmed by karyotype analysis and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)
		analysis. Comparison of 500 bp of the V3 variable region of the large ribosomal
		subunit genes from 14 separate C. dubliniensis isolates and the corresponding
		"sequences from C. albicans, C. stellatoidea, C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, C."
		"parapsilosis, C. kefyr and C. krusei demonstrated that the C. dubliniensis"
		"isolates formed a homogenous cluster (100% similarity), representing a discrete"
		taxon within the genus Candida that was significantly different from the other
		species analysed.

AB	-	RATIONALE: Bacterial and fungal infections in Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19)
		patients have been inadequately investigated and reported thus far. The safety
		profile of tocilizumab (TCZ) administration in candidemia patient still
		debatable. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 54 year-old woman presenting with weakness on the
		"left side of her body was diagnosed with COVID-19. After 7 days of admission, her"
		condition worsened and developed respiratory distress and was having respiratory
		distress despite standard treatment. DIAGNOSES: Acute respiratory distress
		"syndrome (ARDS) in COVID 19 was diagnoses based on real time-PCR swab,"
		deterioration of PaO2/FiO2 and increased of acute phase reactants. INTERVENTIONS:
		Anti Interleukin-6 (IL-6) was considered to tackle her inflammatory condition.
		"Prior to TCZ administration, blood culture was performed and the result came with"
		Candida tropicalis in the absence of bacterial growth. OUTCOMES: No major
		complications associated with intravenous antifungal or TCZ occurred. After
		"40 days of hospitalization, the patient's clinical condition improved and was"
		finally discharged. LESSONS: This case underscores the safety profile of giving
		TCZ in candidemia as a secondary infection in severe COVID-19 patient.

PG	-	30-40
AB	-	"PURPOSE: Candida endocarditis are rare, with a poor prognosis. Actually, the"
		principal problem concerns the growing incidence of nosocomial fungal infections.
		The objective of the present investigation is to assess a disease which risks
		becoming more pronounced in the future. METHODS: We have collected observations
		of Candida sp. endocarditis between 1985 to 1997 from three French university
		hospitals. RESULTS: Twelve of the observations fit the Duke criteria of acute
		"endocarditis. Patients were eight men and four women, with a mean age of 46"
		"years. An immunodepression was found in seven cases, and four patients were"
		active drug addicts. Six had an underlying heart disease at risk to acute
		"endocarditis. Candidemia risk factors were found in nine cases, with an average"
		of 2.7 risk factors per patient. The fungal agents detected were Candida albicans
		"(eight cases), C. tropicalis (one case), C. parapsilosis (two cases), and C."
		"glabrata (one case). These vegetations were on aortic (seven cases), mitral"
		"(three cases), tricuspid valves (two cases) or in other areas (three cases), with"
		"multiple localizations (two cases). In three observations, vegetations were"
		"associated with myocardium abscesses. Eight patients had embolic complications,"
		two had a cardiac insufficiency leading to death. The treatment was medical in
		all of the cases and combined with a surgical treatment in ten cases. The surgery
		"was performed, on an average, 17 days after diagnosis, allowing seven surviving"
		"patients. Among them, five received a secondary prophylaxis and no recurrence was"
		"recorded. CONCLUSIONS: Prognosis remains severe because of the voluminous,"
		"friable and necrotic vegetations, which favor embolic migrations and which are"
		"not easily accessible to antifungals, which penetrate poorly into these"
		vegetations. Therapy is based on a medical treatment combined with a valve
		"replacement which needs to be done early on, and is followed by a relapse"
		prevention which can occur several years after the initial episode.

PG	-	584-8
AB	-	JUSTIFICATION: Candiduria is increasingly frequent among patients admitted to
		intensive care units but its significance remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: Search for
		eventual correlation between quantitative candiduria and known risk factors for
		invasive candidiasis. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A
		four-month study was conducted in 162 patients hospitalized in the intensive care
		unit for more than 72 hours. All patients underwent a weekly research of
		candiduria added to sampling from different body sites to determine the Pittet
		Candida colonization index. RESULTS: Candiduria has been proved in 56 cases
		(34%). It was superior or equal to 10(4) UFC/ml among 28 patients (50%). Candida
		"tropicalis, Candida glabrata and Candida albicans has been isolated in 41, 22 and"
		20% respectively. All patients had at least one major and two minor risk factors
		for Candida infection. Six patients (10%) developed invasive candidiasis. The
		global mortality rate was at 52%. Pittet colonization index was significantly
		different between patients with candiduria and those with invasive candidiasis
		(p=0.01). There was a statistically significant correlation between candiduria
		superior or equal to 10(4) UFC/ml and Pittet colonization index superior or equal
		to 0.5 (p=0.01). CONCLUSION: Candiduria superior or equal to 10(4) UFC/ml
		associated with risk factors may predict invasive candidiasis in critically ill
		patients.

AB	-	Internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) sequencing is the most extensively used
		technology for accurate molecular identification of fungal pathogens in clinical
		"microbiology laboratories. Intra-genomic ITS sequence heterogeneity, which makes"
		"fungal identification based on direct sequencing of PCR products difficult, has"
		rarely been reported in pathogenic fungi. During the process of performing ITS
		"sequencing on 71 yeast strains isolated from various clinical specimens, direct"
		sequencing of the PCR products showed ambiguous sequences in six of them. After
		"cloning the PCR products into plasmids for sequencing, interpretable sequencing"
		"electropherograms could be obtained. For each of the six isolates, 10-49 clones"
		were selected for sequencing and two to seven intra-genomic ITS copies were
		detected. The identities of these six isolates were confirmed to be Candida
		"glabrata (n=2), Pichia (Candida) norvegensis (n=2), Candida tropicalis (n=1) and"
		Saccharomyces cerevisiae (n=1). Multiple sequence alignment revealed that one to
		"four intra-genomic ITS polymorphic sites were present in the six isolates, and"
		all these polymorphic sites were located in the ITS1 and/or ITS2 regions. We
		report and describe the first evidence of intra-genomic ITS sequence
		"heterogeneity in four different pathogenic yeasts, which occurred exclusively in"
		the ITS1 and ITS2 spacer regions for the six isolates in this study.

TI	-	Evaluating the effect of soft lining materials on the growth of yeast.
PG	-	404-9
AB	-	STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Soft lining materials continue to have a place in clinical
		"removable prosthodontics. However, there is an increased probability of yeast"
		colonization on soft lining materials. PURPOSE: This study (1) assessed a method
		of evaluating the effect of long-term soft lining materials on the growth of
		yeast and (2) investigated the effect five soft lining materials had on the
		"growth of three species of yeast. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Coe Supersoft, Novus, and"
		three experimental soft lining materials were investigated together with Candida
		"albicans, Candida tropicalis, and Issatchenkia orientalis (formerly Candida"
		krusei) yeasts. Strips of soft lining material incubated on blood agar plates
		were examined for inhibition of the growth of yeast. Soft lining materials soaked
		in sterile trypticase soya broth or water were inoculated with yeast and
		incubated. The change in colony forming units per milliliter from the initial
		load of yeast at 3 days was measured. Statistical analysis was performed with an
		independent paired Student t test. RESULTS: Inhibition of yeast growth occurred
		for two soft lining materials. Despite the presence of sufficient viable
		"organisms, differences between the initial load of yeast and the 3-day results"
		"were mostly small, both for the test and control groups, suggesting that the"
		material does not support the growth of the tested yeast during this period.
		CONCLUSIONS: The often described increased prevalence of yeast associated with
		soft lining materials in the oral environment is likely related to readily
		available nutrients in the mouth and the difficulty in maintaining and cleaning
		these materials.

LID	-	e27205
AB	-	"RATIONALE: Studies on Candida infections in the central nervous system,"
		especially in infants and young children that did or did not have postoperative
		"surgery, are rarely reported. Thus far, intrathecal (i.t.) amphotericin B (AmB)"
		is not routinely recommended as a therapy for Candida meningitis. We report the
		first case of Candida meningitis in an infant who underwent abdominal surgery and
		was successfully treated with i.t. and intravenous (i.v.) AmB in the mainland of
		China. PATIENT CONCERNS: Candida meningitis was confirmed by culture and
		immunoserological tests in a 1-day-old girl after surgery. She was treated with
		"fluconazole for 1 month, but the patient's symptoms showed no improvement."
		"DIAGNOSES: After surgery, the infant started having recurrent attacks of fever,"
		and laboratory tests of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed antigens of
		Candida tropicalis. CSF tests revealed a high total protein level and a low
		glucose level. She was diagnosed with a secondary Candida meningitis.
		"INTERVENTIONS: After azole therapy failure, intrathecal and intravenous AmB"
		therapy were used as rescue therapies. OUTCOMES: After nearly 2 months of AmB
		"treatment, all repeat CSF cultures were negative, the infant was deemed stable"
		"and was discharged home, and she continued taking voriconazole orally as an"
		outpatient. LESSONS: The combination of i.t. and i.v. administration of AmB can
		provide a safe and effective alternative to managing this rare but severe
		disease.

AB	-	Superficial fungal diseases that affect the skin and its appendages are
		frequently seen in basic triage and in dermatology services. These diseases are
		distributed in Venezuela with an incidence of 92.9%. The aim of this study was to
		determine the genera and species that cause dermatomycoses in residents of
		"Anzoátegui state, Venezuela, during the period 2002-2012. A total of 4257"
		"patients with a presumptive diagnosis of superficial mycoses were studied, with"
		ages from 7 months to 79 years. The overall prevalence was 30.9%. The most
		frequent were dermatophytosis (44.7%). M. canis produced 148 cases of tinea
		"capitis. Three dermatophytic agents represented 95% of all cases, with a"
		significant predominance of T. mentagrophytes with 50%. Candidosis occurred in
		"28.4%. C. albicans, and the C. parapsilosis complex, were responsible for 80% of"
		"the cases. The other species identified were C. tropicalis (n = 41, 11.0%), C."
		"glabrata (n = 10, 2.7%), C. guilliermondii (n = 6, 1.6%), C. krusei (n = 4,"
		"1.1%). Pityriasis versicolor occurred in 22.4% of the cases studied, and less"
		frequently were present onychomycosis produced by a non dermatophytic mold:
		"Fusarium oxysporum (n = 34, 65.4%), Aspergillus terreus (n=16, 30.8%) and"
		Scytalidium dimidiatum (n=2; 3.8%). Rare cases of Trichosporon onychomycosis
		(0.5%) and one case of black tinea were also found. Health education in the
		population is recommended to promote measures to prevent transmission of these
		fungi and prevent the spread of this silent public health problem.

		hematological malignancies.
PG	-	741-6
LID	-	10.1007/s10156-012-0412-9 [doi]
AB	-	Candida tropicalis is one of the most important Candida species causative of
		candidemia that is isolated from the blood of patients with hematological
		malignancies. Candidemia caused by C. tropicalis is known to be highly virulent
		in neutropenic patients. C. tropicalis has been shown to be favorably sensitive
		to azole agents in general. Here we discuss 5 cases of candidemia caused by C.
		"tropicalis in patients with hematological malignancies in our unit, and we note"
		"that 4 isolates were resistant to azole agents, including fluconazole,"
		"itraconazole, and voriconazole. In addition, 2 patients developed breakthrough"
		candidemia caused by C. tropicalis while receiving prophylaxis with azole agents.
		"Interestingly, 2 of the 4 patients with azole-resistant C. tropicalis isolates"
		had never received any antifungal drugs. We also examined the susceptibilities of
		"C. tropicalis to antifungal agents, using 39 non-blood isolates detected from"
		"2003 to 2009. Around 40 % of the isolates were resistant to azole agents, and all"
		of them were highly sensitive to amphotericin B and micafungin. The resistance to
		"azoles was not associated with previous exposure to those agents. In our unit, 2"
		of the 4 cases of candidemia caused by azole-resistant C. tropicalis resulted in
		a poor prognosis. These findings suggested that empirical therapeutic strategies
		for candidemia should be modified based on the local antifungal resistance
		pattern.

PG	-	554-565
LID	-	10.3290/j.qi.a44630 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To assess the relationship between the development of denture-related
		"stomatitis (DRS) and the identification of commonly isolated yeast species, and"
		to evaluate various predisposing factors in Saudi participants wearing new
		removable dental prostheses. METHOD AND MATERIALS: A total of 75 edentulous male
		"participants were recruited, and 64 patients finished the present case-series."
		All participants received new conventional complete dentures. Colonization of
		"Candida species was assessed, and species were identified by means of the VITEK 2"
		(bioMérieux) laboratory components. RESULTS: The most prevalent type of Candida
		"at baseline was C albicans, followed by non-C albicans species (C glabrata)."
		Counts of Candida species significantly increased from the day of insertion to
		"the first month (P < . 05), but there were no significant changes between the"
		"first and second month (P > . 05). On the day of insertion, C tropicalis, C"
		"dubliniensis, and C krusei were extracted from few subjects only, with no"
		significant changes over the first and second month (P > .05). Patients revealing
		habits of sleeping with their dentures were found to frequently suffer from DRS;
		"development of the latter was rapid, and mixed Candida biofilms (with high CFU/mL"
		"counts), along with inadequate oral and denture hygiene, turned out to be"
		contributing factors (P < .05). CONCLUSION: DRS can develop faster than
		"previously reported, even with new dentures; continued denture wearing and poor"
		cleaning of dentures revealed a considerable impact on DRS onset. In the present
		"cohort, C albicans was the most identified kind of yeast, and was followed by C"
		glabrata infection in cases with DRS.

		in patients with hematological malignancies in the era of newer antifungal
		agents.
PG	-	197-206
LID	-	10.1093/mmy/myx038 [doi]
AB	-	Although yeast bloodstream infections (BSIs) are increasingly being reported in
		"patients with hematological malignancies undergoing antifungal therapy, clinical"
		information regarding breakthrough infections is scarce. The aim of this study
		was to determine the risk factors for and clinical outcomes of breakthrough yeast
		BSIs in patients with hematological malignancies in the era of newer antifungal
		"agents. Between 2011 and 2014, all consecutive patients with hematological"
		malignancies who developed yeast BSIs were included in a case-control study
		wherein breakthrough infections (cases) and de novo infections (controls) were
		"compared. Of 49 patients with yeast BSIs, 21 (43%) met the criteria for"
		breakthrough infections. The proportions of Candida krusei and Candida tropicalis
		"in the cases and controls were significantly different (32% [7/22] vs. 3% [1/29],"
		"P = .015; 5% [1/22] vs. 38% [11/29], P = .007, respectively). Acute leukemia,"
		presence of a central venous catheter and neutropenia in the 3 days prior to BSI
		were significant risk factors for breakthrough infections. Six-week mortality
		rates was 33% [7/21] in the cases and 43% [12/28] in the controls (P = .564).
		Refractory neutropenia and the Pitt bacteremia score were independent predictors
		"of 6-week mortality. In conclusion, breakthrough infections accounted for a"
		significant proportion of yeast BSIs in patients with hematological malignancies.
		"However, these infections did not increase the risk of death by themselves. Our"
		"results suggest that current clinical management of breakthrough yeast BSIs,"
		which includes switching to a different antifungal class and prompt catheter
		removal is reasonable.

PG	-	47-53
AB	-	"AIM: To study the etiology, clinical manifestations, risk factors, and results of"
		treatment for candidemia (CE) in patients with blood system tumors. SUBJECTS AND
		METHODS: The investigation included the patients with CE and hemoblastoses
		"treated at the Hematology Research Center, Ministry of Health of the Russian"
		"Federation, in 2006 to 2012. The diagnosis of CE was established according to the"
		single isolation of Candida spp. from blood cultures and the presence of
		"infection symptoms. RESULTS: Over 7 years, CE was diagnosed in 57 patients aged"
		"17 to 77 years (median age 48 years). Among the patients with CE, there was a"
		preponderance of those with lymphomas (54%) and acute leukemias (30%). The
		"pathogens of CE were C. albicans (33%), C. guilliermondii (26%), C. parapsilosis"
		"(12%), C. krusei (8%), C. lusitaniae (5%), C. famata (4%), C. tropicalis (4%), C."
		"glabrata (4%), and C. pelliculosa (4%). The major risk factors were"
		"polychemotherapy (85%), granulocytopenia (63%), mucosal Candida spp. colonization"
		"(82%), the presence of central venous catheter (CVC) (97%), antibiotics (100%),"
		and glucocorticosteroids (70%). The infection occurred with the intake of an
		antifungal agent in 33% of the patients; 60% had concomitant infections of other
		etiology. Antifungal agents were given to 52 (91%) patients. Within 30 days after
		"CE diagnosis, 20 (35%) patients died; of them 12 (60%) patients showed tumor"
		progression concurrent with the infection. The cure rate for CE was significantly
		"higher in the use of echinocandin as a first-line drug (92%), in complete or"
		"partial remission in hemoblastosis (90%), CVC removal (76%) and in the"
		administration of an antifungal drug on day 1 of detection of positive blood
		cultures (75%). The cure rate was significantly lower when septic shock developed
		"and a patient was transferred to an intensive care unit (15%), when amphotericin"
		"B was used as a first-line drug (45%), when granulocytopenia occurred (53%), or"
		glucocorticoids were given (55%). CONCLUSION: Candida non-albicans constitute a
		high proportion among the pathogens of CE. A number of risk factors influencing
		survival rates in CE have been identified. It is crucial to use echinocandin as a
		first-line agent as soon as possible after isolation of Candida spp. from blood
		cultures.

AB	-	"PURPOSE: to characterize, phenotypically, yeasts isolated from the vaginal"
		content of 223 symptomatic (S) and asymptomatic (A) adult women with
		"vulvovaginitis, and to determine the clinical indicators which may lead to the"
		appearance of signs and symptoms related to the mucosa involvement by this
		pathology. METHODS: a questionnaire with open and closed questions on
		"epidemiological clinical data was applied initially. Then, mycological diagnosis"
		"with sowing in Chrom Agar Candida was done, followed by micro-morphological and"
		biochemical identification. Specific methods for the detection of the virulence
		"factors, proteinase and phospholipase were employed. Statistical analysis was"
		performed through chi2 and Pearson's chi2 tests. RESULTS: the most prevalent
		"species found was Candida albicans (87%, S and 67%, A) followed by Candida"
		"glabrata (4%, S e 17% A). The number of women reporting the use of contraceptives"
		"was higher among the symptomatic, 77%. In the two groups studied, about 87% of"
		the women presented regular menstrual cycles and 57% were married with ages
		"between 30 to 40 years old. Concerning the sexual practices, there has been"
		"concomitance among anal, oral and vaginal habits from the patients. Only Candida"
		albicans produced the virulence factor phospholipase in 37.5% of them. Proteinase
		"has been detected in Candida albicans, Candida glabrata and Candida parapsilosis."
		This latter virulence factor was mainly associated to isolates from symptomatic
		patients. CONCLUSIONS: it is a fact that the vaginal mucosa can be colonized and
		"infected by yeasts, with several Candida species present. Nevertheless, Candida"
		albicans is the most prevalent in the vaginal mucosa of adult women. It is
		"evident the emergence of non-albicans Candida species, some of them with"
		"intrinsic resistance to azolics, such as Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis,"
		"Candida tropicalis, and Candida guillermondii, which can be explained by the"
		inadequate use of medicines and empirical treatment.

LID	-	10.1159/000363566 [doi]
AB	-	Lower gastrointestinal tract infections caused by Candida species are rarely
		"reported, and Candida albicans is the only pathogen that has been identified. The"
		author reports a first case of colonic candidiasis caused by Candida tropicalis
		"in a 55-year-old female with diabetes mellitus type 2, diffuse large B-cell"
		lymphoma and neutropenia induced by chemotherapy. Diarrhea and fever were the
		presenting symptoms. Diagnosis was made based on deep tissue involvement on
		colonoscopy with biopsy and positive hemoculture. This alerted the physician to
		be aware of Candida non-albicans as a cause of colonic infection. Fungal culture
		"should always be done to identify specific Candida species, leading to"
		appropriate antifungal therapy. A review of the literature on colonic candidiasis
		is also presented here.

PG	-	221-224
LID	-	10.1099/0022-1317-51-3-221 [doi]
AB	-	Candida ID is a new chromogenic medium for the identification of yeasts from
		"clinical specimens. C. albicans produces blue pigmentation, whereas pink"
		"pigmentation is produced by C. tropicalis, C lusitaniae, C. guilliermondii and C."
		"kefyr; other Candida species appear white. In this study, 240 clinical samples"
		(throat swabs and stool samples) from haematology patients were inoculated on to
		"Candida ID and Sabouraud-chloramphenicol agar in parallel, yielding a total of"
		105 yeasts; the media had overall detection rates of 85.7% and 86.7%
		respectively. The sensitivity of Candida ID for identification of C. albicans by
		blue pigmentation was 52.9% at 24 h and 94.1% at 48 h. Specificity of the blue
		"pigmentation was 100% at 48 h. Two strains of C. tropicalis were identified, one"
		"produced pink pigmentation at 72 h, the other strain did not produce any"
		pigmentation after 5 days. Candida ID was superior in detecting mixtures of
		yeasts compared with Sabouraud-chloramphenicol agar. Candida ID is a suitable
		"primary isolation medium for yeasts from clinical specimens, providing rapid"
		direct identification of C. albicans and enhanced detection of mixtures.

TI	-	Betel quid-associated oral lesions and oral Candida species in a female Cambodian
		cohort.
PG	-	468-72
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Betel quid chewing (BQC) is still prevalent among elderly Cambodian
		women and is associated with a wide variety of oral mucosal lesions. BQC has also
		been associated with a reduced rate of dental caries and changes in the oral
		microbiological flora. METHODS: Since no studies were available on the impact of
		"BQC on the oral carriage of Candida species, in this study oral swabs"
		"(Fungiquick, Hain Diagnostika, Germany) were taken from the tongue and palate of"
		48 Cambodian women with BQC habit (study group) and 13 control subjects without
		BQC habit (control group) to determine the spectrum of Candida species in these
		"two groups. In addition, we investigated lesions of the oral mucosa likely to be"
		associated with BQC habit in both study and control groups. RESULTS: The median
		duration of BQC was 10 years (range 10 months-30 years). The following oral
		"lesions were found in the study group: betel chewer's mucosa (85.4%), oral"
		"leukoplakia (8.3%), leukoedema (37.5%) and oral lichen planus (4.2%). Oral"
		candidiasis was seen neither in BQ-chewers nor in controls. Candida spp. were
		found in 70.8% of the cases (controls 69.2%). Whilst C. albicans was isolated
		"from 27.1% of the study cohort, C. tropicalis was the second most common isolate."
		One control case was colonised by C. dubliniensis--the first report of this
		organism from a Cambodian population. There was no significant difference in the
		candidal carriage rate or the Candida species isolated between the study and the
		control group. CONCLUSIONS: Mycological findings from the present study do not
		indicate that BQC has a significant effect on oral colonisation by Candida
		species.

PG	-	1069-76
AB	-	BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of
		candiduria in critically ill patients admitted to intensive care medical units
		"(ICUs), to identify risk factors for candiduria and to assess the frequency"
		distribution of different Candidaspp. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This was a
		"prospective cohort observational and multicenter study. A total of 1,765 patients"
		older than 18 years of age who were admitted for at least 7 days to 73
		medical-surgical ICUs of 70 Spanish hospitals were included in the study. Urine
		"cultures were performed once a week. RESULTS: In 389 patients (22%), Candidaspp."
		"in one or more urine samples were isolated. In the multivariate analysis,"
		"independent risk factors for candiduria included: age >65 years, female sex,"
		"length of hospital stay before ICU admission, diabetes mellitus, total parenteral"
		"nutrition, mechanical ventilation and previous use of antimicrobials. Candida"
		"albicanswas recovered in 266 cases (68.4%), followed by C. glabrata(32 cases,"
		"8.2%) and C. tropicalis(14 cases, 36%). Previous use of antifungal agents was the"
		"only risk factor for the selection of Candidanon-albicans candiduria (OR 2.64,"
		"95% CI 1.35-5.14, P=0.004). In-hospital mortality was 48.8% in patients with"
		candiduria compared to 36.6% in those without candiduria ( P<0.001). Significant
		"differences were also found for ICU mortality (38.% vs. 28.1%, P<0.001)."
		CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-two percent of critically ill patients admitted for more than
		7 days in the ICU developed candiduria. C. albicanswas the most frequent
		causative pathogen. Previous use of antifungals was the only risk factor for the
		selection of Candidanon-albicans.

AB	-	JUSTIFICATION: The frequency of candidiasis has increased dramatically in recent
		"years. Candida albicans is the most common species. However, other species which"
		are pathogenic and resistant to usual antifungal agents beginning to emerge.
		"These include Candida dubliniensis and Candida africana, which share"
		"morphological similarities with Candida albicans. Thus, it is of interest to"
		correctly identify the fungal isolates. OBJECTIVE: To seek these new species
		among Candida strains isolated in Dakar. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Oropharyngeal and
		vaginal swabs were performed at Fann Universitary Hospital in Dakar. The strains
		"were identified by the germ tube test, the chlamydospore production test and an"
		auxanogram. Then identification by PCR targeting the hyphal wall protein 1(hwp1)
		"gene, was performed for the discrimination between Candida albicans, Candida"
		"dubliniensis and Candida africana. RESULTS: In total, 243 yeasts were isolated"
		from samples including 231 in vaginal swab and 12 in oropharyngeal swab. Species
		"identified by phenotypic methods are Candida albicans, which is the most"
		"frequent, Candida tropicalis, Candida glabrata, Candida dubliniensis, Candida"
		kefyr and Candida lusitaniae. PCR performed on the 150 strains germ tube test
		"positive identifies three Candida africana, 109 Candida albicans and no strain of"
		Candida dubliniensis. CONCLUSION: This study isolates Candida africana for the
		first time in Senegal. Further studies on a larger sample will better know the
		actual proportion of these three species among the isolated yeasts.

		five-year period (1997-2001)].
PG	-	488-92
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: This retrospective study investigates the incidence of candidemia
		and antifungal susceptibility of Candida spp. isolates from blood cultures
		performed in the period from January 1997 to December 2001. METHODS: Amphotericin
		"B, fluconazole, itraconazole and flucytosine minimal inhibitory concentrations"
		(MICs) were determined using the Sensititre YeastOne broth microdilution assay
		"for the 53 isolates detected in the study period: C. parapsilosis (22), C."
		"albicans (19), C. glabrata (5), C. krusei (3), C. tropicalis (2) and C."
		guilliermondii (2). RESULTS: The incidence of candidemia was 0.25 episodes per
		1000 admissions in the period studied. C. parapsilosis was present in 41.5% of
		"cases, followed by C. albicans (35.8%), C. glabrata (9.4%), C. krusei (5.5%), C."
		tropicalis (3.7%) and C. guilliermondii (3.7%). Isolation of C. parapsilosis was
		significantly associated with the neonatal and pediatric ICU. None of the
		isolates presented an amphotericin B MIC > 1 micro g/ml. All the C. krusei
		isolates were resistant to fluconazole. Itraconazole resistance and
		dose-dependent fluconazole susceptibility was found in 80% of C. glabrata
		isolates. Only one C. parapsilosis isolate was resistant to flucytosine.
		CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of candidemia in our hospital was low. C. parapsilosis
		was the most common species and was associated with neonatal and pediatric ICUs.
		Fluconazole and itraconazole resistance was only found among C. krusei and C.
		"glabrata isolates, which accounted for 15% of the total Candida spp. isolated"
		from blood cultures in our hospital.

AB	-	Biofilm forming capacity of yeasts colonizing the intravenous devices is
		considered a key factor involved in the pathogenesis of Candida catheter-related
		bloodstream infections (CCRBSI). The biofilm production of strains of Candida
		spp. isolated both from the CVC and from the blood of patients with CCRBSI was
		"compared to that of strains isolated from patients not having CCRBSI. Results,"
		"expressed in terms of Biofilm Index (BI), revealed that biofilm-producing strains"
		were isolated in the CCRBSI group with a frequency significantly higher than in
		"the non-CCRBSI group (χ(2) = 4.25, p = 0.03). The species more frequently"
		"cultured was C. parapsilosis complex (including C. parapsilosis sensu stricto, C."
		orthopsilosis and C. metapsilosis). When this species was isolated from the CVC
		tip cultures of the CCRBSI group it showed BIs significantly (p = 0.05) higher
		than those found in the non-CCRBSI group. All the strains of C. tropicalis
		isolated from the CCRBSI group produced biofilm. Instead most of the isolates of
		C. glabrata were non-producers. The cumulative BI of non-albicans Candida strains
		isolated from CCRBSI patients was significantly higher than that of non-albicans
		strains cultured from patients non-CCRBSI (χ(2) = 6.91; p = 0.008). C. albicans
		was a biofilm producer both in the CCRBSI and in the non-CCRBSI group. When
		isolated from the blood it showed enhanced biofilm production in the CCRBSI group
		"only, while when colonizing the CVC it displayed high BIs both in the CCRBSI"
		group and in non-CCRBSI group. Our data seem to indicate that the biofilm
		production capacity should be considered in the clinical management of CCRBSI.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify yeasts from commercial attiéké. PATIENTS
		AND METHODS: This descriptive cross-sectional survey involving 103 samples of
		attiéké sold on the market from August to September 2017. It was conducted from
		the mycology laboratory of the Institut Pasteur of Côte d'Ivoire. The samples
		were seeded on YGC medium. The colonies of positive culture were counted and
		seeded again on chromogen medium. Identification of yeasts species was carried
		"out by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Vitek MS bioMérieux). RESULTS: As a whole,"
		63 samples were contaminated with fungi i.e. an overall prevalence of 61.1 %.
		Fifty-nine of yeasts were identified i.e. 57.2 %. Candida rugosa was most
		"frequently isolated (62.7 %), followed by Ccandida albicans (8.5 %), Candida"
		krusei (8.5 %) et Candida tropicalis (8.5 %). Geotrichum candidum represented
		"6.8 % isolated yeasts. The yeast average load is 10,124×10(2) CFU/g with high"
		contamination of commercial attiéké in the commune of Abobo. CONCLUSION: The
		contamination of attiéké by yeasts is a reality. C. rugosa was most frequently
		isolated. It would be necessary to investigate the food chain to determine the
		source of contamination.

PG	-	373-80
AB	-	Forty-one episodes of breakthrough fungaemia occurring over a 7.5 year period in
		"the National and St Elizabeth's Cancer Institutes in Bratislava, Slovakia, were"
		analysed. Five of them occurred during prophylaxis with fluconazole (one
		"Torulopsis glabrata, one Hansenula anomala, two Candida krusei and one Candida"
		"parapsilosis), ten with itraconazole (three Trichosporon pullulans, one"
		"Trichosporon beigelii, one Cryptococcus laurentii, three Candida albicans and two"
		"T. glabrata), 11 during prophylaxis with ketoconazole (one Candida norvegenesis,"
		"one C. parapsilosis, one C. krusei, one Candida tropicalis, five C. albicans, one"
		Candida stellatoidea and one C. laurentii and 15 during empirical therapy with
		"amphotericin B (ten C. albicans, two T. beigelii and three Candida lusitaniae)."
		"The most frequent risk factors for breakthrough fungaemia were neutropenia,"
		previous therapy with multiple antibiotics and recent catheter insertion.
		Comparing these episodes with 38 non-breakthrough fungaemias (appearing at the
		same institute in the same period) differences in certain risk factors were
		noted: breakthrough fungaemias were more frequently observed in patients with
		"acute leukaemia (39.0% vs 5.2%, P < 0.001), mucositis (34.2% vs 13.1%, P < 0.05),"
		"prophylaxis with quinolones (58.5% vs 15.8%, P < 0.0001) and catheter-associated"
		"infections (29.3% vs 2.6%, P < 0.003). In this subgroup overall mortality (36.6%"
		vs 28.8%) or early attributable mortality (22.0% vs 23.6%) were not significantly
		different.

TI	-	Oral itraconazole in treatment of candidemia in a pediatric intensive care unit.
PG	-	973-7
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To examine efficacy of itraconazole in the treatment of candidemia in
		critically ill children. METHODS: We studied retrospectively cases of candidemia
		seen consecutively in our Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) over three and
		"half years. Candida isolates from those patients included. Candida albicans--19,"
		"C. tropicalis--31, C. guillermondii--9, C.krusei--4 and C. glabrata--1. RESULTS:"
		"Of the 64 patients, 48 (75%) had symptoms suggestive of septicemia and 16 had no"
		symptoms suggestive of septicemia. No antifungal therapy was given to
		asymptomatic patients; they recovered from candidemia without development of any
		sequelae. Of the 48 symptomatic patients 11 died before results of fungal culture
		became available and antifungal therapy could be started. Thirty seven patients
		were treated with itraconazole (10 mg/kg/day orally or through gastric tube).
		"Seven (18.9 %) of 37 patients died, 3 within first week of antifungal therapy."
		Thirty (81%) patients recovered; microbiological cure was noted on average by day
		14 (range 4-30 days). The mean +/- SD duration of therapy in patients who
		responded was 24 +/-7 days (range 21-42 days). None had any major side effect.
		CONCLUSION: We conclude that oral itraconazole may be effective in treatment of
		candidemia in children in a PICU where non-C. albicans candida species
		constituted majority (70%) of all Candida isolates.

TI	-	Secular trends in nosocomial candidaemia in non-neutropenic patients in an
		Italian tertiary hospital.
PG	-	908-13
AB	-	A retrospective study was performed in an Italian tertiary hospital to evaluate
		"trends in candidaemia between 1992 and 2001, and to compare the characteristics"
		"of episodes of fungaemia between 1992--1997 and 1998--2001. In total, 370"
		"episodes of candidaemia were identified, with an average incidence of 0.99"
		episodes/10 000 patient-days/year (range 0.49--1.29 episodes). On an annual trend
		"basis, the overall incidence was essentially stable in surgical and medical"
		"wards, but decreased in intensive care units (ICUs) (p 0.0065). The average use"
		"of fluconazole was 37.9 g/10 000 patient-days/year (range 21.4--56.1 g), and did"
		not change significantly during the 10-year period. Nearly two-thirds of patients
		"were in ICUs at the onset of candidaemia, but none was neutropenic in either"
		study period. Candida albicans remained the predominant species isolated (53.8%
		"vs. 48.1%), followed by Candida parapsilosis, Candida glabrata and Candida"
		"tropicalis, the distribution of which did not change significantly. The 30-day"
		crude mortality rate was essentially similar (44% vs. 35%) in both study periods.
		"Thus the incidence of nosocomial candidaemia, although high in this institution,"
		decreased among critically-ill patients during the 10-year period. This finding
		"seemed to be related to an improvement in infection control practices,"
		particularly regarding the prevention of intravascular catheter-related
		"infections in ICUs. Although the overall use of fluconazole was considerable, no"
		increase in azole-resistant non-albicans Candida spp. was detected.

AB	-	The incidence of Candida bloodstream infection has increased over the past years.
		"In the Center-West region of Brazil, data on candidemia are scarce. This paper"
		reports a retrospective analysis of 96 cases of Candida bloodstream infection at
		"a Brazilian tertiary-care teaching hospital in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul,"
		"from January 1998 to December 2006. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data"
		were collected from medical records and from the hospital's laboratory database.
		"Patients' ages ranged from three days to 92 years, with 53 (55.2%) adults and 43"
		"(44.8%) children. Of the latter, 25 (58.1%) were newborns. The risk conditions"
		"most often found were: long period of hospitalization, utilization of venous"
		"central catheter, and previous use of antibiotics. Fifty-eight (60.4%) patients"
		died during the hospitalization period and eight (13.7%) of them died 30 days
		after the diagnosis of candidemia. Candida albicans (45.8%) was the most
		"prevalent species, followed by C. parapsilosis (34.4%), C. tropicalis (14.6%) and"
		C. glabrata (5.2%). This is the first report of Candida bloodstream infection in
		the state of Mato Grosso do Sul and it highlights the importance of considering
		the possibility of invasive Candida infection in patients exposed to risk
		"factors, particularly among neonates and the elderly."

AB	-	Invasive candidiasis (IC) epidemiology has changed in critically ill patients and
		limited data are available in Chile. OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiological
		and microbiological profile of IC in critically ill patients. METHODS:
		Observational prospective study conducted from October 2001 to August 2003 in
		critically ill adults with suspected or confirmed IC. RESULTS: 53 patients met
		"criteria for IC, finding 18 (33.9%) candidemias, 22 (41.5%) disseminated IC, and"
		13 (24.5%) local IC. We identified 8 (44.4%) C. albicans and 10 (55.6%)
		non-albicans Candida in candidemias. C. tropicalis was the predominant
		non-albicans species (27.7%). An 88.8 % of Candidas sp recovered in candidemias
		were fluconazole susceptible. Overall hospital mortality was 24.5%. Mortality in
		"candidemia was significantly lower than in disseminated IC (16.6 vs 31.8%, p ="
		0.02). CONCLUSIONS: A higher proportion of non-albicans Candida was observed in
		"candidemias from critically ill patients. However, most of these strains were"
		fluconazole susceptible. A lower overall mortality was observed in candidemias.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Infections are still the most common complications of cerebral
		"shunt procedures. Even though fungal etiologies are considered to be rare, they"
		are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Due to their
		"uncommonness, diagnostic procedures and optimal therapy are poorly defined. We"
		report a case of Candida tropicalis infection of ventriculo-peritoneal
		cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt in a 49-year-old immune competent male treated
		with voriconazole (VOR). METHODS: Microbiological and CSF markers
		"(1,3-b-D-glucan-BDG) of fungal infection, biofilm production capacity,"
		"sensitivity of serial isolates of the pathogen, and the concentration of the"
		antifungal drug have been monitored and related to the clinical course of this
		"infection. RESULTS: Despite appropriate treatment with VOR, in terms of adequate"
		"achieved CSF drug concentrations and initial effective therapeutic response, loss"
		of VOR susceptibility of the C tropicalis and treatment failure were observed.
		CONCLUSION: Biofilm production of the C. tropicalis isolate might have had a
		"significant role in treatment failure. Of interest, clinical and microbiological"
		unfavorable outcome was anticipated by persistence of BDG in CSF. Rising titers
		of this marker were associated with relapse of fungal infection.

		Rica.
PG	-	90-5
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To identify potential risk factors associated with Candida infections
		and compare these risk factors between patients who both died and survived. STUDY
		DESIGN: A group of patients with positive Candida spp. blood cultures admitted to
		a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in Costa Rica between January 1994 and
		December 1998. Cases were identified through a computerized search of the
		microbiology laboratory's database on blood cultures. RESULTS: One hundred and
		ten newborns were identified. Sixty-six patients (60%) were male; 46 (62%) were
		preterm infants. Thirty-seven (34%) patients died. Twenty (54%) of them died
		within three days of the candidemia diagnosis and 17 had disseminated Candida
		infection on autopsy. Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis were isolated in
		"90% and 10% of blood cultures, respectively. Mean +/- SD (range) number of days"
		from admission to NICU to the initial positive blood culture were 13.5 +/- 8.5
		(1-30) days. Most patients had at least two positive blood cultures (range 1-8).
		Median (range) days for the sterilization of blood culture were four (1-25) days.
		Significant differences in survival were identified in patients with
		"axillary-inguinal lesions, apnea and seizures. CONCLUSIONS: Invasive fungal"

		neonates.
PG	-	603-7
AB	-	High-dose (5-7 mg/kg/day) liposomal amphotericin B was evaluated prospectively
		during the period 1995-2001 in 41 episodes of systemic candidiasis occurring in
		37 neonates (36 of the 37 were premature infants with very low birth weights).
		Median age at the onset of systemic candidiasis was 17 days. Candida spp. were
		"isolated from blood in all patients and from urine, skin abscesses and peritoneal"
		"fluid in 6, 5 and 1 neonates, respectively. Candidiasis was due to Candida"
		"parapsilosis in 17 cases, Candida albicans in 15 cases, Candida tropicalis in 5"
		"cases, Candida guilliermondii in 2 cases, Candida glabrata in 2 cases and an"
		"unidentified Candida sp. in 1 case. Twenty-eight, five and eight infants received"
		"7, 6-6.5 and 5 mg/kg/day, respectively. Median duration of therapy was 18 days;"
		median cumulative dose was 94 mg/kg. Fungal eradication was achieved in 39 of 41
		(95%) episodes; median duration of therapy until fungal eradication was 8.7+/-4.5
		days. Fungal eradication was achieved after 10.9+/-4.8 days in patients who had
		received previous antifungal therapy compared to 8.2+/-4.3 days in those treated
		with liposomal amphotericin B as first-line therapy. One patient died due to
		systemic candidiasis on day 12 of therapy. High-dose liposomal amphotericin B was
		effective and safe in the treatment of neonatal candidiasis. Fungal eradication
		was more rapid in patients treated early with high doses and in patients who
		received high-dose liposomal amphotericin B as first-line therapy.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Oropharyngeal candidiasis continues to be a major opportunistic
		infection in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. The objectives
		"of this study were to investigate the prevalence, associated factors, and"
		microbiologic features for oropharyngeal yeast colonization in HIV-infected
		"patients. METHODS: From October to December 2009, consecutive HIV-infected"
		patients older than 18 years were recruited in this study. Demographic
		"information, underlying conditions, and clinical histories were collected."
		Oropharyngeal swab cultures for yeasts and antifungal drug susceptibilities of
		"the isolates were performed. RESULTS: Of the 105 HIV-infected patients, 54"
		"(51.4%) were colonized with yeasts, including 11 patients (20.4%) with more than"
		"one species. Among the 68 isolates, Candida albicans accounted for 73.5%,"
		"followed by Candida tropicalis (5.9%), Candida glabrata (5.9%), and Candida"
		dubliniensis (4.4%). There were 7.5% and 6% Candida isolates resistant to
		"fluconazole and voriconazole, respectively. All of the Candida isolates were"
		susceptible to amphotericin B. A higher prevalence of yeast colonization was
		noted in patients with a CD4 cell count ≤200 cells/μL (p = 0.032). Multivariate
		regression analysis showed that intravenous drug use was an independent
		"associated factor for oropharyngeal yeast colonization (odds ratio, 5.35; 95%"
		"confidence interval, 1.39-20.6; p = 0.015), as well as protease"
		"inhibitor-containing antiretroviral therapy (odds ratio, 3.59; 95% confidence"
		"interval, 1.41-9.12; p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: Despite previous studies showing"
		"that protease inhibitors decreased Candida adhesion to epithelial cells in vitro,"
		the current study found protease inhibitor-containing antiretroviral therapy
		predisposed to oropharyngeal yeast colonization in HIV-infected patients.

TI	-	[Nosocomial fungemias in a general hospital. Epidemiology and prognostic factors.
		Prospective study 1993-1998].
PG	-	304-7
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Nosocomial fungemias are infections with a high mortality rate. In
		last years the incidence of these infections has increased probably because of
		the growing population of immunocompromised patients who undergo aggressive
		diagnostic and therapeutic techniques. OBJECTIVE: To know the epidemiologic
		"characteristics, risk factors, clinical features and prognosis of fungemia."
		PATIENTS AND METHODS: We prospectively evaluated all the patients with proven
		fungemia in our center during a 5 year-period. After finishing antifungal
		treatment a minimum follow-up of 1 month was carried out. Fungal isolation and
		identification were performed by standard tests. RESULTS: During the period of
		study we evaluated 81 patients with an episode of nosocomial fungemia. Global
		"incidence was 0,9 episodes per thousand admitted patients. Candida albicans was"
		"the more frequently isolated species (n=53), followed by C. parapsilosis (n=11),"
		C. tropicalis (n=6) and C. glabrata (n=5). Most of the patients had a central
		intravenous line and were on parenteral nutrition therapy. All of them previously
		received at least one course of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Overall mortality was
		"49,6%. A worst prognosis was significantly associated with: age over 65 years,"
		"surgical procedures during present admission, leucocytosis, shock, and delay in"
		antifungal treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Fungal bloodstream infection incidence is high
		"in our environment. It is associated with a high mortality rate, specially in"
		patients in whom the beginning of antifungal treatment was delayed. A higher
		clinical suspicion index may improve the poor outcome in these patients.

		unit].
PG	-	382-5
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To conduct a retrospective analysis of the invasive fungal infection
		(IFI) in surgical intensive care unit (SICU). METHODS: The IFI data of the
		patients who were admitted in SICU during January 2003 to December 2008 was
		retrospectively analyzed. A total of 3743 patients were admitted into SICU. Among
		"them, 271 patient's SICU duration was more than 48 hours, who had fungi"
		"examination. RESULTS: Seventy-five patients were diagnosed IFI, the morbidity was"
		"2.00% (75/3743), the incidence of fungemia was 0.27% (10/3743), the mortality of"
		IFI patients was 49.33% (37/75). The morbidity rate of each year was almost the
		same. The mortality of 2007 and 2008 was higher than before (both P < 0.05).
		"Thirty-four of all the 75 IFI patients got urinary tract infected, 37 got fungal"
		"pneumonia, 10 got fungemia, 1 got catheter-related fungal infection, 2 got fungal"
		"infection in abdomen, 2 got biliary tract infected. Eighty-six fungi strains"
		which caused fungal infection were spotted. Candida albicans was the most common
		"isolate (46.51%). Other isolates were Candida glabrata (22.09%), Candida"
		"tropicalis (13.95%), Candida parapsilosis (8.14%), Candida krusei (3.49%),"
		"Trichosporon (4.65%), Aspergillus (1.16%). Assist ventilation, combination of"
		"bacterial infection, treatment by broad spectrum antibiotics or more than three"
		kinds of antibiotics were the most important risk factors of IFI in SICU.
		Prophylactic antifungal treatment may be useful. CONCLUSION: The morbidity of IFI
		"in our SICU was comparatively low, and the same of the incidence of fungemia. The"
		mortality of IFI patients was markedly high. The main sites of infection were
		"lung and urinary tract, and the pathogenic fungi strains were mostly Candidas."
		"Assist ventilation, combination of bacterial infection, broad spectrum"
		antibiotics treatment were the most important risk factors of IFI in SICU.

		mortality despite advancement in diagnostic modalities and therapy. Community
		acquired empyema thoracis due to Candida species are rarely reported in
		paediatric literature. We hereby report an interesting case of empyema due to
		co-infection of Candida krusei with Candida tropicalis. A 11-year-old female
		child presented with respiratory distress. Chest X-ray showed massive pleural
		"effusion, thoracocentesis showed it as purulent exudate and she was empirically"
		treated with antibiotics. C. tropicalis and C. krusei were isolated from the pus
		sample proving to be fungal empyema. Inspite of antifungal agents and mechanical
		"ventilation, her general condition rapidly deteriorated and she succumbed."

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infections are a frequent ailment in patients in
		intensive care units. Candida and other yeasts cause 5-12% of these infections.
		"The value of the finding of any yeast is controversial, and there is no consensus"
		about which parameters are adequate for differentiating urinary infections from
		colonization or contamination. AIMS: To analyse the epidemiological
		"characteristics of patients with funguria, to determine potential cut-off points"
		"in cultures (to distinguish an infection from other conditions), to identify the"
		"prevalent yeast species, and to determine the value of a second urine sample."
		METHODS: A multicentre study was conducted in intensive care units of 14
		hospitals in the Buenos Aires City Mycology Network. The first and second samples
		of urine from every patient were cultured. The presence of white cells and yeasts
		"in direct examination, colony counts, and the identification of the isolated"
		"species, were evaluated. RESULTS: Yeasts grew in 12.2% of the samples. There was"
		no statistical correlation between the number of white cells and the fungal
		colony-forming units. Eighty five percent of the patients had indwelling
		catheters. Funguria was not prevalent in women or in patients over the age of 65.
		"Candida albicans, followed by Candida tropicalis, were the most frequently"
		isolated yeasts. Candida parapsilosis and Candida glabrata appeared less
		"frequently. The same species were isolated in 70% of second samples, and in 23%"
		of the cases the second culture was negative. CONCLUSIONS: It was not possible to
		determine a useful cut-off point for colony counts to help in the diagnosis of
		"urinary infections. As in other publications, C. albicans, followed by C."
		"tropicalis, were the most prevalent species."

PG	-	54-57
LID	-	10.18502/cmm.5.4.2150 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Fungal renal abscesses are rare entities associated with
		"significant morbidity and mortality. Affected kidneys can have microabscess,"
		"pyelonephritis, pyonephrosis, or papillary necrosis. CASE REPORT: Herein, we"
		reported an unusual case of a large renal abscess cause by Candida tropicalis in
		a diabetic patient. The entity presented as a lump in the abdomen and later was
		diagnosed to be an abscess on computed tomography scan. Candida tropicalis was
		confirmed on the culture of the aspirate. The abscess was successfully treated by
		percutaneous drainage and administration of amphotericin B deoxycholate.
		CONCLUSION: Candida tropicalis is now a global concern because of its rising
		prevalence and high virulence. The growing resistance of this Candida species to
		"azoles, as in our case, calls for a more judicious usage of antifungal agents."
		Empirical therapy with either amphotericin or echinocandins is an option in case
		of high azole resistance. This case highlights the importance of timely diagnosis
		and implementation of aggressive management in cases suffering from fungal
		abscesses.

PG	-	295-7
LID	-	10.1097/ICB.0000000000000194 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: To describe the case of a patient with Candida tropicalis
		endophthalmitis who presented with a pattern of segmentally distributed
		preretinal infiltrates overlying the retinal blood vessels. METHODS: A
		retrospective chart review was performed. A 72-year-old East Indian male
		"presented with redness, pain, photosensitivity, and loss of vision in the right"
		eye for 1 month. He had been recently hospitalized for necrotizing pancreatitis
		and had been receiving intravenous medications as well as parenteral nutrition
		through a peripherally inserted central catheter. RESULTS: Fundus examination
		"revealed moderate vitreous cells and infiltrates, including a segmental pattern"
		of preretinal bead-like opacities along several blood vessels. The patient
		underwent emergent vitrectomy with injection of antibiotics and antifungal
		medications. Vitreous cultures grew C. tropicalis. The patient was treated with
		"oral antifungal medication for 6 weeks. By 7 weeks after surgery, all infiltrates"
		and inflammatory cells had completely resolved. The imaging and intraoperative
		observations suggest that the opacities behaved like infiltrates and were
		associated with vitreous rather than vascular inflammation. CONCLUSION: A
		segmental pattern of preretinal infiltrates over retinal vessels can be a
		presenting feature in endogenous fungal endophthalmitis. The observations in this
		case may contribute to understanding the pathophysiology of the findings.

PG	-	1970-3
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the epidemiological characteristics of invasive
		nosocomial candidiasis in teaching hospitals in Beijing. METHODS: The clinical
		data of consecutive cases diagnosed as with nosocomial candidiasis hospitalized
		in Beijing Chaoyang Hospital (CYH) (n=43) and Peking Union Medical College
		Hospital (PUMCH) (n=34) from January 2004 to September 2006 were retrospectively
		"analyzed to evaluate the incidence and mortality, and the relationship between"
		antifungal therapy and outcomes. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for
		Candida spp were determined by microdilution method. RESULTS: The incidence rates
		of nosocomial candidiasis of CYH and PUMCH were 0.053% and 0.025% respectively in
		"2004, and increased to 0.074% and 0.049% respectively in 2006. Candidemia"
		"accounted for 55.8% (43/77) of the Candida infection, followed by intra-abdominal"
		"infection (26.0%, n=20), intra-thoracic infection (9.1%, n=7), and biliary tract"
		"infection (7.8%, n=6). The species mostly frequently isolated were Candida"
		"albicans (57.1%), followed by C. tropicalis (19.5%), C. glabrata (14.3%), and C."
		"parasitosis (2.6%). The susceptibility rates of C. albicans, C. tropicalis, C."
		"glabrata, and C. parasitosis to fluconazole were 97.7%, 86.7%, 63.6%, and 100%"
		respectively. No isolates were resistant to amphotericin B. The crude mortality
		rate of Candida infection was 37.7%. The mortality rate of the candidemia
		"patients who did not receive systemic antifungal therapy was 72.7%, significantly"
		"higher than those who received antifungal therapy (37.5%, P = 0.043). Most"
		patients received fluconazole as the first choice (91.7% in PUMCH and 79.2% in
		CYH) with the survival rates of 63.6% and 52.6% respectively. Conclusion With
		"high morbidity and mortality, invasive nosocomial candidiasis is a big problem in"
		teaching hospitals. Further investigation is necessary to evaluate the incidence
		and to identify which antifungal agents are most protective for candidiasis.

PG	-	605-8
AB	-	PURPOSE: To investigate the distribution of oral candida species in head and neck
		"cancer (HNC) patients treated with radiation therapy, and provide the basis for"
		planning of clinical preventive measures. METHODS: Saliva was sampled from 60 HNC
		"patients before, during and after radiation. Concomitantly, 60 healthy"
		individuals whose age and sex matched that of the patient group were selected as
		control group. Oral candida carriages were quantitatively detected and the
		different candida species were identified by multiple measures such as CHROMagar
		candida culture medium and API 20C AUX yeast identification system. Then the
		differences between the two groups in terms of the candida detection rate and the
		distribution of each species of candida were analyzed with SPSS 17.0 software
		package. RESULTS: Xerostomia and dysphagia was found in 54 HNC patients during
		"radiotherapy, radiation-induced oral mucotitis(RIOM) was found in 50 HNC"
		"patients,and oral candidiasis was found in 18 HNC patients; In radiation group,"
		"the detection rate of candida colonization during radiation was 56.7%, 63.3%"
		"postradiation, which showed significant differences compared with pre-radiation"
		"(X² =18.320,P<0.001 ); Among the 54 identified clinical isolates, candida"
		"albicans (n=42) was the most frequent, followed by candida parapsilosis (n=6),"
		"candida tropicalis (n=4) and candida glabrata (n=2). In radiation group, the oral"
		"candida pathogens detection rate was 30%, and candida colonization was 46.7%."
		CONCLUSIONS: The oral candida colonization rate was significantly higher in HNC
		"patients after radiotherapy, which indicated that the candida infection may be"
		closely related to RIOM.

		Episodes of candidemia occurred in the Hospital de Clinicas of Buenos Aires were
		"reviewed, from 01/01/98 to 31/12/13. RESULTS: 374 episodes of candidemia were"
		"identified. The incidence was 2.21/1,000 discharges and increased from 1.96"
		(1998-2005) to 2.25 (2006-2013) (p = 0.023). Candidemia was diagnosed: 5.4% in
		"neonates, 1.7% in infants, 6.5% in children, 31.8% in adults and 52.7% in elderly"
		"adults over 64 years old. The episodes were caused by C. albicans (40.9%), C."

TI	-	[Epidemiological and microbiological evaluation of nosocomial infections caused
		by Candida species].
PG	-	637-48
AB	-	Nosocomial infections due to candida species are increasingly gaining importance.
		"In this study, we aimed to determine the risk factors associated with nosocomial"
		candida infections and also to determine the species and antifungal sensitivity
		of candida strains. Candida spp. strains isolated from the clinical specimens of
		92 patients who were hospitalized in Ankara Research and Training Hospital
		between May 2008 and September 2009 were prospectively included in the study. The
		"demographic features, clinical and laboratory findings of the patients were"
		recorded. Identification and antifungal sensitivities of the candida species were
		"determined by VITEC 2 Compact System (BioMeriéux, France). Invasive candida"
		infection was determined in 79 (85.9%) and candida colonization was found in 13
		(14.1%) of the patients. Types of candida infections were as follows; urinary
		"tract infection in 57 (72.1%), candidemia in 26 (32.9%), surgical site infection"
		in 6 (7.5%) and intraabdominal infection in 3 (%3.8) patients. According to the
		"univariate analysis, being female gender, duration and rate of hospitalization in"
		"the intensive care unit, use of linezolid, prolonged duration of urinary"
		catheterization and total parenteral nutrition and the duration of central venous
		catheterization were found significantly higher in the urinary tract infection
		"group. In candidemia group, carbapenem use, rates and periods of central venous"
		catheterization and total parenteral nutrition were detected higher which were
		statistically significant. In multivariate analysis for urinary tract infections
		female gender (Odds ratio: 3; 95% CI: 1.25-7.17) and prolonged stay (p= 0.031) in
		intensive care unit; for candidemia use of total parenteral nutrition (OR: 16.25;
		95% CI: 2.07-127.35) were found as independent risk factors. A total of 114
		Candida spp. Strains were isolated from the clinical specimens. The most common
		"isolated species were C.albicans (n= 62, 54.4%), C.glabrata (n= 16, 14%) and"
		"C.tropicalis (n= 13, 11.4%). While the resistance rates of Candida spp. To"
		"fluconazole and flucytosine were 2.6% and 1.7% respectively, there was no"
		resistance to voriconazole. The rate of isolates with amphotericin B MIC values >
		"1 µg/ml was 4.4%. Consequently, the restricted use of central venous catheter and"
		shortening the length of stay in intensive care unit may prevent the development
		of invasive candida infections. The local surveillance of antifungal resistance
		in candida strains might aid to the decision of empirical antifungal therapy.

AB	-	RATIONALE: Collodion baby is a rare autosomal recessive disorder. It can be the
		first expression of some forms of ichthyosis. PATIENT CONCERNS: The authors
		present the case of a newborn diagnosed with severe Collodion baby syndrome who
		required prolonged hospitalization in the intensive care unit because of
		infectious complications like the fungal sepsis and other bacterial
		superinfections. DIAGNOSES: The case has many diagnostic and therapeutic
		"particularities and management difficulties. Skin culture, dermatological and"
		genetic exam were required. INTERVENTIONS: The treatment required
		"multidisciplinary involvement: neonatologist, pediatrician, geneticist,"
		"dermatologist, psychologist, ophthalmologist, audiologist. OUTCOMES: The"
		"evolution during hospitalization was slowly favorable, but later, after a few"
		"months, it developed some complications. LESSONS: In our case, skin injuries,"
		"total parenteral nutrition, aggressive and prolonged antibiotic therapy,"
		"intravenous devices, high hospitalization duration were risk factors for"
		"colonization and sepsis with fungi, especially in the neonatal period, sometimes"
		with severe evolution and prognosis.

		"C. parapsilosis (21.9/50), C. tropicalis (12.8/3.75), and C. glabrata (10.1/5)."
		"As initial therapy, fluconazole was preferred in adults (54%) and liposomal"
		"amphotericin B in children (58%). The 30-day mortality rate was 40.6%, and the"
		species most frequently associated with a fatal outcome was C. krusei (60%). The

		testing was performed using a commercial agar diffusion test. RESULTS: Of the
		"1,070 cases of VVC reported in this study, 36.5% were uncomplicated VVC, and"
		63.5% were complicated VVC. Twenty-four patients were identified as having two
		species of Candida. Candid albicans alone was isolated from 89.5% of cases (n =
		"958). Candida glabrata was isolated from 85 cases (7.9%), Candida tropicalis from"
		"10 (0.9%), Saccharomyces cerevisiae from eight (0.7%), Candida parapsilosis from"
		"six (0.6%), Candida famata from two (0.2%), and Candida krusei from one case"
		(0.1%). All isolates of Candida albicans were susceptible to nystatin. The
		resistant rate of Candida albicans to azole agents was 0-4.9%. CONCLUSION:
		Candida albicans was the predominant Candida species isolated from this series of
		patients with VVC. Resistance of vaginal Candida albicans isolates to antifungal
		agents was infrequent.

TI	-	Primary cutaneous Candida tropicalis infection in a patient with B-cell lymphoma.
PG	-	204-6
AB	-	We report the case of a 61-year-old man with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who
		presented with a tender skin lesion on the left side of the flank of 5 weeks'
		duration after undergoing myeloablative chemotherapy. Prior treatment with
		intravenous vancomycin showed minimal response. Clinical examination revealed a
		"tender, indurated, erythematous plaque on the left side of the flank. A skin"
		biopsy demonstrated a lymphohistiocytic and neutrophilic infiltrate with deep
		dermal necrosis and fungal forms in the dermis and subcutis. A tissue culture
		"grew Candida tropicalis; however, blood cultures remained negative for yeast. A"
		diagnosis of primary cutaneous candidiasis was made based on the lack of response
		"to antibiotics, tissue evidence of C tropicalis, and negative blood cultures."
		"Although rare, primary cutaneous candidiasis should be considered in"
		immunocompromised patients presenting with cellulitis or an abscess that is
		unresponsive to treatment.

PG	-	11-Jul
AB	-	"A 10-year prospective survey of fungaemia in the Slovak Republic, involving 31"
		"microbiology laboratories and 71 hospitals, was conducted from 1989-1998 (10"
		"years): 310 fungaemias were analyzed for etiology, clinical characteristics,"
		"therapy, and outcome. C. albicans was responsible for 191 (61.6%) fungaemias,"
		"non-albicans Candida spp. (NAC) for 97 (31.3%), non-Candida yeasts for 18 (5.8%)"
		and moulds (Fulsarium spp.) for four fungaemias. The most frequent NAC isolated
		"from blood cultures were C. parapsilosis--30 (9.7%), C. krusei--18 (5.8%), C."
		"tropicalis--14 (4.5%), and C. glabrata--10 (3.2%). Secular trends in etiology"
		showed a sustaining decrease of C. albicans (from 100% in 1989 to 50.7% in 1998)
		and increase of NAC (from 0% in 1989-1990 to 46.3% in 1998). Non-Candida yeasts
		and moulds showed a stable proportion during the investigated period. There were
		statistically significant differences in etiology of fungaemia various subgroups
		of patients: non-albicans Candida spp. was significantly more frequent observed
		"among subgroups of patients with pancreatitis and coma (53.3% vs. 31.3%, p < or ="
		"0.02) and less frequently in the subgroup of neonates (15.0% vs. 31.3%, p < or ="
		"0.006). Vice versa, C. albicans appeared more frequently in neonates (85%)."

PG	-	448-50
LID	-	10.4103/0972-2327.144036 [doi]
AB	-	Fungi are a relatively uncommon cause of brain abscess in neonates and early
		"infancy. They are usually associated with predisposing factors like prematurity,"
		"low birth weight, use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and prolonged stay in the"
		intensive care unit. Candida tropicalis (C. tropicalis) is rapidly emerging as a
		nosocomial threat in the neonatal intensive care settings. This case report
		describes a neonate with C. tropicalis brain abscess who was diagnosed early and
		managed aggressively with a favorable outcome. Inadvertent use of intravenous
		antibiotics can have serious complications such as invasive fungal infection.
		Correct microbiological diagnosis is the key to successful treatment of
		deep-seated pyogenic infection. Fungal etiology should always be studied in
		relevant clinical settings.

TI	-	Characterization of Candida species isolated from cases of lower respiratory
		tract infection.
PG	-	290-4
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: (1) To identify and characterize the Candida species isolates from
		lower respiratory tract infection. (2) to determine the rate of isolation of
		Candida species from sputum samples. METHODS: This study was carried out in the
		"Department of Microbiology, Manipal Teaching Hospital, Pokhara, Nepal from June"
		2002 to January 2003. A total of 462 sputum samples were collected from patients
		suspected lower respiratory tract infection. The samples were processed as Gram
		"staining to find out the suitability of the specimen, cultured on Sabouraud's"
		Dextrose Agar (SDA) and also on blood agar and chocolate agar to identify the
		"potential lower respiratory tract pathogens. For the identification of Candida,"
		"sputum samples were processed for Gram stain, culture, germ tube test, production"
		"of chlamydospore, sugar fermentation and assimilation test. For the"
		"identification of bacteria, Gram stain, culture, and biochemical tests were"
		"performed by standardized procedure. RESULT: Out of 462 samples, 246 (53.24%)"
		samples grew potential pathogens of lower respiratory tract. Among them
		Haemophilus influenzae 61(24.79%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae 57 (23.17%) were
		the predominant bacterial pathogens. Candida species were isolated from 30
		samples (12.2%). The majority of Candida species amongst the Candida isolates
		were Candida albicans 21(70%) followed by Candida tropicalis 4(13.33%). Candida
		"krusei 3(10%), Candida parapsilosis 1(3.33%) and Candida stellatoidea 1(3.33%)."
		The highest rate of isolation of Candida was between the age of 71 and 80.
		CONCLUSION: Candida isolation from sputum samples is important as found in the
		present study in which Candida species were the third most common pathogen
		isolated from patients with lower respiratory tract infection.

TI	-	[Epidemiology of candidemia: results of a one month French hospitals-based
		surveillance study in 2004].
PG	-	523-30
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: The aim of our study was to determinate the frequency of
		"candidemia, the species encountered and their susceptibility to antifungal agents"
		"in French hospitals in 2004. METHODS: A prospective survey of septicaemia,"
		including candidaemia was conducted among 193 non teaching French hospitals
		during October 2004. All bloodstream infections were reported and the bloodstream
		isolates sent to two coordinating centers. Species identification and
		"susceptibility were performed by biologists as usual, and further confirmed by"
		"use of alternative methods, including Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC)"
		"determination. RESULTS: The survey was effective in 93 hospitals, where 2013"
		"bloodstream infections were noticed, including 46 candidaemia (2.3%). Candida sp."
		"Is the 7th pathogen responsible for bloodstream infection, without concern of the"
		origin of the infection. Candidaemia was hospital acquired in 80.4% of cases
		(N=37/46). Candidaemia represents 0.7% (N=9/1211) of community-acquired
		"bloodstream infections but 4.5% (N=37/802) of nosocomial cases, placing Candida"
		sp. at the 5th row of frequency in this last group. No mistakes were noticed
		"during identification, but two strains were not named. After confirmation of"
		"identification, species are distributed as follows: 23 C.albicans (50%), 13"
		"C.glabrata (28.3%), 5 C.tropicalis (10.9%), 3 C.parapsilosis (6.5%), 1 C.krusei"
		"(2.2%), and 1 C.kefyr (2.2%). The overall susceptibility is 97.7% for"
		"amphotericin B, 93.2% for 5-fluorocytosin, 88.6% for fluconazole, 70.5% for"
		"itraconazole, 95.5% for voriconzole and 100% of strains had very low MIC for"
		"caspofungin. Concerning the two main species isolated, 95.5% of C.albicans"
		"strains remain susceptible to fluconazole, but only 69% of C.glabrata strains."
		"Two strains, 1 C.albicans and 1 C.glabrata exhibit cross resistance to azoles."
		"The majority of amphotericin, fluconazole, and itraconazole decreased"
		"susceptibility strains are found into C.glabrata strains, but susceptibility to"
		5-fluorocytosin and very low MCI to caspofungin remained in this species.
		CONCLUSION: Our survey allowed us to get data from French non-teaching hospitals
		in 2004 about frequency of candidaemia among septicaemia. Candida species
		distribution and in vitro susceptibility patterns of the strains isolated.
		"Candidaemia is not a rare event, specially when septicaemia is nosocomially"
		acquired. C.albicans is the main species isolated and remains highly in vitro
		susceptible to antifungals. One important feature is the frequency of C.glabrata
		"in our survey. Considering its decreased susceptibility to azoles, this finding"
		confirms the need for rapid identification of yeast isolated from bloodstream
		"samples, and antifungal susceptibility testing each time it is available."

AB	-	Candida is the most important agent of fungal infections. Several risk factors
		have been described associated with invasive infection by fluconazole-resistant
		Candida spp. A prospective cross-sectional study with case-control analysis was
		conducted. Case group patients with fluconazole-resistant Candida isolate were
		included; control group were patients with fluconazole-susceptible Candida spp. A
		multivariate logistic regression model was performed. Three hundred isolates of
		Candida spp. were analyzed. Most frequent species were Candida albicans/Candida
		dubliniensis (48.3%) and Candida tropicalis (22.3%). Posaconazole susceptibility
		"was 93.7%; voriconazole, 84%; and fluconazole, 78.7%. Susceptibility to"
		"anidulafungin and caspofungin was 92.7% and 92.3%, respectively. Neutropenia"
		"(adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 6.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0-43.1),"
		"antifungal exposure (aOR 5.1, 95% CI 2.3-11.2), and antituberculosis therapy (aOR"
		"7.7, 95% CI 1.4-43.2) were associated to fluconazole resistance. Susceptibility"
		results are useful to guide the selection of empiric antifungal treatment and the
		design of local therapeutic guidelines. Previous antifungal exposure suggests
		"possible resistance to fluconazole, pointing towards the selection of a different"
		class of antifungal agents.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive fungal infection (IFI) is one of the most challenging
		complications in children undergoing acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)
		"treatment, but acute fungal osteomyelitis (OM) is rarely encountered. CASE"
		"PRESENTATION: Here, we describe a case of Candida tropicalis osteomyelitis in a"
		10-year-old patient with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive ALL. He was on
		"remission induction therapy at the time of neutropenia, and an abscess developed"
		in his right arm. The blood and bone cultures were positive for C. tropicalis.
		Antibiotics and antifungals were administered. Magnetic resonance imaging of the
		"arm revealed an intraosseous abscess, suggestive of OM. Surgical irrigation and"
		debridement of the bone were performed immediately. The patient was effectively
		treated with antifungal therapy and ALL treatment. He has fully recovered into
		complete clinical remission but with visible sequelae on magnetic resonance
		imaging (MRI). He took oral posaconazole for consolidation until disappearance of
		the lesion shadows on MRI and received subsequent cycles of chemotherapy in
		"parallel. CONCLUSIONS: In the successful management of Ph-positive ALL,"
		"dasatinib, a second-generation Abl-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is crucial. The"
		recommended treatment for Candida osteomyelitis in Ph-positive ALL patients is a
		fungicidal agent combined with surgery and modification chemotherapy with
		dasatinib. The use of combined modalities of treatment seems to be crucial in the
		successful management of Ph-positive ALL.

		patients].
PG	-	428-9
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the candidal carriage and the Candida species in HIV
		positive patients and to explore the relationship between oral candidal carriage
		and oral candidiasis. METHODS: Sixty-four HIV positive patients and 42 healthy
		controls were included in this study. Oral rinse technique was used to detect the
		"candidal carriage. The isolates were identified using multiple measures,"
		"including Gram staining reaction, chlamydospore, pseudo-hyphal and hyphal"
		"production test, CHROMagar Candida test and API 20 C AUX yeast identification"
		system. RESULTS: Thirty-nine of 64 HIV positive cases were diagnosed as oral
		candidiasis. Seventy-four Candida strains were isolated from 52 of 64 HIV
		"positive cases, only 7 strains were isolated from 42 healthy controls (P <"
		"0.001). Of the 74 Candida strains isolated from HIV positive cases, 39 were"
		"Candida albicans, 15 Candida tropicalis, and 20 other 6 species. CONCLUSIONS: A"
		high prevalence of oral candidiasis and high candidal carriage were found in HIV
		positive patients compared with those in controls. Candida albicans and Candida
		tropicalis were the major species. The biotyping of the species isolated from HIV
		"positive patients showed more diversified compared to healthy people, which may"
		suggest the decreased immune ability of the HIV positive patients.

PG	-	531-6
AB	-	This study aimed to retrospectively evaluate the adequate use of antifungal drugs
		"in the treatment of the candidaemia. A collection of clinical, biological and"
		therapeutic data was carried out for the patients who had a positive blood
		culture for Candida species during the year 2004. The antifungal therapy was
		"compared to the guidelines of the French Conference of consensus named ""Prise en"
		"charge des candidoses et aspergilloses invasives de l'adulte"". The degree of"
		"conformity was classified as follows: complying, partly complying (molecule in"
		conformity but delay of treatment or unsuited dosing) and not complying with the
		"guidelines. The analysis was performed, according to the guidelines, before and"
		after knowledge of Candida species growing from the blood culture. On 29
		"candidaemia, the found species were: Candida albicans 55%, Candida glabrata 14%,"
		"Candida krusei 10%, Candida parapsilosis and Candida lusitaniae 7%, Candida"
		pelliculosa and Candida tropicalis 3.5%. Only 19 candidaemia were included in
		this study because blood cultures were known positive for Candida on the day of
		death (N=7) or medical charts were not available (N=3). For treatment before
		"identification of Candida species, 37% were complying, 37% in partly complying"
		and 26% not complying with the guidelines. For the treatment after identification
		"of the species, 26% were complying, 63% partly complying and 11% not complying"
		"with the guidelines. As a whole, antifungal therapy was totally or partly"
		complying in 74 to 89% of candidaemia in adult patients. Lower dosages of
		fluconazole explained most of the treatments that partly complied with
		guidelines.

		Candida species].
PG	-	593-603
AB	-	"Among nosocomial infections in the newborns, the incidence of fungal infections"
		has been rising over the last decades. Fluconazole has been a new option for
		"treatment however, expanded use of the drug brought up the development of"
		"resistance. In this study, species of the Candida isolates from neonates with"
		"candida infections, their antifungal susceptibilities and the effectiveness of"
		"the therapy were evaluated. All the species of Candida isolates from blood, urine"
		and sterile body fluids of 54 neonates and their antifungal susceptibilities were
		"evaluated retrospectively over the 13-year period. Demographic characteristics,"
		"risk factors, infection foci, Candida species causing infection and their in"
		vitro susceptibilities for fluconazole (FCZ) and amphotericin B (AMB) and
		treatment responses were analyzed. The antifungal susceptibility testing of
		isolates was performed by microdilution technique. The median birth weight and
		"gestational age of the study groups were 1735 (660-3990) g and 33 (24-40) weeks,"
		"respectively. Among the patients, 19 (35%) were term, while 35 (65%) were preterm"
		"[< 32 weeks n = 20 (37%), < 28 weeks n = 7 (13%)]. The percentage of low birth"
		"weight infants was 65% (42% was < 1500 g, 13% was < 1000 g). Candida spp. were"
		"isolated mostly from blood samples (63%), followed by urine (46%), cerebrospinal"
		"fluid (CSF; 5%), peritoneal fluid (3%) and endotracheal aspirate (2%). Multifocal"
		growth was determined in 10 (18%) cases. The isolated species were C.albicans (n
		"=36) as being the most common isolate followed by C.parapsilosis (n = 12),"
		"C.tropicalis (n = 1), C.kefyr (n = 1), C.lusitaniae (n = 1), C.pelluculosa (n ="
		"1) and Candida spp. (n = 2). Prior antibiotic use, long term hospitalization,"
		"total parenteral nutrition and use of lipid solutions, prematurity and catheter"
		use were determined as the most frequently associated factors causing candidal
		"infections. A congenital abnormality, mainly myeloschisis and hydrocephaly, was"
		detected in 18 (33%) of the cases. Overall FCZ resistance rate was 5.5% and the
		rate of resistance according to the species was 2.8% for C.albicans and 11% for
		non-albicans isolates. No resistance was observed to AMB. Initial treatment was
		FCZ for 78% and AMB for 22% of the newborns. The treatment was switched to AMB in
		15 (28%) cases because of no clinical or laboratory response to FCZ although only
		three of these babies showed resistance to FCZ (MIC ≥ 64 mcg/ml). Among the cases
		"with no clinical/microbiological response, C.albicans was the most frequently"
		(66%) isolated species followed by non-albicans species (33%). All of the
		isolates in the study group were susceptible to AMB and the rate of FCZ
		"resistance was 5.5%. However, it was noted that the clinical treatment failure"
		was higher than the resistance rate when FCZ was considered. Although antifungal
		"susceptibility tests are helpful for guiding the therapy, in vivo and in vitro"
		differences should be taken into account in case of treatment failure encountered
		with the use of in vitro effective agents.

AB	-	Fungal prosthetic joint infection is a rare complication in total joint
		arthroplasty. There are no established guidelines for management of these
		infections. We present a case of a 53-year-old male with a hip joint prosthesis
		co-infected with Candida tropicalis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus. A two-stage
		"exchange arthroplasty was performed. The patient underwent implant removal,"
		"debridement, irrigation with saline solution and application of cement spacer"
		impregnated with vancomycin followed by aggressive antimicrobial treatment in
		first stage. Complete eradication of infection was demonstrated by negative
		culture of sonicated cement spacer fluid and negative 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA gene
		"PCR of sonicate fluid, synovial fluid and periprosthetic tissue samples. He"
		underwent second-stage revision hip arthroplasty after 9 months of the first
		"stage. At the latest follow-up, there was no evidence of recurrence of infection."
		This case illustrates the utility of sonication of biomaterials and molecular
		techniques for microbiological confirmation of absence of infection in staged
		surgeries which is required for a successful outcome.

PG	-	291-5
AB	-	Osteomyelitis of the spine is a well-recognized delayed manifestation of
		septicemia but has not been recognized as a complication of total parenteral
		nutrition. We report five cases of spinal osteomyelitis that were clinically
		recognized 1 to 13 months after total parenteral nutrition catheter-induced
		septicemia. Radiographic evidence of osteomyelitis was seen in all five patients.
		"In three patients, culture of bony aspirates was positive for the same organism"
		"as from the blood. In one case, the diagnosis was established by histology, and"
		in one the diagnosis was based on radiographic and radionuclide evidence of
		"osteomyelitis. The organism responsible was Staphylococcus aureus in two cases,"
		Candida albicans in another two cases and C tropicalis in one case. The septic
		episode that preceded osteomyelitis was treated with systemic antibiotics and
		"catheter removal in four patients, and antibiotics without catheter removal in"
		"one patient. Nevertheless, osteomyelitis occurred, requiring bracing or operative"
		debridement as well as prolonged antibiotic therapy. Spinal osteomyelitis may

TI	-	Increasing fungal isolation from clinical specimens: experience in a university
		hospital over a decade.
PG	-	185-95
AB	-	The local patterns of fungal isolates were studied by a retrospective analysis of
		fungal species isolated from clinical specimens in a university hospital in
		"Jerusalem. Between 1984 and 1993, 5630 fungi [4071 patient unique isolates (PUI)]"
		"were isolated and identified. During the study decade, the annual incidence of"
		"all isolates increased 2.7-fold, and PUI increased 1.6-fold. Candida albicans"
		accounted for 61% of PUI; urine was the source of 53%. The intensive care units
		(ICUs) and the Bone Marrow Transplantation (BMT) Department had the highest
		incidence of fungal isolation. The following trends were observed: (1) a decrease
		in the relative frequency of C. albicans and increase in Candida tropicalis; (2)
		"increased number of isolates from urine, surgical wounds and intra-abdominal"
		sites; (3) increased number of isolates from ICUs and BMT. Fungi are emerging as
		"important hospital-acquired pathogens in tertiary care and teaching hospitals,"
		and are associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. It is important to
		be familiar with the local patterns of fungal isolation in order to improve
		treatment.

TI	-	[Evaluation of risk factors in patients with candiduria].
PG	-	318-24
AB	-	"Urinary system infections are usually bacterial, however, fungal etiology,"
		particularly Candida spp. are encountered in about 10% of these infections.
		C.albicans is still the most frequently isolated species in candiduria. This
		study was aimed to identify the risk factors of candiduria and to determine
		species distribution of Candida which cause candiduria in hospitalized patients.
		"The study was carried out in a total of 93 hospitalized patients (68 female, 25"
		"male; age range: 17-84 yrs, mean age: 59.5 ± 1.7 yrs) of which 50 presented with"
		"candiduria (case group) and 43 with bacteriuria (control group), between January"
		2009 to December 2009. The most frequently isolated species was C.albicans (n=
		"32; 64%), followed by C.glabrata (n= 13; 26%), C.tropicalis (n= 4; 8%) and"
		"C.krusei (n= 1; 2%). All of the isolates except one, were found susceptible to"
		"fluconazole and voriconazole by E-test (AB Biodisk, Sweden), however, C.krusei"
		isolate was resistant to fluconazole and susceptible to voriconazole. The mean
		hospitalization period and the period of stay in intensive care unit (ICU) of the
		"case group (9.56 ± 9.09 and 4.12 ± 7.05 days, respectively) were found"
		"statistically significant compared to control group (4.42 ± 3.71 and 0.53 ± 1.78,"
		respectively) (p< 0.005). Nosocomial origin of infection was higher in control
		"group (n= 45, 90%) than the case group (n= 30, 69.8%), (p= 0.014). The rate of"
		antibiotic use prior to candiduria in the case group was detected significantly
		higher (n= 43; 86%) than the controls (n= 14; 32.6%) (p= 0.000). The most
		frequently used antibiotic prior to candiduria/bacteriuria was the quinolone
		"group of agents both in case and control groups (42% and 21%, respectively). The"
		other risk factors for candiduria found to be higher in the case group than the
		"controls were as follows; presence of urinary system intervention (32% and 0,"
		"respectively; p= 0.000), catheter use (76% and 46.5%, respectively; p= 0.003) and"
		"immunosuppression history (24% and 9.3%, respectively; p= 0.041). However, there"
		was no significant relationship between candiduria and history of surgical
		"intervention, diabetes mellitus and renal failure (p> 0.05). In conclusion, rate"
		"of candiduria might be reduced by judicious antibiotic use, by implementation of"
		"guidelines for urinary catheter use, care and maintenance, and shortening the"
		duration of ICU and hospital stay.

		hospital.
PG	-	602-7
AB	-	"In a retrospective study conducted in an Italian tertiary care hospital, the"
		incidence of nosocomial candidemia was evaluated together with causative
		"pathogens, treatment, and risk factors for death. Over a 6-year period"
		"(1992-1997), a total of 189 episodes of candidemia occurred in 189 patients (mean"
		"age 58+/-19 years), accounting for an average incidence of 1.14 episodes per"
		"10,000 patient-days per year. The most common reasons for hospitalization were"
		"solid neoplasia (21%), trauma (17%), abdominal diseases requiring surgery (13%),"
		and cardiovascular diseases (13%). No patient was neutropenic within 3 weeks
		prior to the onset of candidemia. One hundred thirty patients were hospitalized
		"in intensive care units, 47 patients in surgical wards, and 12 patients in"
		"medical wards. Candida albicans was the most frequently isolated pathogen,"
		"accounting for 54% of fungal isolates, followed by Candida parapsilosis (23%),"
		"Candida glabrata (7%), Candida tropicalis (5%), Candida pelliculosa (4%), Candida"
		"lusitaniae (1%), Candida humicula (1%), and other non-albicans Candida spp. (5%)."
		Seventy-six (41%) patients received adequate antifungal therapy. Seventy-one
		(58%) of the 123 evaluable patients with central venous catheters underwent line
		removal; 51 of them had catheter-related candidemia. The 30-day crude mortality
		"rate was 45%. Older age, hospitalization in an intensive care unit, a longer"
		"duration of candidemia, retention of central lines, and inadequate antifungal"
		"therapy were significantly associated with poor outcome. In the present study,"
		nosocomial candidemia was a frequent and relatively underestimated illness.
		Adequate antifungal therapy and central line removal independently reduced the
		high mortality of the disease.

PG	-	309-18
AB	-	The aim of this study was to evaluate the distributions of yeast species
		according to the years and to detect the emerging pathogens in intensive care
		"units (ICU). For this purpose, yeast isolation rates were detected"
		"retrospectively, in the following time periods: Period I: April-December 2001;"
		period II: January-December 2002; period III: January-December 2003; period IV:
		January-December 2004. A total of 490 yeast isolates recovered from 462 clinical
		specimens obtained from 360 different ICU patients were investigated during these
		"periods. Urine (62.1%), blood (13.6%) and tracheal aspirate (8.7%) samples were"
		"detected as the most common specimens. Of these isolates, 53.3% were identified"
		"as Candida albicans, 14.5% as C. tropicalis, 12.2% as C. glabrata, 6.5% as C."
		"parapsilosis, 4.5% as Trichosporon spp., 3.9% as C. kefyr, 1.6% as C. krusei,"
		1.4% as Geotrichum candidum and 2.1% as other Candida species. The isolation
		"rates of C. albicans in the periods of I to IV were found as 47.7%, 55.5%, 41.7%"
		"and 62.4%, respectively. The decrease between the second and third periods, and"
		increase between third and fourth periods were statistically significant (chi2 =
		"4.15, p = 0.04 and chi2 = 8.32, p = 0.004). C. glabrata was the second most"
		"common species in the first and second periods (14.8% and 15.5%, respectively),"
		"followed by C. tropicalis (12.5% and 10.0%, respectively), however this array has"

		"rates of 16.7% and 16.8%, while C. glabrata placed in the third line with the"
		"rates of 14.8% and 7.6%, respectively). It was concluded that C. albicans has"
		still been the most frequent species among yeast isolates of ICU's in our
		"hospital; however, the incidence of non-albicans species like C. glabrata and C."
		tropicalis has increased.

AB	-	"OBJECTIVE: A one-year prospective, observational study was conducted in the west"
		"of France, to evaluate the epidemiology of candidemia. METHOD: During the year"
		"2004, each patient with at least one blood culture yielding Candida sp. was"
		"included. For each episode of candidemia, mycological, demographical, clinical,"
		"and therapeutic data, as well as outcome, were collected. RESULTS: One hundred"
		"and ninety-three strains of Candida sp. were isolated in 186 patients, Candida"
		"albicans accounting for 54.9%, Candida glabrata for 18.7%, Candida parapsilosis"
		"for 12.9%, Candida tropicalis for 4.7% and Candida krusei for 4.1% of these"
		isolates. A percentage of 84% of the Candida isolates were fully susceptible to
		fluconazole in vitro. Dose-dependent susceptibility or resistance to fluconazole
		"was detected in more than one third of the Candida glabrata strains, of which 36%"
		"were also resistant to voriconazole. Two-thirds of the patients were males, and"
		the mean age was 61.5 years. A percentage of 37% of patients were hospitalized in
		intensive care units. The main predisposing factors for candidemia were
		"broad-spectrum antibiotics (75.8%), central venous catheter (72.6%), cancer or"
		"hematologic malignancy (47.3%), recent surgery (42.5%), total parenteral"
		nutrition (37.6%). One hundred and fifty-four patients were treated with
		"antifungal therapy, two-thirds of whom received fluconazole as first-line agent."
		"Mortality was 49% overall, and was significantly higher in case of septic shock,"
		"advanced age, and absence of catheter removal."

TI	-	Endophthalmitis in patients with disseminated fungal disease.
PG	-	67-70; discussion 70-1
AB	-	BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Fungal endophthalmitis caused by dissemination from
		extraocular fungal infections has been reported to vary between 9% and 45%.
		"However, recent clinical experience disagrees with that. This study is an"
		"investigation of patients in an inner city teaching hospital, the risks"
		"associated with endogenous fungal endophthalmitis, and this incidence. METHODS:"
		All ophthalmology consultations between February 1995 and August 2000 that might
		be associated with disseminated fungal infection were examined in a prospective
		manner. Patients were excluded if there was no evidence of a positive fungal
		culture from any site at any time. Visual symptoms were recorded along with
		"ophthalmologic and systemic examination features. Information was gathered,"
		"including the identity of cultured organisms, the sites from which the organisms"
		"were obtained, and the patients' disposition. RESULTS: During this interval, 170"
		"consultation requests contained the words ""endophthalmitis"" or ""retinitis"" and/or"
		indicated concern about disseminated fungal infections. Extraocular fungal
		"infections were found in 114 patients, but only 82 of them had evidence of"
		systemic dissemination. Some patients had more than one organism. The following
		"are listed in decreasing frequency of occurrence: Candida albicans, Torulopsis"
		"glabrata, Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis, Candida krusei, Aspergillus"
		"niger, and others. Only two patients had evidence of chorioretinitis and"
		progressed to fungal endophthalmitis. CONCLUSIONS: Endophthalmitis was rare among
		these patients with known fungal infections. Less than 2% had any related
		"ophthalmic manifestations. Nevertheless, since treatment can save vision,"
		evidence of intraocular infection should be sought as eagerly as before.

TI	-	Frequency of Candida albicans in Patients with Funguria.
PG	-	113-6
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of Candida albicansin patients with
		funguria. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive cross-sectional study. PLACE AND DURATION OF
		"STUDY: Department of Microbiology, Sindh Institute of Urology and"
		"Transplantation, from July to December 2012. METHODOLOGY: Patients’ urine samples"
		with fungus/Candida were included. Candida albicans was identified by the
		production of tubular structures (germ tubes) on microscopy as per standard
		procedure followed by inoculation on Chrom agar (Oxoid) and Corn Meal-Tween 80
		agar (Oxoid). The identification of other non-albicans Candidaspecies was also
		done both microscopically and macroscopically as per standard procedure. RESULTS:
		"Out of the 289 isolates, 204 (70.6%) were male patients and 85 (29.4%) were"
		"female patients, with 165 (57.1%) from the out-patients and 124 (42.9%) from the"
		in-patients. Five species of Candidawere found to be prevalent including 87
		"(30.1%) Candida albicans, 176 (60.9%) Candida tropicalis, 14 (4.8%) Candida"
		"parapsilosis, 8 (2.8%) Candida glabrata and 4 (1.4%) Candida lusitaniae. Majority"
		of patients with funguria were aged above 50 years (60.2%). CONCLUSION: In the
		"present study, 30.1% patients with funguria had Candida albicans. The most"
		"frequently isolated species was Candida tropicalis(60.9%), followed by other"
		non-albicansCandida. This study has shown the emergence of non-albicans Candidaas
		a major cause of candiduria.

TI	-	Candida tropicalis vertebral osteomyelitis: a late sequela of fungemia.
PG	-	697-703
AB	-	Two adult patients who had undergone bone marrow transplantation had transient
		fungemia due to Candida tropicalis during the posttransplantation neutropenic
		period and later (at 5 and 14 months post-transplantation) developed vertebral
		osteomyelitis due to the same organism. The courses of all adult patients who
		underwent bone marrow transplantation at our center during this time were
		reviewed for determining the frequency of this problem. Molecular typing
		techniques were used to establish the relationship between the organisms isolated
		during the initial fungemia and those causing the subsequent osteomyelitis. Only
		two of 532 adults who received transplants at our center from 1980 to 1993
		"developed candidal osteomyelitis. Moreover, they are part of a subset of 13"
		patients (2.4% of the total) whose cultures were positive for C. tropicalis; five
		of the 13 had fungemia. The study of fungal isolates from prior sites of
		colonization and from blood sampled during the original fungemia and of
		subsequently recovered vertebral bone isolates by means of DNA restriction
		fragment analysis (with use of standard agarose gel electrophoresis or
		"pulsed-field gel electrophoresis) showed that the colonizing, bloodstream, and"
		bone isolates were identical in each case. Transient C. tropicalis fungemia in
		severely immunocompromised patients may cause important late infectious
		"complications, including osteomyelitis. Although these initial septic events may"
		"appear to resolve easily, the outcome in the two cases in this report suggests"
		"that special treatment considerations, such as immediate removal of the central"
		"venous catheter and intensive treatment with amphotericin B, may be required in"
		selected cases for prevention of late sequelae.

TI	-	[Prevalence of Candida albicans and Candida non-albicans in clinical samples
		during 1999-2001].
PG	-	107-12
AB	-	The importance of epidemiological monitoring of yeasts involved in pathologic
		processes is unquestionable due to the increase of these infections over the last
		"decade, the changes observed in species causing candidiasis, and empirical"
		"antifungal treatment. At the Mycology Center, 1006 isolates from a wide range of"
		clinical samples were studied during 1999-2001. Candida albicans (40.3%) was the
		"most isolated species, although, the Candida no albicans species with 54.9%"
		"showed the major prevalence. In blood cultures Candida parapsilosis (34.9%), C."
		albicans (30.2%) and C. tropicalis (25.6%) were recovered most frequently while
		C. glabrata represented only 2.3%. C. albicans with 60%-80% was the predominant
		"specie in mucosal surface. We also detected Candida mediastinistis, which alert"
		us over the importance at this location. Urinary tract infections caused by
		"yeasts were more frequent in hospitalized patients, being C. albicans (47.7%),"
		"the most commonly isolated, followed by C. glabrata (24.8%) and C. tropicalis"
		"(20.0%). In the candidal onychomycoses, C. parapsilosis (37.7%) outplaced C."
		albicans (22.0%). Fluconazole susceptibility studies of Candida species allowed
		"us to conclude that the majority of C. albicans islolates are susceptible, and"
		that the highest resistance averages were observed in C. glabrata (21.41%) and C.
		krusei (69.23%).

		"with 9.03% in 1989 and 2.7% in 1993. Among the molds, Aspergillus spp. was the"
		most frequently isolated genus. Analyzing the etiology of mycologically proven
		"fungal infections confirmed by positive blood cultures or biopsies, C. albicans"
		and Aspergillus spp. were the most common causative organisms.

AB	-	PURPOSE: To report a case of polymicrobial keratitis resistant to topical and
		intraocular antibiotics with recurrence after penetrating keratoplasty. METHODS:
		Case report. RESULTS: We report a case of polymicrobial keratitis caused by
		"Phialophora verrucosa, Candida tropicalis, and Propionibacterium acnes. Initial"
		"treatment included topical vancomycin, tobramycin, amphotericin B, voriconazole,"
		"and oral fluconazole, as well as subconjunctival amphotericin B. Penetrating"
		"keratoplasty was performed, and the infection seemed to have resolved until 4"
		"weeks after keratoplasty. A second penetrating keratoplasty was performed,"
		followed by 4 weekly intracameral injections of voriconazole. Two weeks after the
		"fourth intracameral injection, the infection manifested as an active"
		anterior-chamber reaction. The patient's eye was subsequently enucleated.
		Histopathologic evaluation showed penetration of the crystalline lens by fungus
		at the site of synechiae between the intact lens capsule and iris. CONCLUSIONS:
		"To our knowledge, this is the first documented case of a polymicrobial keratitis"
		"caused by a bacterium, yeast, and a fungus. It is the first histopathologic"
		demonstration of fungal penetration of intact lens capsule from infected iris.

PG	-	211-8
AB	-	Oesophageal candidiasis is an epithelial infection which requires an immune
		"deficiency. C. albicans is commonly the cause, although other species may also be"
		"responsible. Resistance to fluconazole, drug of choice for treatment, is an"
		emerging problem. The objectives of the current paper were: to determine the
		frequency of oesophageal candidiasis in patients submitted to upper
		"gastrointestinal endoscopy, analyze risk factors, identify Candida species and"
		"determine in vitro susceptibility to fluconazole. During 12 months, 34 patients"
		with oesophageal candidiasis were detected. Out of 1.230 HIV negative and 91 HIV
		"positive patients submitted to upper endoscopy, 11 (0.9%) and 23 (25.3%),"
		"respectively, had candidiasis. Risk factors for HIV negative patients were"
		"systemic antibiotic therapy in 2, deficient dental cleaning in 2 aged patients,"
		"use of proton pump inhibitors in 3, inhaled steroids in 2, malignancy in 1 and"
		oral steroids in 1. The histopathologic diagnosis was confirmed in 48.6% of
		"cases. Cultures were positive in 91.2% C. albicans was prevalent (93.5%), and was"
		"associated to other species in 5 cases (16.1%), (3 C. glabrata, 1 C. tropicalis"
		"and 1 C. parapsilosis). One case cultured only C. glabrata and 1, only C"
		"tropicalis. Out of 31 cultures, 25 were susceptible to fluconazole, 4 dose"
		"dependent (1 C. albicans, 3 C. glabrata), and 2 resistant (1 C. albicans, 1 C."
		"glabrata). Frequency of oesophageal candidiasis was low, except for HIV positive"
		"patients. The most common etiologic agent was C. albicans, though other Candida"
		species were also found. C. albicans and C. glabrata showed dose dependency and
		resistance to fluconazole.

TI	-	Cross-sectional study of the susceptibility of Candida isolates to antifungal
		drugs and in vitro-in vivo correlation in HIV-infected patients.
PG	-	945-50
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To investigate (1) the frequency of clinical resistance to oral
		"polyenes or azole treatment for oral candidiasis, (2) the frequency of resistant"
		"in vitro Candida strains, (3) the relationship between the susceptibilities of in"
		vitro Candida species and in vivo status in HIV patients. DESIGN: Prospective
		"cross-sectional study. SETTING: Tertiary care clinic at Bocage Hospital, Dijon,"
		France. PATIENTS: HIV-infected patients with and without oral candidiasis.
		"INTERVENTIONS: Clinical examination, oral swab for mycologic investigations. MAIN"
		"OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical diagnosis of oral candidiasis, identification of the"
		"antifungal treatment given within the previous month, identification of Candida"
		"species, antimycogramm and determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration"
		"(MIC) for fluconazole, and measurement of T-helper cell count. RESULTS: Within a"
		"2-month period, 154 HIV-infected patients were studied: 46 heterosexuals, 51"
		"intravenous drug users (IVDU), 52 homosexuals and five blood transfusion"
		"recipients. The percentages of patients with oral candidiasis were: 41, 80, 44"
		"and 20%, respectively (P < 0.05); the mean T-helper cell counts were 200, 135,"
		"210 and 238 x 10(6)/l cells, respectively (P < 0.05). Twenty-two patients (14.3%)"
		had received recent azole treatment and 29 (18.8%) recent oral polyene treatment.
		"Among the 84 patients with and the 70 patients without oral candidiasis, 78 and"
		"28 Candida strains were isolated, respectively. Although Candida albicans"
		"represented the majority of Candida species (88 strains, 83%), the non-albicans"
		strains were isolated more frequently in patients who had received recent
		"antifungal treatment. No strains were resistant to ketoconazole, miconazole or"
		"econazole; however, six (5.6%), 16 (15%) and 10 (9.5%) were intermediately"
		"susceptible to the three drugs, respectively. Twelve (13.6%) of the 88 C."
		"albicans, five of the six C. (Torulopsis) glabrata, one of the five C. tropicalis"
		and all three C. krusei strains were resistant to fluconazole. These resistant
		strains were separated as follows: 41.1% of C. albicans strains resistant to
		"fluconazole were isolated from patients who had received recent azole therapy,"
		"17.6% from patients who received recent oral polyene, and 3.7% from patients who"
		had not received any recent antifungal treatment (P = 0.004). The mean MIC of
		"these three categories of isolates were 3.6, 1.6 and 0.6 mg/l, respectively (P ="
		0.06). CONCLUSIONS: Oral candidiasis and fluconazole-resistant Candida isolates
		are more frequently found in IVDU. Treatments using azoles select non-albicans
		strains and are associated with decreased susceptibilities of C. albicans strains
		to fluconazole in particular. These findings show that prolonged azole treatment
		in severely immunocompromised patients should be avoided.

AB	-	Objective: To analyze the distribution and drug resistance of pathogens from the
		"wounds of thermal burn patients, so as to provide reliable basis for the rational"
		use of antibiotics and the effective control over nosocomial infection. Methods:
		Wound samples of 1 310 thermal burn patients admitted into our burn wards from
		January 2012 to December 2017 were collected and retrospectively analyzed. API
		bacteria identification panels and automatical bacteria identification equipment
		were used to identify pathogens. E test was conducted to detect drug resistance
		"of pathogens to vancomycin, tigecycline, and oxacillin. Kirby-Bauer paper disk"
		diffusion method was used to detect drug resistance of pathogens to 31
		"antibiotics including penicillin G, gentamicin and rifampicin, etc., and drug"
		"resistance of fungi to 5 antifungal agents (voriconazole, amphotericin B,"
		"fluconazole, itraconazole, and ketoconazole). The WHONET 5.6 software was used to"
		"analyze the constituent ratios of Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria,"
		and fungi in each year; the distribution of fungi; the distribution of top 10
		bacteria with the highest constituent ratios in each year; the constituent ratios
		of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-sensitive
		Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA); the drug resistance of top 3 bacteria with the
		highest constituent ratios to commonly used antibiotics in each year; and the
		drug resistance of Candida to commonly used antifungal agents. Results: (1)
		"Totally 2 183 strains of pathogens were isolated for the first time, including"
		"Gram-negative bacteria 1 194 (54.70%) strains, Gram-positive bacteria 879"
		"(40.27%) strains, and fungi 110 (5.04%) strains. From 2012 to 2016, the"
		"constituent ratio of Gram-negative bacteria showed a decreasing trend, while that"
		of Gram-positive bacteria showed an increasing trend year by year; and the
		constituent ratio of fungi was with a significantly increasing trend from 2016 to
		"2017. (2) Among all the fungi, the constituent ratio of Candida parapsilosis"
		"ranked the first, Aflatoxin ranked the second, Candida albicans and Candida"
		"tropicalis both ranked the third. (3) From 2012 to 2017, top 10 bacteria with the"
		"highest constituent ratios, from high to low, were Staphylococcus aureus,"
		"Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae,"
		"Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Klebsiella pneumoniae,"
		"Enterococcus faecalis, Aeromonas hydrophila, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia"
		respectively. The constituent ratio of Staphylococcus aureus ranked the first in
		each year. The constituent ratio of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was fluctuating but
		showed a rising trend comprehensively. The constituent ratio of Acinetobacter
		"baumannii went up after decreasing. (4) Among all the Staphylococcus aureus,"
		"constituent ratio of MRSA was above 65.00%, while that of MSSA was below 31.00%"
		"in each year. (5) From 2012 to 2017, Staphylococcus aureus resistant to"
		"vancomycin, linezolid, or teicoplanin was not detected; the drug-resistant rates"
		"of MRSA to penicillin G, oxacillin, gentamicin, rifampicin, tetracycline,"
		"ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and levofloxacin were above or equal to 80.0% in each"
		year; the drug-resistant rates of Staphylococcus aureus to clindamycin and
		"erythrocin showed an obviously increasing trend, the drug-resistant rates of"
		Staphylococcus aureus to moxifloxacin and queenoputin/daputin in 2017 were higher
		"than those in 2016, while the drug-resistant rates of Staphylococcus aureus to"
		the other 14 antibiotics showed no significant change in trend. From 2012 to
		"2017, Acinetobacter baumannii was sensitive to polymyxin B and tigecycline; the"
		drug-resistant rate of Acinetobacter baumannii to ceftriaxone was relatively
		"high; the drug-resistant rates of Acinetobacter baumannii to levofloxacin,"
		"minocycline, and tetracycline were decreasing while those to the other 14"
		"antibiotics went up after decreasing. From 2012 to 2017, Pseudomonas aeruginosa"
		"wasn't resistant to polymyxin B, and its drug-resistant rates to the other 14"
		antibiotics showed decreasing trends. (6) The drug-resistant rates of Candida
		"albicans to voriconazole, amphotericin B, fluconazole, itraconazole, and"
		ketoconazole were all zero. The drug-resistant rates of non-Candida albicans to
		"voriconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, and ketoconazole were higher than those"
		of Candida albicans. Conclusions: Among the pathogens from the wounds of thermal
		"burn patients, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter"
		baumannii had the top 3 constituent ratios; the constituent ratio of non-Candida
		albicans was obviously higher than that of Candida albicans. The high drug
		resistance rates of Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumanni require more
		attention from clinicians and the local hospital's infection control department.

AB	-	Candida arthritis in patient with hematological malignancy is rare. A case of
		Candida tropicalis arthritis of knee occurred in a patient with acute monocytic
		leukemia was reported during the recovery phase of post chemotherapy
		myelosuppression and agranulocytosis. The patient was diagnosed as Candida
		tropicalis arthritis of knee according to the Candida tropicalis isolated from
		the synovial fluid. Itraconazole and amphotericin B were intravenously injected
		"for therapy for 4 - 5 weeks based on the susceptibility test in vitro, which"
		showed better efficacy. But the arthritis relapsed at 4 - 6 weeks after the drug
		withdrawal. The curative effect was found in patient after treatment with
		fluconazole injection and articular cavity douching with amphotericin B for 8
		"weeks. In conclusion, although Candida arthritis in patient with hematological"
		"malignancy is rare, it still occurred in the patient with hypoimmunity. The"
		treatment emphasis showed be placed on the full dosage and full treatment course
		of antifungal agent.

PG	-	89-93
AB	-	The incidence rate of invasive infections due to Candida species has increased
		"drastically in the last 20 years, causing a 40% mortality rate in hospitalized"
		patients. In order to comprehend the epidemiology of Candida bloodstream
		"infection, the study was carried out. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective"
		study was done based on microbiology laboratory reports from five terciary care
		hospitals from the city of Cordoba between January 2010 and August 2012. RESULTS:
		"158 patients had candidemia, the average age was 55,8 years, and 54% of patients"
		"were in the intensive care unit. Candida albicans (44%), Candida parapsilosis"
		(22%) and Candida tropicalis (12%) were the main fungi isolated. Candida
		parapsilosis was commonly associated with catether infections. CONCLUSIONS: The
		"data from the city of Cordoba showed that C. albicans, C. parapsilosis y C."
		tropicalis were the more frequent species isolated from blood cultures. This is
		similar to what is seen in other series published from Argentina and
		Latinamerica. This study may have implications when it comes to deciding which
		empiric antifugal agent is best for the treatment of candidemia.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical characteristics of nosocomial septicemia in
		the early stage after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in children
		with major β-thalassemia. METHODS: The clinical data were retrospectively
		analyzed of 55 consecutive children with major β-thalassemia who developed
		"septicemia early after HSCT between January, 2011 and June, 2016. RESULTS: Among"
		the total of 416 consecutive children with major β-thalassemia undergoing
		"allogeneic HSCT, the incidence of nosocomial infection early after"
		"transplantation was 77.16% (321/416), and 55 (17.13%) children showed positive"
		findings in blood culture test. The infections occurred most commonly in the oral
		"cavity (65.5%), followed by the respiratory tract, intestinal tract and skin."
		"Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli (27.3%), Klebsiella pneumoniae"
		"(21.8%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9.1%), were the most common causes of"
		infections. Fungal (Candida tropicalis) infection caused septicemia in 1 case. Of
		"all the pathogens, extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria were"
		"found in 6 cases, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in 2 cases,"
		and multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria in 2 cases. CONCLUSION: Gram-negative
		bacteria are the major pathogens causing septicemia in children early after HSCT
		"for major β-thalassemia, and the bacteria show a high level of drug resistance."
		"Adequate preventive use of antibiotics and care of the oral cavity, the"
		"respiratory tract, and the perianal region following the transplantation are"
		important measures to control nosoconial infection in these children.

PG	-	373-9
AB	-	The aim of this study was to detect fungi in three ontocenoses of 947 women (aged
		20-45). The prevalence of multifocal fungal infections in women varied from 62.2
		+/- 2.99% to 81.0 +/- 3.92% in different ontocenoses. They assumed the following
		"mean values: 38.4 +/- 1.77% for the vagina, 42.2 +/- 1.80% for the oral cavity,"
		and 25.0 +/- 1.58% for the anus. The clinical manifestations of sexual organs
		inflammations were statistically significantly (p < 0.01) more frequent in women
		infected with fungi than in those without fungi in the vaginal ontocenosis. The
		highest convergence of the fungi presence with subjective and objective symptoms
		(assessed using the Yule Q index value) concerned: pruritus of the vulva or/and
		"vaginal walls, burning sensation or painful urethra, as well as oedema of the"
		"external opening of the urethra, vulva or/and the vagina (Q from +0.808 to"
		"+0.970). However, there was no statistically significant convergence between"
		occurrence of the fungi and vaginal discharge and painful hypogastrium. Based on
		"more than 40 phenotypical features (morphological, biochemical) of the axenic"
		"strains originating from vaginal, oral, and anal ontocenoses, a total of 12"
		"species of fungi were identified: Candida albicans, C. guilliermondii, C. krusei,"
		"C. tropicalis, C. kefyr, C. utilis, C. humicola, C. viswanathii, C. glabrata, C."
		"parapsilosis, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, and Geotrichum candidum. For"
		"intraspecific features, depending on the profile of the compounds used for"
		"auxanogram, 9 codes were read for Candida albicans and only one code for each of"
		other species was detected. In API ZYM test based on assessment of 19 hydrolase
		activities the enzymograms of species included from 6 to 11 enzymes.

PG	-	247-53

		compared over periods of 15 months (10/87 to 12/88 and 1/91 to 3/92) before and
		after the introduction of fluconazole. The following changes could be
		demonstrated: 1. In all specimens analysed the number of Candida albicans
		"isolates decreased, while the number of Candida tropicalis isolates remained"
		almost unchanged. 2. During the observation period the number of Candida glabrata
		isolates doubled. In 1991 C. glabrata was second to C. albicans as the most
		"common of all fungal isolates, appearing in 8.6% of all specimens. 3. The total"
		"number of Candida krusei isolates increased only slightly, but the rise in the"
		number of isolates in bronchial secretions was statistically significant. 4. The
		"prevalence of rarely isolated Candida yeasts, such as Candida guilliermondii,"
		"Candida lipolytica and Candida kefyr, and Candida isolates which were not further"
		differentiated increased. 5. During the observation period the number of mixed
		cultures showed a fourfold increase. C. glabrata and C. krusei were associated in
		more than 75% of all isolates with C. albicans or C. tropicalis respectively. 6.
		The number of mould isolates increased. These changes in the spectra of fungal
		isolates are discussed with respect to the broad therapeutic and prophylactic
		usage of fluconazole in the University Hospital of Göttingen.

TI	-	Acute conjunctivitis associated with biofilm formation on a punctal plug.
PG	-	559-60
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Punctal plugs are used for the treatment of tear-deficient type dry
		eye. We recently examined a case of acute conjunctivitis associated with
		bacterial biofilm formation on a punctal plug. CASE: A 63-year-old woman
		diagnosed as having tear-deficient type dry eye came to our hospital with a
		complaint of soreness in her right eye. Punctal plugs had been inserted into this
		"eye 5 1/2 months previously. On the day of her visit, she presented with acute"
		"conjunctivitis. OBSERVATIONS: In biomicroscopical examination, the top of the"
		punctal plug was seen to be covered with a whitish soft material. Microbiological
		analysis performed on a part of this material was positive for Staphylococcus
		haemolyticus and Candida tropicalis. Scanning electron microscopy of the removed
		punctal plug revealed widespread bacterial colonization embedded within an
		extensive extracellular matrix. Treatment consisted of the replacement of the
		"plug, and administration of a combination of antibacterial eyedrops and"
		"preservative-free artificial solution. As a result, the acute conjunctivitis"
		cleared up within 1 month. CONCLUSIONS: This case suggests that a punctal plug
		poses a potential risk of causing the formation of bacterial biofilm. In such a
		"case, replacement of the plug and/or removal of the accumulated materials should"
		be considered.

		"(Medical University Graz) have been studied. Altogether, 10,463 samples from"
		"patients with vulvovaginal complaints were analysed in the years 2000-2004, a"
		number of 3184 proved to be culture-positive for yeast. Candida albicans was the
		most prevalent cause in 87.9% of all cases. Non-albicans Candida yeast were
		"detected in 12.1%, mainly C. glabrata and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. During a"
		1-year period 185 patients showed more than one episode of VVC. Patients aged
		21-40 years were significantly more prone to suffer from VVC compared with other
		age-related groups.

TI	-	Case Report. Tinea pedis and onychomycosis in primary school children in Turkey.
PG	-	198-201
AB	-	A cross-sectional study was performed in two primary schools with different
		"socioeconomic status in the suburban and central areas of Manisa, Turkey, in"
		order to determine the prevalence of tinea pedis and onychomycosis. A full
		dermatological examination and a questionnaire on socioeconomic conditions were
		performed in a group of 785 randomly selected children aged 6-14. Of 9 clinically
		"suspected tinea pedis and 4 onychomycoses cases, KOH examination (direct"
		"microscopy) and/or mycological cultures were positive in six boys, in whom"
		Candida glabrata and C. tropicalis grew. Older age and higher number of siblings
		were found to be significant factors for fungal infection.

TI	-	Silver-sulfadiazine eschar pigmentation mimics invasive wound infection: a case
		report.
PG	-	154-7
AB	-	"A 3-year-old girl with 52% TBSA scalds, mostly partial thickness, was treated"
		topically with 5% mafenide acetate solution and 1% silver sulfadiazine cream. All
		blood cultures and wound swabs were negative for the first 5 days. On day 6
		gram-negative bacteria and yeast forms were isolated from her wounds. High fever
		and leukocytosis were present and the child was treated with intravenous
		ampicillin and gentamicin according to sensitivity bacteriogram. The bacteria
		were identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the yeast was Candida tropicalis.
		"On day 7, Escherichia coli was identified in blood cultures and intravenous"
		cefixime was added. Amphotericin B was added on day 9 when blood cultures grew
		Candida tropicalis and Burkholderia cepacia. On day 13 dark pigmentation foci
		"developed on some areas of partial-thickness burns in the back, resembling"
		"invasive wound infection. White blood cell count was 14,300 cells/mm3, and her"
		body temperature reached 39.7 degrees C. Cultures from the pigmented areas were
		"negative, and biopsies revealed deposits of silver. Most of the areas healed"
		"uneventfully, and only about 8% TBSA needed grafting, including some of the"
		pigmented areas. No residual pigmentation remained on discharge.

TI	-	Secular trends in the epidemiology of nosocomial fungal infections at a teaching
		"hospital in Taiwan, 1981 to 1993."
PG	-	369-75
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To describe the incidence and patterns of nosocomial fungal infection
		"in a large teaching hospital in Taiwan. DESIGN: Prospective, hospitalwide"
		nosocomial surveillance data from 1981 through 1993 were analyzed to show the
		secular trend in nosocomial fungal infection rates and to identify the most
		common pathogens and sites of infection (other than skin) in this hospital.
		SETTING AND PATIENTS: The National Taiwan University Hospital is a medical
		"school-affiliated hospital in the city of Taipei, Taiwan, with a 1200-bed"
		capacity before 1991 and 1500 beds since 1992. It provides both primary and
		tertiary medical care. RESULTS: The overall nosocomial fungal infection rate rose
		from 0.9 infections per 1000 discharges in 1981 to 6.6 per 1000 discharges in
		"1993, with the highest rate at the medical intensive-care unit (26.5/1000"
		discharges in 1993). This increase in infection rate was found at four major
		"anatomic sites of infection, particularly including the bloodstream"
		(0.08-2.19/1000 discharges) and the urinary tract (0.36-2.95/1000 discharges). Of
		"256 pathogens causing nosocomial fungemia from 1981 through 1993, Candida"
		"albicans was the most commonly isolated (50.8%), followed by Candida tropicalis"
		"(17.6%). Candida parapsilosis (11.7%), and Candida glabrata (8.2%). As compared"
		"to isolates from 1981 through 1988, the proportion of C parapsilosis and C"
		"glabrata isolated between 1989 and 1993 increased more than sixfold and fourfold,"
		respectively. The increasing importance of fungal infections was confirmed
		further by the increased use of amphotericin B and azoles in this hospital.
		CONCLUSIONS: Candida species and other yeasts have become a prominent cause of
		nosocomial infections in this hospital. These fungal pathogens accounted for a
		higher proportion of nosocomial bloodstream and urinary infections than any
		"single bacterial species. Therefore, it is important to conduct a prospective"
		epidemiological study and to establish in vitro antifungal susceptibility testing
		to enhance efforts to control nosocomial fungal infections and to minimize the
		risk of emergence of antifungal resistance.

AB	-	The use of improved microbiological procedures associated with molecular
		"techniques has increased the identification of Candida bloodstream infections,"
		even if the isolation of more than one species by culture methods remains
		uncommon. We report the cases of two children presenting with severe
		gastrointestinal disorders and other risk factors that contribute to Candida
		"infections. In the first patient, C. albicans DNA was initially detected by a"
		"nested-amplification and C. tropicalis was found later during hospitalization,"
		"while blood cultures were persistently negative. In the second child, there was"
		"amplification of C. albicans and C. glabrata DNA in the same samples, but blood"
		cultures yielded only C. albicans. Both patients received antifungal therapy but
		had unfavorable outcomes. These two cases illustrate that PCR was more successful
		than culture methods in detecting Candida in the bloodstream of high risk
		"children, and was also able to detect the presence of more than one species in"
		the same patient that might impact therapy when the fungi are resistant to azole
		compounds.

TI	-	"Triazole cross-resistance among Candida spp.: case report, occurrence among"
		"bloodstream isolates, and implications for antifungal therapy."
PG	-	529-35
AB	-	Candida spp. are common causes of bloodstream infections among hospitalized
		patients. Fluconazole (FLC) remains a first-line therapy for candidemia; and
		"voriconazole (VRC), an expanded-spectrum triazole, was recently approved for the"
		treatment of candidemia in nonneutropenic patients. In vitro studies have
		suggested that VRC has potent activity against Candida spp. with reduced
		susceptibilities to FLC. We present a case report of invasive candidiasis and
		candidemia due to a Candida glabrata isolate that developed resistance to all
		currently available triazole antifungals after a course of FLC treatment. This
		case prompted us to determine the frequency of cross-resistance among bloodstream
		"Candida isolates collected during a recent 12-month period at a large, academic"
		medical center. FLC MICs were determined for 125 of 153 isolates (81.7%). Thirty
		of 125 isolates (24%) were resistant or showed reduced susceptibilites to FLC
		(MICs >/= 16 microg/ml). When 28 of these 30 isolates were tested for their VRC
		"susceptibilities, 9 (32%) had MICs that were >/=2 microg/ml. Five of these nine"
		"isolates were C. glabrata, two isolates were Candida tropicalis, one isolate was"
		"Candida albicans, and one isolate was Candida parapsilosis. All five Candida"
		krusei isolates tested had VRC MICs </=0.5 microg/ml. These data have prompted
		the introduction of reflexive FLC susceptibility testing of first bloodstream
		Candida isolates at our institution. The case report and our data also suggest
		that VRC should be avoided as initial therapy in unstable patients with invasive
		"candidiasis, particularly in the setting of prior azole exposure. Studies are"
		needed to define the clinical significance of in vitro resistance to the newer
		antifungal agents.

AB	-	Nosocomial candidemia is the 4(th) most common pathogen in blood stream
		infection. Emergence of non-albicans Candida species with often intrinsically
		resistance fluconazole pattern may lead to difficulty in management of
		septicemia. Although the present study isolated 80% of non albicans candida
		"species with C.tropicalis as the most common (35%) species, 96% of our Candida"
		species isolated were sensitive to fluconazole. The probable causes of low
		resistance pattern to fluconazole in our institute are discussed. It is however
		necessary to identify the complete clinical response to the given treatment.
		"Therefore, appropriate identification of species with susceptibility testing"
		would be advisable before start of anti-fungals. This would prevent emergence of
		fluconazole resistance.

AB	-	CONTEXT: Infection is a major determinant in the outcome of patients with cancer.
		AIMS: The aim was to know the epidemiology and outcome of patients with cancer in
		a cancer care center in Eastern India. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Retrospective study
		"of pediatric patients in Tata Medical Center, Kolkata, India. METHODS: Patients"
		(n = 262) between the age group of 0 and 18 years were reviewed for infections
		and infection-related outcome (January to December 2013). STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:
		Modified Wald method was used to determine confidence interval of proportions.
		RESULTS: Gram-negative bacteria were found to be the most common cause of
		"bloodstream infections (BSIs) (56.4%), followed by Gram-positive cocci (34.5%),"
		and Candida species (9.1%). Carbapenem-resistance was noted among 24% of
		"Gram-negative bacilli (GNB), and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase among 64% of"
		GNBs. A single case of Vibrio cholerae septicemia was also noted. No case of
		"vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus was observed, whereas only two cases of"
		methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (1/3 of all Staphylococcus
		"aureus bacteremia) were detected. Escherichia coli, followed by Klebsiella,"
		"Pseudomonas, and Acinetobacter were the predominant organisms detected in BSIs."
		"Among Candida spp. BSIs no resistance to caspofungin, amphotericin B,"
		"Voriconazole was noted. Candida tropicalis was the most common isolate, and 1"
		isolate of Candida glabrata showed dose-dependent sensitivity to fluconazole.
		Three out of 25 patients died of multi-drug resistant Gram-negative bacteria
		(12%) in 2013. Seventeen patients had radiological evidence of invasive fungal
		infections (no mortality was noted). CONCLUSIONS: Periodic review of
		"infection-related data, as well as infection control practices, is essential to"
		optimize clinical outcome in patients with pediatric malignancies.

		The aim of the study was to speciate Candida species and to determine antifungal
		susceptibility pattern of Candida species to antifungal agents. METHODS: A total
		of 100 consecutive Candida species were isolated from 1248 clinical specimens
		over 7 months period. Growths on Sabouraud dextrose agar were evaluated for
		"colony appearance, macroscopic examination, Gram staining, germ tube test and"
		"urea hydrolysis test. Further, they were processed for Candida speciation on"
		CHROMagar. Antifungal susceptibility testing was performed as recommended by
		Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M44-A document. RESULTS: Out
		"of 100 Candida isolates, Candida albicans (56%) was the most common species."
		"Among the non-albicans Candida species, Candida tropicalis (20%) was the"
		predominant isolate followed by Candida glabrata (14%). Regarding antifungal
		"susceptibility pattern, Candida species were more susceptible to clotrimazole"
		(82%) followed by fluconazole (64%) and miconazole (44%). CONCLUSIONS: Candida
		albicans was the predominant species responsible for various Candidal infections.
		"Among commonly used antifungal drugs clotrimazole, miconazole and fluconazole"
		were most effective.

AB	-	PURPOSE: Postoperative endophthalmitis is a dreaded outcome of any intraocular
		surgery. Fungal endophthalmitis is a particularly severe complication that poses
		a significant threat of blindness. We experienced seven consecutive cases of
		postoperative fungal endophthalmitis stemming from a single local clinic in which
		extensive early intervention resulted in favorable final visual acuity. METHODS:
		The present study is retrospective observational case series of fungal
		"endophthalmitis. The initial case, as diagnosed by fungal culture, resulted in"
		"blindness. In the ensuing eight months, seven consecutive cases were referred to"
		our institution. All were presumed to be fungal endophthalmitis as the cases
		possessed similar inflammatory findings to the preceding case and occurred in the
		same environment. Extensive surgical and antifungal treatment was immediately
		"administered, including complete vitrectomy with removal of the intraocular lens"
		and lens capsule and Amphotericin B injections. RESULTS: Retinal infiltration was
		identified in three cases and the lesion site was photocoagulated with an
		endolaser. All cases were confirmed fungal endophthalmitis by culture (4 cases:
		"Candida parapsilosis, one case each: Fusarium, Acremonium, Candida tropicalis)"
		and five cases required secondary intraocular lens implantation. Final corrected
		visual acuity ranged from 20/20 to 40/200 by the Snellen chart. CONCLUSIONS:
		Early extensive surgical intervention and antifungal agent administration may
		result in favorable visual outcomes in patients with fungal endophthalmitis
		following cataract surgery.

TI	-	Candidemia and the susceptibility pattern of Candida isolates in blood.
PG	-	1060-3
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: Candida species has become one of the most common blood isolates as
		well as one of the leading causes of nosocomial bloodstream infections. The
		purpose of our study was to determine the prevalence of Candida species among our
		bloodstream infecting organisms and the susceptibility pattern of the Candida
		isolates to antifungal agents. METHODS: A prospective study was carried out in
		"the Division of Microbiology, King Khalid National Guard Hospital, Jeddah,"
		Kingdom of Saudi Arabia of all positive blood cultures for Candida species. The
		study took place from 1st January 1998 to March 2002. Identification and
		susceptibility pattern of isolates were determined by the Candifast technique to
		"amphotericin B, fluconazole, nystatin, Flucytosine, econazole, ketoconazole and"
		"miconazole. RESULTS: Over a 2-year period, 17,916 blood cultures were performed"
		"in our hospital. There were 2,972 positive cultures, of which 83 (2.8%) patients"
		"had Candida species isolated from their bloodstream. Of these, 38 (46%) were"
		Candida albicans (C.albicans). The remaining 45 strains were made up of Candida
		tropicalis 9 (10.8%); Candida parapsilosis 9 (10.8%); Candida species 9 (10.8%);
		Candida guilliermondi 6 (7.2%); Candida krusei 5 (6%); Candida glabrata 4 (4.8%);
		Candida pseudotropicalis 2 (2.4%) and Trichosporon species 1 (1.2%). All Candida
		"species were susceptible to amphotericin B. However, only 18 (47%) out of 38"
		"C.albicans were susceptible to fluconazole, while only 8 (17.7%) of 45"
		non-C.albicans strains were susceptible to this drug. CONCLUSION: The
		susceptibility of C.albicans to fluconazole in our hospital using the Candifast
		method is very low (47%). These results need to be confirmed by carrying out the
		Etest or the NCCLS M27-A method to confirm the true susceptibilities of Candida
		strains in our locality.

AB	-	A patient with a purulent pericarditis due to Candida tropicalis is described. A
		77-year-old woman undergoing chemotherapy for Hodgkin's disease was admitted to
		the hospital with a history of several febrile episodes. She was thought to be
		"septic and was begun on broad-spectrum antibiotics, despite treatment, however,"
		"the patient expired. Among the multiple premortem blood, urine, and cerebrospinal"
		"fluid cultures, one blood culture yielded C. tropicalis 2 days postmortem."
		Autopsy revealed purulent pericarditis accompanied by endocarditis and
		myocarditis due to culture-proven C. tropicalis. This is the first reported case
		of purulent pericarditis complicating systemic infection with this organism and
		is indicative of the fulminant course of fungal pericarditis.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Treatment options for onychomycosis are numerous but of limited
		"efficacy, potentially dangerous and/or relatively restrictive. PATIENTS AND"
		METHODS: We describe the first case of Candida tropicalis onychomycosis resistant
		to standard topical treatments successfully treated with four sessions of Nd:YAG
		laser in Short Pulse mode. The efficacy of treatment was verified at 3 months via
		a negative control sample and was maintained for at least 6 months. DISCUSSION:
		Nd:YAG laser is a versatile type of laser widely used in dermatology. Its mode of
		action in the treatment of onychomycosis may consist of a thermal effect that is
		"non-specific but differentiates between healthy nail and diseased nail, which"
		respond differently to impact. The main interest of this case is in helping to
		pave the way for a new type of treatment for onychomycosis.

PG	-	1195-7
AB	-	A 79-year-old male with acute myelogenous leukemia developed acute right knee
		"arthritis during admission, after the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics before"
		chemotherapy. The initial synovial fluid sample appeared to be mildly
		inflammatory with a low white cell count. The fungal septic arthritis was not
		"diagnosed until Candida tropicalis, a rare species of Candida, was isolated in"
		the synovial fluid. Although fluconazole is effective in treating the
		"microorganism, the untreated leukemia rendered the infection incurable and led to"
		the growth of fluconazole-resistant Candida krusei. We reported the unusual case
		of fungal arthritis and reviewed the literature.

PG	-	132-5
AB	-	A patient with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia who had previously been treated
		with cladribine presented with septic arthritis caused by Escherichia coli. The
		"patient's condition subsequently deteriorated, and he succumbed to pneumonia and"
		mixed fungaemia due to Candida tropicalis and Penicillium marneffei. Profound
		lymphopenia coexisted with fungaemia. This is the first reported case of mixed
		Penicillium marneffei and Candida fungaemia and penicilliosis marneffei in a
		patient with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia. Penicilliosis marneffei should be
		considered as a potential complication in patients with markedly impaired
		cell-mediated immunity who have travelled to or resided in endemic areas.
		Patients who have undergone therapy with purine nucleoside analogues such as
		fludarabine and cladribine are also at risk.

TI	-	Fungal infection of ventriculoperitoneal shunts in children.
PG	-	1049-53
AB	-	Infection is still the most common complication of shunt procedures in children.
		"However, fungal infection is still considered to be rare. We found that fungi"
		accounted for 17% of shunt infections (8 of 48) in a retrospective study. All of
		the patients were premature babies and had received a ventriculoperitoneal shunt
		because of hydrocephalus. The clinical manifestations were subtle and insidious.
		The time of onset of infection ranged from 1 month to 1 year after the insertion
		of the shunt. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid of infected patients showed
		mild pleocytosis with an elevated protein concentration. Candida species
		"(including Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis, and Candida tropicalis) or"
		"Torulopsis glabrata were isolated. In all but one case, shunts were removed and"
		systemic therapy with amphotericin B was administered. Amphotericin B was given
		"intrathecally to two patients, who did not respond to systemic therapy. Treatment"
		with fluconazole failed for one patient. We suggest performing fungal cultures in
		"cases of shunt infection, especially those involving premature infants."
		"Extraventricular drainage, systemic therapy with amphotericin B, and insertion of"
		a new shunt remain the principal components of the treatment regimen for fungal
		shunt infections in children.

AB	-	Results from a cross-sectional observational study on candidemia conducted at
		"Hospital de Clínicas, Federal University of Paraná, are presented. From January"
		"2001 to December 2004, one hundred candidemia cases were evaluated. The incidence"
		"was 1.27 episodes per 1,000 hospitalizations and Candida was the eighth most"
		frequently isolated agent from bloodstream infections. The patients ages ranged
		"from five days to 89 years, with a mean of 32 years. Sixty percent of the cases"
		occurred in adults (66% > 50 years old) and 40% in children (52% < one year old).
		Fifty-nine percent had been admitted to medical wards and 41% to the intensive
		care unit. Candida albicans was the most (59%) frequent species followed by
		Candida tropicalis (15%) and Candida parapsilosis (9%). The most (97%) prevalent
		"coexisting conditions were the use of antibacterial drugs, central venous"
		"catheter (77%), H2 blockers (57%), total parenteral nutrition (49%) and admission"
		"to the intensive care unit (41%). Out of the 51 isolates tested, three of Candida"
		glabrata presented dose-dependent susceptibility to fluconazole and resistance to
		itraconazole. One sample of Candida krusei presented dose-dependent
		susceptibility to fluconazole and one of Candida pelliculosa presented
		"dose-dependent susceptibility to itraconazole. Among the study population, 68%"
		"received antifungal therapy, but the mortality was 56%."

AB	-	Acute disseminated candidiasis is a serious and difficult problem often seen in
		immunocompromised states. Appearance of a characteristic skin eruption is helpful
		in the diagnostic. We report below a case report of an eight year old girl with
		aplastic anemia who had received multiple courses of antibiotics. A profuse
		"monomorphic papular nodular eruption subsequently appeared on the face, palms and"
		soles. Candida tropicalis was identified from the skin biopsy taken from one such
		lesion.

AB	-	Candida spp. vertebral osteomyelitis is rare. Clinical presentation is
		unspecific. Diagnosis requires mycological culture of a biopsy specimen.
		Therapeutic management is based on prolonged course of azole or liposomal
		amphotericin B. We report the case of Candida tropicalis vertebral osteomyelitis
		"with epidural involvement in a 27 years-old male patient, followed for"
		S-β-thalassemia and with a history of candidemia. The fungus was isolated from a
		needle biopsy of the vertebral disk. The outcome was favorable under antifungal
		treatment by amphotericin B and voriconazole.

AB	-	Herein we report the confirmation of fungus balls (circular collections of
		"C.tropicalis) during a transurethral ureterolithotomy, which is as far as we know"
		the first reported instance. A-61-year old man was referred to the urology
		department with bilateral ureteral calculi. Initially a transurethral
		ureterolithotomy was attempted but residual stones existed. During the second
		"operation, we found numerous white fluffy material in the renal pelvis. Because"
		"of them, we were unable to have a clear field of vision to complete operation."
		"During the third operation, we found the fungus balls again and cultured them."
		Cultures yielded C.tropicalis.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: The efficiency of a novel differential culture medium, CHROM-agar"
		"Candida, is evaluated in order to differentiation and presumptive identification"
		"of clinically important yeasts. METHODS: We studied 600 clinical yeast strains,"
		"pertaining to 8 genera (Candida, Cryptococcus, Geotrichum, Rhodotorula,"
		"Trichosporon, Kluyveromyces, Pichia and Saccharomyces) and 27 species. Strains"
		were previously identified by conventional methods and by commercial system ATB
		"ID32C (Bio-Mérieux). RESULTS: Four species (C. albicans, C. krusei, C. tropicalis"
		"and t. beigelii) were presumptive recognized after 48-72 hours of incubation,"
		regarding their colonial morphology and color. Colony color of other species
		showed low specificity. CONCLUSION: CHROM-agar Candida medium is recommended for
		recognition of mixed yeast cultures and differentiation of the common clinically
		yeast species.

PG	-	47-51
AB	-	Retrospective evaluation of candidaemia patients was performed in an Indian
		teaching hospital over a 10-year period. The incidence of patients with
		candidaemia increased eleven-fold in the second half of the study period (55
		patients) compared with the first half (5 patients). Haematological malignancies
		"(11 patients), neonatal septicaemia (9), cardiac abnormalities and cardiac"
		surgery (9) were the commonest underlying diseases in these patients. Candida
		"albicans (50%), C. guilliermondii (17%), C. tropicalis (15%) and C. parapsilosis"
		(8%) were the most common fungal pathogens isolated from blood culture. Therapy
		"with two or more antibiotics (92%), corticosteroid administration (25%),"
		intravascular catheter use for over 24 h (78%) and neutropenia (48%) were the
		accountable predisposing factors. Prolonged hospitalization (mean average 22.2
		days as compared with 11.2 days in other patients) was an added risk factor in
		these patients.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive fungal diseases have increased in recent years. Candida
		"species are the most common aetiology. Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis,"
		"Candida tropicalis, Candida glabrata and Candida krusei are the cause of most of"
		them. The aim of this work is to describe the first isolation of Candida fabianii
		in the blood of a non-neonatal paediatric patient. CASE REPORT: A 2 year-old male
		"with short bowel syndrome, severe malnutrition, and hypophosphataemic rickets"
		deficiency was admitted to paediatric intensive care due to a respiratory tract
		infection and suspicion of an intestinal pseudo-obstruction. He received several
		cycles of broad-spectrum antibiotics for several infections due to Pseudomonas
		aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. After the surgical correction of the intestinal
		disorder he suffered a new episode of sepsis where yeasts were isolated by
		culture. The species identification was performed by means of mass spectrometry
		"(MALDI-TOF system, Bruker Daltonic). The identity of the isolate was C.fabianii"
		(anamorph)/Pichia fabianii (teleomorph) with a score of 2.149. Antifungal
		"treatment with caspofungin was prescribed, with good progress of the patient."
		CONCLUSIONS: Molecular techniques are important for the identification of these
		"species, although mass spectrometry offered a reliable and rapid diagnosis."
		Treatment with caspofungin was effective.

PG	-	e106949

LID	-	e106949
AB	-	Some emerging but less common human fungal pathogens are known environmental
		"species and could be of low virulence. Meanwhile, some species have natural"
		"antifungal drug resistance, which may pose significant clinical diagnosis and"
		treatment challenges. Implant breast augmentation is one of the most frequently
		"performed surgical procedures in China, and fungal infection of breast implants"
		"is considered rare. Here we report the isolation of a rare human fungal species,"
		"Quambalaria cyanescens, from a female patient in China. The patient had undergone"
		bilateral augmentation mammoplasty 11 years ago and was admitted to Peking Union
		Medical College Hospital on 15 September 2011 with primary diagnosis of breast
		infection. She underwent surgery to remove the implant and fully recovered
		"thereafter. During surgery, implants and surrounding tissues were removed and"
		sent for histopathology and microbiology examination. Our careful review showed
		that there was no solid histopathologic evidence of infection apart from
		"inflammation. However, a fungal strain, which was initially misidentified as"
		"""Candida tropicalis"" because of the similar appearance on CHROMagar Candida, was"
		"recovered. The organism was later on re-identified as Q. cyanescens, based on"
		sequencing of the rDNA internal transcribed spacer region rather than the D1/D2
		domain of 26S rDNA. It exhibited high MICs to 5-flucytosine and all
		"echinocandins, but appeared more susceptible to amphotericin B and azoles tested."
		The possible pathogenic role of Q. cyanescens in breast implants is discussed in
		"this case, and the increased potential for misidentification of the isolate is a"
		cause for concern as it may lead to inappropriate antifungal treatment.

AB	-	A 60 year-old woman with hip dysplasia battled with duodenal cancer that was
		"complicated with Candida tropicalis sepsis. Two years later, the patient"
		underwent a total hip arthroplasty (THA). She complained of a persisting
		low-grade fever and local heat on the THA scar. Arthrocentesis of the hip was
		performed and the Candida tropicalis was detected. Debridement and polyethylene
		liner/modular head exchange were performed 28 days after the primary THA.
		Fluconazole was administrated for one year. The patient reported no symptoms five
		years later. It was found that periprosthetic infection could be prevented by
		implant preservation surgery.

TI	-	"[Candida infections in premature infants weighing less than 1,500 g."
		Mucocutaneous colonization and incidence of systemic infections].
PG	-	633-8
AB	-	BACKGROUND: An increasing incidence of systemic candidiasis has been reported in
		low birth weight infants requiring intensive care. We have retrospectively
		analyzed mucocutaneous Candida-colonization and infection rate in 422 preterm
		"infants with a birthweight < 1,500 g. METHODS: All infants were treated at the"
		"NICU, University of Göttingen, from 1/1985-5/1991. 359 neonates (85%) were on"
		"mechanical ventilation, no prophylactic antimycotic regimen was applied."
		Mucocutaneous swabs and cultures from various anatomic sites were regularly
		obtained from all infants. RESULTS: 37/422 preterm infants (8.8%) had
		"mucocutaneous colonization with candida, none of our patients developed systemic"
		candidiasis. In 7 mechanically ventilated patients (1.9%) Candida albicans or
		Candida tropicalis was repeatedly detected in the bronchial secretions; 1 patient
		who had invasive Candida-pneumonia was effectively treated with 5-Fluocytosin and
		Fluconazol. 4/352 (1.1%) central silastic catheters were colonized with Candida
		albicans; none of these patients required specific treatment. CONCLUSION: The low
		rate of mucocutaneous Candida-colonization and invasive infection found in our
		patients may be explained--at least in part--by epidemiological and obstetrical
		factor as well as by the procedures of the neonatal management.

AB	-	An ECMM epidemiological prospective survey of candidaemia was performed in one
		Italian region (Lombardy; population: 8 924 870) by the National Society of
		"Medical Mycology (FIMUA) from September 1997 to December 1999. In total, 569"
		"episodes were reported with an overall rate of 0.38/1000 admissions, 4.4/100000"
		patient days. Predisposing factors included presence of an intravascular catheter
		"(89%), antibiotic treatment (88%), surgery (56%), intensive care (45%), solid"
		"tumour (28%), steroid treatment (15%), haematological malignancy (7%), HIV"
		"infection (6%), fetal immaturity (4%). Mucous membrane colonization preceded"
		"candidaemia in 83% of patients. Candida albicans was identified in 58% of cases,"
		"followed by Candida parapsilosis (15%), Candida glabrata (13%), Candida"
		"tropicalis (6%). Septic shock occurred in 95 patients. Crude mortality was 35%,"
		"the highest in C. tropicalis fungaemia (44%), the elderly (64%) and solid tumour"
		cancer patients (43%). Intravascular catheter removal was associated with higher
		survival rate (71 vs. 47%). This survey underscores the importance of candidaemia
		in hospital settings.

TI	-	Concurrent isolation of Candida krusei and Candida tropicalis from multiple blood
		cultures in a patient with acute leukemia.
PG	-	521-3
AB	-	Reports of the concurrent isolation of more than one non-albicans species of
		Candida from blood cultures of immunocompromised patients with disseminated
		candidiasis are extremely infrequent. We report on the isolation of Candida
		krusei and Candida tropicalis from 17 blood cultures that were taken from a
		67-year-old white man with a diagnosis of acute biphenotypic leukemia during a
		2-week period of hospitalization for induction chemotherapy. Despite receiving
		"high-dose amphotericin B throughout this period, the status of the patient"
		"worsened, and he experienced pancytopenia, hypernatremia, azotemia, and"
		"disseminated intravascular coagulation, which led to his death. Candida krusei"
		"and C tropicalis were isolated concurrently from 10 of the 17 blood cultures,"
		while C krusei was the single isolate in three cultures and C tropicalis was
		isolated alone in four cultures. Each species manifested markedly different
		colonial morphological features. This case report serves to emphasize to
		microbiologists that they must exercise extreme suspicion when non-albicans
		species of Candida are isolated singly or concurrently from blood cultures in
		"neutropenic patients, given the increasing clinical significance of these yeasts."

TI	-	Breakthrough candidaemias during empirical therapy with fluconazole in non-cancer
		and non-HIV adults caused by in vitro-susceptible Candida spp.: report of 33
		cases.
PG	-	749-51
AB	-	The objective of this study was to assess risk factors and the outcome of
		breakthrough fungaemias (BFs) occurring during fluconazole (FLU) therapy in
		non-cancer and non-HIV individuals. Thirty-three fungaemias occurring during
		therapy with FLU among a total of 310 fungaemias observed within a 10-y national
		survey were analysed. The agar disk diffusion method was used for antifungal
		susceptibility testing and the Vitek system for species identification.
		Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed to determine risk factors for
		BF. All BFs were due to species known to be susceptible to FLU: Candida albicans
		"(25/33), C. parapsilosis (6/33) and C. guillermondii (2/33). The mean number of"
		positive blood cultures per episode was 2.4. The MIC of Candida spp. to FLU was
		"0.5-8 mg/ml (all strains were susceptible in vitro). Neonatal age (< 4 weeks),"
		"very low birth weight, prior surgery, central venous catheter placement,"
		"artificial ventilation, total parenteral nutrition and C. parapsilosis were"
		"significantly related to BF in univariate analysis, but only central venous"
		"catheter placement was significantly related in multivariate analysis. However,"
		the outcome of BFs and non-BFs was similar. All BFs occurred in non-HIV patients
		"who were not previously treated with azoles, and were caused by in vitro"
		FLU-susceptible species (C. albicans and C. tropicalis). Thus factors other than
		in vitro susceptibility play a role in BFs.

AB	-	Clinical evaluation of fluconazole was performed on 12 cases of mycotic
		infections (7 cases of Candida esophagitis; one each case of cryptococcal
		"meningitis with AIDS, Candida tropicalis fungemia and disseminated cryptococcosis"
		in kidney transplant patient; 2 cases of Candida pneumonia). Satisfactory
		responses were obtained except 1 case of Candida pneumonia in which clinical
		efficacy could not be evaluated. Hiccup was noted in 1 case during the
		fluconazole treatment. No other adverse reaction was observed. When 150 mg and
		200 mg of fluconazole were administered orally to a patient with hemodialysis
		"(HD) after HD on separate occasions, concentrations of the drug in serum at 20"
		"hours after ingestion were 5.9 micrograms/ml and 11.6 micrograms/ml,"
		"respectively, and in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were 3.5 micrograms/ml and 9.2"
		"micrograms/ml, respectively. Two clinical benefits were obtained in our studies."
		"First, it was possible to treat the AIDS-patient as an outpatient with Candida"
		"esophagitis using orally administered fluconazole. Second, it was possible to"
		"treat the case of cryptococcal meningitis, in which relapse often occurs, to"
		complete the therapy when the cryptococcal antigen in serum and CSF diminished to
		an undetectable level and to maintain the therapy preventing relapse without
		severe adverse effects. Ongoing and future clinical trials will define the
		specific roles of fluconazole more clearly in the treatment of systemic mycosis.

		"liver abscesses are divided into bacterial (pyogenic), and parasiti (amebic)."
		Parasitic cysts (e.g. caused by Echinococcus granulosus) can be secondary
		bacterial infected and their clinical and laboratory manifestations are like
		pyogenic abscesses. In clinical manifestation of liver abscesses dominates fever
		of unknown origin. Authors present two characteristic cases of liver abscesses as
		a Case reports. The origin of multiple pyogenic abscesses of mixed etiology
		"(Enterococcus faecium, E. coli ESBL, Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis) in"
		73-years old man was either in secondary infected liver hematomas after his fall
		and injury or in intrascapular subcutaneous abscess with spreading of microbes by
		blood stream into liver. Some of liver abscesses were evacuated during surgical
		laparotomy; the residual ones were puncted by radiologist under CT control. The
		"patient was treated with combination of meropenem, vancomycin, metronidazol (4"
		"weeks), and fluconazole (20 days). Antibiotic treatment with per oral doxycycline"
		was continuing after patient's discharge from the hospital for 3 weeks. Three
		amebic liver abscesses were diagnosed in 27-years old man of Indian origin. The
		treatment was based on drainage of abscesses under CT control a long-term
		metronidazol treatment.

TI	-	[Role of fungi belonging to the genus Candida in the etiology of nonspecific
		pulmonary diseases].
PG	-	44-8
AB	-	The sputum specimens from 1363 patients at the age of 16 to 65 years with
		nonspecific pulmonary diseases and the pleural exudate specimens from 325
		patients were tested for fungi in 1989-1994. The etiological significance of
		Candida was stated at a concentration of > 10(5) GFU per 1 ml of the sputum. The
		identification was performed by the routine methods. An increase in the rate of
		the fungi isolation was studied in the time course of the observation: 15.3 +/-
		1.9 per cent in 1989 and 31.6 +/- 3.4 per cent in 1994. The fungi were more
		frequently isolated from the patients with lung abscesses (38.0 +/- 4.1 per cent
		of the cases). In the patients with pyothorax the fungi were isolated from the
		pleural exudate specimens only in 6.8 +/- 1.4 per cent of the cases. The groups
		of risk of the susceptibility to Candida were revealed. They included patients at
		the age of 21 to 30 years and above 60. Out of 484 Candida isolates 80.7 per cent
		"belonged to C. albicans, 4.2 per cent to C. tropicalis, 2.1 per cent to C. kefyr"
		"and 1.8 per cent to C. krusei. The isolates of C. parapsilosis, C. guillermoudii,"
		C. utilis and C. brumptii were rate. The isolates were highly susceptible to
		"nystatin (91,8 per cent) and lowly susceptible to levorin (35.4 per cent),"
		amphoglucamine (24.7 per cent) and ketokonazol (16.8 per cent).

		in an H. pylori-negative patient with no antecedent ulcers who had not taken
		"NSAIDs, Candida is considered, contrary to the prevailing opinion, to play an"

		Documentation by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.
PG	-	545-7
AB	-	Candida albicans and other Candida species have emerged as major nosocomial
		pathogens associated with a high mortality. Therapeutic options for fungal
		infections are limited. Amphotericin B has been the mainstay of treatment for
		"serious systemic candidal infections, but it is relatively toxic and associated"
		with a variety of side effects. Fluconazole has been proposed as alternative
		therapy for the treatment of systemic candidiasis including candidemia. We report
		the case of a patient with fungemia in whom fluconazole failed to eradicate C.
		albicans and C. tropicalis. These pathogens were recovered from sputum and urine
		"cultures, respectively, on day 12 of intravenous fluconazole therapy. Molecular"
		epidemiologic techniques employing pulsed-field gel electrophoresis confirmed the
		persistence of the same C. albicans strain. Susceptibility studies showed a
		"marked change in MICs of fluconazole between 24 and 48 hr, with an increase from"
		less than or equal to 1.25 to greater than 80 micrograms/ml. Controlled trials
		will be needed to delineate the role of fluconazole in the treatment of
		disseminated candidiasis and its efficacy in comparison with amphotericin B.
		Amphotericin B should remain the drug of choice for such infections until data
		from controlled trials are available.

TI	-	Fungal bezoar and bladder rupture secondary to candida tropicalis.
PG	-	439-41
AB	-	Candidal urinary tract infections typically occur in a host with compromised
		"immune function. Although usually associated with aerobic bacterial infections,"
		emphysematous cystitis occasionally complicates fungal infections of the lower
		"urinary tract, especially in diabetics. Another uncommon occurrence is formation"
		"of a ""fungus ball"" leading to obstructive uropathy. We present a case of bladder"
		rupture in a patient with emphysematous cystitis and obstructing fungal bezoar
		caused by Candida tropicalis. Various factors predispose to fungal urinary tract
		"infection, including diabetes mellitus, neurogenic bladder, antibiotic usage, and"
		the presence of an indwelling urinary catheter.

PG	-	681-6
LID	-	10.1111/myc.12083 [doi]
AB	-	Simultaneous infections with multiple fungi may be misinterpreted as
		monomicrobial infections by current diagnostics with ramifications for the choice
		of antimicrobial agents that may impact patient outcomes. The application of
		molecular methods on tissue samples may be useful to decipher the aetiology of
		mixed fungal infections. We present a leukaemic patient who died from sepsis due
		to candidaemia. The postmortem examination documented fungal elements in lung
		tissue. Fungal DNA was amplified from the lung sample by broad-range PCR assays
		targeting the 28S ribosomal RNA gene or the internal transcribed spacer 2
		(ITS-2). Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) using differentially labelled
		fungal probes was applied on the tissue. Sequencing identified the PCR amplicons
		as Aspergillus fumigatus (28S assay) and Candida tropicalis (ITS-2 assay). As a
		"chromatogram suggested mixed amplicons, the Isentio ripseq(®) tool for in silico"
		analysis was applied and confirmed the presence of both amplicons in the PCR
		products of both assays. FISH confirmed the presence of Aspergillus and Candida
		"within the infectious process, a prerequisite for inferring a causal relationship"
		with the infection. The combination of broad-range PCR with sequence analysis and
		FISH applied on tissue samples is a powerful approach to identify the aetiology
		"of invasive fungal infections, including mixed infections."

AB	-	Candida arthritis in patients with a haematological malignancy is rare. We report
		a case of Candida tropicalis arthritis of the knee that occurred in a patient
		with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia during the recovery phase of post-chemotherapy
		neutropenia. Although the Candida tropicalis isolates from synovial fluid and
		"synovial tissue were sensitive to fluconazole in vitro, a 6-week course of oral"
		treatment failed to produce clinical improvement. The arthritis resolved after 7
		"weeks of combination therapy with caspofungin, a new echinocandin class of"
		antifungal agent that acts primarily on the cell wall. Eleven other reports of
		Candida arthritis in patients with a haematological malignancy were reviewed.

PG	-	29-38
AB	-	"During the past decades, several studies have reported an increase in the"
		"incidence of nosocomial candidosis. In a prospective study, performed at the"
		"Departamento de Micología, INEI, ANLIS Dr. C. G. Malbrán and the Servicio de"
		"Neonatología and Microbiología, Hospital de Niños Sor María Ludovica, from"
		"October 1995 to December 1996, 167 patients with candidosis were detected."
		"Candida species isolated were C. albicans (53.1%), C. parapsilosis (26.5%) and C."
		tropicalis (14.8%). The aim of this work was to characterize the clinical C.
		parapsilosis isolates from pediatric patients hospitalized in two neonatal
		intensive care units from the same hospital and to evaluate the usefulness of
		electrophoretic karyotype (EK) and restriction endonuclease analysis of genomic
		DNA (REAG) using a low frequency digestion enzyme. EK of all isolates disclosed
		12 banding patterns and REAG with endonuclease Sfi I showed only 5 groups.
		"However, isolates from the control group could not be separated from the clinical"
		isolates. The isolates within each dendogram group for EK or REAG were apparently
		"unrelated. Our results show that EK yields better results than REAG, but that it"
		"falls short of the desired discrimination, which suggests that these techniques"
		do not seem to be useful for studying nosocomial C. parapsilosis outbreaks.

		nystatin].
PG	-	959-63
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: The rates of Candida species and susceptibility to nystatin were
		"evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the period from January 1, 1998 to December"
		"31, 1998 mycological tests have been carried out for identification of yeast"
		species in the group of pregnant and delivering women hospitalized in the
		Obstetrics-Gynecological Departments of the Municipal Hospital in Bydgoszcz. We
		used two commercial media: Albicans ID and CHROMagar Candida. Noted have been 389
		positive inoculation results for Candida from vaginal secretions. RESULTS AND
		CONCLUSIONS: From the total number of 416 differentiated fungus strains decidedly
		dominant was the species Candida albicans--constituting 81.97% of all strains.
		The second frequently occurring fungus species was Candida glabrata--11.06%.
		"Further species were C. krusei--2.16%, C. tropicalis--1.20% and C."
		guilliermondii--1.20%. In 10 cases (2.41%)--in spite of carrying out the
		laboratory activities that are necessary in such a situation--the species type of
		tested strains could not be determined. The simultaneous occurrence of two
		Candida species has been noted in material originating from 27 women (6.94% of
		cases). Defining the drug-resistance of 93 Candida species strains against
		nystatin by means of the disk-diffusion method--it has been started that this
		drug is highly effective--81.72% of sensitive strains.

		manifestation of pacemaker endocarditis. METHODS: We examined a 75-year-old man
		with diabetes mellitus who was initially examined for bilateral multifocal
		endophthalmitis complicating endocarditis 2 years after a permanent pacemaker for
		sick sinus syndrome was implanted. RESULTS: Transesophageal echocardiography
		showed a large vegetation with a 3-cm diameter attached to the pacing electrode
		in the right ventricle. Six consecutive blood cultures grew C tropicalis.
		"CONCLUSIONS: Ocular involvement, including multifocal endophthalmitis, may occur"
		"as the only manifestation of C tropicalis endocarditis, complicating an"
		intravenous permanent pacemaker.

		After discharge he was readmitted and infective endocarditis was strongly
		"suspected because of high fever, hematuria, Osler's nodes, Janeway's lesions,"
		splinter hemorrhages and mitral regurgitation. Penicillin G in combination with
		Gentamycine therapy was started on the first hospital day. On the second hospital
		"day, blood culture revealed Candida tropicalis so Miconazole therapy was"
		"commenced. On the forth hospital day, he underwent surgery for replacement of a"
		mitral prosthesis with a prosthetic valve because he had embolus in the radial
		"artery. Despite intensive antifungal therapy, he showed no improvement in"
		clinical symptoms. Then we changed the antifungal drug from Miconazole to
		"Amphotericin B and 5-fluorocytosine. On the 109th hospital day, his clinical"

AB	-	Hepatosplenic candidiasis is increasingly observed in patients with a
		haematological malignancy who have received chemotherapy. A case history is
		described of a male aged 45 who developed symptoms of hepatosplenic candidiasis
		caused by Candida tropicalis after treatment for acute myeloid leukaemia. The
		disease is characterized by persistent fever after recovery of the leukopenia
		induced by the chemotherapy. Echographic and computer-tomographic examination may
		reveal abscess patterns specific of Candida in the liver. Treatment consists of
		amphotericin B intravenously or fluconazole orally. Protracted treatment is
		frequently required.

PG	-	66-8
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: We report a case of candidiasis of the upper urinary tract that
		presented as acute renal failure associated with septic syndrome. The patient
		initially required hemodialysis. Right hydronephrosis and perirenal collection
		were observed on ultrasound examination. METHODS: A percutaneous nephrostomy was
		performed. Nephrostomy urine cytology and cultures were positive for Candida
		tropicalis. An anterograde pyelography showed a 'fungus ball' in the urinary
		tract. RESULTS: Therapy with oral fluconazole and percutaneous amphotericin B
		achieved excellent results. CONCLUSIONS: Candidiasic urinary infection of the
		upper urinary tract often produces obstructive uropathy requiring percutaneous
		"nephrostomy, which can also be used to instill amphotericin B. Combination"
		therapy with amphotericin B and fluconazole can achieve excellent results.

PG	-	270-3
AB	-	This report describes a case of Candida tropicalis intervertebral diskitis
		successfully treated with a brief course of amphotericin B followed by a longer
		course of ketoconazole. Candida tropicalis is an increasingly frequent pathogen
		"in immunocompromised patients, and infection can become manifest weeks or months"
		after an episode of neutropenia has resolved. The excellent response we observed
		in this patient adds to a growing body of clinical experience testifying to the
		effectiveness of ketoconazole in treating certain deep-seated candidal infection.

PG	-	543-5
AB	-	"Infectious crystalline keratopathy is a chronic infection of the cornea,"
		characterized by branching intrastromal opacities without inflammation. These
		"changes are usually due to accumulations of bacterial colonies, most commonly"
		"viridans streptococci, but this entity has previously been reported in"
		association with Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis. We present the case of
		a 66-year-old man who had previously undergone penetrating keratoplasty and
		developed infectious crystalline keratopathy due to Candida parapsilosis.
		Histopathology showed interlamellar accumulations of viable yeasts with no
		inflammation. Chronic topical corticosteroid use in this patient produced
		"relative immunosuppression, allowing for the infection by Candida parapsilosis"
		and the lack of inflammation in the cornea. The spectrum of causative organisms
		"in infectious crystalline keratopathy continues to grow, emphasizing the need for"
		laboratory evaluation in the management of this disorder.

		"Regarding mortality and morbidity, opportunistic infections play a major role in"
		immunocompromised individuals. CASE REPORT: An 8-month-old infant died of a
		"sepsis with multi-organ failure after 32 days in intensive care. At autopsy, no"
		thymus gland could be found; toxicological examinations yielded high morphine
		concentrations. Autopsy findings and the results of further examinations
		"performed postmortem are discussed in view of the clinical findings, the"
		classification and the cause of death.

		Tropicalis endophthalmitis after an anterior resection for rectal carcinoma. The
		pathogen was identified in blood cultures but not in vitreal cultures. Systemic
		anti fungal treatment brought no ocular improvement. After having a vitrectomy
		and intravitreal antifungal agent injection gradual improvement up to full
		"resolution took place. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of"
		a post surgical candida tropicalis endophthalmitis in a non-neutropenic patient.
		We suggest special attention to ophthalmic complaints in patients with systemic
		candidemia and prompt treatment according to ocular findings.

		is reported in a female patient with alcohol-related cirrhosis of the liver.
		Joint destruction occurred despite appropriate treatment with fluconazole.
		Candida tropicalis joint infections are seen mainly in immunocompromised hosts
		and usually cause little destruction of the joint. Most are the result of
		dissemination via the bloodstream. Preexisting chondrocalcinosis in the patient
		reported here may have been a contributing factor to the development of extensive

		characteristics and microbiology of 2083 patients with haematological malignancy
		who were treated for BSI from 2008 to 2013 at a medical centre in Taiwan were
		"retrospectively reviewed. Lymphoma (38.1%) was the most common, followed by acute"
		"myeloid leukaemia (30.9%). Of the 2090 non-duplicate BSI isolates, 1310 (62.7%)"
		"were recovered from patients with neutropenia. Of the Gram-negatives (53.7%),"
		"Escherichia coli was predominant (13.8%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae"
		"(9.5%), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii (ACB) complex (5.7%) and"
		"Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.0%). Of the Gram-positives (40.2%), coagulase-negative"
		"staphylococci were the most common (20.5%), followed by Enterococcus faecium"
		(5.6%). Candida tropicalis (2.0%) was the most commonly encountered yeast (5.0%).
		Multidrug resistance (MDR) was identified in 21.8% of ACB complex isolates. Among
		"the 57 Staphylococcus aureus isolates, 24 (42.1%) were resistant to oxacillin"
		"(MRSA), and among the 118 E. faecium isolates, 55 (46.6%) were resistant to"
		vancomycin (VRE). The overall 14-day mortality rate was 12.9% (n = 269). There
		was no significant difference in 14-day mortality among patients with (13.4%) and
		without (11.9%) neutropenia (P = 0.315). Multivariate analysis revealed that age
		"≥60 years, prior allogeneic transplantation, BSI due to VRE (E. faecium) and"
		shock were independent predictors of 14-day mortality. Gram-negative organisms
		continued to be the most common cause of BSI in patients with haematological
		malignancies during the period 2008-2013. There was a significant increase in the
		prevalence of VRE (E. faecium) and MDR-ACB complex isolates.

TI	-	Relationship between salivary flow rates and Candida counts in subjects with
		xerostomia.
PG	-	149-54
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the relationship between salivary flow and
		Candida colony counts in the saliva of patients with xerostomia. STUDY DESIGN:
		Sialometry and Candida colony-forming unit (CFU) counts were taken from 112
		subjects who reported xerostomia in a questionnaire. Chewing-stimulated whole
		saliva was collected and streaked in Candida plates and counted in 72 hours.
		Species identification was accomplished under standard methods. RESULTS: There
		was a significant inverse relationship between salivary flow and Candida CFU
		counts (P =.007) when subjects with high colony counts were analyzed (cutoff
		"point of 400 or greater CFU/mL). In addition, the median sialometry of men was"
		"significantly greater than that of women (P =.003), even after controlling for"
		confounding variables like underlying disease and medications. Sjögren's syndrome
		was associated with low salivary flow rate (P =.007). There was no relationship
		between the median Candida CFU counts and gender or age. There was a high
		frequency (28%) of mixed colonization. Candida albicans was the most frequent
		"species, followed by C parapsilosis, C tropicalis, and C krusei. CONCLUSIONS: In"
		subjects with high Candida CFU counts there was an inverse relationship between
		salivary flow and Candida CFU counts.

		"methods can be time-consuming, particularly for non-albicans Candida species,"
		"non-Candida yeasts, and moulds. An oligonucleotide array system targeting the"
		internal transcribe spacer (ITS) 1 or 2 region of the rRNA genes was used to
		analyse prospectively 116 fungus-positive blood cultures [BACTEC Myco/F Lytic
		"bottles (Becton-Dickinson Microbiology Systems, Sparks, MD, USA)] from 105"
		"patients, and the results were compared with those obtained using conventional"
		methods. A total of 124 yeast isolates and two mould isolates were identified;
		"these microorganisms (isolate no.) included C. albicans (50), C. tropicalis (26),"
		"C. glabrata (18), C. parapsilosis (14), Cryptococcus neoformans (9), Trichosporon"
		"asahii (2), Rhodotorula mucilaginosa (2), Penicillium marneffei (2) and three"
		other species. Multiple species fungaemia (MSF) was detected in ten samples as
		"opposed to six detected using conventional methods. In two discrepant samples,"
		antifungal susceptibility testing revealed that the additionally detected isolate
		had higher MICs of fluconazole. An isolate reported as Rhodotorula glutinis by
		"the Vitek Yeast Biochemical Card (bioMérieux Vitek, Marcy l'Etoile, France) was"
		identified as R. mucilaginosa by the array and the identification by array
		hybridization was confirmed by sequence analysis of the ITS region. A test
		sensitivity of 100% was obtained. The test specificity was 100% according to
		examination of 57 blood samples containing non-target fungal species or bacterium
		"only. From the time at which growth was detected in blood cultures, the entire"
		identification procedure could be completed within 16-24 h.

TI	-	Oral candidal species among smokers and non-smokers.
PG	-	679-82
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To determine the various oral Candidal species among healthy Malaysian
		adults. DESIGN: Case-control study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: This study was
		"collaborated between the Department of Medical Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine"
		"and Department of Oral Pathology, Oral Medicine and Periodontology, Faculty of"
		"Dentistry, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, between September 2002"
		till January 2004. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred adults (50 smokers and 50
		"non-smokers), aged between 40 and 70 years were studied. Swabs and carbohydrate"
		"assimilation (Saboraud Dextrose Agar, Corn Meal Agar, API 20C AUX System) were"
		"performed. Specimens were collected from dorsum of the tongue, buccal mucosa and"
		commissures (right and left each). Colony forms were established by positive
		"colony forming units, on SDA medium (24-48 hours). Germ tube test for"
		(true/pseudohyphae) growth was done on Corn Meal Agar Medium. Candida biotypes
		"were evaluated by API 20C AUX system, which had a numerical 7 digit profile,"
		added to evaluate a definite Candida species. RESULTS: Thirty-five percent of
		Malaysian adults harbored Candida intraorally. Candidal species identified among
		"100 subjects had C. albicans (27) 77%, C. glabrata (3) 8%, C. famata, C."
		"tropicalis, C. krusei, C. lusitaniae and C. guilliermondii (1) 3% each."
		Thirty-three positive cases comprised of 35 species i.e. two cases had two
		species each. Fifty seven percent of these were smokers and 43% non-smokers.
		"These included 40% Chinese, 36% Malays and 24% Indians. Species were, however,"
		"not specified according to intra-oral sites i.e. buccal, commissural mucosa and"
		dorsum of tongue. CONCLUSION: On this series C. albicans is the most common
		species found in the oral cavity of Malaysian adults. It is equally frequent in
		"smokers and non-smokers, but showed a predilection for the ethnic Chinese group."

TI	-	Role of environmental surfaces and hands of healthcare workers in perpetuating
		multi-drug-resistant pathogens in a neonatal intensive care unit.
PG	-	619-628
LID	-	10.1007/s00431-021-04241-6 [doi]
AB	-	Neonates admitted to neonatal intensive care units are at a risk of developing
		"healthcare-associated infections, leading to increased risk of mortality. This"
		study aimed to identify organisms causing such late-onset infections in neonates
		and determine whether these isolates were genetically identical to those from the
		surrounding environmental surfaces and hands of healthcare workers (HCWs). A
		cross-sectional study was carried out over a period of 4 months in a university
		neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Samples were collected from all neonates
		with symptoms of late-onset infections (n = 180). Fingerprint samples of 21
		healthcare workers as well as 330 random environmental samples were also taken
		"from the unit. Isolates from neonates, environment and fingerprints were"
		subjected to protein electrophoresis followed by sequencing to detect genetic
		"similarities. Almost half of neonatal samples were culture positive (91/180,"
		"50.6%), out of which 72% of bacterial isolates (49/68) were multi-drug resistant."
		Klebsiella pneumoniae (32.6%) and Candida spp. (28.4%) were the commonest
		neonatal isolates. A cluster of two homologous Klebsiella pneumoniae strains was
		"isolated from a neonate and an examining bed, while another homologous cluster"
		was from a neonatal sample and a portal incubator. A third cluster was isolated
		from hands and three neonatal samples. This cluster (caused by Klebsiella
		pneumoniae strain NH54 chromosome) was found to perpetuate over the 4 months of
		the study. All three clusters were multi-drug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. A
		homologous pair of each of Candida tropicalis and Candida glabrata was isolated
		"from the blood of two neonates, and one neonatal and a crash cart sample,"
		"respectively. Overall, 8.8% (8/91) of neonatal samples were found to be"
		"homologous to other neonatal/environmental/hand isolates, denoting perpetuation"
		of pathogens between neonates themselves and also other reservoirs of
		"infections.Conclusion: The hands of HCWs, crash carts and incubators are"
		reservoirs of pathogens and can lead to nosocomial infections. Clusters of
		multi-drug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and Candida spp. were the predominant
		neonatal pathogens in this NICU. What is Known: • The role of hands and the
		environment in transmission of infections to neonates is a subject of debate. •
		Genetic sequencing provides solid evidence for detecting homologous strains. What
		"is New: • K. pneumoniae was the most frequently isolated pathogen, and"
		concomitant isolation was found in two cases from the neonatal surroundings
		(bed/incubator) and hands. • Candida spp. with homology were also found in
		different neonates and environmental samples suggesting risk of transmission.

PG	-	32-40
LID	-	10.1159/000260081 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: A disintegrin and metalloprotein-33 (ADAM33) participates in the
		"bronchial remodeling process in asthma, and genetic analyses pointed it out as a"
		candidate gene in asthma. METHODS: To analyze the association between ADAM33 and
		asthma and total and mite-specific IgE levels in a population of the Caribbean
		"Coast of Colombia, we genotyped 6 single-nucleotide polymorphisms of ADAM33 in"
		"429 asthmatics, 401 controls and 116 family trios using fluorogenic probes. Total"
		and specific IgE against Blomia tropicalis and Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus
		were determined by ELISA. Case-control and family-based analyses were performed.
		Case-control association analyses were corrected by population stratification
		using a set of 52 ancestry-informative markers. RESULTS: Eight common haplotypes
		"were identified; among them, H4 (GCAGGG) was associated with asthma in the family"
		"group (Z score: -2.049, p = 0.04). We also found an association between the TT"
		genotype of ST+7 and asthma in the case-control study (p = 0.05) that disappeared
		"after correcting for multiple testing. In the family-based analysis, this"
		"genotype was a risk factor for asthma (p = 0.01), high total IgE (Z score: 2.546,"
		p = 0.01) and high specific IgE against B. tropicalis (p = 0.02) and D.
		"pteronyssinus (Z score: 2.414, p = 0.01). V4 was associated with specific IgE"
		"against B. tropicalis (p = 0.03); T2 with asthma (p = 0.03), high total IgE (p ="
		0.02) and IgE against D. pteronyssinus (p = 0.03) and T1 with high total IgE (p =
		0.04). None of these associations was maintained after correction for multiple
		testing. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a relevant role of ADAM33 in
		thepathogenesis of asthma in this population.

TI	-	[Pulmonary fungal infection after renal transplantation: analysis of 40 cases].
PG	-	880-3
AB	-	"OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical characteristics, therapeutic measures and risk"
		factors of pulmonary fungal infection in patients after renal transplantation.
		METHODS: The clinical data of 176 patients receiving renal allograft
		transplantation with postoperative infections were retrospectively analyzed.
		"Among the patients, 40 were diagnosed to have pulmonary fungal infection, and"
		"their clinical symptoms, signs, radiographic findings, pathogenic bacterial"
		"culture, histopathological examination, and treatments were analyzed. RESULTS:"
		The 40 recipients with postoperative pulmonary fungal infection included 25 male
		and 15 female patients with a mean age of 49 years. Twenty-eight of the patients
		developed pulmonary fungal infection within 6 months after transplantation.
		"Positive pathogen cultivation was reported in 19 cases, and Candida albicans was"
		"detected in 11 cases, Candida krusei in 2 cases, Candida glabrata in 3 cases,"
		"Candida tropicalis in 1 case, aspergillosis in 1 case, and Candida mycoderma in 1"
		case. Twenty-four of out of the 40 cases were found to have co-infection. All the
		"patients received antifungal drugs and adjuvant treatments, and 38 patients were"
		cured and 2 died. CONCLUSION: Pulmonary fungal infection often occurs within 6
		months after renal transplantation. The most common fungal pathogen is Candida
		"albicans, and the patients often had coinfections. Early diagnosis and timely"
		intervention with antifungal drugs and comprehensive measures are critical in the
		management of pulmonary fungal infection following renal transplantation.

AB	-	"Otomycosis, which is otitis externa caused by fungi, is common throughout the"
		"world especially in tropical and subtropical countries. However, the"
		epidemiologic data about the etiologic agents of otomycosis in Turkey is limited.
		The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the agents of otomycosis in
		patients living at Manisa region (located at western Anatolia of Turkey). A total
		"of 2279 cases [1465 male, 813 female; age range 1-87 (mean: 41.7) years] who were"
		"clinically prediagnosed as otomycosis at Celal Bayar University Hospital, between"
		"February 1995 and July 2011, were included in the study. External ear swab"
		samples from patients with suspicion of otomycosis have been evaluated by routine
		mycological methods. Identification of mold-like fungi was based on colony
		"morphology and microscopic examination of fungal structure, whereas germ tube"
		"test, growth characteristics on cornmeal-Tween 80 agar and API 20C AUX"
		"(bio-Mérieux, France) system were used for the identification of yeast-like"
		"fungi. Of the samples, 28% (638/2279) were found positive by direct microscopy"
		and 24% (544/2279) by culture methods. Among culture-positive cases the isolation
		"rates of mold-like and yeast-like fungi were 66% (359/544) and 34% (185/544),"
		respectively. The number of distribution of the molds were as follows;
		"Aspergillus niger (180), Aspergillus fumigatus (95), Aspergillus terreus (32),"
		"Aspergillus flavus (23), Aspergillus spp. (14), Penicillium spp. (13),"
		"Trichophyton spp. (T.rubrum 1, T.mentagrophytes 1); while this distribution was"
		"as follows for the yeasts; Candida tropicalis (97), Candida albicans (39),"
		"Candida parapsilosis (21), Candida glabrata (19), Candida kefyr (4),"
		"C.guilliermondii (2), Candida krusei (1), Geotrichum candidum (1) and"
		Trichosporon capitatum (1). It was notable that 96% (344/359) of mold-like fungi
		"were Aspergillus spp., and 99% (183/185) of yeast-like fungi were Candida spp."
		The results of this study indicated that the most frequent agents of otomycosis
		"were non-dermatophyte species such as Aspergillus, followed by Candida."
		Dermatophytes were isolated in a small number of otomycosis cases. These data
		will provide support to the establishment of antifungal therapy guidelines for
		otomycosis.

AB	-	"Objective: To retrospectively analyze the diagnosis time, pathogen distribution,"
		and drug resistance of fungal bloodstream infection in severe burn patients.
		Methods: Blood samples were collected from 55 severe burn patients with fungal
		"bloodstream infection (including 46 males and 9 females, aged 42 (1, 78) years)"
		admitted to the intensive care unit of the Institute of Burn Research of the
		First Affiliated Hospital of Army Medical University (the Third Military Medical
		University) from July 2011 to May 2019 for retrospective analysis. Microbial
		"monitoring system was used to cultivate pathogens, API yeast identification kit"
		"and Candida chromogenic medium were used to identify pathogens, and Kirby-Bauer"
		paper disk diffusion method was used to detect drug resistance of fungi to
		"fluconazole, amphotericin B, itraconazole, ketoconazole, and voriconazole. The"
		"positive rate of blood fungal culture, mortality rate, distribution of local"
		"fungal proliferation sites, the diagnosis time distribution of fungal bloodstream"
		"infection, the distribution of fungal species, resistance to commonly-used"
		"antifungal drugs, and the use of antibiotics were assessed. The WHONET 5.6"
		software was applied to analyze the distribution and drug resistance of fungi.
		"Results: (1) Totally 4 839 blood samples were collected during the 9 years, and"
		"122 strains of fungi were isolated, with positive rate of 2.52%. The mortality"
		rate was 14.55% (8 patients) in 55 patients. Catheter fungal proliferation ranked
		the first among 30 cases of local fungal proliferation. (2) The diagnosis time of
		fungal bloodstream infection mainly distributed in ≤1 week of hospitalization
		"[32.73% (18/55)]. (3) Among the 55 strains of fungi detected, the detection rate"
		"of Candida parapsilosis ranked the first (21.82%, 12 strains), Candida glabrata"
		"was the second (18.18%, 10 strains), and Candida tropicalis was tied with Candida"
		"albicans in the third place (14.55%, 8 strains). All the detected fungi were"
		"sensitive to amphotericin B, and the resistance rates to voriconazole,"
		"fluconazole, itraconazole, and ketoconazole were between 4.5% and 9.1%. (4)"
		"Droad-spectrum antibiotics were used in all the 55 patients, ≥3 kinds of"
		"antibiotics were used in 44 patients, and 37 patients used antibacterial drugs ≥7"
		days. Conclusions: The diagnosis time of fungal bloodstream infection in the 55
		severe burn patients was mainly within 1 week of hospitalization. Candida
		parapsilosis is the most commonly detected fungal species. Catheter fungal
		proliferation occurs most commonly among the 30 patients with local fungal
		"proliferation. All the detected fungi were sensitive to amphotericin B, with low"
		"drug resistance to voriconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, and ketoconazole."
		Broad-spectrum antibiotics were overused in the severe burn patients with fungal
		bloodstream infection.

AB	-	AIM OF THE STUDY: The epidemiological profile of onychomycosis is poorly
		determined in Cote d'Ivoire. This study aimed to determine the fungal aetiologies
		of these onychomycosis in Abidjan. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional
		study was conducted from February to August 2011 at the Department of Dermatology
		of the University Hospital of Treichville. All patients who consulted for
		onycholysis were interviewed. All samples were analyzed by direct examination and
		Sabouraud-chloramphenicol and Sabouraud-chloramphenicol-actidione culture was
		performed. Species identification was based on microscopic characteristics of the
		fungus observed. RESULTS: A total of 53 patients were included. The prevalence of
		onychomycosis was estimated at 66%. The unilateral lesions were statistically
		different from bilateral lesions (P=0.010). Women were more affected at the hands
		than men (P=0.010). Five species of yeasts and two dermatophytes species were
		identified. Yeasts species were essentially Candida tropicalis (36.4%) and
		Candida albicans (30.3%). Trichophyton rubrum and Trichophyton soudanense were
		the only dermatophytes isolated. No contributing factors were statistically
		related to the occurrence of onychomycosis in our series. CONCLUSION: The
		observed onychomycosis in Côte d'Ivoire are mainly caused by yeasts. Although in
		"our series the risk factors have not been identified, hygiene of the nails should"
		provide effective prevention.

TI	-	Bacterial and fungal colonization of burn wounds.
PG	-	535-9
AB	-	A prospective study of fungal and bacterial flora of burn wounds was carried out
		from February 2004 to February 2005 at the Burns Unit of Hospital Regional da Asa
		"Norte, Brasília, Brazil. During the period of the study, 203 patients were"
		treated at the Burns Unit. Wound swab cultures were assessed at weekly intervals
		for four weeks. Three hundred and fifty four sampling procedures (surface swabs)
		were performed from the burn wounds. The study revealed that bacterial
		colonization reached 86.6% within the first week. Although the gram-negative
		"organisms, as a group, were more predominant, Staphylococcus aureus (28.4%) was"
		the most prevalent organism in the first week. It was however surpassed by
		Pseudomonas aeruginosa form third week onwards. For S. aureus and P. aeruginosa
		vancomycin and polymyxin were found to be the most effective drugs. Most of the
		isolates showed high level resistance to antimicrobial agents. Fungi were found
		"to colonize the burn wound late during the second week postburn, with a peak"
		incidence during the third and fourth weeks. Species identification of fungi
		"revealed that Candida tropicalis was the most predominant, followed by Candida"
		parapsilosis. It is crucial for every burn institution to determine the specific
		"pattern of burn wound microbial colonization, the time-related changes in the"
		"dominant flora, and the antimicrobial sensitivity profiles. This would enable"
		early treatment of imminent septic episodes with proper empirical systemic
		"antibiotics, without waiting for culture results, thus improving the overall"
		infection-related morbidity and mortality.

		"molecular identification, biofilm production and antifungal susceptibility of the"
		agents.
PG	-	725-732
LID	-	10.1093/mmy/myw030 [doi]
AB	-	This paper presents data on fungal peritonitis (FP) in patients undergoing
		"peritoneal dialysis (PD) at the University Hospital of Botucatu Medical School,"
		"São Paulo, Brazil. In a total of 422 patients, 30 developed FP, from which the"
		medical records and the fungal isolates of 23 patient cases were studied. All
		"patients presented abdominal pain, cloudy peritoneal effluent, needed"
		"hospitalization, had the catheter removed and were treated with fluconazole or"
		fluconazole plus 5-flucitosine; six of them died due to FP. Concerning the
		"agents, it was observed that Candida parapsilosis was the leading species (9/23),"
		"followed by Candida albicans (5/23), Candida orthopsilosis (4/23), Candida"
		"tropicalis (3/23), Candida guilliermondii (1/23), and Kodamaea ohmeri (1/23). All"
		"the isolates were susceptible to amphotericin B, voriconazole and caspofungin"
		whereas C. albicans isolates were susceptible to all antifungals tested.
		"Resistance to fluconazole was observed in three isolates of C. orthopsilosis, and"
		dose-dependent susceptibility to this antifungal was observed in two isolates of
		C. parapsilosis and in the K. ohmeri isolate. Biofilm production estimates were
		"high or moderate in most isolates, especially in C. albicans species, and low in"
		"C. parapsilosis species, with a marked variation among the isolates. This"
		"Brazilian study reinforces that FP in PD is caused by a diverse group of yeasts,"
		"most prevalently C. parapsilosis sensu stricto species. In addition, they present"
		"significant variation in susceptibility to antifungals and biofilm production,"
		thus contributing to the complexity and severity of the clinical features.

PG	-	145-9
LID	-	10.2174/1874306401206010145 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Persistent Candida from fungal cultures of respiratory secretions are
		often ignored and not treated due to assumptions concerning benign colonization.
		OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical course of patients with chronic sputum and
		"fungi on culture, including response to antifungal treatment. METHODS: All"
		patients seen at a single long term acute care hospital (LTAC) between May 2009
		and September 2010 with at least two months of daily sputum and fungus on more
		"than one sputum culture were identified. LTAC, inpatient, and outpatient records"
		through June 2011 were reviewed to assess clinical features and response to
		"therapy or to cessation of therapy. RESULTS: Eleven patients were identified,"
		"having sputum duration of 5 months to 28 years, and respiratory cultures growing"
		"Candida species. Fungi included C albicans (8 patients), C glabrata (2), C krusei"
		"(2), C tropicalis (1), C parapsilosis (1), Aspergillus fumigatus (1), Aspergillus"
		"terreus (1), and Scedosporium (1), the latter 3 in conjunction with Candida"
		"species. All had abnormal chest CT scans, often with bronchiectasis and sometimes"
		"atelectasis or consolidation, and ten of 11 patients were on chronic steroids"
		"(inhaled and/or systemic). Antifungal therapy, mostly oral voriconazole and"
		"nebulized amphotericin, led to improved respiratory symptoms and sputum within 3"
		weeks in 10 of 10 treated patients. Lack of antifungal therapy or early cessation
		of treatment was associated with progressive or recurrent symptoms and death of
		one patient. CONCLUSIONS: This case series suggests that chronic candidal
		bronchitis is associated with significant morbidity and responds well to
		treatment. Such patients may benefit from extended antifungal therapy. Guidelines
		for the treatment of Candida in pulmonary secretions should be reevaluated.

		"developed hepatitis E infection while hepatitis A, B, or C serology profile"
		showed no active infection. The bilateral iliopsoas hematoma was also observed on
		CT scan manifested by decreased power in bilateral lower limbs and pain in the
		right leg. The patient was treated in the hospital with antibiotics (ceftriaxone
		2 g once daily for 14 days) and antifungal (fluconazole 200 mg per oral initially
		"for one day then 100 mg daily for 13 days) medicines, and his condition improved"
		on discharge. There is evidence of variable presentations of dengue fever after
		"the disease burden is increased, and thus, diagnosing with such manifestations"
		can be very challenging.

TI	-	Caspofungin as primary antifungal prophylaxis in stem cell transplant recipients.
PG	-	1644-50
AB	-	STUDY OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and tolerability of caspofungin as
		primary prophylaxis against invasive fungal infections in stem cell transplant
		recipients who are poor candidates for triazole or lipid amphotericin B
		"prophylaxis due to renal or hepatic dysfunction, and to determine whether any"
		patient characteristics are independently associated with an increased risk of
		breakthrough invasive fungal infection during caspofungin prophylaxis. DESIGN:
		Retrospective medical record review. SETTING: Tertiary care comprehensive cancer
		center. PATIENTS: One hundred twenty-three adult stem cell transplant recipients
		who received caspofungin 35-50 mg/day for up to 100 days after transplantation as
		"primary antifungal prophylaxis between January 1, 2002, and June 30, 2005."
		MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Data were collected on host and transplant
		"characteristics such as transplant type, neutropenia, graft-versus-host disease"
		"(GVHD), and corticosteroid use, as well as evidence of breakthrough invasive"
		"fungal infections. Of the 123 patients, 117 (95.1%) were allogeneic recipients,"
		and the median time to engraftment was 12 days (range 6-26 days). Fifty (40.7%)
		of the patients developed GVHD of grade 2 or greater and received corticosteroids
		for more than 21 days. Median duration of caspofungin prophylaxis was 73 days
		(range 10-100 days). Nine patients (7.3%) developed breakthrough invasive fungal
		infections (two cases of mixed Aspergillus species and one each of Aspergillus
		"terreus, Rhizopus, Exserohilum, an unspecified mold, Cryptococcus, Candida"
		"glabrata, and Candida tropicalis). Median time to invasive fungal infection"
		development was 65 days (range 12-88 days). Only one case occurred during the
		neutropenic period before engraftment. Multivariate analysis showed that
		Pseudomonas coinfection (p=0.04) and infliximab therapy (p=0.02) were associated
		with breakthrough invasive fungal infections in patients receiving caspofungin.
		"By day 100, there were five (4.1%) deaths, two of which were directly"
		attributable to invasive fungal infections. No caspofungin-related adverse events
		were reported. CONCLUSION: Caspofungin seems to be an effective and
		well-tolerated option for primary antifungal prophylaxis in the highly
		immunosuppressed stem cell transplant patient population.

TI	-	Necrotizing fasciitis following a motor vehicle accident with Candida species as
		the sole organisms.
PG	-	43-6
AB	-	Necrotizing soft-tissue infections exclusively due to Candida species are rare
		and not usually considered in the differential diagnosis of this devastating
		"condition. When documented previously, Candida species are generally proposed to"
		be a saprophytic component of multibacterial synergistic infection often
		associated with streptococcal species. We report a case of a 51-year-old man who
		developed necrotizing fasciitis secondary to Candida infection following a motor
		vehicle accident. His clinical presentation was very similar to that of
		clostridial gas gangrene. The only organisms isolated from tissue culture were
		Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis. Histopathology confirmed yeast forms and
		pseudohyphae within the debrided tissue specimens. No bacteria were identified on
		any of the wound swabs or tissue specimens. Our report is the first that reveals
		Candida as the sole identifiable cause for necrotizing fasciitis following
		trauma. Candida should be considered in the differential diagnosis of causative
		organisms for necrotizing fasciitis and infective myonecrosis.

TI	-	Sequential endoscopic and robot-assisted surgical solutions for a rare fungal
		"spondylodiscitis, secondary lumbar spinal stenosis, and subsequent discal"
		pseudocyst causing acute cauda equina syndrome: a case report.
PG	-	34
LID	-	10.1186/s12893-022-01493-3 [doi]
LID	-	34
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Fungal spondylodiscitis is a rare infectious disease. The secondary
		lumbar spinal stenosis and postoperative discal pseudocyst were even rarer. The
		"surgical interventions were disputed, yet endoscopic and robot-assisted"
		techniques may be helpful under different circumstances. CASE PRESENTATION: A
		62-year-old female was diagnosed as infectious spondylodiscitis at the L4/5 level
		and a posterolateral endoscopic debridement was performed after invalid
		"conservative therapy. Causative organism culture revealed a rare fungus, Candida"
		tropicalis. A secondary spinal stenosis with refractory radiculopathy occurred
		almost 3 years after the first surgery and a successful endoscopic surgery was
		"implemented aiming to decompress the nerve in a minimally invasive way. However,"
		"2 months later, the patient manifested severe acute cauda equina syndrome and"
		radiological examinations suggested a rare postoperative discal pseudocyst. A
		laminectomy followed by a pseudocystectomy was applied to achieve thorough
		decompression. An innovative double trajectory system (simultaneous traditional
		pedicle screw and cortical bone trajectory screw) accompanied by posterolateral
		fusion was designed and executed by the professional robot-assisted system.
		CONCLUSION: Endoscopic and robot-assisted techniques may provide alternative
		solutions for fungal spondylodiscitis and accompanied sequelae.

TI	-	Candida meningitis in children: report of two cases.
PG	-	339-44
AB	-	Candida meningitis is rare in children. However reports have been increasing
		recently. We report two cases of meningitis caused by Candida species. The first
		case was a term male infant who was admitted at 14 days of age with the diagnosis
		of possible sepsis. He had received multiple courses of antibiotics without
		improvement. Later his cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture grew Candida tropicalis.
		The damage done by the infection was severe and the patient died. The second case
		was a 2-month old girl who was born at 34 weeks of gestation. She was admitted to
		the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) and given antibiotics as prophylaxis.
		Despite this she developed recurrent episodes of fever that required multiple
		"courses of antibiotics. After discharging her, she continued to have fever. Upon"
		"investigation, her blood and CSF grew Candida albicans. She was treated and"
		responded to therapy.

TI	-	Infectious complications in left ventricular assist device recipients.
PG	-	18-23
AB	-	The left ventricular assist device (LVAD) has revolutionized the care of patients
		with heart failure who are awaiting transplantation. Despite reports of
		"significant infection rates associated with LVAD implantation, few data are"
		available concerning the management of LVAD-related infections and their impact
		on transplantation. Eight (40%) of our first 20 LVAD recipients developed
		infections. LVAD-related bloodstream infection occurred in three (15%) patients;
		"infection was due to Staphylococcus aureus in one case, coagulase-negative"
		"staphylococci in the second case, and S. aureus and Candida tropicalis in the"
		third case. All three patients were treated with courses of antibiotics that were
		appropriate for prosthetic valve endocarditis and received antibiotics for at
		least 6 weeks. All infected patients underwent successful transplantation and had
		no evidence of recurrence of infection up to 16 months postoperatively. Our
		experience suggests that LVAD infections can be successfully treated without
		device removal and that cardiac transplantation can be performed in individuals
		with LVAD-related bloodstream infection.

TI	-	[Bilateral candida bezoar of the upper urinary tract].
PG	-	374-6
AB	-	Fungal urinary tract infections are due to candida albicans as first responsible
		germ. This sporulated oval fungus divides itself by gemmation and produces
		"pseudohyphas when it is spread in culture mediums, organic tissues or their"
		exudates. The most frequent predisposing factor is diabetes mellitus. Others
		"predisposing factors are: long antibiotic administration, corticoids,"
		"immunosuppressors, neoplasias, neurogenic bladder, and catheter or foreign bodies"
		into the urinary tract. Bezoar formation is a rare complication that sometimes
		produces obstructive uropathy. Although Candida albicans is the most frequent
		"observed germ in bezoars, Candida tropicalis, Penicillium, Aspergillus, Mucor y"
		Turolopsis have been found as well. We present the case of a diabetic patient
		with a bilateral bezoar formation into the upper urinary tract due to Candida
		"albicans. Clinical features, diagnosis and treatment are described emphasizing in"
		the are bilateral onset.

		long-term complication of peritoneal dialysis. Endometriosis is a common
		gynecological problem but hemoperitoneum due to endometriosis has been reported
		to be extremely rare in hemodialysis (HD) patients. A 25-year-old female HD
		"patient was admitted to our clinic with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and"
		weight loss for last 3 months. Candida tropicalis and Candida glabrata were
		isolated in the fungal cultures from peritoneal fluid. Her abdominal computerized
		"tomography scan has shown irregular peritoneal calcifications, diffuse peritoneal"
		"thickening, dilatation of the small bowel loops, and cocoon formation which all"
		were typical for EPS. Hemoperitoneum was reported to recur for four times with
		"intervals suggesting menstrual cycles. Her peritoneal biopsy, along with the"
		"signs of EPS, has also revealed the presence of endometriosis. The patient died"
		with symptoms of septic shock in the first year of EPS diagnosis.

		"stent-graft infection and pseudoaneurysm, after stent-graft implantation. An 83"
		year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for sepsis 14 months after treatment
		with a balloon-expandable stent-graft for an arterio-ureteral fistula (AUF)
		between the right external iliac artery and the right ureter. Blood cultures were
		positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Candida tropicalis.
		A giant infectious pseudoaneurysm (44 × 70 mm) at the distal edge of the

		"therapy (EVT) was planned to correct the pseudoaneurysm, the right iliac artery"

		"the common femoral artery 5 days after diagnosing the pseudoaneurysm; hence, EVT"
		"was not performed. Antibiotic administration was continued, and blood culture"
		"results were negative. Although EVT using a stent graft for AUFs is effective,"
		"data on the chronic phase outcomes are limited. Therefore, patients with AUFs"
		treated using stent-grafts should be carefully followed up.

TI	-	[Hepatitis E virus-associated aplastic anemia. Report of a case].
PG	-	175-7
AB	-	Hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia (HAAA) is a well-recognized clinical
		syndrome in which marrow failure follows the development of hepatitis; it can be
		observed in up to 5% in the aplastic anemia in West Europe and North American
		countries and 10% in the East Asia. Although hepatotropic and other viruses were
		"suspected of causing HAAA, this hypothesis was rarely confirmed. Currently, the"
		infection with hepatitis E virus represents the first cause of acute hepatitis in
		"the world. Its genotype 3, the most frequent in Argentina and other Latin"
		"American countries, was associated with extrahepatic complications (renal,"
		"pancreatic, neurologic and hematologic). To our knowledge, only one case of"
		"hepatitis E virus-associated aplastic anemia has been previously reported, in"
		Pakistan; the case presented here would be the first in Argentina. The patient
		"was treated with thymoglobulin, cyclosporine, corticosteroids, filgastrim and"
		transfusional support. She developed fungemia due to Candida tropicalis that
		"remitted with equinocandins and therefore fever, pulmonary infiltrates and a"
		solitary nodular cerebral image with serum galactomannan (DO index > 1.0 ng/ml)
		that resolved with voriconazol. She was discharged three months after her
		admission without transfusion requirements and normal hepatic values.With this in
		"mind, it would be advisable to investigate hepatitis E (HEV) as a cause of HAAA"
		in Argentina.

TI	-	Idiopathic ileal volvulus with multiple concomitant infections in a starving man.
PG	-	81-85
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Small bowel volvulus is defined as the torsion of the small
		"intestine, potentially leading to bowel obstruction, gangrene and perforation. It"
		"is a rare condition, especially in adults. CASE PRESENTATION: A 30-year-old man"
		was retrieved from the jungle with severe weight loss and abdominal symptoms. He
		succumbed to death despite 22 days of intensive medical treatment. An autopsy
		revealed a ruptured gangrenous ileal volvulus with peritonitis and
		subdiaphragmatic abscess. Further laboratory analysis detected systemic Candida
		"tropicalis and intestinal gramnegative bacterial sepsis, systemic Zika virus"
		"viremia, leptospirosis complicating rhabdomyolysis and disseminated intravascular"
		"coagulopathy, Type I Herpes Simplex virus infection of the tongue and upper"
		"gastrointestinal tract. The cause of death was the ruptured ileal volvulus,"
		complicated with upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to Herpes simplex virus
		esophagitis in a malnourished patient with resolving leptospirosis and underlying
		Zika virus co-infection. CONCLUSION: Rare clinical scenarios of adult-onset
		intestinal volvulus with concomitant multiple infections precludes clinical
		"diagnosis and early treatment, leading to devastating consequences of clinical"
		outcome. The positive clinical and postmortem correlation is a good learning
		lesson in many disciplines of medicine and science.

		Report and Literature Review of Candida-Associated Longitudinal Melanonychia
		Striata.
PG	-	e14248
LID	-	10.7759/cureus.14248 [doi]
LID	-	e14248
AB	-	"Longitudinal melanonychia striata, presenting as a black linear vertical band of"
		"the nail plate, can be caused by pigmented lesions and non-pigmented etiologies."
		"A fungal infection of the nail plate, also referred to as onychomycosis or tinea"
		"unguim, can result from dermatophytes, non-dermatophyte molds, and Candida."
		"Albeit rare, Candida-associated fungal melanonychia can present as a longitudinal"
		black nail plate streak. The case of a 79-year-old man who developed a solitary
		linear black streak on his right fourth fingernail after a prior history of
		recent trauma to the digit's nail folds is described; the fungal culture grew
		"Candida parapsilosis. Including our patient, Candida-associated longitudinal"
		melanonychia striata has been described in four women and two men ranging in age
		"from 40 to 79 years (median, 70 years) at diagnosis. The black streak, present"
		"from one month to one year (median, seven months), affected either a hand digit"
		(five patients) or the great toe (one patient). Fungal organisms were visualized
		"on either a potassium hydroxide preparation (one patient), pathologic evaluation"
		"of a nail plate specimen (three patients), or both (one patient). Culture grew"
		"Candida parapsilosis (two patients), Candida species (two patients), Candida"
		"albicans (one patient), and Candida tropicalis (one patient). All of the patients"
		experienced clinical improvement after treatment. Topical treatment (5%
		amorolfine hydrochloride nail lacquer for two patients or modified Castellani
		paint and 1% clotrimazole cream for one man) or oral itraconazole (either as
		monotherapy for two women or combined with 5% amorolfine hydrochloride nail
		lacquer for one woman) was successfully used. Although the clinical presentation
		of fungal melanonychia can mimic subungual melanoma when it appears as a solitary
		"black linear vertical nail plate streak, investigative studies--such as a"
		"potassium hydroxide preparation, nail plate pathology, nail matrix biopsy, and/or"
		fungal culture--can be used to establish the diagnosis of Candida-associated
		longitudinal melanonychia striata and exclude the diagnosis of a pigmented
		melanocytic tumor.

PG	-	115-33
AB	-	"Thirty-one immunocompromised patients (22 renal allograft recipients, 5 patients"
		"receiving chronic corticosteroid therapy, and 4 patients undergoing chemotherapy"
		"for acute leukemia) with significant dermatologic infection, excluding typical"
		"cellulitis and herpesvirus infections, were retrospectively identified over a"
		"12-year period. Of these 31 patients, 15 (48%) had infection restricted to their"

		"patients with apparent secondary skin involvement, the development of the"
		cutaneous lesion was the first clinical indication of disseminated infection.
		Eleven immunocompromised patients (35%) with bacterial infection of the skin or
		subcutaneous tissue were identified. These patients could be divided into three

		"extensive, confluent cutaneous dermatophyte infections. One patient with"
		protothecosis and two patients with extensive papillomavirus infection were
		"identified. Of these latter two cases, one had his immunosuppression"
		"discontinued, with clearing of his extensive warts; the other had confluent warts"
		of the face and neck that subsequently underwent malignant degeneration to

TI	-	Pure distraction injury of T1-2 with quad fever.
PG	-	1044-1050
LID	-	10.1007/s00586-017-5232-2 [doi]
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: We report a pure distraction injury of the upper thoracic spine and
		uncontrolled hyperthermia without an infectious cause. Quad fever appears in the
		first several weeks to months after a cervical or upper thoracic SCI and is
		characterized by an extreme elevation in body core temperature beyond 40 °C
		without an infectious cause. Discriminating between infectious and noninfectious
		"causes is important, and a thorough clinical assessment is required. MATERIALS"
		AND METHODS: A 52-year-old male visited the emergency room complaining of back
		pain with complete paralysis [American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) A] of
		both lower extremities after a pedestrian-motor vehicle accident. He had trouble
		breathing due to a hemothorax and flail chest caused by fractures of the right
		second to eleventh and left fourth to seventh ribs. A computed tomography scan
		revealed severe distraction of the T1-2 intervertebral space. A magnetic
		resonance image showed signal changes in the spinal cord and a clean-cut margin
		between the T1-2 disc and T2 body. The neurological level of injury was C8 upon
		the initial neurological assessment. Emergency surgery was performed. C6-T3
		posterior instrumentation and an autologous iliac bone graft were performed.
		"RESULTS: After surgery, the core temperature increased gradually to above 38.0 °C"
		on post-trauma day 4 and increased to 40.8 °C on post-trauma day 7. None of the
		"repeated aerobic, anaerobic, or fungal cultures of the blood, tracheal aspirate,"
		"line tips, urine, or stool was positive until post-trauma day 21, when Candida"
		"tropicalis was identified in the urine culture. On post-trauma day 63, the blood"
		"pressure, pulse, and body temperature stabilized and the patient was transferred"
		"to the general ward. At post-trauma year 6, the injury state was still complete"
		and the neurological level of injury was changed to C4. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the
		"Grand Round case and relevant literature, we discuss the case of pure distraction"
		injury of T1-2 with quad fever. Spinal surgeons should be knowledgeable regarding
		quad fever as well as the differential diagnoses and treatment strategies.
