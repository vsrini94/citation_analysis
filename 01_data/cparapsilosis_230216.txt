AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive fungal infections (IFI) are increasing in prevalence in
		"recent years. In the last few months, the rise of COVID-19 patients has generated"
		"a new escalation in patients presenting opportunistic mycoses, mainly by"
		Aspergillus. Candida infections are not being reported yet. OBJECTIVES: We aimed
		to determine the prevalence of systemic candidiasis in patients admitted to ICUs
		due to severe pneumonia secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the existence of
		possible associated risk factors that led these patients to develop candidiasis.
		PATIENTS/METHODS: We designed a study including patients with a confirmed
		"diagnosis of COVID-19. RESULTS: The prevalence of systemic candidiasis was 14.4%,"
		and the main isolated species were C. albicans and C. parapsilosis. All patients
		that were tested positive for Candida spp. stayed longer in the ICU in comparison
		to patients who tested negative. Patients with candidiasis had higher MuLBSTA
		"score and mortality rates and a worse radiological involvement. In our study,"
		"Candida spp. isolates were found in patients that were submitted to: tocilizumab,"
		"tocilizumab plus systemic steroids, interferon type 1β and Lopinavir-Ritonavir."
		CONCLUSIONS: Results suggested a high prevalence of systemic candidiasis in
		severe COVID-19-associated pneumonia patients. Patients with Candidiasis had the
		worst clinical outcomes. Treatment with tocilizumab could potentialize the risk
		to develop systemic candidiasis.

PG	-	3292-3303
LID	-	10.1111/jog.15442 [doi]
AB	-	"AIM: Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), is a common fungal infection that remains a"
		global concern. The objectives of this study were molecular identification and
		"assessment of the antifungal susceptibility profile of Candida species, causing"
		VVC in southeast Iran. METHODS: A cross-sectional investigation was carried out
		on 119 nonpregnant females suspected of VVC between February 2019 and May 2021.
		Yeast samples were characterized to the species level by conventional and
		molecular methods. All Candida isolates were examined for in vitro susceptibility
		profile to six conventional antifungal drugs using Clinical and Laboratory
		"Standards Institute guidelines. RESULTS: Out of 119 subjects, 52 (43.7%) cases"
		"were affected by VVC, out of whom 11 (21.15%) cases had recurrent vulvovaginal"
		candidiasis (RVVC). The species distribution was as follows; Candida albicans
		"(n = 21; 40.4%), C. glabrata (n = 11; 21.2%), C. tropicalis (n = 9; 17.3%), C."
		"parapsilosis (n = 5; 9.7%), C. africana (n = 3; 5.7%), C. famata (n = 1; 1.9%),"
		"C. lusitaniae (n = 1; 1.9%), and C. dubliniensis (n = 1; 1.9%). The resistance"
		"rate of Candida isolates to fluconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole were"
		"15.38%, 11.5%, and 3.8%, respectively. Resistance to fluconazole was obtained in"
		46% (5/11) of RVVC cases but only in 7% (3/41) of VVC cases. CONCLUSION: This
		study demonstrated that the majority of VVC cases were caused by non-albicans
		"Candida species which also were resistant to some antifungal agents. Hence, our"
		findings revealed the importance of conducting periodical epidemiological studies
		"to determine changes in species distribution. Moreover, for effective management"
		"of treatment and infection, it is imperative to evaluate the susceptibility"
		profiles of Candida species isolated from VVC patients.

PG	-	871-880
LID	-	10.3855/jidc.15231 [doi]
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Invasive candidiasis is a severe form of infection. The incidence
		"of invasive fungal infections has increased, due to the increasing number of"
		patients with impaired immunity who are being treated through prolonged stay in
		hospital facilities. Neurological patient treatment methods such as
		"antimicrobials, corticosteroid, central venous catheter (CVC), total parenteral"
		"nutrition, and mechanical ventilation use are associated with common risk factors"
		for invasive candidiasis. Our study demonstrated invasive candidiasis prevalence
		among neurological patients. METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional study was done with
		consecutive sampling of neurological patients who were hospitalized from January
		2017 to February 2020 at the Mahar Mardjono National Brain Center Hospital East
		"Jakarta Indonesia. Patients with sepsis, septic shock, or fever (> 38.5 °C), and"
		who had not received antifungals before culture were enrolled in the study.
		"Clinical specimens were obtained from blood, liquor cerebrospinal or other"
		"sterile sites, CVC, respiratory tract specimens, and urine or other non-sterile"
		"sites. Socio-demographic data, potential risk factors based on previous studies,"
		"clinical, and other tests data were obtained from medical records. Classification"
		of invasive candidiasis was according to the Paphitou classification criteria.
		RESULTS: One hundred and two subjects met the study criteria. The prevalence of
		invasive candidiasis in neurological patients was 13.7%. All of the isolates were
		C. parapsilosis. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of invasive candidiasis was high in
		"the samples studied. The infection was associated with septic shock,"
		"tracheostomy, and duration of use of central venous catheter, ventilator, and"
		steroids.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Neonatal Candida spp. infections are serious events due to their
		"morbidity and mortality, however, epidemiological information is insufficient in"
		developing countries. The objective of this study was to describe the incidence
		and factors associated with invasive infection by Candida spp. in a Neonatal
		Intensive Care Unit in Mexico. METHODS: Case-control study nested in a cohort and
		matched for birth weight. We estimated the incidence of invasive neonatal
		"infection by Candida spp. For the bivariate analysis of the studied factors,"
		McNemar's test was used to contrast hypotheses and multivariate analysis was made
		with logistic regression. RESULTS: The incidence of infection was 2.27
		"events/1000 live newborns. The species identified were C. albicans 35.3% (n 30),"
		"C. parapsilosis 30.6% (n 26), C. glabrata 31.8% (n 27) and two events with C."
		lipolytica. The factors associated with a higher risk were mechanical ventilation
		"(OR 3.04, 95% CI 1.13-8.14), systemic antibiotics (OR 7.48, 95% CI 1.30-42.9),"
		"number of antimicrobial regimens (OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.01-4.03), and days with total"
		"parenteral nutrition (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.04-1.25) or with venous catheter central"
		"(OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.02-1.20). Fluconazole prophylaxis decreased the risk (OR 0.32,"
		"95% CI 0.12-0.84). CONCLUSIONS: Invasive interventions (central catheter,"
		"mechanical ventilation, and parenteral nutrition) and the use of antimicrobials"
		"increase the risk of neonatal Candida spp. Infection, while prophylactic"
		fluconazole is protective.

		API 20C system for rare yeast was 15.29% (26/170 isolates). Antifungal
		susceptibility was tested in a total of 1844 isolates of Candida from patients
		with VVC. C. albicans was susceptible to most of the tested antifungals. The MICs
		of azoles for C. glabrata were higher than those for C. albicans. The MICs of
		echinocandins for C. parapsilosis were higher than those for C. albicans.
		CONCLUSIONS: The API 20C yeast identification system can be used to reliably
		identify the most common Candida species while molecular methods are necessary
		"for the identification of closely related, emerging, and rare yeast species. The"
		results from this study suggest that much of the previous studies on the
		epidemiology of VVC should be re-thought. C. albicans was susceptible to most of
		the tested antifungals.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is the second most common infection of
		the genital tract affecting millions of women worldwide. Data concerning the
		distribution and antifungal resistance of Candida species responsible of VVC vary
		among countries and population studied. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this work was to
		"determine the prevalence, species distribution and antifungal susceptibility"
		patterns of Candida species among symptomatic women over a 20-year period.
		"METHODS: A total of 5,820 unique samples were retrospectively identified. Out of"
		"them, 1,046 (18%) were diagnosed with VVC. RESULTS: Women between 18 and 30 years"
		had the highest prevalence rate of VVC (21%). Women aged less than 18 years and
		greater than 51 years had the highest prevalence rates of vaginal bacterial
		infections. Thirty-five (3.3%) women presented recurrent VVC. The most common
		"yeast isolated was C. albicans, followed by C. glabrata, C. krusei, and C."
		parapsilosis. Non-Candida albicans species (NAC) were more significantly isolated
		"among women aged 51 or above, than in women included in other groups (p < 0.01)."
		Resistance to fluconazole and amphotericin B was infrequent in C. albicans
		strains. Resistance to fluconazole and amphotericin B was infrequent in C.
		albicans strains. NAC species presented higher resistance rates against
		fluconazole (30%) and voriconazole (25%). C. krusei and C. glabrata isolates
		showed lower MICs than most of the strains against amphotericin B (1 mg/L) and
		flucytosine (1 mg/L). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated that continued
		surveillance on Candida species distribution and non-susceptibility rates to
		antifungals should be routinely reported to help the selection of the most
		"appropriate drug, to avoid the emergence of resistant strains, and to improve the"
		patient's outcomes.

		parapsilosis Complex from Candidiasis Cases.
PG	-	889-900
LID	-	10.1093/jalm/jfac005 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Phenotypically identified Candida parapsilosis is actually a complex
		"of 3 member species named Candida parapsilosis sensu stricto (CPSS), Candida"
		"orthopsilosis (CO), and Candida metapsilosis (CM), which can be identified only"
		by molecular methods and automated methods such as MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry
		"(MS). This study was undertaken to evaluate the VITEK MS, which uses the"
		principle of MALDI-TOF MS for the identification of member species of C.
		"parapsilosis complex (CPC). METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 126"
		presumptively identified and stocked isolates of CPC were included. Definite
		identification to species level was done by VITEK MS and PCR as the gold standard
		method. Clinico-demographic characters and risk factors were analyzed. Antifungal
		susceptibility testing was performed for fluconazole and voriconazole. RESULTS:
		Twelve isolates were not identified as CPC either by VITEK MS or PCR and hence
		"were excluded from the analysis. Out of 114 CPC isolates, 89 (78.1%), 18 (15.8%),"
		"and 7 (6.1%) isolates were identified as CPSS, CO, and CM, respectively, by VITEK"
		"MS. PCR identified 84 (79.2%), 15 (14.2%), and 7 (6.6%) isolates as CPSS, CO, and"
		"CM, respectively. However, PCR did not detect 8 isolates of CPSS detected by"
		VITEK MS. VITEK MS showed 95.3% agreement in species identification and showed a
		"kappa coefficient of 0.87, which is almost perfect agreement. Predominant"
		isolations of all 3 species were from blood. Resistance was observed more in CPSS
		"for both the azoles. CONCLUSION: MALDI-TOF MS can be used as a rapid, reliable,"
		cost-effective method to identify the species of CPC.

PG	-	753-762
LID	-	10.1111/myc.13278 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candida bloodstream infections (BSI) became an important invasive
		"disease in the late 20th century, in particular among immunocompromised patients."
		Although considerable progress has been made in the management of patients with
		"invasive mycoses, Candida BSI are still widespread among hospitalised patients"
		and are associated with relatively high mortality. OBJECTIVES: We conducted a
		"retrospective study to evaluate patient characteristics, incidence, species"
		distribution and antifungal susceptibility of BSI isolates of Candida spp. as
		"well as outcomes of Candida BSI from 2001 to 2012, before the widespread use of"
		echinocandins. This is the first epidemiological study of Candida BSI in Slovenia
		so far. METHODS: All documented candidaemia cases from 2001 to 2012 in two major
		"hospitals-University Medical Centre and Institute of Oncology in Ljubljana,"
		Slovenia-were taken into consideration. Candida BSI were identified in 422
		"patients (250 male, 172 female). Laboratory and clinical data of these patients"
		were retrospectively analysed. Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare continuous
		variables and Fisher's exact test or chi-squared test for categorical variables.
		RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The average incidence of Candida BSI was 0.524/10.000
		"patient-days (0,317/1000 admissions); 16/422 were younger than 1 year and 251/422"
		patients were over 60 years old. The most commonly isolated species were Candida
		"albicans and Candida glabrata, followed by Candida parapsilosis. Majority of the"
		"patients had a single episode of Candida BSI, multiple episodes of Candida BSI"
		occurred in 18/434 patients (4.1%); in 25/434 patients (5.8%) mixed Candida BSI
		were observed. Crude 30-day case-fatality rate was 55.4%.

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the epidemiology of
		"candidemia, the fungal susceptibility, the first-line therapy and the morality"
		rate over 5 years. Knowing the differences of the yeasts in the candidemia local
		"epidemiology, is essential to obtain information on fungal epidemiology to adapt"
		antifungal strategies. MATERIALS/METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted
		from January 2014 to December 2018. The susceptibility of the Candida strains
		"were tested for amphotericin B, caspofungin, voriconazole and fluconazole."
		"RESULTS: The 304 strains were isolated from 290 patients (40 patients in 2014, 65"
		"in 2015, 72 in 2016, 62 in 2017 and 51 in 2018). The three most common Candida"
		"spp isolated from blood cultures were Candida albicans (44%), Candida glabrata"
		(22%) and Candida parapsilosis (13%). The proportion of non-albicans Candida
		decreased from 68% in 2014 to 45% in 2018. C. albicans and C. parapsilosis were
		"to the four antifungals tested. As first-line therapy, 60% of patients received"
		caspofungin and 26% fluconazole. There was no significant difference in the
		"mortality between the two arms of patients (, 27% and 21%, p = 0.47 at 30 days"
		respectively). Thirty day all-cause mortality was 31% and it decreased from 2014
		(46%) to 2018 (18%). CONCLUSIONS: We report that the absence of antifungal
		resistance of our C. albicans and C. parapsilosis candidemia suggests possible
		treatment after MALDI-TOF identification with fluconazole as first-line therapy
		"in our hospital, as soon as possible and while continuing to perform the"
		antifungal test.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candida arthritis is extremely rare and also represents a major
		challenge of diagnosis and treatment. Here we reported a rare case of recurrent
		arthritis caused by Candida parapsilosis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 56-year-old
		Chinese male suffered from recurrent pain and swelling in his right knee after
		"several times of ""small needle-knife"" acupuncture and corticosteroid injection of"
		the joint. Candida parapsilosis was cultured in his synovial fluid and identified
		by sequencing of its Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) gene. Here we present the
		"radiological characteristics, arthroscopic pictures, and synovium pathology of"
		"this patient. Also, blood test and chemical analysis of his synovial fluid were"
		listed as well as the ITS sequence of this Candida species identified. The
		patient underwent thorough arthroscopic debridement and then set on fluconazole
		400 mg daily for 12 months. His symptoms resolved and no relapse was observed on
		"the last follow-up. Additionally, a brief but comprehensive review of C."
		parapsilosis arthritis episodes from past to now were studied. CONCLUSION: With
		the detailed clinical information reported in this case and our literature
		"review, we hope they would add to our knowledge of C. parapsilosis arthritis -"
		"its clinical settings, laboratory features, radiological characteristics,"
		arthroscopic findings and experience of management.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candida parapsilosis is an incredibly rare cause of
		"ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt infections, with only 1 adult case reported in"
		the literature to date. CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe the case of a 45-year-old
		man admitted for a traumatic fall and subsequently treated with VP shunt
		placement for obstructive hydrocephalus secondary to a cerebellar contusion and
		"intraventricular hemorrhage. Eight months following VP shunt placement, the"
		patient presented with a 2-month history of clear fluid leakage through a
		dehiscent surgical abdominal wound overlying the distal VP shunt. Cerebrospinal
		fluid cultures were obtained and grew C. parapsilosis. The patient subsequently
		underwent VP shunt externalization and began antifungal treatment with
		intravenous liposomal amphotericin B. Cerebrospinal fluid studies continued to
		"redemonstrate C. parapsilosis infection, for which VP shunt removal and external"
		ventricular drain placement was performed. Three days into treatment with
		"amphotericin B, he endured significant nephrotoxicity necessitating a switch to"
		oral fluconazole. Following 3 weeks of oral fluconazole treatment with negative
		"serial cerebrospinal fluid cultures, the patient underwent external ventricular"
		drain removal and VP shunt insertion. Following the procedure and 22 total days
		"of oral fluconazole treatment, our patient recovered well and was discharged to a"
		"rehabilitation facility in stable condition. CONCLUSIONS: In our report, we"
		describe the clinical course of our patient and offer a review and analysis of
		"the most up-to-date literature concerning C. parapsilosis shunt infections, as"
		well as treatment guidelines for central nervous system candidiasis.

AB	-	"The Candida parapsilosis group encompasses three species: C. parapsilosis, C."
		"orthopsilosis, and C. metapsilosis. Here, we describe the incidence and"
		echinocandin susceptibility profile of bloodstream isolates of these three
		species collected from patients admitted to an Italian university hospital from
		2007 to 2014. Molecular identification of cryptic species of the C. parapsilosis
		complex was performed using polymerase chain reaction amplification of the gene
		"encoding secondary alcohol dehydrogenase, followed by digestion with the"
		restriction enzyme BanI. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined using
		the broth microdilution method according to European Committee for Antimicrobial
		Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST EDef 7.2) and Clinical Laboratory Standards
		"Institute (CLSI M27-A3) guidelines, and the results were compared with those"
		obtained using the E-test and Sensititre methods. Of the 163 C. parapsilosis
		"complex isolates, 136 (83.4%) were identified as C. parapsilosis, and 27 (16.6%)"
		"as C. orthopsilosis. The species-specific incidences were 2.9/10,000 admissions"
		"for C. parapsilosis and 0.6/10,000 admissions for C. orthopsilosis. No resistance"
		to echinocandins was detected with any of the methods. The percent essential
		agreement (EA) between the EUCAST and E-test/Sensititre methods for
		"anidulafungin, caspofungin, and micafungin susceptibility was, respectively, as"
		"follows: C. parapsilosis, 95.6/97.8, 98.5/88.2, and 93.4/96.3; C. orthopsilosis,"
		"92.6/92.6, 96.3/77.8, and 63.0/66.7. The EA between the CLSI and"
		"E-test/Sensititre methods was, respectively, as follows: C. parapsilosis,"
		"99.3/100, 98.5/89.0, and 96.3/98.5; C. orthopsilosis, 96.3/92.6, 100/81.5, and"
		"92.6/88.9. Only minor discrepancies, ranging from 16.9% (C. parapsilosis) to"
		"11.1% (C. orthopsilosis), were observed between the CLSI and E-test/Sensititre"
		"methods. In conclusion, this epidemiologic study shows a typical C. parapsilosis"
		"complex species distribution, no echinocandin resistance, and it reinforces the"
		relevance of using commercially available microbiological methods to assess
		antifungal susceptibility. These data improve our knowledge of the national
		"distribution of species of the psilosis group, as there are very few studies of"
		these species in Italy.

PG	-	480-7

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Biliary obstruction and cholangitis are common problems in
		gastroenterology. Infections of the biliary tract with Candida and other fungal
		species have increasingly been seen in the last few years. OBJECTIVE: To
		"investigate the prevalence, associations, and trends of biliary-tract"
		"candidiasis. DESIGN: A prospective, observational, diagnostic study. SETTING:"
		"University Hospital, Muenster, Germany. PATIENTS: Consecutive patients undergoing"
		"ERCP for various indications. RESULTS: In 54 of 123 patients, we found Candida"
		"species in bile samples (44%). In only 7 patients, candidiasis was suspected on"
		endoscopy before mycologic proof. Only 4 of these 7 patients were correctly
		diagnosed with biliary candidiasis by simple morphologic aspects. The fungus was
		mainly differentiated as Candida albicans or Candida glabrata and rarely as
		"Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, or other subspecies. Immunosuppression"
		for various reasons was significantly associated with bile-duct candidiasis (P <
		.02). No significant association was found between positive fungal cultures and
		prior endoscopic sphincterotomy (P = .0824) or prior ERCP (P = .1152). Biliary
		candidiasis was neither associated with positive fungal cultures of buccal smears
		(P = .0722) nor with positive findings in stool samples (P = .0860). LIMITATIONS:
		Highly selected patient population. Buccal smears and stool samples were not
		obtained from all patients. Contamination artifacts cannot totally be excluded
		with the ERCP procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Candida species very frequently can be
		detected in the bile. Positive fungal cultures of bile samples are not just
		contamination artifacts. This has to be taken into account when designing an
		anti-infectious treatment for recurrent cholangitis or even more cholangiosepsis.
		Especially in immunosuppressed patients or recipients of long-term antibiotic
		"therapy, physicians should screen for biliary-tract candidiasis during endoscopic"
		examination.

AB	-	Whole genome sequencing has been extensively used to describe infection
		"outbreaks, although with limited application on Candida albicans and Candida"
		parapsilosis.We retrospectively studied all patients admitted to the neonatal
		care unit diagnosed with candidemia caused by C. albicans (n = 46) or C.
		parapsilosis (n = 31) between 2007 and 2010 (Period 1) and 2011 and 2014 (Period
		2). All isolates were genotyped by microsatellite markers. A cluster was defined
		as a group of ≥ 2 patients infected by strains with identical genotypes. For the
		"validation of microsatellite markers and outbreak investigation, phylogenetic"
		analyses and whole genome pairwise strain comparisons were performed.The number
		of episodes was significantly higher in Period 1 than in Period 2 (51 vs 32;
		P = 0.003); the reduction in the number of cases coincided with the educational
		"campaign for catheter care implementation in 2011. Overall, eight genotypes were"
		clusters involving 29 patients. All C. albicans (n = 5) and C. parapsilosis
		(n = 3) clusters were found during Period 1 before the educational campaign. No
		statistically significant differences were found between the percentage of C.
		"albicans and C. parapsilosis clusters, but the percentage of patients associated"
		to the clusters was significantly higher for C. parapsilosis clusters in
		comparison to C. albicans clusters (52 vs 28.2%; P = 0.03). Whole genome
		sequencing confirmed microsatellite-defined clusters with high bootstrap
		"values.Whole genome sequences confirmed microsatellite-defined clusters,"
		corroborating the presence of outbreaks. Persistent or sporadic Candida clusters
		causing candidemia in neonates disappeared after the implementation of catheter
		care educational campaigns. LAY SUMMARY: We retrospectively studied all patients
		admitted to the neonatal care unit diagnosed with candidemia caused by C.
		albicans or C. parapsilosis. Reliable whole genome sequences confirmed
		"microsatellite-defined clusters, corroborating the presence of outbreaks before"
		educational campaigns for catheter care.

TI	-	Relative frequency of albicans and the various non-albicans Candida spp among
		candidemia isolates from inpatients in various parts of the world: a systematic
		review.
PG	-	e954-66
LID	-	10.1016/j.ijid.2010.04.006 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candidemia is among the leading causes of nosocomial bloodstream
		infections and is associated with significant mortality. Several centers have
		published data regarding the incidence and relative frequency of Candida spp.
		OBJECTIVE: We performed a systematic review to summarize and evaluate the
		available evidence regarding the distribution of the relative frequency of
		"Candida spp isolated from blood, according to geographic region and study design,"
		during the period 1996 to 2009. METHODS: We searched PubMed and Scopus and
		retrieved 81 relevant articles reporting data on the relative frequency of
		Candida spp. RESULTS: C. albicans was the predominant species in almost all
		studies. The highest proportion of C. albicans was found in North and Central
		"Europe and the USA. Non-albicans species were more common in South America, Asia,"
		and South Europe. C. glabrata was commonly isolated in the USA and North and
		"Central Europe; C. parapsilosis in South America, South Europe, and several parts"
		of Asia; and C. tropicalis in South America and Asia. The relative frequency of
		C. krusei was low in all regions. Significant differences were noted depending on
		"study design (surveillance study, multicenter or single centre, prospective or"
		retrospective) and setting (hospital or intensive care unit). CONCLUSIONS:
		Significant geographic variation is evident among cases of candidemia in
		different parts of the world. Local epidemiological data continue to be of major
		significance.

TI	-	Oral Candidiasis in children and adolescents with cancer. Identification of
		Candida spp.
PG	-	E419-23
AB	-	Oral candidiasis represents a serious problem for children with cancer. The
		"mortality rate of this infection has increased due to fungal septicemia,"
		associated with a primary buccal infection. OBJECTIVE: Identify the Candida spp.
		"in buccal lesions of patients with cancer, establish the predominant species and"
		"correlate them to age and sex of the patient, clinical presentation, type of"
		"neoplasic disease and cytostatic therapy received. STUDY DESIGN: 62 patients,"
		"between 0-16 years, were investigated in a cross sectional study. SAMPLE"
		INCLUSION CRITERIA: Patients with malignant neoplasic disease that were receiving
		cytostatic treatment and had suspicious lesions of oral candidiasis. Patients
		"with antifungal therapy, active caries, calculus or intraoral appliances were"
		excluded. A clinical evaluation was carried out. The lesion sample was taken and
		studied by direct exam and culture in CHROMagar-Candida and Sabouraud-Dextrose
		Agar with chloramphenicol. The identification of the isolated yeast was done by
		"the filamentation test, carbohydrate fermentation and assimilation. RESULTS: Most"
		"of the cases (69.35%) were positive to oral candidiasis, C. albicans was the most"
		"frequent species found, followed by C. parapsilosis (14.89%), C. tropicalis"
		"(12.77%), C. krusei (4.26%), C. glabrata (2.13%) and C. lusitaniae (2.13%). In"
		some cases more than one specie were isolated (9.30%). The most frequent location
		of the lesion was in the tongue (72.70%). The pseudomembranous candidiasis was
		the most frequent clinical presentation found (78.71%). There were not
		"significant statistically differences with regard to sex and age of the patient,"
		type of neoplasic disease and cytostatic agent received. CONCLUSION: The results
		suggest that oral candidiasis is a frequent complication in the pediatric
		"oncological population, being C. albicans the main etiological agent, however,"
		there is an important participation of other Candida species.

		2006 to 2011.
PG	-	353
LID	-	10.1186/1471-2334-13-353 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive candidiasis is an important nosocomial infection associated
		with high mortality among immunosuppressive or critically ill patients. We
		described the incidence of invasive candidiasis in our hospital over 6 years and
		showed the antifungal susceptibility and genotypes of the isolated yeast. METHOD:
		The yeast species were isolated on CHROMagar Candida medium and identified using
		"an yeast identification card, followed by analysis of the D1/D2 domain of 26S"
		"rDNA. The susceptibilities of the isolates to flucytosine, amphotericin B,"
		"fluconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole were tested using the ATB FUNGUS 3"
		"system, and that to caspofungin was tested using E-test strips. C. albicans was"
		genotyped using single-strand conformation polymorphism of CAI (Candida albicans
		I) microsatellite DNA combined with GeneScan data. RESULTS: From January 2006 to
		"December 2011, a total of 259 isolates of invasive Candida spp. were obtained"
		"from 253 patients, among them 6 patients had multiple positive samples."
		"Ninety-one stains were from blood and 168 from sterile fluids, accounting for"
		6.07% of all pathogens isolated in our hospital. Most of these strains were C.
		"albicans (41.29% in blood/59.06% in sterile body fluids), followed by C."
		"tropicalis (18.06%/25.72%), C. parapsilosis (17.42%/5.43%), C. glabrata"
		(11.61%/3.99%) and other Candida spp. (11.61%/5.80%). Most Candida spp. were
		isolated from the ICU. The new species-specific CLSI candida MIC breakpoints were
		applied to these date. Resistance to fluconazole occurred in 6.6% of C. albicans
		"isolates, 10.6% of C. tropicalis isolates and 15.0% of C. glabrata isolates. For"
		"the 136 C. albicans isolates, 54 CAI patterns were recognized. The C. albicans"
		strains from blood or sterile body fluids showed no predominant CAI genotypes. C.
		albicans isolates from different samples from the same patient had the same
		genotype. CONCLUSIONS: Invasive candidiasis has been commonly encountered in our
		"hospital in the past 6 years, with increasing frequency of non-C. albicans."
		Resistance to fluconazole was highly predictive of resistance to voriconazole.
		CAI SSCP genotyping showed that all C. albicans strains were polymorphic.
		Invasive candidiasis were commonly endogenous infection.

TI	-	Candidemia in major burns patients.
PG	-	391-8
LID	-	10.1111/myc.12488 [doi]
AB	-	Major burn patients have characteristics that make them especially susceptible to
		"candidemia, but few studies focused on this have been published. The objectives"
		"were to evaluate the epidemiological, microbiological and clinical aspects of"
		"candidemia in major burn patients, determining factors associated with a poorer"
		prognosis and mortality. We conducted a retrospective observational study of
		candidemia between 1996 and 2012 in major burn patients admitted to the La Fe
		"University Hospital, Valencia, Spain. The study included 36 episodes of"
		"candidemia in the same number of patients, 55.6% men, mean age 37.33 years and"
		low associated comorbidity. The incidence of candidemia varied between 0.26 and
		6.09 episodes/1000 days stay in the different years studied. Candida albicans was
		the most common species (61.1%) followed by Candida parapsilosis (27.8%).
		"Candidemia by C. krusei, C. glabrata or C. tropicalis were all identified after"
		2004. Central vascular catheter (CVC) was established as a potential source of
		"candidemia in 36.1%, followed by skin and soft tissues of thermal injury (22.2%)"
		and urinary tract (8.3%). Fluconazole was used in 19 patients (52.7%) and its in
		"vitro resistance rate was 13.9%. The overall mortality was 47.2%, and mortality"
		related to candidemia was 30.6%. Factors associated with increased mortality were
		those related to severe infection and shock. CVC was the most usual focus of
		candidemia. Fluconazole was the most common antifungal drug administered. The
		management of candidemia in major burn patients is still a challenge.

TI	-	Factors Influencing Non-albicans Candidemia: A Case-Case-Control Study.
PG	-	665-672
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-017-0146-4 [doi]
AB	-	The study identified factors predisposing to non-albicans candidemia with special
		"interest to prior antimicrobial treatment. A retrospective, case-case-control"
		"study was performed at the University Hospital of Heraklion, Greece, from"
		November 2007 through September 2011 including adult patients. The study had
		"three groups. The first included 58 patients with non-albicans candidemia, the"
		"second 48 with C. albicans candidemia, while the third (control) 104 without"
		candidemia. Each of the two candidemia groups was compared with the control using
		"multivariate logistic regression model. The mean (SD) age of the non-albicans,"
		"the albicans and the control patients was 67 (12), 67 (18) and 59 (19) years,"
		respectively. The most common non-albicans Candida spp. isolated were C.
		"parapsilosis in 19 patients (33%), C. glabrata in 17 (29%) and C. tropicalis in"
		15 (26%). Independent risk factors for non-albicans candidemia were prior
		"treatment with quinolones (p < 0.001), b-lactam-b-lactamase inhibitors"
		"(p = 0.011) and presence of central venous catheter (p = 0.05), while for C."
		"albicans candidemia were prior treatment with quinolones (p < 0.001), carbapenems"
		(p = 0.003) along with cardiac disease (p < 0.001). Neither duration of
		hospitalization nor in-hospital mortality [41% for the non-albicans vs 29% for C.
		albicans group (p = 0.192)] was significantly different between the two
		candidemia groups. The study reveals the role of antimicrobial exposure as a risk
		factor for candidemia caused by different species. Prior treatment with
		"b-lactam-b-lactamase inhibitors was associated with non-albicans, while with"
		carbapenems with C. albicans candidemia. Prior use of quinolones was associated
		with candidemia in general.

TI	-	Epidemiology and reporting of candidaemia in Belgium: a multi-centre study.
PG	-	649-655
LID	-	10.1007/s10096-016-2841-3 [doi]
AB	-	The primary aim of this study was to collect national epidemiological data on
		candidaemia and to determine the reporting time of species identification and
		antifungal susceptibility in clinical practice. During a 1-year period (March
		"2013 until February 2014), every first Candida isolate from each episode of"
		candidaemia was included prospectively from 30 Belgian hospitals. Identification
		and susceptibility testing were performed according to local procedures and
		isolates were sent to the National Reference Center for Mycosis. Species
		identification was checked by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation
		time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and internal transcribed spacer
		(ITS) sequencing in case no reliable identification was obtained by MALDI-TOF MS.
		Antifungal susceptibility testing was performed according to the European
		Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) methodology. A total
		of 355 isolates were retrieved from 338 patients. The mean incidence rate of
		candidaemia was 0.44 (range: 0.07 to 1.43) per 1000 admissions or 0.65 (range:
		"0.11 to 2.00) per 10,000 patient days. Candida albicans was most frequently found"
		"(50.4 %), followed by C. glabrata (27.3 %) and C. parapsilosis sensu lato"
		"(9.8 %). The overall resistance to fluconazole was 7.6 %, ranging from 3.9 % in"
		C. albicans to 20.0 % in C. tropicalis. Only one C. glabrata isolate was
		"resistant to the echinocandins. Four days after blood culture positivity, 99.7 %"
		of the identifications and 90.3 % of the antifungal profiles were reported to the
		treating clinician. Candidaemia incidence rates differed up to 20-fold among
		Belgian hospitals; no clear factors explaining this difference were identified.
		The overall antifungal resistance rates were low but high azole resistance rates
		were recorded in C. tropicalis.

TI	-	Fungaemia due to rare yeasts in paediatric intensive care units: A prospective
		study.
PG	-	1387-1395
LID	-	10.1111/myc.13297 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Considering the emergence of fungaemia due to rare yeasts at our
		"centre, we performed a systematic epidemiologic study on fungaemia due to rare"
		yeast. OBJECTIVES: We undertook the present prospective observational study to
		explore the epidemiological features and clinical characteristics of fungaemia
		due to rare yeasts in paediatric ICUs at our centre. METHODS: The successive
		yeasts isolated from blood at our PICUs during December 2017 through March 2019
		were identified by molecular methods. Fungaemia due to yeasts other than
		"C. albicans, C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, C. krusei and C. parapsilosis was"
		categorised as rare yeasts. Antifungal susceptibility testing of the yeast
		isolates was performed as per clinical and laboratory standards institute (CLSI)
		guidelines. We also compared different clinical parameters of fungaemia due to
		"common versus rare yeasts, and rare yeasts in neonates versus non-neonates."
		"RESULTS: During the study period, 212 yeast isolates were obtained from 159"
		"patients at PICUs of our hospital, and 127 isolates from 98 patients (61.6%) were"
		categorised as rare yeasts. Neonates acquired fungaemia significantly earlier
		after ICU admission than non-neonates (median:4 vs 6 days; p = .005). Regarding
		"epidemiology study of rare yeast fungaemia, Wickerhamomyces anomalus (43.8%) and"
		Candida utilis (40.8%) were common isolates; surgical intervention and
		"gastrointestinal disease were significantly associated; overall, azole,"
		"echinocandin and amphotericin B resistance was at 9.1%, 1.02% and 1.02%,"
		respectively; overall mortality was 65.3%. CONCLUSIONS: The emergence of rare
		yeasts especially W. anomalus and C. utilis causing fungaemia in our children
		demands urgent attention to control the spread.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: The epidemiology of candidemia has changed over the last decades and
		varies widely among geographic areas. AIMS: We examined in children (aged 0-14)
		"with candidemia the trends in the incidence rate of this infection, as well as"
		"the clinical characteristics of the patients, in order to optimize the prognosis"
		and the control measures of this serious disease. METHODS: A retrospective cohort
		study of candidemia in the period 2011-2018 in the neonatal intensive care unit
		"(NICU), pediatric ICU (PICU) and pediatric wards of a tertiary hospital, was"
		"conducted. The clinical course, Candida species isolated, antifungal"
		"susceptibility, outcome and incidence rates were analyzed and compared. RESULTS:"
		"We diagnosed 68 episodes of candidemia in 62 children, 48% occurred in the NICU,"
		31% in the PICU and 21% in pediatric wards. Candida albicans was the most
		"frequent species isolated in NICU infants (53%), and Candida parapsilosis"
		predominated among PICU patients (59%) and pediatric wards (50%). One third of
		"NICU infants had invasive candidiasis (IC), most of them having extremely low"
		birth weight (ELBW) (35%). All isolates were susceptible to the antifungal
		"administered. Over time, the incidence of candidemia decreased in the PICU (from"
		"2.2 to 0.3 episodes/1000 patient-days, OR=0.6; 95%CI 0.5-0.8), whereas in the"
		NICU and in the wards remained stable. Mortality occurred mostly in NICU patients
		"(26%), predominated in ELBW infants and did not change over time. CONCLUSIONS:"
		The higher incidence and mortality of candidemia and IC observed in preterm
		infants requires a continuous evaluation of practices and diagnostic methods
		which will allow improving the prognosis of this most vulnerable population.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at providing original data on fungemia in the Centre
		"Hospitalier de Mayotte in terms of prevalence, epidemiological characteristics of"
		"infected patients, yeast species distribution and profile of in vitro antifungals"
		susceptibility. METHODS: A total of 223 positive blood cultures for yeasts were
		retrospectively reported during the period April 2010-April 2020. RESULTS:
		Ninety-five episodes were identified corresponding to an incidence rate of 3.7
		"cases/100,000 inhabitants. The average age of patients was 33.5 years, and 63.3%"
		patients were hospitalized in intensive care unit. The main co-morbidities were
		"surgery in the 30 days prior to fungemia (27.8%), neoplasia (22.8%), parenteral"
		"nutrition (17.7%), diabetes (16.5%) and immunosuppressive medications (31.6%)."
		Candida spp accounted for the majority of isolates (92.4%) with a predominance of
		"non-albicans species (55.8% vs 33.7%), including C. albicans (33.7%),"
		C. tropicalis (30.5%) and C. parapsilosis (20%). The antifungal susceptibility
		profiles did not differ from expected results for each species and did not change
		significantly over time. DISCUSSION: Fungemia remain frequent hospital infections
		associated with high mortality in Mayotte. The vast majority of fungemia was due
		to Candida spp. Non-albicansCandida species reach half of the Candida isolates
		"with a high percentage of C. tropicalis. Surprisingly, no case of candidemia due"
		to C. glabrata were identified. The management of candidemia remains satisfactory
		and the treatment was adapted according to the international recommendations.
		"However, the high susceptibility of Candida spp. isolates to fluconazole may"
		invite to reconsider the use of this molecule as empirical and first-line
		treatment of candidemia in Mayotte.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Leprosy represents a chronic progressive debilitating disease. The
		severe morbidity associated with leprosy predisposes the patients to
		opportunistic infections. To assess the oral candida prevalence and species
		specificity in lepromatous leprosy patients. METHODS: The cross-sectional study
		included 70 lepromatous leprosy patients under a multi-drug regimen for less than
		1 year (group 1) and 70 healthy volunteers (group 2). Both group 1 and 2 were
		"matched for potential confounding factors including age, gender, ethnicity,"
		absence of HIV co-infection. Oral swab samples obtained from both groups were
		subjected to a series of conventional and molecular diagnostic modalities.
		RESULTS: Yeast growth was statistically higher (0.0006) in group 1 (45.7%) than
		in group 2 (18.5%). 28 of the 32 yeast growth in group 1 and all 13 yeast growth
		"in group 2 were identified as candida. Among the 28 candida species in group 1,"
		"23 (71.88%) were Candida albicans, 3 (9.37%) were Candida parapsilosis, 1 (3.13%)"
		"was Candida lusitaniae and 1 (3.13%) was Candida nivariensis. Among group 2, 11"
		"(84.6%) were Candida albicans, 1 (7.7%) was Candida parapsilosis and 1 was"
		Candida tropicalis. CONCLUSION: Oral candida prevalence is higher in leprosy
		"patients than in healthy individuals, indicating a predisposition towards"
		opportunistic infections. The increasing prevalence of the non-candida albicans
		species in leprosy is a major concern as they have shown to possess inherent
		resistant towards common anti-fungal agents.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Active surveillance is necessary for improving the management and
		outcome of patients with candidemia. The aim of this study was to describe
		epidemiologic and clinical features of candidemia in children and adults in
		"tertiary level hospitals in Chile. METHODS: We conducted a prospective,"
		"multicenter, laboratory-based survey study of candidemia in 26 tertiary care"
		"hospitals in Chile, from January 2013 to October 2017. RESULTS: A total of 780"
		"episodes of candidemia were included, with a median incidence of 0.47/1,000"
		"admissions. Demographic, clinical and microbiological information of 384 cases of"
		"candidemia, from 18 hospitals (7,416 beds), was included in this report. One"
		hundred and thirty-four episodes (35%) occurred in pediatric patients and 250
		"(65%) in adult population. Candida albicans (39%), Candida parapsilosis (30%) and"
		"Candida glabrata (10%) were the leading species, with a significant difference in"
		the distribution of species between ages. The use of central venous catheter and
		antibiotics were the most frequent risk factors in all age groups (> 70%). Three
		hundred and fifteen strains were studied for antifungal susceptibility; 21
		"strains (6.6%) were resistant to fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole,"
		anidulafungin or micafungin. The most commonly used antifungal therapies were
		"fluconazole (39%) and echinocandins (36%). The overall 30-day survival was 74.2%,"
		significantly higher in infants (82%) and children (86%) compared with neonates
		"(72%), adults (71%) and elderly (70%). CONCLUSIONS: Our prospective, multicenter"
		"surveillance study showed a low incidence of candidemia in Chile, with high"
		"30-day survival, a large proportion of elderly patients, C. glabrata as the third"
		"most commonly identified strain, a 6.6% resistance to antifungal agents and a"
		frequent use of echinocandins.

		(2005-2006) to 4.7/100 000 population/year (2015-2016). The three most common
		"Candida spp. isolated from blood cultures were Candida albicans (54.7%), Candida"
		glabrata (19.7%) and species in the Candida parapsilosis complex (9.4%). Candida
		"resistance to fluconazole was 2% in C. albicans and between 0% and 100%, in"
		non-albicans species other than C. glabrata and C. krusei. Resistance to
		"voriconazole was rare, except for C. glabrata, C. krusei and C. tropicalis."
		Resistance to anidulafungin was 3.8% while no Candida isolate was resistant to
		amphotericin B. CONCLUSIONS: We report an overall increase in candidaemia but a
		minor decrease of C. albicans while C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis remain
		constant over this 10-year period.

AB	-	"OBJECTIVES: To determine the epidemiology of Candida bloodstream infections,"
		"variables influencing mortality, and antifungal resistance rates in ICUs in"
		"Spain. DESIGN: Prospective, observational, multicenter population-based study."
		SETTING: Medical and surgical ICUs in 29 hospitals distributed throughout five
		metropolitan areas of Spain. PATIENTS: Adult patients (≥ 18 yr) with an episode
		of Candida bloodstream infection during admission to any surveillance area ICU
		from May 2010 to April 2011. INTERVENTIONS: Candida isolates were sent to a
		reference laboratory for species identification by DNA sequencing and
		susceptibility testing using the methods and breakpoint criteria promulgated by
		the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing. Prognostic
		factors associated with early (0-7 d) and late (8-30 d) mortality were analyzed
		using logistic regression modeling. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We detected
		"773 cases of candidemia, 752 of which were included in the overall cohort. Among"
		"these, 168 (22.3%) occurred in adult ICU patients. The rank order of Candida"
		"isolates was as follows: Candida albicans (52%), Candida parapsilosis (23.7%),"
		"Candida glabrata (12.7%), Candida tropicalis (5.8%), Candida krusei (4%), and"
		others (1.8%). Overall susceptibility to fluconazole was 79.2%. Cumulative
		mortality at 7 and 30 days after the first episode of candidemia was 16.5% and
		"47%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that early appropriate antifungal"
		"treatment and catheter removal (odds ratio, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.08-0.91), Acute"
		"Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (odds ratio, 1.11; 95% CI,"
		"1.04-1.19), and abdominal source (odds ratio, 8.15; 95% CI, 1.75-37.93) were"
		independently associated with early mortality. Determinants of late mortality
		"were age (odds ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.07), intubation (odds ratio, 7.24; 95%"
		"CI, 2.24-23.40), renal replacement therapy (odds ratio, 6.12; 95% CI,"
		"2.24-16.73), and primary source (odds ratio, 2.51; 95% CI, 1.06-5.95)."
		CONCLUSIONS: Candidemia in ICU patients is caused by non-albicans species in 48%
		"of cases, C. parapsilosis being the most common among these. Overall mortality"
		remains high and mainly related with host factors. Prompt adequate antifungal
		treatment and catheter removal could be critical to decrease early mortality.

PG	-	1303-12
LID	-	10.1007/s00134-014-3408-3 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: To analyze trends in incidence and mortality of candidemia in intensive
		care units (ICUs) vs. non-ICU hospitalized patients and to determine risk factors
		for infection by specific species and for death. METHODS: Active hospital-based
		surveillance program of incident episodes of candidemia due to common species in
		"24 tertiary care hospitals in the Paris area, France between October 2002 and"
		"September 2010. RESULTS: Among 2,507 adult cases included, 2,571 Candida isolates"
		"were collected and species were C. albicans (56 %), C. glabrata (18.6 %), C."
		"parapsilosis (11.5 %), C. tropicalis (9.3 %), C. krusei (2.9 %), and C. kefyr"
		"(1.8 %). Candidemia occurred in ICU in 1,206 patients (48.1 %). When comparing"
		"ICU vs. non-ICU patients, the former had significantly more frequent surgery"
		"during the past 30 days, were more often preexposed to fluconazole and treated"
		"with echinocandin, and were less frequently infected with C. parapsilosis. Risk"
		factors and age remained unchanged during the study period. A significant
		increased incidence in the overall population and ICU was found. The odds of
		being infected with a given species in ICU was influenced by risk factors and
		preexposure to fluconazole and caspofungin. Echinocandins initial therapy
		"increased over time in ICU (4.6 % first year of study, to 48.5 % last year of"
		"study, p < 0.0001). ICU patients had a higher day-30 death rate than non-ICU"
		patients (odds ratio [OR] 2.12; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.66-2.72; p <
		0.0001). The day-30 and early (<day 8) death rates increased over time in ICU
		(from 41.5 % the first to 56.9 % the last year of study (p = 0.001) and 28.7-38.8
		"% (p = 0.0292), respectively). Independent risk factors for day-30 death in ICU"
		"were age, arterial catheter, Candida species, preexposure to caspofungin, and"
		lack of antifungal therapy at the time of blood cultures results (p < 0.05).
		CONCLUSIONS: The availability of new antifungals and the publication of numerous
		guidelines did not prevent an increase of candidemia and death in ICU patients in
		the Paris area.

AB	-	The epidemiological and antifungal susceptibility data for 35 episodes of
		candidemia in intensive care units (ICU) in 2007 were evaluated by prospective
		active surveillance. The incidence of fungaemia was 39.1 cases per 1000 ICU
		admissions and 2.85 cases per 1000 patient-days. The crude mortality was 65.7%;
		70.8% of the fatalities occurred within 7 days of admission to the ICU. Only 2
		"species were isolated, Candida parapsilosis (77.1%) and Candida albicans (22.9%)."
		"There was no association between mortality and patient characteristics, prior"
		"antifungal usage, Candida subspecies or antifungal resistance (p > 0.05). Of the"
		"isolates, 5.7% were resistant to fluconazole and caspofungin, and 3.4% to"
		"voriconazole and amphotericin B. In molecular analysis of the isolates, 2"
		clusters of C. parapsilosis in the neurology and anaesthesiology ICUs were
		"detected by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), suggesting a nosocomial"
		"transmission. In conclusion, a high incidence and high mortality rate of C."
		parapsilosis candidaemia were found in the ICUs. An excessive use of invasive
		"procedures, total parenteral nutrition and broad-spectrum antibiotics in the"
		"ICUs, combined with a lack of proper infection control measures, may possibly"
		explain the high incidence of C. parapsilosis candidaemia in our hospital.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: The impact of central venous catheter (CVC) removal on the outcome of
		"patients with candidemia is controversial, with studies reporting discrepant"
		results depending on the time of CVC removal (early or any time during the course
		"of candidemia). OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the effect of time to CVC removal, early"
		(within 48h from the diagnosis of candidemia) vs. removal at any time during the
		"course of candidemia, on the 30-day mortality. METHODS: Retrospective cohort"
		study of 285 patients with candidemia analyzing CVC removal within 48h (first
		analysis) or at any time (second analysis). RESULTS: A CVC was in place in 212
		"patients and was removed in 148 (69.8%), either early (88 patients, 41.5%) or"
		"late (60 patients, 28.3%). Overall, the median time to CVC removal was one day"
		(range 1-28) but was six days (range 3-28) for those removed later. In the first
		"analysis, APACHE II score (odds ratio [OR] 1.111, 95% confidence interval [95%"
		"CI] 1.066-1.158), removal at any time (OR 0.079, 95% CI 0.021-0.298) and Candida"
		"parapsilosis infection (OR 0.291, 95% CI 0.133-0.638) were predictors of 30-day"
		mortality. Early removal was not significant. In the second analysis APACHE II
		"score (OR 1.122, 95% CI 1.071-1.175) and C. parapsilosis infection (OR 0.247, 95%"
		CI 0.103-0.590) retained significance. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of CVC removal is
		dependent on whether the optimal analysis strategy is deployed and should be
		taken into consideration in future analyses.

PG	-	133-9
LID	-	10.1111/myc.12287 [doi]
AB	-	Onychomycosis is a fungal infection treated orally for prolonged periods of
		"treatment, caused primarily by Dermatophytes, Candida species and"
		non-dermatophyte moulds (NDMs). The prevalence of specific aetiology may differ
		"in dependence of environmental, geographic and demographic factors, and may"
		affect management of the infection. The objective of this survey was to analyse
		"epidemiologic parameters of onychomycosis in Israel. Data of a cohort of 27,093"
		patients were collected from six centres during a 2- and 10-year period. The
		diagnosis was based on microscopy of KOH/calcofluor mounts of nail scrapings and
		culture isolation. A positive result indicates isolation of a fungus in culture.
		"Data were analysed for each centre and expressed as range for the whole cohort,"
		using the spss v18 software. Analysis included three epidemiologic parameters:
		fungal aetiology in toe- and fingernails; association with gender; association
		with age group. Dermatophytes were the major causative agents and Trichophyton
		rubrum the most frequent isolate. Candida species were more frequent in women
		fingernails; frequency increased with age and C. parapsilosis the most frequent
		species. NDMs were isolated at low rate and Aspergillus terreus was the most
		frequent isolate. This is a first large cohort of onychomycosis patients from
		Israel analysed by defined epidemiological parameters.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Candida is the leading cause of vaginitis, and 75% of women have at"
		"least one episode of infection in their lives, with pregnancy being a"
		"predisposing factor. If left untreated, vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) can lead"
		"to chorioamnionitis with subsequent abortion, prematurity and congenital"
		"infection of the neonate. We aimed to determine the prevalence of VVC, identify"
		"the recent and most frequently occurring species of Candida in pregnant women,"
		and determine the most effective antifungal drug of choice for treatment. METHOD:
		A prospective cross-sectional study in which 176 high vaginal swab samples of
		consented pregnant women visiting the antenatal clinic from February 2018 to
		April 2018 were subjected to direct gram smear and culture for Candida isolation.
		Candida isolates were identified using a germ tube test and HiCrome Candida
		differential agar. Candida isolates were then subjected to a disk diffusion
		"method using fluconazole (25 μg), nystatin (100 units), and voriconazole (1 μg)"
		on Mueller-Hinton agar supplemented with 2% (w/v) glucose and 0.5 μg/ml methylene
		blue dye to determine the susceptibility pattern as per the guidelines of the
		Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI). Chi-square analysis was used to
		ascertain the significant association of participants' sociodemographics and
		clinical presentations to VVC. A univariate logistic regression model was used to
		identify potential risk factors of VVC. RESULTS: The prevalence of VVC among our
		study participants was 30.7%. Non-albicans Candida (NAC) and Candida albicans had
		"a prevalence of 74.1 and 25.9%, respectively. Candida glabrata was the most"
		"common species, followed by Candida albicans, Candida krusei, and Candida"
		"parapsilosis. 50.0, 18.5 and 3.7% of Candida species were susceptible to"
		"voriconazole, fluconazole and nystatin, respectively, whereas 37.0, 48.1 and 9.3%"
		"of Candida species were resistant to voriconazole, fluconazole and nystatin,"
		respectively. The majority of isolates were susceptible dose dependent to all
		"three antifungal agents, with voriconazole being the most efficacious antifungal"
		agent. There was no significant association between participants'
		socio-demographic information and clinical presentations to VVC. CONCLUSION: The
		prevalence of VVC was high in the study area. C. glabrata was found to be the
		"most common cause of VVC among the pregnant women attending antenatal clinics, in"
		the Ho Municipality region of Ghana. The majority of the Candida isolates were
		"susceptible and resistant to voriconazole and fluconazole, respectively."

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: The goal of the study was to measure the prevalence of Candida spp. in
		the oral cavity of patients with diabetes types 1 and 2 when compared to healthy
		individuals and to study antifungal resistance profile of the isolates. DESIGN:
		There were 162 subjects in the study: diabetes type 1 (n=39); control group 1
		"(n=50): healthy individuals matched in gender, age, and oral conditions to"
		diabetes type 1 patients; diabetes type 2 (n=37); control group 2 (n=36) who were
		matched to each patient of the diabetes type 2 group. Stimulated saliva was
		collected and isolates were identified with phenotypic tests. The presence of C.
		dubliniensis was determined by multiplex PCR. RESULTS: There were no
		statistically significant differences in Candida spp. frequency between the
		diabetes 1 group and its control (p=0.443) nor between the diabetes 2 group and
		its control (p=0.429). C. albicans was the most frequently isolated yeast in all
		"groups. In the diabetes groups, C. stellatoidea, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis,"
		"C. lipolytica, C. glabrata, and C. krusei were also identified. Additionally, in"
		"control groups, C. kefyr was also detected. None of the isolates were resistant"
		to amphotericin B and flucytosine. A low percentage of the isolates were
		resistant to ketoconazole. CONCLUSIONS: No differences were detected in
		colonization of Candida spp. oral isolates from type 1 and type 2 diabetes when
		compared to matched controls. The antifungal resistance of Candida spp. isolates
		for ketoconazole from type 1 diabetes patients was significantly higher than that
		of its matched control.

AB	-	Voriconazole is a broad-spectrum triazole antifungal agent indicated for invasive
		"aspergillosis, refractory Candida infections, and other emerging invasive fungal"
		infections. Adverse cutaneous reactions associated with voriconazole therapy
		occur in fewer than 10% of treated patients and range from mild erythematous
		eruptions to life-threatening reactions such as the Stevens-Johnson syndrome and
		toxic epidermal necrolysis. Photosensitivity reactions are an uncommon but
		"characteristic dermatitis in voriconazole recipients, particularly following"
		chronic administration. We report a case of voriconazole-induced phototoxicity in
		a 50-year-old male with Candida parapsilosis endocarditis that reversed on
		discontinuation of the drug.

AB	-	"PURPOSE: Candidemia is an important issue of nosocomial bloodstream infections,"
		"and is associated with a high mortality rate. However, little information is"
		"available before final species identification, which takes days after the episode"
		of candidemia. This study tried to determine whether time to positivity (TTP) for
		yeast helps in predicting the species of candidemia. METHODS: A retrospective
		"cohort study was conducted in Taiwan, which included 434 episodes of"
		nonduplicated candidemia during the period between 2006 and 2009. The demographic
		"features, clinical characteristics, TTP for yeast, and acute illness scores were"
		included for analysis. RESULTS: The mean age of patients with candidemia was 70.4
		"± 15.2 years, and the 30-day crude mortality rate was 48.2%. Forty-five percent"
		of patients suffered from shock status with a mean Acute Physiological and
		Chronic Health Evaluation II score of 27.0 ± 8.7 and a mean Sequential Organ
		"Failure Assessment score of 9.7 ± 4.5, whereas 50% were admitted to the intensive"
		care units. Candida albicans was still the most commonly identified pathogen
		"(58.1%), followed by C. tropicalis (14.7%), C. parapsilosis (13.1%), and C."
		glabrata (8.3%). Results of multivariate logistic regression showed that TTP for
		"yeast within 48 hours would more favor C. tropicalis (p = 0.044), and less favor"
		C. glabrata (p = 0.025) and C. parapsilosis (p < 0.001). Patients with parenteral
		nutrition usage were more frequently associated with a TTP for yeast within 48
		"hours, whereas those with previous exposure to an antifungal agent had a longer"
		TTP for yeast. CONCLUSION: The TTP for yeast might provide a hint of the
		responsible Candida species before final identification among critical patients
		with candidemia. The association between antifungal agents and TTP would need
		more evidence for elucidation.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Candidemia is a nosocomial infection of increasing importance,"
		associated with high morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study is to
		"describe the species distribution, risk factors, management and outcomes of"
		patients with candidemia. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study at Centro
		"Hospitalar Universitário de São João, Portugal, between January 2016 and December"
		2017. RESULTS: A total of 117 candidemia episodes (n=114 patients) were included.
		"Median age was 65 years, with an increased prevalence of older ages. Candida"
		"albicans (51.3%) was the most prevalent species, followed by C. glabrata (22.2%),"
		"C. parapsilosis (15.4%), C. tropicalis (4.3%) and C. lusitaniae (2.6%). Forty-two"
		patients (35.9%) did not receive antifungal drugs after diagnosis of candidemia.
		Echinocandins were used as first-line drug therapy in half of the treated
		patients (50.7%). The median EQUAL Candida Score was 6/17 (IQR 6-9) for patients
		without central venous catheter (CVC) and 11/20 (IQR 6-14) for patients with CVC.
		"The 30 days-mortality was 31,6% and was not significantly associated with the"
		timing of antifungal therapy and the EQUAL Candida Score. CONCLUSION: The
		"distribution of Candida species has changed in recent years, with an increase in"
		"the proportion of C. albicans and C. glabrata. Rapid diagnostic tests, empiric"
		antifungal therapy and source control are essential to improve the prognosis of
		patients with candidemia. More multicentric prospective studies are needed to
		evaluate the association of mortality with the timing of antifungal therapy or
		the EQUAL Candida Score.

PG	-	361-368
LID	-	10.1111/myc.13050 [doi]
AB	-	AIM: During the last decade a continuous increase in non-albicans species
		isolation has been observed with Candida parapsilosis being one of the leading
		"species. Aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology of candidemia,"
		"particularly of C parapsilosis, its predictors and clinical outcome. MATERIALS"
		AND METHODS: Incidences of candidemia was evaluated analyzing data from both a
		prospective collection (2012-2016) and a retrospective one (2008-2011).
		Predictors and outcome were based only on the prospective phase. C parapsilosis
		potential clusters were analysed by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)
		technique. RESULTS: 1240 episodes were identified. Incidences of candidemia
		increased from 1.97 episodes/10 000 patient-days in 2008 to 4.59/10 000
		"patient-days in 2016 (P < .001), mainly due to an increase of C parapsilosis"
		"(incidence rate ratio, IRR: 1.04, P < .001). 33.0% of C parapsilosis strains were"
		resistant to fluconazole; no resistance to echinocandins was found. Independent
		"predictors of C parapsilosis candidemia were time of infection (P = .007),"
		previous use of echinocandins (P < .0001) and year in which the episode was
		"registered (P < .0001). 30 days mortality was 32.4% for C parapsilosis, with a"
		significant difference compared to C non-parapsilosis. Potential clonal
		"C parapsilosis strains were detected by genetic analyses, showing RAPD profile A"
		as the most represented (72.6% of isolates). DISCUSSION: C parapsilosis
		"candidemia is an emerging issue in our center, possibly attributed to some extent"
		"to horizontal transmission of the pathogen, as confirmed by the analysis of"
		isolates similarities. Further microbiological and epidemiological investigations
		are needed in order to identify the most effective measures to reduce the rate of
		this infection.

AB	-	"PURPOSE: To present clinical, microbiologic, and histopathologic features of"
		keratitis due to Candida parapsilosis. METHODS: Clinicomicrobiologic evaluation
		of four patients (four eyes) with culture-proven C. parapsilosis keratitis. The
		"patients were evaluated for symptoms, visual acuity, clinical observations,"
		"microbiologic examination of corneal scrapings, and pathologic examination of"
		corneal buttons. RESULTS: Three cases were observed after penetrating
		"keratoplasty, and one case occurred after inhalation of corticosteroids. Clinical"
		presentation of C. parapsilosis keratitis showed a great diversity. There was one
		case of crystalline keratopathy and three cases of suppurative corneal
		infiltrate. Histopathology of corneal buttons showed interlamellar accumulations
		of yeast. Medical treatment included topical amphotericin B and systemic
		triazoles. Penetrating keratoplasty was required in three patients. CONCLUSION:
		Risk factors for C. parapsilosis keratitis may include corticosteroid use and
		prior corneal transplantation. The prognosis of C. parapsilosis keratitis with
		antifungal and surgical therapy may vary from good visual outcome to intraocular
		extension with phthisis bulbi.

AB	-	We isolated and identified yeasts from burn wounds and evaluated the ability of
		Candida parapsilosis isolates from burn wounds to penetrate an acellular dermal
		matrix (ADM). A prospective study was conducted with patients from the burn
		"treatment center of North Paraná University Hospital in Londrina, Brazil from"
		February 2015 to January 2016. Yeast cultures were obtained from the tissue of
		burn wounds that had been debrided and cleansed with 2% chlorhexidine. After
		"identification and confirmation of the purity of the culture, the yeasts were"
		placed on ADM fragments and incubated for three or seven days. During the study
		"period, 273 patients were treated, and 36 of these patients fulfilled the"
		inclusion criteria and provided samples for culture. Yeasts were isolated in
		"19.44% (n = 7) of the cultures, and the following species were identified: C."
		"parapsilosis (57.1%), C. albicans (28.6%), and C. glabrata (14.3%). C."
		"parapsilosis, the most frequent species, was chosen for the ADM tests. We"
		demonstrated active penetration of the ADM by the yeast isolates from burn
		"wounds. C. parapsilosis grew on ADM and penetrated the matrix, indicating that"
		"this yeast, which is common in skin and cutaneous wounds, has the potential to"
		"colonize and pass through ADM, a medical device that is frequently used to dress"
		and regenerate burn wounds.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible risk factors for
		mortality in adult patients with candidemia by investigating the causative
		"agents, underlying conditions and predisposing factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The"
		"data including causative Candida species, predisposing factors, and underlying"
		conditions of candidemia patients between the years 2015-2017 were collected and
		the impact of these factors on mortality was evaluated. Patients were divided
		into two groups as died (died patients within 30 days of the onset of candidemia)
		and survived and risk factors were evaluated for each group. RESULTS: We found
		163 adult candidemia cases during the study period. Overall 30-day mortality was
		40.5%. Candida parapsilosis was the most frequent causative agent (49.1%). C.
		parapsilosis candidemia was more common in the survived group compared with the
		"died group (n: 49 (61.3%) vs. n: 31 (38.8%), P=0.888). Mortality rates were"
		"significantly higher in patients with dialysis (n: 27 (69.2%) vs. n: 12 (30.8%),"
		"P<0.00) and concurrent bacteremia (n: 20 (57.1%) vs. n: 15 (42.9%), P=0.024)."
		Survival rates were significantly higher in patients with follow-up blood
		"cultures (n: 75 (65.8%) vs. n: 39 (34.2%), P=0.013). The most important source of"
		"candidemia was catheter (49.7%), and C. parapsilosis was the most common"
		causative agent (58%). The catheter was removed in 96.3% of these patients and
		the mortality rate was 38.5%. All of the patients received antifungal therapy and
		there was no significant difference between the effects of antifungals on
		"mortality (n: 65 (39.9%) vs. 98 (60.1%), P=0.607). CONCLUSIONS: Dialysis and"
		concurrent bacteremia are strong predictors of mortality in 30 days within
		"patients with candidemia, whereas follow-up blood cultures have a protective role"
		"with lower mortality rates. In our study, the most important source of candidemia"
		"was catheter, and C. parapsilosis was the most common causative agent. The"
		catheter was removed in almost all patients and the mortality rate was almost one
		third among these patients.

AB	-	"Systematic candidemia studies, especially in southern Iran, are scarce. In the"
		"current prospective study, we investigated candidemia in three major healthcare"
		"centers of Shiraz, the largest city in southern Iran. Yeast isolates from blood"
		and other sterile body fluids were identified by matrix-assisted laser
		desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and subjected to
		antifungal susceptibility testing (AFST) using the broth microdilution method.
		"Clinical data were retrieved from patients' medical records. In total, 113 yeast"
		"isolates were recovered from 109 patients, over 60% of whom received fluconazole."
		Antifungal drugs were prescribed without considering species identification or
		AFST. The all-cause mortality rate was 28%. Almost 30% of the patients were from
		intensive care units (ICUs). Candida albicans (56/113; 49.5%) was the most
		"prevalent species followed by C. glabrata (26/113; 23%), C. parapsilosis (13/113;"
		"11.5%), C. tropicalis (7/113; 6.2%), and C. dubliniensis (5/113; 4.4%). Only five"
		isolates showed antifungal resistance or decreased susceptibility to fluconazole:
		"one C. orthopsilosis isolate from an azole-naïve patient and two C. glabrata, one"
		"C. albicans, and one C. dubliniensis isolates from patients treated with azoles,"
		who developed therapeutic failure against azoles later. Our results revealed a
		low level of antifungal resistance but a notable rate of azole therapeutic
		"failure among patients with candidemia due to non-albicans Candida species, which"
		"threaten the efficacy of fluconazole, the most widely used antifungal in southern"
		regions of Iran. Candidemia studies should not be confined to ICUs and treatment
		should be administered based on species identification and AFST results.

		"extensively explored the epidemiology of candidemia. However, candidemia data"
		"from the other regions are notoriously scarce, which precludes from reaching a"
		"consensus regarding species distribution, the burden of antifungal resistance,"
		"and the clinical features of infected patients. Therefore, we conducted the"
		"current prospective candidemia study in Shiraz, one of the largest cities located"
		"in the south of Iran, from April 2016 to April 2018. More than 63% of the"
		candidemia infections were treated by fluconazole and species identification and
		antifungal susceptibility testing were not used for decision making regarding the
		choice of antifungal treatment. Approximately 70% of the candidemia cases
		"occurred in the wards outside of the ICUs. Candida albicans, C. glabrata, C."
		"parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, and C. dubliniensis were the five leading causative"
		agents of candidemia. Antifungal resistance was rare and fluconazole resistance
		"and/or non-wild type phenotypes were noticed in five isolates, only one was C."
		"albicans and the rest were non-albicans Candida (NAC) species, including C."
		"glabrata, C. dubliniensis, and C. orthopsilosis. Except for C. orthopsilosis,"
		"which was isolated from an azole-naïve patient, the rest of isolates were"
		recovered from patients treated with azoles and all showed therapeutic failure to
		"azoles. Collectively, our data will complete the candidemia picture in Iran and"
		"show that, although the level of resistance was rare, the therapeutic failure was"
		"notable among NAC species, which threatens the efficacy of fluconazole, the most"
		"widely used antifungal in Southern regions of Iran. Moreover, we showed that"
		candidemia is poorly managed in Iran since species identification tools along
		with antifungal susceptibility testing were not used to select appropriate
		antifungal treatment.

		factors and mortality of inpatients with invasive Candida infection in a regional
		tertiary teaching hospital in Southwest China. RESULTS: A total of 243 inpatients
		with invasive Candida infection during the five-year study period were
		"identified, with a mean annual incidence of 0.41 cases per 1000 admissions and a"
		"30-day mortality rate of 12.3%. The species distributions of Candida albicans,"
		"Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, Candida krusei, Candida parapsilosis and"
		"other Candida species was 45.3, 30.0, 15.2, 4.9, 2.1 and 2.5%, respectively. The"
		"total resistance rates of fluconazole (FCA), itraconazole (ITR) and voriconazole"
		"(VRC) were 18.6, 23.1 and 18.5%, respectively. Respiratory dysfunction, pulmonary"
		"infection, cardiovascular disease, chronic/acute renal failure, mechanical"
		"ventilation, abdominal surgery, intensive care in adults, septic shock and IC due"
		to C. albicans were associated with 30-day mortality (P < 0.05) according to the
		"univariate analyses. Respiratory dysfunction [odds ratio (OR), 9.80; 95%"
		"confidence interval (CI), 3.24-29.63; P < 0.001] and IC due to C. albicans (OR,"
		"3.35; 95% CI, 1.13-9.92; P = 0.029) were the independent predictors of 30-day"
		mortality. CONCLUSIONS: This report shows that the incidence and mortality rates
		are lower and that the resistance rates to azoles are higher in medium and small
		cities than in large cities and that the species distributions and risk factors
		in medium and small cities are different from those in large cities in China. It
		is necessary to conduct epidemiological surveillance in medium and small cities
		to provide reference data for the surveillance of inpatients with IC infections.

AB	-	Candida blood stream infection (candidemia) is severe systemic infection mainly
		develops after intensive medical cares. The mortality of candidemia is affected
		"by the underlying conditions, causative agents and the initial management. We"
		retrospectively analyzed mortality-related risk factors in cases of candidemia
		between April 2011 and March 2016 in five regional hospitals in Japan. We
		conducted bivariate and multivariate analysis of factors including causative
		"Candida species, patients' predisposing conditions, and treatment strategies,"
		such as empirically selected antifungal drug and time to appropriate antifungal
		"treatment, to elucidate their effects on 30-day mortality. The study enrolled 289"
		cases of candidemia in adults. Overall 30-day mortality was 27.7%. Forty-nine
		"cases (17.0%) were community-acquired. Bivariate analysis found advanced age,"
		"high Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, and prior antibiotics use"
		"as risk factors for high mortality; however community-acquired candidemia,"
		"C. parapsilosis candidemia, obtaining follow-up blood culture, and empiric"
		treatment with fluconazole were associated with low mortality. Logistic
		"regression revealed age ≥65 years (adjusted odds ratio, 2.13) and sequential"
		organ failure assessment (SOFA) score ≥6 (6.30) as risk factors for 30-day
		"mortality. In contrast, obtaining follow-up blood culture (0.38) and empiric"
		treatment with fluconazole (0.32) were found to be protective factors. The cases
		with candidemia in associated with advanced age and poor general health
		conditions should be closely monitored. Obtaining follow-up blood culture
		contributed to an improved prognosis.

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To investigate the incidence rates of candidemia in hospitalized
		patients and to identify differences in risk factors of patients with Candida
		albicans and non-C. albicans and with Candida guilliermondii and non-C.
		"guilliermondii candidemia. METHODS: Non-immunosuppressed, non-neutropenic"
		inpatients with candidemia diagnosed after admission were included in this
		retrospective observational study at a tertiary academic hospital in China.
		"RESULTS: During the study period (January 2009 to December 2011), 238 eligible"
		"patients had candidemia episodes with an incidence rate 5.4%. Of these patients,"
		"29.8% had candidemia due to C. albicans, 27.7% due to C. parapsilosis, and 16.4%"
		due to C. guilliermondii. Diabetes was a significant risk factor for patients
		"with candidemia due to C. albicans (35.2%, 25/71) compared to candidemia due to"
		"non-C. albicans spp (13.2%, 22/167) (odds ratio (OR) 0.2792, 95% confidence"
		interval (CI) 0.144-0.5412; p < 0.001). Compared to patients with candidemia due
		"to non-C. guilliermondii spp, preterm birth with low birth weight (OR 0.0887, 95%"
		"CI 0.0398-0.1977; p < 0.001), intravenous nutrition (OR 0.0662, 95% CI"
		"0.0226-0.1938), and surgery (OR 0.0662, 95% CI 0.0226-0.1938; p < 0.001) were"
		"significant risk factors for candidemia due to C. guilliermondii. Furthermore,"
		"compared to patients with candidemia due to C. albicans, patients with candidemia"
		due to C. guilliermondii had markedly higher rates of central venous
		"catheterization (85.9%, 61/71 vs. C. guilliermondii: 100%, 39/39; p = 0.013) and"
		"intravenous nutrition (89.7%, 35/39 vs. C. albicans: 42.2%, 30/71; p < 0.001)."
		"CONCLUSIONS: Candidemia due to C. albicans ranks first in incidence, and"
		candidemia due to C. guilliermondii occurs in a significant proportion of our
		hospitalized patients.

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: Due to the increase in isolation of Candida spp. in critically ill
		"patients, and the high mortality and economic costs which this infection entails,"
		a study was made of the risk factors associated to candidemia in critically ill
		patients from 7 intensive care units in Colombia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A
		multicenter matched case-control study was conducted in 7 intensive care units of
		3 university hospitals. Data on overall length of hospital stay (including both
		general wards and the intensive care unit) were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 243
		subjects (81 cases and 162 controls) between January 2008 and December 2012 were
		"included. In order of frequency, C. albicans, C. tropicalis and C. parapsilosis"
		were isolated. The main identified risk factors were: overall length of hospital
		"stay>25 days (OR 5.33, 95% CI 2.6-10.9), use of meropenem (OR 3.75, 95% CI"
		"1.86-7.5), abdominal surgery (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.39-6.06) and hemodialysis (OR"

		"candidemia and controls were found (39.5 vs. 36.5%, respectively, P=.66) were"
		"found. CONCLUSIONS: In Colombia, a long hospital stay, abdominal surgery, the use"
		of meropenem and hemodialysis were identified as risk factors for candidemia.

AB	-	AIM: To evaluate the diversity and antifungal susceptibilities of Candida
		"isolates from wounds and blood of burn victims, and the associated mortality"
		rates compared with those of controls without candidaemia. METHODS: We performed
		a nested case-control study within a database of clinical data for all patients
		admitted to our burn unit from January 2001 to December 2005. Each candidaemic
		patient was compared with two matched controls. Bloodstream cultures were
		"performed if the core temperature was >39 degrees C, and three sites were"
		"cultured weekly for fungal identification (burn wound, pharynx, urinary tract)."
		RESULTS: At least one episode of candidaemia was diagnosed among 20 of 851
		persons admitted during the study period. Isolates in bloodstream infection were
		"Candida albicans (65%), C. parapsilosis (25%) and C. tropicalis (10%). The median"
		time between admission and onset of candidaemia was greater with C. albicans
		infection (42.6+/-31 days) than with infection by other yeasts (18+/-12 days).
		Candidaemia was associated with more extensive burn and longer duration of
		"hospital stay but with similar mortality, compared with controls. CONCLUSION:"
		Candidaemia in burn cases is mostly due to fluconazole-susceptible C. albicans
		and is not associated with increased mortality.

PG	-	70-80
LID	-	10.5578/mb.67599 [doi]
AB	-	Invasive candidiasis is a common and serious infection in premature newborns.
		Preventing and treating fungal infections is very important to improve the
		prognosis of premature infants. Fluconazole and amphotericin B are used as the
		first choice in the treatment of invasive fungal infections of the newborns. In
		"some cases, fluconazole and amphotericin B cannot be used due to nephrotoxicity,"
		"hepatotoxicity or resistant strains. Micafungin, which is among recently"
		"developed echinocandins, is the drug of choice in these cases. The use of"
		micafungin in newborns is new and there is a limited experience about the effect
		of high dose usage in the central nervous system. The aim of this study was to
		evaluate the electronic files of patients who used micafungin for the treatment
		of culture-proven or possible invasive fungal infection during their hospital
		stay in the neonatal intensive care unit during a 24-month period (2016-2017) in
		the third-level intensive care unit. A total of 15 patients (10 premature and 5
		term babies) were included in the study. The mean birth weight of the patients
		was 1732 ± 999 g and the mean gestational age was 32.2 ± 5.8 weeks. All patients
		had long-term intensive care and increased risk of invasive candidiasis
		infection. Central venous catheterization and multiple antibiotics usage were the
		most common risk factors in these patients. The other risk factors included
		"intubation, total parenteral nutritional use and surgical procedure application."
		Candida species were isolated from the cultures of four patients. Candida species
		"isolated from patients were Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida"
		"catenulata, Candida parapsilosis. The mean time for onset of micafungin was 29.9"
		± 16.6 days. Mean duration of micafungin therapy was 22.4 ± 11.2 days. Eight
		"patients received amphotericin B, three patients received fluconazole therapy and"
		four patients did not receive any antifungal therapy before the onset of
		micafungin. None of these patients had an abnormal kidney or liver function tests
		"due to micafungin use. As a conclusion, high dose (10 mg/kg/day) micafungin is a"
		safe and effective treatment choice both in the treatment of neonatal culture
		proven or probable invasive candida infections that were caused by refractory
		"Candida strains, and in the case of nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity."

AB	-	There is limited research into Invasive fungal disease (IFD) in children with no
		underlying disease. We undertook a retrospective study of children with IFD who
		"did not suffer from another underlying disease, from June 2010 to March 2018 in"
		"Changsha, China. Nine children were identified. Eosinophil counts were elevated"
		in six cases. The level of procalcitonin (PCT) was elevated in six cases. Fungal
		"culture was positive in all patients, including eight cases of Cryptococcus"
		neoformans and one case of Candida parapsilosis. 8.33 days following antifungal
		"treatment, the body temperature of the eight patients affected by cryptococcal"
		disease had returned to normal. Our study indicates that the primary pathogen in
		IFD was Cryptococcus neoformans in children who had no other underlying disease.
		Eosinophils can be considered to be indicators of cryptococcal infection. IFD in
		children with no other underlying disease has a satisfactory prognosis.

TI	-	Epidemiology and predictive factors for early and late mortality in Candida
		bloodstream infections: a population-based surveillance in Spain.
PG	-	O245-54
LID	-	10.1111/1469-0691.12380 [doi]
AB	-	"A prospective, multicentre, population-based surveillance programme for Candida"
		bloodstream infections was implemented in five metropolitan areas of Spain to
		"determine its incidence and the prevalence of antifungal resistance, and to"
		"identify predictors of death. Between May 2010 and April 2011, Candida isolates"
		were centralized to a reference laboratory for species identification by DNA
		sequencing and for susceptibility testing by EUCAST reference procedure.
		Prognostic factors associated with early (0-7 days) and late (8-30 days) death
		were analysed using logistic regression modelling. We detected 773 episodes:
		"annual incidence of 8.1 cases/100 000 inhabitants, 0.89/1000 admissions and"
		1.36/10 000 patient-days. Highest incidence was found in infants younger than 1
		year (96.4/100 000 inhabitants). Candida albicans was the predominant species
		"(45.4%), followed by Candida parapsilosis (24.9%), Candida glabrata (13.4%) and"
		"Candida tropicalis (7.7%). Overall, 79% of Candida isolates were susceptible to"
		fluconazole. Cumulative mortality at 7 and 30 days after the first episode of
		"candidaemia was 12.8% and 30.6%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that"
		therapeutic measures within the first 48 h may improve early mortality:
		"antifungal treatment (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27-0.95) and central venous catheter"
		"removal (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.21-0.87). Predictors of late death included host"
		"factors (e.g. patients' comorbid status and signs of organ dysfunction), primary"
		"source (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.03-2.61), and severe sepsis or septic shock (OR 1.77,"
		"95% CI 1.05-3.00). In Spain, the proportion of Candida isolates non-susceptible"
		to fluconazole is higher than in previous reports. Early mortality may be
		improved with strict adherence to guidelines.

TI	-	Fungal peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis: 5-year review from a North China
		center.
PG	-	35-43
LID	-	10.1007/s15010-018-1204-7 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: Fungal peritonitis (FP) is a rare but devastating complication in
		"peritoneal dialysis (PD), accounting for high rates of technique failure,"
		morbidity and mortality. This study was conducted to investigate FPs with regard
		"to peritonitis rate, microbiology testing, patient characteristics, clinical"
		"features, antifungal treatments, and clinical outcomes in patients on PD."
		METHODS: This single-center study retrospectively reviewed all FP episodes
		"diagnosed from June 1, 2012 to June, 2017. All FPs were matched in a 1:5 ratio"
		"with PD patients diagnosed with bacterial peritonitis. Clinical, biochemical"
		characteristics and detailed data on peritonitis episodes were recorded. RESULTS:
		Eleven fungal peritonitis episodes (rate of 0.0067 episodes per patient-year on
		dialysis) were identified. All FPs were caused by Candida species (identification
		and antifungal susceptibility testing were performed with VITEK 2(®) compact
		"system), including C. albicans (6/11), C. parapsilosis (4/11) and C. krusei"
		"(1/11). Except C. krusei, no Candida resistance to fluconazole was detected."
		"Compared to bacterial peritonitis (matched cases, n = 55), FP group showed higher"
		"rate of previous antibiotic use (p = 0.002), higher total effluent cell count"
		"(p = 0.007), and lower serum albumin (p = 0.01), higher rate of infection-related"
		"surgery (p < 0.001), HD transfer (p = 0.001), and all-cause death (p = 0.006)."
		"High prevalence (≥ 50%) of female gender, anuria, CCI ≥ 4, hypoalbuminemia,"
		"anemia, and hypokalemia were also observed in FP patients. More than half of the"
		FP patients presented gastrointestinal symptoms (7/11) and extraperitoneal
		infection (6/11). Eight (72.7%) patients had catheter surgically removed with a
		"median 5.5 lag days, four (36.4%) patients died within 3 months and six (54.5%)"
		cases led to technique failure. CONCLUSIONS: FP results in high rates of catheter

AB	-	PURPOSE: To assess the risk factors and outcomes associated with fungemia caused
		by the six most commonly occurring Candida species in patients with and without
		malignancies. METHODS: Analysis of the episodes of fungemia due to common Candida
		"species in adults, based on an active hospital-based surveillance program (Paris"
		"area, France, 2002 to 2014). RESULTS: Of the 3417 patients (3666 isolates), 1164"
		(34.1%) had a solid tumor (45.7% digestive tract) and 586 (17.1%) a hematological
		"malignancy (41.8% lymphoma, 33.5% acute leukemia). The hematology patients were"
		"significantly younger, more often pre-exposed to antifungals, more often infected"
		"by C. tropicalis, C. krusei, or C. kefyr, and more often treated in the first"
		instance with an echinocandin. Compared with inpatients who were not in ICU at
		"the time of fungemia, those in ICU were less frequently infected by"
		"C. parapsilosis (p < 0.02), had more recent surgery (p < 0.03), and died more"
		frequently before day 8 and day 30 (p < 0.0001). An increase in crude mortality
		over time in ICU was observed only in oncology patients (p < 0.04). For all
		"patients, lack of prescription of antifungals despite knowledge of positive blood"
		culture increased the risk of death. The odds of being infected by a given
		"Candida species compared with C. albicans were uneven regarding age, gender, type"
		"of malignancy, hospitalization in ICU, central venous catheter, HIV status,"
		"intravenous drug addiction, and previous exposure to antifungal drugs. Compared"
		"with C. albicans, C. glabrata (OR = 0.69 [0.54-0.89]) and C. parapsilosis"
		(OR = 0.49 [0.35-0.67]) were associated with a decreased risk of death by day 8
		and day 30. CONCLUSION: The clinical context of underlying malignancy and
		hospitalization in ICU may be relevant to the initial management of candidemia.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Vaginitis, an infection of the lower genital tract in women, is known"
		to be triggered by the overgrowth of the vagina's naturally occurring
		microorganisms. OBJECTIVE: This study looked at the prevalence of Candida spp.
		and age-related disparities amongst women presenting with vaginitis at the
		"Obstetrics and Gynaecology (O&G) clinic in a tertiary hospital in Port Harcourt,"
		Nigeria. METHODS: One hundred high vaginal swabs were collected from pregnant and
		non-pregnant women and examined microscopically and microbiologically. RESULTS:
		Age-group 20-29 years had the highest incidence of candidal vaginitis. There was
		a higher occurrence of yeast cells in pregnant than in non-pregnant participants
		while the non-pregnant women had a greater level of bacterial cells. Forty (40)
		of the samples contained yeasts of Candida species representing a 40% prevalence.
		Three species of Candida were identified with C. albicans dominating. Of the 40
		"samples positive for Candida spp., 30 (75.0%) were confirmed to be C. albicans."
		The remaining isolates were C. tropicalis (15.0%) and C. parapsilosis (10.0%).
		CONCLUSION: The findings in this study would play a role in the future management
		of Candida-induced vaginitis.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Bloodstream infection by Candida species has a high mortality in
		Latin American countries. The aim of this study was to describe the
		characteristics of patients with documented bloodstream infections caused by
		Candida species in third level hospitals and determine the risk factors for
		in-hospital-mortality. METHODS: Patients from seven tertiary-care hospitals in
		"Bogotá, Colombia, with isolation of a Candida species from a blood culture were"
		"followed prospectively from March 2008 to March 2009. Epidemiologic information,"
		"risk factors, and mortality were prospectively collected. Isolates were sent to a"
		"reference center, and fluconazole susceptibility was tested by agar-based E-test."
		The results of susceptibility were compared by using 2008 and 2012 breakpoints. A
		multivariate analysis was used to determinate risk factors for mortality.
		"RESULTS: We identified 131 patients, with a median age of 41.2 years. Isolates"
		were most frequently found in the intensive care unit (ICU). Candida albicans was
		"the most prevalent species (66.4% of the isolates), followed by C. parapsilosis"
		(14%). Fluconazole resistance was found in 3.2% and 17.6% of the isolates
		"according to the 2008 and 2012 breakpoints, respectively. Fluconazole was used as"
		"empirical antifungal therapy in 68.8% of the cases, and amphotericin B in 22%."
		Hospital crude mortality rate was 35.9%. Mortality was associated with age and
		the presence of shock at the time of Candida detection. Fluconazole therapy was a
		protective factor for mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Candidemia is associated with a
		"high mortality rate. Age and shock increase mortality, while the use of"
		fluconazole was shown to be a protective factor. A higher resistance rate with
		new breakpoints was noted.

TI	-	The continuous changes in the aetiology and epidemiology of invasive candidiasis:
		from familiar Candida albicans to multiresistant Candida auris.
PG	-	107-119
LID	-	10.1007/s10123-018-0014-1 [doi]
AB	-	Recent changes in the aetiology and epidemiology of invasive candidiasis have
		"serious implications for current and future diagnosis, treatment and prognosis."
		The aim of the current review was to discuss the epidemiology of invasive
		"candidiasis, the distribution of Candida species in different regions of the"
		"world, the medical concerns of the changing aetiology and the emergence of"
		"antifungal resistance. Overall burden of invasive candidiasis remains high,"
		"especially in vulnerable persons, such as the elderly, immunosuppressed or"
		"debilitated patients. Moreover, there is a progressive shift in the aetiology of"
		"invasive candidiasis from Candida albicans to other species of Candida, probably"
		related to the increased use of azole drugs with a clear trend towards increased
		"antifungal resistance. Finally, the emergence and rise of multiresistant species,"
		"such as Candida auris or Candida glabrata, is a major threat making necessary"
		invasive candidiasis worldwide surveillances. These changes have serious
		"implications for the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of invasive candidiasis."
		Updated knowledge of the current local epidemiology of invasive candidiasis is
		critical for the clinical management.

TI	-	Factors influencing the presence of Candida dubliniensis and other non-albicans
		species in patients with oral lichen planus: a retrospective observational study.
PG	-	333-342
LID	-	10.1007/s00784-021-04004-5 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: The epidemiologic distribution of non-albicans species in the oral
		"cavity of oral lichen planus (OLP) patients remains uncertain. Therefore, the aim"
		of this study was to identify factors associated with the presence of C.
		"dubliniensis and other non-albicans species. Furthermore, independent risk"
		factors for Candida superinfection in OLP should be identified. MATERIAL AND
		METHODS: Epidemiologic data and microbiological findings from 268 symptomatic OLP
		patients who underwent continuous oral swab culture over a 5-year period
		(2015-2019) were retrospectively reviewed. Candida species identification and
		"semi-quantification were obtained by culture on CHROMagar Candida, followed by"
		matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry
		(MALDI-TOF MS). RESULTS: C. albicans was the most frequently isolated species
		"(72.3%), followed by C. glabrata (7.3%), C. dubliniensis (5.8%), C. krusei and C."
		parapsilosis (both 2.6%). The presence of C. dubliniensis was significantly
		associated with tobacco smoking. Other non-albicans spp. were significantly more
		often detected in patients using removable dentures. Increasing age and the
		intake of psychotropic drugs were identified as independent risk factors of
		"Candida superinfection in OLP. CONCLUSION: In OLP patients, certain local and"
		systemic factors increase the risk of carrying potentially drug-resistant Candida
		species and the development of Candida superinfection of OLP lesions. CLINICAL
		"RELEVANCE: Due to the frequent detection of non-albicans species in OLP,"
		resistance or at least reduced sensitivity to azole antifungals should be
		"expected, especially in smokers and patients using removable dentures. In the"
		"case of oral complaints, a superinfection with Candida should be considered,"
		whereby older patients and patients taking psychotropic drugs have an increased
		risk for oral infection with Candida.

PG	-	414-21
AB	-	"Demographic information, risk factors, therapy, and outcome for all patients who"
		"had candidemia at Barnes Hospital, St. Louis, between 1 September 1988 and 1"
		September 1989 were retrospectively reviewed. One hundred six candidemic patients
		"were identified, representing 0.5% of all medical and surgical discharges and"
		0.33% of total patient discharges. These percentages represent a 20-fold increase
		in the incidence of candidemia at our hospital in comparison with that during
		"1976-1979. Candida albicans was the most frequently isolated species (63%),"
		"followed by Candida tropicalis (17%), Candida glabrata (13%), Candida"
		"parapsilosis (6.5%), and Candida krusei (0.9%). Overall mortality was 57%, and 14"
		(23%) of 60 deaths occurred within 48 hours of the detection of candidemia.
		Mortality was associated with higher APACHE II scores (25 for nonsurvivors vs. 16
		"for survivors; P = .0001), the presence of a rapidly fatal underlying illness (P"
		"= .0009), and sustained positivity of blood cultures (P = .02). In cases of"
		"sustained candidemia, the isolation of non-albicans Candida species also"
		correlated with increased mortality (8 of 8 vs. 10 of 21; P = .005). Thirty
		"candidemic patients (28%) did not receive any antifungal therapy, and 19 (63%) of"
		these untreated patients died. Eleven untreated patients (37%) survived without
		sequelae. There has been a marked increase in the incidence of candidemia in our
		institution that is associated with a high overall mortality. Candidemia lasting
		less than 24 hours was associated with a lower mortality than was that of longer
		duration. Severity of illness and duration of candidemia should be used as
		stratifying factors in prospective studies to determine optimum therapy.

		proposal of a novel LAMP identification method for the species.
PG	-	53-62
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-014-9830-9 [doi]
AB	-	Candida parapsilosis complex (CPC) is the third Candida species isolated in blood
		"cultures of patients from our Hospital, following C. albicans and C. tropicalis."
		"From 2006 to 2010, the median annual distribution of CPC was 8 cases/year."
		Records of 36 patients were reviewed. CPC were 31 (86.1%) C. parapsilosis; 4
		(11.1%) C. orthopsilosis; and 1 (2.8%) C. metapsilosis. Clinical characteristics
		"were central venous catheter, 34 (94.4%); parental nutrition, 25 (70%); surgery,"
		"27 (57.9%); prior bacteremia, 20 (51.3%); malignancy, 18 (50%). General mortality"
		was 47.2%. Death was higher in immunosuppressed patients (17 vs. 11; p = 0.003).
		Three out four (75%) patients with C. orthopsilosis and 14 out 31 (45.2%) with C.
		parapsilosis died (p = 0.558). Thirty-nine individual isolates were tested for
		"susceptibility to seven antifungal drugs, with MICs values showing susceptibility"
		"to all of them. Two isolates, one C. orthopsilosis and one C. parapsilosis, had"
		fluconazole MIC = 4 μg/mL. Differentiation among CPC has implication in caring
		"for patients with invasive candidiasis since there are differences in virulence,"
		pathogenicity and drug susceptibility. A method targeting the topoisomerase II
		gene based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) was developed. LAMP
		emerges as a promising tool for the identification of fungal species due to the
		"high sensitivity and specificity. LAMP can be performed at the point-of-care,"
		"being no necessary the use of expensive equipment. In our study, the method was"
		successful comparing to the DNA sequencing and proved to be a reliable and fast
		assay to distinguish the three species of CPC.

TI	-	Epidemiologic and molecular characterization of an outbreak of Candida
		parapsilosis bloodstream infections in a community hospital.
PG	-	4468-72
AB	-	Candida parapsilosis is an important cause of bloodstream infections in the
		health care setting. We investigated a large C. parapsilosis outbreak occurring
		in a community hospital and conducted a case-control study to determine the risk
		factors for infection. We identified 22 cases of bloodstream infection with C.
		parapsilosis: 15 confirmed and 7 possible. The factors associated with an
		increased risk of infection included hospitalization in the intensive care unit
		"(adjusted odds ratio, 16.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.8 to 148.1) and receipt of"
		"total parenteral nutrition (adjusted odds ratio, 9.2; 95% confidence interval,"
		0.9 to 98.1). Samples for surveillance cultures were obtained from health care
		"worker hands, central venous catheter insertion sites, and medical devices."
		Twenty-six percent of the health care workers surveyed demonstrated hand
		"colonization with C. parapsilosis, and one hand isolate was highly related to all"
		case-patient isolates by tests with the DNA probe Cp3-13. Outbreak strain
		isolates also demonstrated reduced susceptibilities to fluconazole and
		voriconazole. This largest known reported outbreak of C. parapsilosis bloodstream
		"infections in adults resulted from an interplay of host, environment, and"
		pathogen factors. Recommendations for control measures focused on improving hand
		hygiene compliance.

AB	-	"To evaluate clinical features and prognostic factors of non-albicans candidemia,"
		we conducted a retrospective multicenter cohort study at 7 university hospitals
		in Korea from January 2010 to February 2016. A total of 721 patients with
		non-albicans candidemia were included in the analysis. C. tropicalis was most
		"commonly identified (36.5%), followed by C. glabrata (27.2%), C. parapsilosis"
		"(25.7%), and C. krusei (2.4%). Clinical presentation of C. tropicalis candidemia"
		was most severe with highest median C-reactive protein level (10.1 mg/dL) and
		"Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (14, both P ≪ 0.05). C."
		tropicalis showed the highest 14- and 30-day mortality (28.9% and 44.1%). In
		"multivariate analysis, C. tropicalis infection was significantly related with 14-"
		"(P = 0.005) and 30-day mortality (P = 0.033). In conclusion, C. tropicalis"
		infection presented most severely and showed worst clinical outcome among
		non-albicans candidemia.

LID	-	e59373
AB	-	BACKGROUND: The epidemiology of candidemia varies depending on the geographic
		region. Little is known about the epidemiology of candidemia in Latin America.
		METHODS: We conducted a 24-month laboratory-based survey of candidemia in 20
		centers of seven Latin American countries. Incidence rates were calculated and
		the epidemiology of candidemia was characterized. RESULTS: Among 672 episodes of
		"candidemia, 297 (44.2%) occurred in children (23.7% younger than 1 year), 36.2%"
		in adults between 19 and 60 years old and 19.6% in elderly patients. The overall
		"incidence was 1.18 cases per 1,000 admissions, and varied across countries, with"
		the highest incidence in Colombia and the lowest in Chile. Candida albicans
		"(37.6%), C. parapsilosis (26.5%) and C. tropicalis (17.6%) were the leading"
		"agents, with great variability in species distribution in the different"
		"countries. Most isolates were highly susceptible to fluconazole, voriconazole,"
		amphotericin B and anidulafungin. Fluconazole was the most frequent agent used as
		"primary treatment (65.8%), and the overall 30-day survival was 59.3%."
		CONCLUSIONS: This first large epidemiologic study of candidemia in Latin America
		"showed a high incidence of candidemia, high percentage of children, typical"
		"species distribution, with C. albicans, C. parapsilosis and C. tropicalis"
		"accounting for the majority of episodes, and low resistance rates."

		intensive care unit of a university hospital (10-year experience).
PG	-	325-333
LID	-	10.1007/s10096-020-03994-6 [doi]
AB	-	Candidemia is a nosocomial infection mostly found in critically ill patients. Our
		objectives were to evaluate the change in distribution and resistance profile of
		Candida spp. isolated from candidemic patients in our intensive care unit over
		two 5-year periods spanning 15 years and to evaluate the risk factors. Records
		"from the microbiology laboratory were obtained, from January 2004 to December"
		"2008 and from January 2013 to December 2017, retrospectively. Antifungal"
		susceptibility was performed by E-test and evaluated according to EUCAST
		breakpoints. A total of 210 candidemia cases occurred; 238 Candida spp. were
		"isolated in 197 patients (58.8% male; mean age, 59.2 ± 19.6 years). The most"
		predominant risk factor was central venous catheter use. Species distribution
		"rates were 32%, 28%, 17%, and 11% for C. albicans (n = 76), C. parapsilosis"
		"(n = 67), C. glabrata (n = 40), and C. tropicalis (n = 27), respectively."
		Resistance rate to anidulafungin was high in C. parapsilosis over both periods
		and increased to 73% in the second period. Fluconazole showed a remarkable
		decrease for susceptibility in C. parapsilosis (94 to 49%). The prevalence of MDR
		C. parapsilosis (6%/33%) and C. glabrata (0%/44%) increased in the second period.
		"We observed a predominance of non-albicans Candida spp., with C. parapsilosis"
		being the most frequent and C. glabrata infections presenting with the highest
		mortality. High level of echinocandin resistance in C. parapsilosis and
		increasing prevalences of MDR C. parapsilosis and C. glabrata seem emerging
		challenges in our institution.

AB	-	Data on the epidemiology of invasive Candida infections in paediatric patients in
		Europe are still limited. The aim of this retrospective study was to analyse the
		epidemiology of candidaemia in a tertiary paediatric hospital in Poland from 2000
		"to 2010. Using microbiological records, a total of 118 episodes of candidaemia"
		"were identified in 114 children, with an annual incidence of 0.35 episodes/1000"
		discharges. The highest incidences were found in the medical intensive care unit
		"(5.28), and in neonatal intensive care (1.47). The mortality rate was 8.5%."
		Candida albicans and C. parapsilosis were the most prevalent species (39.8% and
		35.6% respectively). The prevalence of non-albicans species increased from 12.5%
		in 2000 to 70% in 2010. No differences were found between C. albicans and C.
		"non-albicans episodes in terms of demographics, risk factors or mortality. The"
		highest resistance rates (overall 7.6%) were observed for fluconazole (4.3% in C.
		"albicans, 7.1% in C. parapsilosis and 13.8% in other Candida species). Resistance"
		to amphotericin B (2.5%) was limited to non-albicans isolates. The dynamic
		changes in species distribution and increasing resistance of fungal pathogens
		confirm the importance of epidemiological surveillance.

TI	-	Neonatal Candidemia Caused by Candida haemulonii: Case Report and Review of
		Literature.
PG	-	69-73
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-015-9872-7 [doi]
AB	-	Candidemia is a frequent condition in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU) and
		usually complicates the newborns clinical course. Several factors are responsible
		"for candidiasis, such as prematurity and use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and"
		"in these cases, there are the involvement of various Candida species, as C."
		"albicans, and C. parapsilosis. However, other species as C. haemulonii has been"
		"rarely described in candidemia cases, being considered an emergent pathogen."
		"Thus, we report a case of neonatal candidemia by C. haemulonii and a review of"
		literature of fungemia by this yeast. The patient was a neonate with gestational
		age of 26 weeks and birth weight of 660 g hospitalized in a NICU from a Brazilian
		hospital. The identification of the etiological agent was performed by phenotypic
		"methods, scanning electron microscopy, sequencing of the ITS region of rDNA, and"
		mass spectrometry. Antifungal susceptibility testing was carried out according to
		the Clinical Laboratories and Standards Institute guidelines. The newborn was
		diagnosed with candidemia by C. haemulonii resistant to amphotericin B with
		"minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 8 µg/mL, sensitive to fluconazole (MIC:"
		8 µg/mL) and voriconazole (MIC: 0.12 µg/mL). The treatment with fluconazole (12
		mg/kg/day) was established with good outcome. Candidemia by C. haemulonii is
		still being limited to a few sporadic cases in adults with endemic and restricted
		"occurrences in neonates. Usually, the therapy with amphotericin B is ineffective"
		against this species. Our results showed the importance of the mycological
		diagnosis associated to antifungigrama for the successful clinical management
		followed by important epidemiological data.

AB	-	The surveillance and analysis of candidemia risk factors are necessary to reduce
		treatment failures in cancer patients. By understanding the geographic
		distribution of Candida spp. and their in vitro minimal antifungal inhibitory
		"concentrations in cancer patients, optimal treatment protocols may be developed."
		On reviewing the candidemia data of cancer patients in Tianjin Medical University
		"Cancer Institute and Hospital (TMUCIH), we found that the incidence rate was"
		"0.34-0.53 cases per 1,000 admissions from 2008-2010, and the crude mortality was"
		"31.7% during 2006-2010. Candida albicans was the most common species (48.8%),"
		"followed by C. parapsilosis (24.4%), C. glabrata (9.8%), C. tropicalis (9.8%), C."
		"lusitaniae (4.9%), and C. famata (2.3%). All species were susceptible to azoles"
		and showed low MICs to amphotericin B. Surgery was an independent risk factor in
		"candidemia caused by C. albicans. Furthermore, among all cancer patients, those"
		with digestive system neoplasms were most likely to develop candidemia. In
		"addition, cancer patients with metastasis to distant organs were significantly"
		more prone to non-C. albicans Candida infection. This study provided data on the
		epidemiology of candidemia in cancer patients in North China which may be of
		value in such individuals with yeast infections.

PG	-	471-7
LID	-	10.1093/mmy/myv114 [doi]
AB	-	Bloodstream infections caused by Candida species are of increasing importance and
		associated with significant mortality. We performed a multi-centre prospective
		observational study to identify the species and antifungal susceptibilities of
		invasive bloodstream isolates of Candida species in the Asia-Pacific region. The
		"study was carried out over a two year period, involving 13 centers from Brunei,"
		"Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam."
		"Identification of Candida species was performed at each study center, and"
		reconfirmed at a central laboratory. Susceptibility testing was performed using a
		"commercial broth dilution panel (Sensititre YeastOne YST-010, Thermofisher,"
		"United Kingdom) with susceptibility categorisation (S = susceptible, S-DD ="
		susceptible dose-dependent) applied using breakpoints from the Clinical
		Laboratory Standards Institute. Eight hundred and sixty-one Candida isolates were
		"included in the study. The most common species were C. albicans (35.9%),"
		"C. tropicalis (30.7%), C. parapsilosis (15.7%), and C. glabrata (13.6%)."
		Non-albicans species exceeded C. albicans species in centers from all countries
		except Taiwan. Fluconazole susceptibility was almost universal for C. albicans
		"(S = 99.7%) but lower for C. tropicalis (S = 75.8%, S-DD = 6.1%), C. glabrata"
		"(S-DD = 94.9%), and C. parapsilosis (S = 94.8%). Echinocandins demonstrated high"
		"rates of in vitro susceptibility (S>99%) against C. albicans, C. tropicalis, and"
		C. parapsilosis This study demonstrates that non-albicans species are the most
		common isolates from bloodstream infections in most countries in the Asia-Pacific
		"region, with C. tropicalis as the predominant species. Because of the prevalence"
		"of reduced susceptibility to fluconazole in non-albicans species, the study"
		indicates that echinocandins should be the antifungal of choice in clinically
		unstable or high-risk patients with documented candidemia.

		for the development of Oral Candidiasis. The aim of this study was to identify
		"Candida species isolated from the oral cavity of HIV/AIDS patients, to determine"
		their in vitro antifungal susceptibility and to investigate the possible risk
		factors associated with oral candidiasis. METHODS: This was a hospital based
		cross sectional study that was carried out for a period of 3 months amongst
		"HIV/AIDS patients in Kumba District Hospital, whether on HAART or not. Mouth"
		swabs were collected from 378 participants using sterile cotton wool swabs and
		5ml venous blood were collected for determination of CD4 cell. Candida species
		were isolated and identified. Antifungal sensitivity testing was performed using
		modified kirby-bauer susceptibility testing technique. RESULTS: Candida species
		were present in 42.86% of the samples and Candida albicans was the most prevalent
		"(60.2%) amongst the six Candida isolates identified, followed by Candida glabrata"
		"(16.9%), Candida krusei (12.3%), Candida tropicalis (6.4%), Candida parapsilosis"
		"(2.3%) and Candida pseudotropicalis (1.8%). Pregnancy, oral hygiene and"
		antibiotic usage were significantly associated with oral candidiasis in HIV/AIDS
		patients (P<0.05). Oral candidiasis was mostly frequent in HIV/AIDS patients
		between 21-40 years. A CD4 cell count less than 200 cells/μl was a significant
		risk factor for acquiring oral candidiasis in HIV/AIDS patients (P<0.001).
		Nystatin was the most sensitive drug (83.6%) meanwhile ketonazole was the most
		"resistant drug (29.2%), followed by fluconazole (24.6%) to all oral Candida"
		isolates. CONCLUSION: Oral Candida colonization occurs more frequently in
		HIV/AIDS patients and the is a need for the government to implement regular
		"checks for opportunistic infections in HIV/AIDS patients, including oral"
		candidiasis in HIV/AIDS patients to monitor disease progression and prevent
		subsequent complications such as candidemia and diarrhea.

AB	-	PURPOSE: This study examined the prevalence of Candida species in the saliva of
		oral squamous cell carcinoma patients and its effect on the mortality rate.
		MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred patients with oral cavity squamous cell
		carcinoma undergoing protocol treatment at Helsinki University Hospital were
		"recruited into the study from March 2011 through 2014. For comparison, 75"
		age-matched controls with no current or previously treated oral cancer were
		recruited. Paraffin-stimulated whole saliva samples were collected and cultivated
		"on CHROMagar Candida medium (CHROMagar, Paris, France) to establish possible"
		"Candida growth. The API ID 32C yeast identification kit (bioMérieux, Lyon,"
		"France) and Bichro-Dubli Fumouze latex agglutination test (Fumouze Diagnostics,"
		"Levallois-Perret, France) were used for further identification of different"
		Candida species. Patients' medical records were studied for information on their
		"health habits and general health status, as well as tumor-related data. The"
		patients' status regarding being alive and cancer free was checked at a follow-up
		point in December 2017. Descriptive statistics and cross tabulation were carried
		"out, and the P value was set at .05. RESULTS: Candida species were detected in"
		"74% of the oral cancer patients' samples, with C. albicans being the most common"
		"species (84%). Other species identified were C. dubliniensis (8%), C. tropicalis"
		"(4%), C. glabrata (3%), C. parapsilosis (3%), C. sake (3%), C. krusei (1%), and"
		"C. guilliermondii (1%). After the follow-up period, 63% of the patients were"
		alive and 86% of them were cancer free. Harboring Candida species in the saliva
		was not associated with any increase in the mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS: C.
		albicans was common in the oral cavity of the oral squamous cell carcinoma
		"patients. However, in this patient population, we did not observe a statistically"
		significant effect of the yeast on the mortality rate.

PG	-	2188-95
LID	-	10.1007/s00134-013-3057-y [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: To record the practices for prevention and management of invasive
		candidiasis in the PICU and investigate the epidemiology of candidiasis and its
		outcome nationwide. METHODS: A multicenter national study among PICUs throughout
		Greece. A questionnaire referring to local practices of prevention and management
		"of candidemia was filled in, and a retrospective study of episodes that occurred"
		during 5 years was conducted in all seven Greek PICUs. RESULTS: Clinical
		"practices regarding surveillance cultures, catheter replacement protocols and"
		"antibiotic use were similar, although the case mix differed. In all PICUs"
		prophylactic antifungal treatment was administered in transplant and neutropenic
		oncology patients. Discrepancy existed between PICUs concerning the first-line
		antifungal agents and treatment duration of candidemia. Twenty-two candidemias
		were nationally recorded between 2005 and 2009 with a median incidence of 6.4
		"cases/1,000 admissions. Median age was 8.2 (0.3-16.6) years. Candida albicans was"
		isolated in 45.4 % of episodes followed by Candida parapsilosis (22.7 %). Common
		findings were presence of central venous and urinary catheters as well as
		mechanical ventilation and administration of antibiotics with anti-anaerobic
		activity in almost all patients with candidemia. Total parenteral nutrition was
		administered to five (22.7 %) patients. Most of the patients had a chronic
		"underlying disease; five were oncology patients, and two-thirds of those with"
		candidemia were colonized with Candida spp. Lipid amphotericin B formulations
		were the predominant therapeutic choice (54.5 %). Thirty-day mortality was 18.2
		%. CONCLUSION: This first national study adds information to the epidemiology of
		"candidemia in critically ill children. In these special patients, candidemia has"
		a relatively low incidence and tends toward non-albicans Candida preponderance.

PG	-	576-81
LID	-	10.1111/myc.12077 [doi]
AB	-	Significant changes in the frequency of candidaemia and the distribution of
		causative species have been noted worldwide in the last two decades. In this
		"study, we present the results of the first multicentre survey of fungaemia in"
		Polish hospitals. A total of 302 candidaemia episodes in 294 patients were
		identified in 20 hospitals during a 2-year period. The highest number of
		"infections was found in intensive care (30.8%) and surgical (29.5%) units,"
		"followed by haematological (15.9%), 'others' (19.2%) and neonatological (4.6%)"
		units. Candida albicans was isolated from 50.96% of episodes; its prevalence was
		"higher in intensive care unit and neonatology (61.22% and 73.33%, respectively),"
		and significantly lower in haematology (22%; P < 0.001). The frequency of C.
		krusei and C. tropicalis was significantly higher (24% and 18%) in haematology
		"(P < 0.02); whereas, the distribution of C. glabrata (14.1%) and C. parapsilosis"
		(13.1%) did not possess statistically significant differences between compared
		departments. Obtained data indicates that species distribution of Candida blood
		"isolates in Polish hospitals reflects worldwide trends, particularly a decrease"
		in the prevalence of infections due to C. albicans.

		infections: case-control population-based surveillance study of patients in
		"Barcelona, Spain, from 2002 to 2003."
PG	-	1681-5
AB	-	Candida parapsilosis has emerged as an important yeast species causing fungemia.
		We describe the incidence and epidemiology of C. parapsilosis fungemia. Data from
		"active population-based surveillance in Barcelona, Spain, from January 2002 to"
		December 2003 were analyzed. We focused on 78 episodes of C. parapsilosis
		"fungemia, and we compared them with 175 Candida albicans controls. C."
		parapsilosis accounted for 23% of all fungemias. The annual incidences were 1
		"episode per 10(5) patients, 1.2 episodes per 10(4) discharges, and 1.7 episodes"
		per 10(5) patient days. All isolates but one (99%) were fluconazole susceptible.
		Seventy-two isolates (92%) were inpatient candidemias. Forty-two episodes (51%)
		"were considered catheter-related fungemia, 35 (45%) were considered primary"
		"fungemia, and 3 (4%) were considered secondary fungemia. Risk factors for"
		"candidemia were vascular catheterization (97%), prior antibiotic therapy (91%),"
		"parenteral nutrition (54%), prior surgery (46%), prior immunosuppressive therapy"
		"(38%), malignancy (27%), prior antifungal infection (26%), transplant recipient"
		"(16%), neutropenia (12%), and prior colonization (11%). Multivariate analysis of"
		the differential characteristics showed that the factors that independently
		predicted the presence of C. parapsilosis fungemia were neonate patients (odds
		"ratio [OR], 7.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.1 to 26.8; P = 0.002),"
		"transplant recipients (OR, 9.2; 95% CI, 1.9 to 43.3; P = 0.005), patients with a"
		"history of prior antifungal therapy (OR, 5.4; 95% CI, 1.8 to 15.9; P = 0.002),"
		"and patients who received parenteral nutrition (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.09 to 4.6; P ="
		0.028). The overall mortality rate was lower than that associated with C.
		"albicans candidemia (23% versus 43%; P < 0.01). In summary, C. parapsilosis was"
		"responsible for 23% of all candidemias and was more frequent in neonates, in"
		"transplant recipients, and in patients who received parenteral nutrition or"
		"previous antifungal therapy, mainly fluconazole. The mortality rate was lower"
		than that associated with C. albicans fungemia.

LID	-	10.1111/ggi.12329 [doi]
AB	-	AIM: The present retrospective study was carried out to investigate the
		epidemiological characteristics and the prognostic factors of candidemia among
		"elderly patients. METHODS: From 2009 to 2012, elderly patients with candidemia"
		"were identified at the Chi Mei medical center, a 900-bed regional hospital in"
		"southern Taiwan, and their medical records retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS:"
		"During the 4-year period, a total of 175 episodes of candidemia among elderly"
		patients were identified. The patients ranged in age from 65 to 98 years (mean
		76.4 years) and the mean (±standard deviation) Charlson Comorbidity Index score
		"was 7.6 (±2.7). Cancer was the most common underlying disease (n = 127, 72.6%),"
		"followed by diabetes mellitus (n = 69, 39.4%). Candida albicans (n = 96, 54.9%)"
		"was the most common pathogen, followed by C. tropicalis (n = 39, 22.3%),"
		"C. parapsilosis (n = 24, 13.7%), C. glabrata (n = 22, 12.6%), C. guilliermondii"
		"(n = 2, 1.1%) and Candida species (n = 3, 1.7%). The ratio of C. albicans causing"
		candidemia was significantly higher in young-old than old-old patients (64.1% vs
		"47.4%, P = 0.027). The overall in-hospital mortality was 50.3%. Multivariate"
		analysis showed that the in-hospital mortality was only significantly associated
		"with jaundice (P = 0.004), no use of antifungal agent (P = 0.021) and intensive"
		care unit admission (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Candidemia can develop in elderly
		"patients, especially patients with cancer or other risk factors. C. albicans is"
		"the most common Candida species causing candidemia among elderly patients,"
		followed by C. tropicalis. The mortality of candidemia among elderly patients
		remains high.

AB	-	Candida blood steam infection is a life-threatening disease that seems to be
		under estimated. Understanding epidemiology of such disease is crucial for
		"improved diagnosis, optimized treatment, and better outcome. Through this"
		"retrospective study, we aimed to determine the incidence of candidemia in a"
		"secondary care hospital, and to describe the epidemiology and outcome of"
		candidemia among adult patients. The incidence of candidemia for all age groups
		"was 0.24, 0.16 and 0.15 cases/1000 patient-days in 2014, 2015 and 2016"
		"respectively. Among adult patients, 82 cases were identified. The patients had"
		"the following clinical characteristics with varying proportions: old age,"
		"diabetes, antibiotic exposure, use of vascular catheter, abdominal surgery, ICU"
		"hospitalization, haemodialysis, and total parenteral nutrition. All-cause 30-day"
		mortality was 54% and ICU hospitalization was a recognized risk factor for death.
		"The leading causative agents were Candida albicans (32%), and Candida"
		"parapsilosis (32%), followed by Candida tropicalis (20%), Candida glabrata (13%)"
		"and one each by Candida dubliniensis, Candida famata, and Candida auris. Almost"
		all tested isolates were susceptible to caspofungin and amphotericin B. With
		"regard to fluconazole, C. glabrata showed variable susceptibility. Other species"
		"were susceptible except one isolate, each of C. parapsilosis and C. auris. The"
		study highlights the growing importance of non-C. albicans Candida species in the
		etiology of candidemia. Emergence of C. auris is a warning sign and needs to be
		closely monitored.

		"infection: results from population-based surveillance, barcelona, Spain, from"
		2002 to 2003.
PG	-	1829-35
AB	-	We conducted population-based surveillance for Candida bloodstream infections in
		"Spain to determine its incidence, the extent of antifungal resistance, and risk"
		factors for mortality. A case was defined as the first positive blood culture for
		"any Candida spp. in a resident of Barcelona, from 1 January 2002 to 31 December"
		2003. We defined early mortality as occurring between days 3 to 7 after
		candidemia and late mortality as occurring between days 8 to 30. We detected 345
		"cases of candidemia, for an average annual incidence of 4.3 cases/100,000"
		"population, 0.53 cases/1,000 hospital discharges, and 0.73 cases/10,000"
		"patient-days. Outpatients comprised 11% of the cases, and 89% had a central"
		venous catheter (CVC) at diagnosis. Overall mortality was 44%. Candida albicans
		"was the most frequent species (51% of cases), followed by Candida parapsilosis"
		"(23%), Candida tropicalis (10%), Candida glabrata (8%), Candida krusei (4%), and"
		other species (3%). Twenty-four isolates (7%) had decreased susceptibility to
		"fluconazole (MIC > or = 16 microg/ml). On multivariable analysis, early death was"
		"independently associated with hematological malignancy (odds ratio [OR], 3.5; 95%"
		"confidence interval [CI], 1.1 to 10.4). Treatment with antifungals (OR, 0.05; 95%"
		"CI, 0.01 to 0.2) and removal of CVCs (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1 to 0.9) were"
		"protective factors for early death. Receiving adequate treatment, defined as"
		"having CVCs removed and administration of an antifungal medication (OR, 0.2; 95%"
		"CI, 0.08 to 0.8), was associated with lower odds of late mortality; intubation"
		"(OR, 7.5; 95% CI, 2.6 to 21.1) was associated with higher odds. The incidence of"
		candidemia and prevalence of fluconazole resistance are similar to other European
		"countries, indicating that routine antifungal susceptibility testing is not"
		warranted. Antifungal medication and catheter removal are critical in preventing
		mortality.

AB	-	AIM: The study of candidemia in cancer patients has been limited. This
		retrospective study aims to investigate the epidemiologic characteristics and
		prognostic factors of candidemia among cancer patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
		"From 2009 to 2012, cancer patients with candidemia were identified at a hospital"
		in Taiwan. The medical records of all patients with bloodstream infections due to
		Candida species were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: During the four-year
		"period, a total of 242 episodes of candidemia were identified among cancer"
		"patients. Half of these patients were classified as elderly (≥65 years old), and"
		more than 95% of the candidemia episodes were classified as healthcare-associated
		"infections. Among the 242 cancer patients with candidemia, head and neck cancer"
		"was the most common, followed by gastrointestinal tract and lung cancer."
		"Additionally, most of the patients had variable underlying conditions, such as"
		the presence of CVC (99%) or prior exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics (93%)
		"and were receiving an immunosuppressant (86%). Overall, C. albicans (n = 132,"
		"54.5%) was the most common pathogen, followed by C. tropicalis (n = 52, 21.5%),"
		"C. parapsilosis (n = 38, 15.7%), and C. glabrata (n = 29, 12.0%). Seventeen"
		"patients had polycandidal candidemia, and 77 patients had concomitant bacteremia."
		Approximately one-third of the patients required admission to the intensive care
		"unit (ICU) or mechanical ventilation, and the overall in-hospital mortality was"
		50.8%. Multivariable analysis showed that the in-hospital mortality was
		significantly associated with only the non-use of antifungal agents and acute
		respiratory failure (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Candidemia can develop in patients
		"with both solid cancer and hematological malignancy, especially for patients with"
		"underlying conditions. Overall, the associated morbidity and mortality due to"
		Candidemia remain high. It was also determined that the non-use of antifungal
		agents and acute respiratory failure conditions were associated with in-hospital
		mortality.

AB	-	Surveillance of candidemia is essential to monitor trends in species distribution
		"and change in the incidence and antifungal resistance. In this study, we aimed to"
		"investigate prevalence, resistance rates, antifungal utilization and costs. A"
		6-year retrospective analysis of the data belonging to patients with candidemia
		hospitalized between 2010 and 2016 was performed. The annual usage of fluconazole
		and caspofungin and the usage of these antifungals in different units were
		"described in defined daily doses (DDD) per 1000 patient days. In total, 351"
		patients of candidemia were included. Median age of the patients was 45 (0-88)
		"and 55.1% of them were male. Overall, 48.1% of the candidemia episodes (169/351)"
		"were due to C. albicans, followed by C. parapsilosis (25.1%), C. glabrata"
		(11.7%). Length of hospital stay was longer with a median of 20 days among
		patients with non-albicans candidemia. Presence of a central venous catheter was
		found to be an associated risk for candidemia caused by non-albicans strains.
		Annual incidence of candidemia increased from 0.10 to 0.30 cases/1000 patient
		days. Antifungal use was increased over years correlated with the cost paid for
		it. The policy against candidemia should be specified by each institution with
		"respect to candidemia prevalence, resistance rates, antifungal use and costs."

		"microbiology, outcomes, and risk factors for mortality of candidemia in adult"
		surgical patients in Shenyang from 2012 to 2018. METHODS: We designed a
		retrospective observational study of adult patients with candidemia in a teaching
		hospital including three hospital campuses. Data regarding clinical and
		demographic characteristics were collected from the patient's medical records.
		"RESULTS: Of the 236 cases of candidemia, 172 (72.9%) were identified in surgical"
		"patients, including 146 (84.9%) general surgeries, 11 (6.4%) urologic surgeries,"
		"6 (3.5%) thoracic surgeries, and others. Higher proportions of solid tumors,"
		"total parenteral nutrition, the presence of a urinary catheter, and the presence"
		of a gastric tube were observed in surgical patients with candidemia versus
		"non-surgical ones, whereas the percentages of hematological malignancy, diabetes"
		"mellitus, and renal replacement therapy were relatively lower in surgical"
		"patients. Renal failure, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia were less common"
		laboratory findings in surgical patients with candidemia than compared to
		"non-surgical ones. Among surgical patients with candidemia, Candida parapsilosis"
		"was the predominant species (43%), followed by C. albicans (33.7%), C. glabrata"
		"(11%), C. tropicalis (8.1%), and others (4.1%). Overall susceptibility,"
		"susceptible dose dependent or intermediate susceptibility, and resistance to"
		"fluconazole were detected in 73.3, 19.8, and 3.5% Candida isolates from surgical"
		"patients, respectively, but no resistance to amphotericin B was observed."
		"Overall, the 30-day mortality in surgical patients was 19.2%. At multivariable"
		"analysis, independent risk factors for death in surgical patients with candidemia"
		"were ICU stay, thrombocytopenia, and C. albicans infection. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical"
		patients account for the majority of candidemia cases. Among patients with recent
		"surgery, risk factors for species distribution, antifungal sensitivity patterns"
		"of Candida isolates causing candidemia, and independent risk factors for"
		mortality should be evaluated and considered for a better outcome in the
		antifungal treatment.

PG	-	997-1003
LID	-	10.3855/jidc.6550 [doi]
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Infection with and antifungal resistance of Candida species have
		been on the rise globally. Relevant data on these pathogens are relatively few in
		"our region, including Lebanon, thus warranting this study. METHODOLOGY: This"
		retrospective study of Candida spp. profiles and their in vitro antifungal
		susceptibility was based on analysis requests for 186 Candida non-albicans and 61
		"C. albicans during three periods (2005-2007, 2009-2011, and 2012-2014) over the"
		span of the last 10 years at the American University of Beirut Medical Center
		"(AUBMC), a major tertiary care center in Lebanon. Identification of Candida was"
		"done using the API 20C AUX system, and the E-test was used to determine the"
		minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of antifungal agents. RESULTS: Among the
		"1,300-1,500 Candida isolates recovered yearly, C. albicans rates decreased from"
		"86% in 2005 to around 60% in 2014. Simultaneously, the non-albicans rates"
		"increased from 14% in 2005 to around 40% in 2014, revealing 11 species, the most"
		"frequent of which were C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, and C. parapsilosis. All these"
		"demonstrated high resistance (35%-79%) against itraconazole, but remained"
		uniformly susceptible (100%) to amphotericin B. Though C. albicans and the other
		"species maintained high susceptibility against fluconazole and voriconazole,"
		"their MIC90 showed an elevated trend over time, and C. glabrata had the highest"
		resistance rates. CONCLUSIONS: The observed rise in resistance among Candida spp.
		in Lebanon mandates the need for close surveillance and monitoring of antifungal
		drug resistance for both epidemiologic and treatment purposes.

PG	-	1328-35
LID	-	10.1017/S0950268809991531 [doi]
AB	-	The incidence of nosocomial candidaemia was evaluated in a retrospective study in
		"a Turkish tertiary-care hospital. Over a 12-year period (1996-2007), a total of"
		"743 episodes of candidaemia occurred in 743 patients, accounting for an average"
		incidence of 1.9 episodes/1000 admissions and 2.9 episodes/10 000 patient-days
		per year. The annual incidence was almost constant during the study period except
		for 1996 when it was significantly higher in comparison with other years
		"(P<0.05). The most common species isolated was Candida albicans (45%), followed"
		"by C. parapsilosis (26%), C. tropicalis (7%), C. krusei (7%), and C. glabrata"
		(3.5%). A significant increase in C. albicans isolates causing candidaemia linked
		to a decrease in C. parapsilosis isolates in adult patients and C. krusei
		isolates in children was found between the two 6-year study periods. This trend
		reflects improved infection control at Uludağ University Hospital. Ninety percent
		of isolates were susceptible to fluconazole (8 microg/ml) and resistance was
		found only in C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis isolates. Regular local
		surveillance of Candida spp. is important in order to develop empirical treatment
		protocols to reduce the incidence and mortality of candidaemia.

AB	-	Candidemia has been considered a persistent public health problem with great
		impact on hospital costs and high mortality. We aimed to evaluate the
		epidemiology and prognostic factors of candidemia in a tertiary hospital in
		Northeast Brazil from January 2011 to December 2016. Demographic and clinical
		data of patients were retrospectively obtained from medical records and
		antifungal susceptibility profiling was performed using the broth microdilution
		method. A total of 68 episodes of candidemia were evaluated. We found an average
		incidence of 2.23 episodes /1000 admissions and a 30-day mortality rate of 55.9%.
		"The most prevalent species were Candida albicans (35.3%), Candida tropicalis"
		"(27.4%), Candida parapsilosis (21.6%) and Candida glabrata (11.8%). Higher"
		mortality rates were observed in cases of candidemia due to C. albicans (61.1%)
		"and C. glabrata (100%), especially when compared to C. parapsilosis (27.3%)."
		Univariate analysis revealed some variables which significantly increased the
		"probability of death: older age (P = 0.022; odds ratio [OR] = 1.041), severe"
		"sepsis (P < 0.001; OR = 8.571), septic shock (P = 0.035; OR = 3.792), hypotension"
		"(P = 0.003; OR = 9.120), neutrophilia (P = 0.046; OR = 3.080), thrombocytopenia"
		"(P = 0.002; OR = 6.800), mechanical ventilation (P = 0.009; OR = 8.167) and"
		greater number of surgeries (P = 0.037; OR = 1.920). Multivariate analysis showed
		"that older age (P = 0.040; OR = 1.055), severe sepsis (P = 0.009; OR = 9.872) and"
		hypotension (P = 0.031; OR = 21.042) were independently associated with worse
		"prognosis. There was no resistance to amphotericin B, micafungin or itraconazole"
		"and a low rate of resistance to fluconazole (5.1%). However, 20.5% of the Candida"
		isolates were susceptible dose-dependent (SDD) to fluconazole and 7.7% to
		"itraconazole. In conclusion, our results could assist in the adoption of"
		strategies to stratify patients at higher risk for developing candidemia and
		"worse prognosis, in addition to improve antifungal management."

		"period, but the proportion due to NAC did not change significantly in that of 141"
		"cases, 55 (39%) were due to NAC and 86 (61%) to C. albicans (CA). The NAC species"
		"isolated included C. tropicalis (25 of 141, 18%), C. glabrata (14 of 141, 9.9%),"
		"C. parapsilosis (eight of 141, 5.7%), C. krusei (three of 141, 2.1%) and C."
		"lusitaniae (one of 141, 0.71%); other Candida species accounted for four of the"
		141 cases (2.8%). Twenty-one isolates (38%) of NAC were not susceptible to
		fluconazole. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) (OR 4.2; 95% CI 3.5-58; P < 0.001)
		and previous fluconazole therapy (OR 7.7; 95% CI 2.2-27; P = 0.001) were risk
		"factors for invasive NAC candidiasis, whereas patient age ≥65 years (OR 0.37; CI"
		0.16-0.88; P = 0.025) and invasive mechanical ventilation (OR 0.22; CI
		0.069-0.70; P =0.010) were connected with invasive CA candidiasis. Prior
		fluconazole therapy was a risk factor (P = 0.007) for infections caused by NAC
		"not susceptible to fluconazole. In conclusion, TPN and prior fluconazole therapy"
		"are independent risk factors for NAC infection, while prior fluconazole therapy"
		is a risk factor for infection due to NAC not susceptible to fluconazole.

AB	-	"INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to examine the incidence, epidemiology, and"
		clinical characteristics of symptomatic and asymptomatic candidiasis in a
		"pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), and to determine the risk factors"
		associated with symptomatic candidiasis. METHODS: This retrospective study
		included 67 patients from a 7-bed PICU in a tertiary care hospital that had
		Candida-positive cultures between April 2007 and July 2009. Demographic and
		"clinical characteristics of the patients, Candida isolates, antimicrobial and"
		"antifungal treatments, and previously identified risk factors for symptomatic"
		"candidiasis were recorded, and symptomatic and asymptomatic patients were"
		"compared. RESULTS: In all, 36 (53.7%) of the patients with Candida-positive"
		cultures had asymptomatic candidiasis and 31 (46.3%) had symptomatic candidiasis.
		Candida albicans was the most common Candida sp. in the asymptomatic patients (n
		"= 20, 55.6%), versus Candida parapsilosis in the symptomatic patients (n = 15,"
		"48.4%). The incidence of central venous catheter indwelling, blood transfusion,"
		"parenteral nutrition, and surgery was higher in the symptomatic patient group"
		than in the asymptomatic patient group (P < 0.5). Surgery was the only
		independent predictor of symptomatic candidiasis according to forward stepwise
		multivariate logistic regression analysis (OR: 6.1; 95% CI: 1.798-20.692).
		CONCLUSION: Surgery was the only risk factor significantly associated with
		symptomatic candidiasis and non-albicans Candida species were more common among
		the patients with symptomatic candidiasis. While treating symptomatic candidiasis
		in any PICU an increase in the incidence of non-albicans candidiasis should be
		considered.

TI	-	Epidemiology of bloodstream Candida species in a Spanish tertiary care hospital
		as a guide for implementation of T2MR (T2CANDIDA®) for rapid diagnosis of
		candidemia.
PG	-	350-354
LID	-	10.1093/mmy/myaa056 [doi]
AB	-	The aim of this work was to study the epidemiology of candidemia in our hospital
		in order to determine whether the T2MR system might be a useful tool for early
		diagnosis of candidemia in selected units. We perform a retrospective review of
		all candidemia episodes registered in the last 12 years in selected units of our
		hospital in adult and pediatric patients. Candida species and antifungal
		"susceptibility patterns were registered. A total of 686 isolates were registered,"
		of which 625 were infections due to the five most common species of Candida. C.
		albicans (45.6%) and C. parapsilosis (33.1%) were the predominant species found
		in our institution. In adults these species were closely followed by C. glabrata
		(12-21%) in all units. While in pediatric medical and intensive care units
		"(PICU), these species were followed by other uncommon yeasts. Resistance rates to"
		triazoles were low in C. albicans and C. parapsilosis. In C. glabrata and C.
		tropicalis the resistance rates to fluconazole ranged from 10.86 to 6.67%.
		Resistance rates for echinocandins were very low and all strains were susceptible
		to amphotericin B. T2Candida® might be useful to guide antifungal targeted
		treatment and discontinuation of antifungal empirical treatment in those units
		where the five most common Candida species represent more than the ninety percent
		of the isolates. The selection of medical and surgical units should be based on
		local epidemiology and antifungal susceptibility patterns. Incidence should be
		taken into account in order to make clinical decisions based on negative results.
		LAY ABSTRACT: T2Candida® might be useful selectively in clinical units according
		"to their local epidemiology, antifungal resistance patterns, and incidence of"
		candidemia. It optimizes the clinical value of positive results supporting
		decisions about targeted therapies or discontinuations based on negative results.

AB	-	Keratitis due to Candida parapsilosis or Corynebacterium macginleyi is uncommon.
		We present a patient with several risk factors who suffered two subsequent
		corneal infections caused by these pathogens and healed with topical conservative
		therapy. The important factor was the early detection of infection. Fluconazole
		solution administered topically as eye drops combined with regular debridement
		proved in this case a successful alternative to systemic antifungal treatment.
		"With a perceived recurrence of the keratitis, one must take into account the"
		involvement of other pathogens present. The previous use of an antifungal
		solution other than a conventional eye drop could be an additional risk factor
		"for a second bacterial infection, but the benefits should still rule in favor of"
		such a treatment.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: There are few recent studies evaluating trends in the epidemiology of
		candidemia including changes in species or utilization of antifungal agents in
		children. METHODS: We performed a retrospective case series of candidemia at our
		children's hospital from 2002 to 2006. Our objectives were to study trends in the
		"rates of candidemia, demographic characteristics, Candida species, antifungal"
		"susceptibility, and antifungal utilization. These data were obtained from the"
		electronic medical records. RESULTS: There were 203 episodes of candidemia in 154
		"subjects. During the study period, the average rate of candidemia was 5.52 per"
		1000 patient-discharges and did not change throughout the study. The mean and
		"median ages of subjects were 3 years versus 9 months, respectively, and 38% were"
		less than 3 months of age. Gastrointestinal disorders were a common comorbid
		"condition (33%), especially for subjects with multiple episodes of candidemia."
		"Overall, Candida parapsilosis and Candida albicans caused 43% and 26% of"
		"episodes, respectively, and candidemia caused by Candida glabrata (5.3%-23%) and"
		Candida krusei (0%-8.5%) increased during the study. Ninety-eight percent of C.
		albicans and C. parapsilosis isolates remained susceptible to all antifungal
		"drugs. From 2003-2006, the use of antifungal agents increased from 79 days to 150"
		days per 1000 hospital-days. CONCLUSIONS: While antifungal use at our hospital
		"increased, candidemia rates remained stable. C. parapsilosis was the most common"
		species but other non-C. albicans species increased during the study period.
		Local epidemiology should be monitored in pediatric populations for potential
		impact on management strategies.

PG	-	406-415
LID	-	10.1093/mmy/myx077 [doi]
AB	-	Candidemia is the main invasive fungal disease among hospitalized patients.
		"Several breakthrough candidemia (BrC) cases have been reported, but few studies"
		"evaluate the epidemiology, risk factors, molecular characterization, antifungal"
		"susceptibility profile and outcome of those patients, especially in developing"
		countries and including patients using broad spectrum antifungals. We conducted a
		"retrospective study from 2011 to 2016, including patients aged 12 years or older"
		with candidemia. Epidemiological characteristics and risk factors for candidemia
		were evaluated and compared with patients with BrC using univariate and
		multivariate analysis. Sequential Candida isolates from BrC were identified by
		"internal transcribed spacer sequencing, genotyped with amplified fragment length"
		"polymorphism fingerprinting (AFLP), and tested for antifungal susceptibility."
		"From 148 candidemia episodes, 27 breakthrough episodes (18%) were identified,"
		with neutropenia and mucositis being independent risk factors for BrC. Candida
		non-albicans was more frequent in the BrC group (P < .001). AFLP showed high
		correlation with conventional methods of identification among breakthrough
		isolates and a high genetic similarity among isolates from the same patient was
		observed. C. albicans was the most susceptible species with low MIC values for
		"all antifungal agents tested. In contrast, we found isolates of C. glabrata, C."
		parapsilosis and C. tropicalis resistant to triazoles and echinocandins. In
		"conclusion, BrC occurred mainly in severely immunosuppressed patients, with"
		neutropenia and mucositis. Mortality did not differ between the groups. Candida
		"non-albicans species were more recovered from BrC, with C. albicans being the"
		most susceptible to antifungals.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Fungal bloodstream infections (FBI) among intensive care unit (ICU)
		patients are increasing. Our objective was to characterize the fungal pathogens
		that cause bloodstream infections and determine the epidemiology and risk factors
		"for patient mortality among ICU patients in Meizhou, China. METHODS: Eighty-one"
		ICU patients with FBI during their stays were included in the study conducted
		from January 2008 to December 2017. Blood cultures were performed and the
		antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of the resulting isolates were determined.
		Logistic multiple regression and ROC curve analysis were used to assess the risk
		factors for mortality among the cases. RESULTS: The prevalence of FBI in ICU
		"patients was 0.38% (81/21,098) with a mortality rate of 36% (29/81). Ninety-eight"
		"strains of bloodstream-infecting fungi, mainly Candida spp., were identified from"
		these patients. Candida albicans was most common (43%). Two strains of C.
		"parapsilosis were no-sensitive to caspofungin, C. glabrata were less than 80%"
		"sensitive to azole drugs. Logistic multiple regression showed that age, serum"
		"albumin, APACHE II score, three or more underlying diseases, and length of stay"
		in ICU were independent risk factors for mortality in FBI. ROC curve analysis
		showed that APACHE II scores > 19 and serum albumin ≤25 g/L were the best
		predictors of mortality. CONCLUSION: Candida spp. predominated with high
		"mortality rates among cases of FBI in ICU. Thus, clinical staff should enhance"
		overall patient monitoring and concurrently monitor fungal susceptibility to
		reduce mortality rates.

PG	-	248-51
LID	-	10.1016/j.clineuro.2009.11.011 [doi]
AB	-	Candida parapsilosis is a very rare cause of meningitis. Though several cases
		"have now been reported in neonates and children, only one has been described in"
		an adult. We report on a 55-year-old male that was admitted due to altered mental
		"status. He had recent sinus drainage and polypectomy, craniotomy with drainage of"
		"brain abscess, and ventriculo-peritoneal shunt placement. On admission, imaging"
		studies showed no evidence of shunt dysfunction but did reveal extensive white
		matter decreased attenuation. Microscopic examination of the first 10 daily
		cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures revealed yeast. Flucytosine and liposomal
		amphotericin B were started and externalization of shunt was performed on day 3.
		"On day 8, CSF culture from admission grew C. parapsilosis; fluconazole was added."
		"On day 10, daily CSF still showed yeast and cultures consistently grew C."
		parapsilosis. Shunt was removed and bilateral ventriculostomy drains were
		inserted. CSF after procedure as well as at follow-up examinations throughout his
		3-month hospitalization were negative for yeast. Extended treatment with
		"flucytosine and fluconazole was initiated. At 8-month follow-up, successful"
		treatment of C. parapsilosis infection without recurrence was confirmed. This
		case underscores the need for suspicion of C. parapsilosis as a cause of
		meningitis after invasive surgeries in adults.

PG	-	543-551
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-021-00569-7 [doi]
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Candida species is the most common cause of invasive fungal
		infection. With the wide variation in species distribution and antifungal
		"susceptibility of causative agents, local epidemiological profiles are needed to"
		provide effective guidelines for the treatment of invasive candidiasis.
		OBJECTIVE: To find out the species distribution and antifungal susceptibilities
		of Candida strains isolated from patients in an intensive care unit (ICU) of
		Vietnam. METHODS: All patients in ICU of Vietnam National Hospital of Burn with
		Candida isolation reported from January 2017 to December 2019 were
		retrospectively studied. Species identification and antifungal susceptibility
		testing were performed using VITEK 2 Compact. The identification was reconfirmed
		by sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer regions when needed. RESULTS: A
		total of 186 yeasts belonging to ten species were collected. The most common
		"agent was C. tropicalis (45.7%), followed by C. albicans (42.4%), and C."
		parapsilosis (7.53%). The isolated yeasts showed less susceptibility to
		"fluconazole (resistant rate R 10.7%) than to micafungin, caspofungin, flucytosine"
		"and amphotericin B (R 0%, 0.6%, 2.3% and 3.4%, respectively, p < 0.05). C."
		albicans isolates were more susceptible to fluconazole (R 5.2%) than C.
		tropicalis (R 15.7%). Resistance to voriconazole was seen only among C. albicans
		(3.9%) and C. tropicalis isolates (9.9%). CONCLUSION: Non-albicans species
		"(especially C. tropicalis) is the predominant species, and there is a significant"
		proportion of isolates with reduced susceptibility to azole but not to
		echinocandin.

		of candidemia in Shanghai differed from that observed in Western countries.
		Appropriate empiric antifungal therapy influenced the short-term survival.

		with Lower Reproductive Tract Infections in Women from Southern
		Poland-Retrospective Laboratory-Based Study.
LID	-	10.3390/ijerph18010335 [doi]
LID	-	335
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: Female infections affecting the genital tract include sexually
		"transmitted diseases, endogenous infections such as vulvovaginal candidiasis,"
		bacterial vaginosis (BV) or aerobic vaginitis (AV) and healthcare-associated
		infections. The aim of the study was to analyze the etiological factors of the
		"vaginal dysbacteriosis, and the antimicrobial susceptibility of the dominant"
		bacterial and fungal infections in different age groups of outpatient women from
		the Silesian Region. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective laboratory-based
		multi-center study encompassed 4994 women of different ages in Silesian
		"Voivodeship, in the south of Poland; patients who had vaginal swabs collected as"
		per physicians' orders during the period from 1 January 2017 until 30 June 2018
		"were included in the study. The inclusion criteria were: non-hospitalized female,"
		"aged ≤80, with suspected vulvovaginal candidiasis or bacterial vaginosis and"
		clinical sings of infections. RESULTS: Gram-positive cocci were the ones most
		often isolated: Enterococcus faecalis (29.2%) and Streptoccoccus agalactiae
		"(13.1%), followed by bacilli from the Enterobacteriaceae group, including"
		Escherichia coli (26.3%). The presence of Streptococcus agalactiae was confirmed
		"in 13.1%, slightly more often in the 45-80 age group, and Gardnerella vaginalis"
		"in 6.4%, most often in women aged 15-24. The prevalence of yeast-like infections"
		"was 24.3%, Candida albicans accounted for 78.3%, whereas among C. non-albicans"
		spp.-C. glabrata dominated (14.9%) followed by C. parapsilosis (3.8%). The
		highest resistance was observed only in Streptococcus agalactiae as the MLSB
		mechanism (Macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B) was identified in 38.6% of
		"strains. The prevalence of vulvovaginal candidiasis was 24.3%, the highest in"
		women aged 15-44. CONCLUSIONS: Drug resistance in studied vulvovaginitis was
		associated only with Streptococcus agalactiae. A high proportion of yeast-like
		"aetiology was found, probably associated with recurrent infections. In the"
		analyzed cases only the Amsel criteria and culture methods were used for
		diagnosis without preparations and microbiological Nugent criteria.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: In recent years, Candida parapsilosis is recognized as a species"
		"complex and is composed of Candida parapsilosis sensu stricto, Candida"
		orthopsilosis and Candida metapsilosis. Candida parapsilosis complex prosthetic
		valve endocarditis (PVE) is rare and the survival rate is still low despite of
		"optimal therapeutic strategies. In our report, it is novel to report cases as"
		Candida parapsilosis complex PVE at species and identify Candida parapsilosis
		using MALDI-TOF MS. Case presentation A series of 4 cases of Candida parapsilosis
		complex PVE from our institution was reported. Three were infected by Candida
		parapsilosis sensu stricto and one was infected by Candida metapsilosis. The
		condition of two cases got better and the other died. CONCLUSIONS: More attention
		should be paid to Candida parapsilosis complex PVE and early diagnosis and prompt
		antibiotic therapy may play a role in the treatment for Candida parapsilosis
		complex PVE. It is recommended to identify Candida parapsilosis complex at
		"species level and MALDI-TOF MS as an easy, fast and efficient identification"
		method is worth promoting in clinical microbiology.

TI	-	Type 2 diabetes mellitus and oral Candida colonization: Analysis of risk factors
		in a Sri Lankan cohort.
PG	-	508-516
LID	-	10.1080/00016357.2019.1607547 [doi]
AB	-	Aims: Oral candidiasis is a major oral manifestation of uncontrolled diabetes
		"mellitus, and a number of cofactors are associated with the pathogenesis of this"
		"infection. Here, we describe the prevalence of oral Candida in a Sri Lankan"
		cohort of type 2 diabetes mellitus and risk factors that predispose them to this
		common fungal infection. Methods: A case-control study was conducted in 250
		diabetics with type 2 diabetes and 81 nondiabetic controls. Clinical and
		"demographic data were collected using an interviewer administered questionnaire,"
		and patient records. Oral rinse samples were collected to determine the candidal
		"carriage, and the resultant yeast growth was quantified and speciated using"
		multiplex-PCR and phenotypic analyses. Chi-square test (χ(2) test) and Fisher
		exact test were used for the determination of the significant relationships
		between risk factors and oral candidiasis. Results: The oral prevalence of
		Candida species among both groups was similar (81%) although a significantly
		higher proportion of diabetics (32.8%) yielded >2000 CFU/mL of yeasts compared
		with only 12.3% of the healthy controls (p < .05). Significant associations were
		"noted between oral candidal carriage amongst diabetics, and (i) denture wearing,"
		"(ii) female gender and (iii) cigarette smoking (all, p < .05). Amongst both"
		"groups, C.albicans was the most common Candida species isolated followed by C."
		"parapsilosis, C. tropicalis and C. glabrata. Conclusions: The oral infestation of"
		Candida in our Sri Lankan cohort of diabetics is significantly higher than their
		"healthy counterparts, and co-carriage of multiple yeast species is a common"
		finding in the study population. As there are no previous such reports of the
		"latter phenomenon particularly from the Asian region it is noteworthy, mainly in"
		view of the recent data on the emergence of drug-resistant yeast species the
		world over.

PG	-	5590-6
LID	-	10.1128/AAC.00466-11 [doi]
AB	-	A 13-month prospective multicenter study including 44 hospitals was carried out
		to evaluate the epidemiology of Candida parapsilosis complex candidemia in Spain.
		"Susceptibility to amphotericin B, flucytosine, fluconazole, itraconazole,"
		"voriconazole, posaconazole, anidulafungin, caspofungin, and micafungin was tested"
		by the microdilution colorimetric method. A total of 364 C. parapsilosis complex
		"isolates were identified by molecular methods: C. parapsilosis (90.7%), Candida"
		"orthopsilosis (8.2%), and Candida metapsilosis (1.1%). Most candidemias (C."
		"parapsilosis, 76.4%; C. orthopsilosis, 70.0%; C. metapsilosis, 100%) were"
		observed in adults. No C. orthopsilosis or C. metapsilosis candidemias occurred
		in neonates. C. parapsilosis was most frequent in adult intensive care unit
		"(28.8%), surgery (20.9%), and internal medicine (19.7%) departments; and C."
		"orthopsilosis was most frequent in hematology (28.6%), pediatrics (12.0%), and"
		neonatology (11.5%) departments. The geographic distribution of C. orthopsilosis
		"and C. metapsilosis was not uniform. According to CLSI clinical breakpoints, all"
		C. orthopsilosis and C. metapsilosis isolates were susceptible to the nine agents
		tested. Resistance (MICs > 1 mg/liter) was observed only in C. parapsilosis:
		"amphotericin B, posaconazole, itraconazole, and caspofungin (0.3% each),"
		"anidulafungin (1.9%), and micafungin (2.5%). Applying the new species-specific"
		"fluconazole and echinocandin breakpoints, the rates of resistance to fluconazole"
		"for C. parapsilosis and C. orthopsilosis increased to 4.8% and 0.3%,"
		"respectively; conversely, for C. parapsilosis they shifted from 1.9 to 0.6%"
		(anidulafungin) and from 2.5 to 0.6% (micafungin). Our study confirms the
		different prevalence of C. parapsilosis complex candidemia among age groups:
		neither C. orthopsilosis nor C. metapsilosis was isolated from neonates;
		"interestingly, C. metapsilosis was isolated only from adults and the elderly. The"
		disparity in antifungal susceptibility among species could be important for
		therapy.

AB	-	Despite the increasing occurrence of Candida orthopsilosis and Candida
		"metapsilosis in clinical settings, little is known about their microbiological"
		"and clinical properties. Herein, we conducted a national retrospective study"
		"(2014-2019) from multiple centers in Iran. Among the 1,770 Candida isolates"
		"collected, we identified 600 Candida parapsilosis species complex isolates."
		"Isolate identification was performed by 9-plex PCR, matrix-assisted laser"
		"desorption-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), and rDNA sequencing,"
		and antifungal susceptibility testing (AFST) followed CLSI M27-A3/S4; genotyping
		was performed by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis; and
		clinical information was mined. Thirty-one isolates of C. orthopsilosis from
		"various clinical sources, one mixed sample (blood) concurrently containing C."
		orthopsilosis and C. parapsilosis and one isolate of C. metapsilosis from a nail
		sample were identified. Although both 9-plex PCR and MALDI-TOF successfully
		"identified all isolates, only 9-plex PCR could identify the agents in a mixed"
		"sample. For the C. orthopsilosis isolates, resistance (non-wild type) was noted"
		only for itraconazole (n = 4; 12.5%). Anidulafungin and fluconazole showed the
		highest and voriconazole had the lowest geometric mean values. AFLP analysis
		"showed three main and four minor genotypes. Interestingly, 90% of nail isolates"
		"clustered with 80% of the blood isolates within two clusters, and four blood"
		isolates recovered from four patients admitted to a hospital clustered into two
		"genotypes and showed a high degree of similarity (>99.2%), which suggests that C."
		orthopsilosis disseminates horizontally. Supported by our data and published case
		"studies, C. orthopsilosis and C. metapsilosis can be linked to challenging"
		"clinical failures, and successful outcomes are not always mirrored by in vitro"
		"susceptibility. Accordingly, conducting nationwide studies may provide more"
		"comprehensive data, which is required for a better prognosis and clinical"
		management of patients.

TI	-	Characteristics and outcomes of patients with postoperative Candida versus
		bacterial mediastinitis: a case-matched comparative study.
PG	-	523-530
LID	-	10.1093/ejcts/ezab437 [doi]
AB	-	"OBJECTIVES: Postoperative mediastinitis, a feared complication after cardiac"
		"surgery, is associated with high mortality, especially of critically ill"
		"patients. Candida species infections are rare and severe, with poorly known"
		"outcomes. We conducted a case-control study to describe the characteristics,"
		management and outcomes of patients with postoperative Candida mediastinitis.
		"METHODS: This French, monocentre, retrospective study included all patients with"
		postoperative Candida mediastinitis (January 2003-February 2020) requiring
		intensive care unit admission. Candida mediastinitis patients (henceforth cases)
		"were matched 1:1 with postoperative bacterial mediastinitis (henceforth control),"
		"based on 3 factors during mediastinitis management: age >40 years, cardiac"
		transplantation and invasive circulatory device used. The primary end point was
		the probability of survival within 1 year after intensive care unit (ICU)
		admission. RESULTS: Forty cases were matched to 40 controls. The global
		"male/female ratio was 2.1, with mean age at admission 47.9 ± 13.8 years. Candida"
		"species were: 67.5% albicans, 17.5% glabrata, 15% parapsilosis, 5.0% tropicalis,"
		2.5% krusei and 2.5% lusitaniae. The median duration of mechanical ventilation
		"was 23, 68.8% of patients received renal replacement therapy and 62.5%"
		extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. The probability of survival within
		the first year after ICU admission was 40 ± 5.5% and was significantly lower for
		"cases than for controls (43 ± 8% vs 80 ± 6.3%, respectively; Log-rank test: P <"
		0.0001). The multivariable Cox proportional hazards model retained only renal
		"replacement therapy [hazard ratio (HR) 3.7, 95% confidence interval (CI)"
		"1.1-13.1; P = 0.04] and Candida mediastinitis (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.1-5.6; P = 0.04)"
		as independently associated with 1-year mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Candida
		mediastinitis is a serious event after cardiac surgery and independently
		associated with 1-year mortality. Further studies are needed to determine whether
		deaths are directly attributable to Candida mediastinitis.

TI	-	Fungemia in patients with leukemia.
PG	-	225-32
AB	-	A nine-year retrospective study on fungemia in patients with leukemia was
		conducted. A total of 79 episodes of fungemia in 77 patients with leukemia were
		documented. Candida parapsilosis fungemia was associated more frequently with the
		presence of a central venous line and to the use of parenteral nutrition than the
		"other fungal species (p = 0.00026 and p = 0.01, respectively). The same fungus"
		was isolated from both blood and surveillance cultures in 95% of Candida albicans
		"and in 89% of Candida tropicalis fungemia (p < 0.01 and p = 0.02, respectively)."
		The neutropenia and fungus colonization that resulted was associated
		"significantly with the presence of invasive disease (p = 0.0024 and p = 0.0028,"
		"respectively). Conversely, central venous catheterization and parenteral"
		nutrition appeared to be associated with episodes without deep tissue invasion (p
		"= 0.000037 and p = 0.001, respectively). Invasive mycosis due to the fungus"
		"isolated from blood was documented in 51 patients with a mortality rate of 69%,"
		"whereas in 20 patients without invasive mycosis, mortality rate was 21% (p ="
		"0.000059). In patients with fungemia, related or unrelated to the presence of a"
		"central venous catheter, mortality was 24% and 64%, respectively (p = 0.00042)."
		Mortality was highest with C. tropicalis (p = 0.0017) and lowest with C.
		parapsilosis (p = 0.057). Severe neutropenia (polymorphonuclears < 100/mmc)
		"appeared associated with a higher mortality rate (p = 0.012), whereas the"
		recovery of neutropenia was related adversely to a fatal outcome (p < 0.01). With
		"antifungal therapy, there was no statistically significant difference whether"
		antifungal therapy was given or not.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive candidiasis is not uncommon in critically ill patients but
		has variable epidemiology and outcomes between intensive care units (ICUs). This
		"study evaluated the epidemiology, characteristics, management, and outcomes of"
		patients with invasive candidiasis at 6 ICUs of 2 tertiary care centers. METHODS:
		This was a prospective observational study of all adults admitted to 6 ICUs in 2
		different hospitals between August 2012 and May 2016 and diagnosed to have
		invasive candidiasis by 2 intensivists according to predefined criteria. The
		"epidemiology of isolated Candida and the characteristics, management, and"
		outcomes of affected patients were studied. Multivariable logistic regression
		analyses were performed to identify the predictors of non-albicans versus
		albicans infection and hospital mortality. RESULTS: Invasive candidiasis was
		"diagnosed in 162 (age 58.4 ± 18.9 years, 52.2% males, 82.1% medical admissions,"
		and admission Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score 24.1 ± 8.4)
		"patients at a rate of 2.6 cases per 100 ICU admissions. On the diagnosis day, the"
		Candida score was 2.4 ± 0.9 in invasive candidiasis compared with 1.6 ± 0.9 in
		"Candida colonization (P < .01). The most frequent species were albicans (38.3%),"
		"tropicalis (16.7%), glabrata (16%), and parapsilosis (13.6%). In patients with"
		"candidemia, antifungal therapy was started on average 1 hour before knowing the"
		"culture result (59.6% of therapy initiated after). Resistance to fluconazole,"
		"caspofungin, and amphotericin B occurred in 27.9%, 2.9%, and 3.1%, respectively."
		The hospital mortality was 58.6% with no difference between albicans and
		"non-albicans infections (61.3% and 54.9%, respectively; P = .44). The independent"
		predictors of mortality were renal replacement therapy after invasive candidiasis
		diagnosis (odds ratio: 5.42; 95% confidence interval: 2.16-13.56) and invasive
		candidiasis leading/contributing to ICU admission versus occurring during
		critical illness (odds ratio: 2.87; 95% confidence interval: 1.22-6.74).
		"CONCLUSIONS: In critically ill patients with invasive candidiasis, non-albicans"
		"was responsible for most cases, and mortality was high (58.6%). Antifungal"
		therapy was initiated after culture results in 60% suggesting low preclinical
		suspicion. Study registration: NCT01490684; registered in ClinicalTrials.gov on
		"February 11, 2012."

PG	-	915-26
AB	-	"Fungal endocarditis (FE) is an uncommon disease, and while accounting for only"
		"1.3-6% of all cases of infectious endocarditis, it carries a high mortality risk."
		"Although Candida albicans represents the main etiology of FE, C. parapsilosis is"
		the most common non-albicans species. We report the case of a 32-year-old man
		with a history of prior intravenous drug (IVD) use hospitalized with endocarditis
		due to C. parapsilosis and review all 71 additional cases documented in the
		literature. A retrospective analysis of the 72 C. parapsilosis cases compared to
		52 recently reviewed cases of C. albicans endocarditis was conducted to identify
		organism-specific clinical peculiarities. The most common predisposing factor for
		C. parapsilosis endocarditis (41/72; 57.4%) involved prosthetic valves followed
		by IVD use (12/72; 20%). Peripheral embolic and/or hemorrhagic events occurred in
		"28/64 (43.8%) patients, mostly in cerebral and lower limb territories. Overall"
		mortality was 41.7%. Combined surgical and clinical treatment was associated with
		"a lower mortality. Few patients received the newer antifungal agents, and it"
		would appear that more experience is required for their use in the treatment of
		C. parapsilosis endocarditis.

TI	-	Molecular epidemiology of candidemia: evidence of clusters of smoldering
		nosocomial infections.
PG	-	e17-24
LID	-	10.1086/589298 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive fungal infections pose a serious threat to hospitalized
		"patients worldwide. In particular, the prevalence of clusters of nosocomial"
		infection among patients with candidemia remains unknown. The aim of this study
		was to investigate the molecular epidemiology of candidemia in a nationwide
		setting in Iceland during a 16-year period. METHODS: The genotypes of all
		available fungal bloodstream isolates during 1991-2006 (n = 219) were determined
		by polymerase chain reaction fingerprinting with use of 4 separate primers.
		Clusters were defined as isolation of > or =2 strains with genotypes that had >
		or =90% relatedness in the same hospital within a period of 90 days. RESULTS:
		"Candida albicans represented 61.6% of isolates, followed by Candida glabrata"
		"(13.7%), Candida tropicalis (9.1%), and Candida parapsilosis (8.7%). Polymerase"
		"chain reaction fingerprinting revealed 35 clones of C. albicans, 10 clones of C."
		"glabrata, 7 clones of C. tropicalis, 4 clones of C. parapsilosis, and 5 clones of"
		"Candida dubliniensis. Overall, 18.7%-39.9% of all infections were part of"
		"nosocomial clusters, most commonly caused by C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, and C."
		tropicalis. Most clusters involved 2 cases and disproportionately affected
		patients in adult and neonatal intensive care units (P = .045). The 7-day (16%)
		and 30-day (32%) case-fatality rates among cluster-associated cases did not
		differ statistically significantly from those for sporadic nosocomial infections.
		None of the clusters were identified by the hospital surveillance team.
		"CONCLUSIONS: In an unselected patient population, as many as one-third of all"
		cases of candidemia may be attributable to nosocomial clusters. The risk is
		dependent on hospital wards and patient populations; it is highest in intensive
		care units. Small clusters are not identified by routine hospital surveillance.

AB	-	Candidemia is a growing problem in hospitals all over the world. Despite advances
		"in the medical support of critically ill patients, candidiasis leads to prolonged"
		"hospitalization, and has a crude mortality rate around 50%. We conducted a"
		multicenter surveillance study in 16 hospitals distributed across five regions of
		"Brazil to assess the incidence, species distribution, antifungal susceptibility,"
		and risk factors for bloodstream infections due to Candida species. From June
		"2007 to March 2010, we studied a total of 2,563 nosocomial bloodstream infection"
		(nBSI) episodes. Candida spp. was the 7th most prevalent agent. Most of the
		"patients were male, with a median age of 56 years. A total of 64 patients (46.7%)"
		were in the ICU when candidemia occurred. Malignancies were the most common
		underlying condition (32%). The crude mortality rate of candidemia during the
		hospital admission was 72.2%. Non-albicans species of Candida accounted for 65.7%
		"of the 137 yeast isolates. C. albicans (34.3%), Candida parapsilosis (24.1%),"
		Candida tropicalis (15.3%) and Candida glabrata (10.2%) were the most prevalent
		species. Only 47 out of 137 Candida isolates were sent to the reference
		"laboratory for antifungal susceptibility testing. All C. albicans, C. tropicalis"
		and C. parapsilosis isolates were susceptible to the 5 antifungal drugs tested.
		"Among 11 C. glabrata isolates, 36% were resistant to fluconazole, and 64% SDD."
		All of them were susceptible to anidulafungin and amphotericin B. We observed
		that C. glabrata is emerging as a major player among non-albicans Candida spp.
		and fluconazole resistance was primarily confined to C. glabrata and C. krusei
		strains. Candida resistance to echinocandins and amphotericin B remains rare in
		Brazil. Mortality rates remain increasingly higher than that observed in the
		"Northern Hemisphere countries, emphasizing the need for improving local practices"
		"of clinical management of candidemia, including early diagnosis, source control"
		and precise antifungal therapy.

		other normally sterile sites: results of a 2-year (1996 to 1998) multicenter
		"surveillance study in Quebec, Canada."
PG	-	949-53
AB	-	"During a 2-year surveillance program (1996 to 1998) in Quebec, Canada, 442"
		strains of Candida species were isolated from 415 patients in 51 hospitals. The
		"distribution of species was as follows: Candida albicans, 54%; C. glabrata, 15%;"
		"C. parapsilosis, 12%; C. tropicalis, 9%; C. lusitaniae, 3%; C. krusei, 3%; and"
		"Candida spp., 3%. These data, compared to those of a 1985 survey, indicate"
		"variations in species distribution, with the proportions of C. glabrata and C."
		"parapsilosis increasing by 9 and 4%, respectively, and those of C. albicans and"
		"C. tropicalis decreasing by 10 and 7%, respectively. However, these differences"
		are statistically significant for C. glabrata and C. tropicalis only. MICs of
		"amphotericin B were > or =4 microg/ml for 3% of isolates, all of which were"
		non-C. albicans species. Three percent of C. albicans isolates were resistant to
		flucytosine (> or =32 microg/ml). Resistance to itraconazole (> or =1 microg/ml)
		"and fluconazole (> or =64 microg/ml) was observed, respectively, in 1 and 1% of"
		"C. albicans, 14 and 9% of C. glabrata, 5 and 0% of C. tropicalis, and 0% of C."
		parapsilosis and C. lusitaniae isolates. Clinical data were obtained for 343
		"patients. The overall crude mortality rate was 38%, reflecting the multiple"
		serious underlying illnesses found in these patients. Bloodstream infections were
		"documented for 249 patients (73%). Overall, systemic triazoles had been"
		administered to 10% of patients before the onset of candidiasis. The frequency of
		isolation of non-C. albicans species was significantly higher in this group of
		"patients. Overall, only two C. albicans isolates were found to be resistant to"
		"fluconazole. These were obtained from an AIDS patient and a leukemia patient,"
		"both of whom had a history of previous exposure to fluconazole. At present, it"
		appears that resistance to fluconazole in Quebec is rare and is restricted to
		patients with prior prolonged azole treatment.

AB	-	"Skull base osteomyelitis (SBO) is an invasive infection refractory to therapy,"
		closely linked with malignant otitis externa (MOE). It is characterized by a mild
		clinical presentation that can delay cross-sectional imaging considered as the
		key to revealing it. Skull base osteomyelitis typically affects elderly diabetics
		and immunocompromised patients (>70 years). It most commonly has an otogenic
		origin due to an extension of MOE. The prognosis can be very poor without the
		administration of adequate and timely therapy at an early disease stage.
		"Nowadays, Pseudomonas aeruginosa remains the most common pathogen associated with"
		SBO. Fungi are a rare cause of MOE. This report documents a rare case of otogenic
		"SBO caused by Candida parapsilosis in a diabetic patient, with persistent"
		otologic symptoms as clinical onset and resistance to medical treatment. Fungal
		MOE has more subtle symptoms and is more aggressive than its bacterial
		"counterpart. When MOE is resistant to antibacterial drugs, this should raise the"
		suspicion of a fungal etiology of MOE. The current guidelines do not exhaustively
		"describe the diagnosis, antifungal drugs of choice, and optimum duration of"
		treatment. The description of these rare clinical cases should help with the
		multidisciplinary management of this disease in order to optimize the diagnosis
		and therapeutic protocol.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: This paper aimed to identify and quantify Candida on head and neck
		irradiated patients with two comparative elderly populations. MATERIALS AND
		METHODS: Saliva was sampled from 29 head and neck irradiated patients (group 1)
		34 non-institutionalized elderly patients (group 2) and 29 institutionalized
		"elders (group 3) and matched by age. For quantification, the obtained saliva was"
		"sewed on CHROMagar Candida(®), which was used also for presumptive identification"
		"of Candida, API 20C AUX(®), microculture and RAPD (OPE-18) were used for the"
		"final identification. RESULTS: Among the 92 patients surveyed, 51 (55.4%) had"
		"scores classified as positive for Candida, and among individuals of groups 1 and"
		"3, 58.6% had Candida. There was higher positive/carrier conditions (CFU/sample)"
		"in groups 1 and 3, comparing with group 2 (P=0.011). Gender was not associated"
		with Candida portability (P=0.334). Candida portability was significantly
		associated with the presence of candidosis (P=0.031) and xerostomic state
		"(P=0.007). The isolates and definitive confirmed colonies were Candida albicans,"
		"Candida dubliniensis, Candida tropicalis, Candida krusei, Candida glabrata,"
		"Candida parapsilosis, Candida guilliermondii, Candida lusitaniae, and Candida"
		"kefyr. Among the species identified, C. albicans was the most frequent, followed"
		"by C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis and C. glabrata. C. albicans was more prevalent"
		"in group 2 and 3, 45% and 41.2%, respectively, whereas, the most prevalent"
		"species in group 1 were C. tropicalis (27%), C. albicans and C. parapsilosis"
		"(16.2% for both). On multiple statistical models, only radiotherapic treatment"
		was associated with positiveness to Candida. CONCLUSIONS: Diversification and
		major prevalence of non-albicans species were observed in irradiated patients on
		head and neck and this treatment is straightly associated with fungus
		positiveness.

TI	-	Incidence of bloodstream infections due to Candida species and in vitro
		susceptibilities of isolates collected from 1998 to 2000 in a population-based
		active surveillance program.
PG	-	1519-27
AB	-	To determine the incidence of Candida bloodstream infections (BSI) and antifungal
		"drug resistance, population-based active laboratory surveillance was conducted"
		from October 1998 through September 2000 in two areas of the United States
		"(Baltimore, Md., and the state of Connecticut; combined population, 4.7 million)."
		"A total of 1,143 cases were detected, for an average adjusted annual incidence of"
		"10 per 100,000 population or 1.5 per 10,000 hospital days. In 28% of patients,"
		Candida BSI developed prior to or on the day of admission; only 36% of patients
		were in an intensive care unit at the time of diagnosis. No fewer than 78% of
		"patients had a central catheter in place at the time of diagnosis, and 50% had"
		undergone surgery within the previous 3 months. Candida albicans comprised 45% of
		"the isolates, followed by C. glabrata (24%), C. parapsilosis (13%), and C."
		tropicalis (12%). Only 1.2% of C. albicans isolates were resistant to fluconazole
		"(MIC, > or = 64 microg/ml), compared to 7% of C. glabrata isolates and 6% of C."
		tropicalis isolates. Only 0.9% of C. albicans isolates were resistant to
		"itraconazole (MIC, > or = 1 micro g/ml), compared to 19.5% of C. glabrata"
		isolates and 6% of C. tropicalis isolates. Only 4.3% of C. albicans isolates were
		"resistant to flucytosine (MIC, > or = 32 microg/ml), compared to < 1% of C."
		parapsilosis and C. tropicalis isolates and no C. glabrata isolates. As
		"determined by E-test, the MICs of amphotericin B were > or = 0.38 microg/ml for"
		"10% of Candida isolates, > or =1 microg/ml for 1.7% of isolates, and > or = 2"
		microg/ml for 0.4% of isolates. Our findings highlight changes in the
		epidemiology of Candida BSI in the 1990s and provide a basis upon which to
		conduct further studies of selected high-risk subpopulations.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of oral candidiasis and multiple oral
		"Candida infections in patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome (SS), and the"
		clinical and drug susceptibility profile. METHODS: Thirty patients with primary
		SS were enrolled in our study. The diagnosis of oral candidiasis was based on the
		"clinical manifestation, and confirmed by a concentrated rinse culture. Candida"
		spp. assessment was accomplished using standard methods: Sabouraud dextrose agar
		with 50 mg/l chloramphenicol and CHROMagar were used for the rapid screening of
		"clinical species, followed by the API 20C system for further species"
		identification. In vitro antifungal drug susceptibility of Candida isolates was
		"determined by the minimal inhibitory concentrations. RESULTS: In our study, 87%"
		"(26/30) of subjects had oral candidiasis, in which 42% (11/26) had multiple"
		"Candida spp. infection. Although C. albicans remains the predominant isolate,"
		"other rare species such as C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, and C."
		"krusei were present, alone or in combination. Chronic atrophic candidiasis is the"
		most common clinical type of oral candidiasis in patients with SS. The
		susceptibilities of the 44 Candida isolates to 7 antifungal agents varied
		"dramatically. The resistance to azoles was remarkable, and the phenomenon of"
		cross-resistance between itraconazole and fluconazole was observed. CONCLUSION:
		Patients with primary SS carry a high risk of oral candidiasis and a high
		frequency of multiple Candida infections. The azole resistance patterns of
		Candida spp. support the necessity for drug susceptibility testing as a routine
		procedure for patients with oral Candida infections.

		"nine antifungal drugs of Candida parapsilosis species complex, Candida"
		"tropicalis, Candida glabrata species complex and Candida krusei isolates from"
		patients with invasive candidiasis at 11 hospitals over 3 years. Isolates were
		identified by MALDI-TOF MS supplemented by DNA sequencing. MICs were determined
		by Sensititre YeastOne(TM) using current clinical breakpoints/epidemiological
		"cut-off values to assign susceptibility (or WT), and by CLSI M44-A2 disc"
		"diffusion for fluconazole and voriconazole. RESULTS: Of 1072 isolates, 392"
		"(36.6%) were C. parapsilosis species complex. C. tropicalis, C. glabrata species"
		"complex and C. krusei comprised 35.4%, 24.3% and 3.7% of the isolates,"
		respectively. Over 99.3% of the isolates were of WT phenotype to amphotericin B
		and 5-flucytosine. Susceptibility/WT rates to azoles among C. parapsilosis
		"species complex were ≥97.5%. However, 11.6% and 9.5% of C. tropicalis isolates"
		"were non-susceptible to fluconazole and voriconazole, respectively (7.1% were"
		resistant to both). Approximately 14.3% of C. glabrata sensu stricto isolates
		"(n = 258) were fluconazole resistant, and 11.6% of C. glabrata sensu stricto"
		isolates were cross-resistant to fluconazole and voriconazole. All C. krusei
		"isolates were susceptible/WT to voriconazole, posaconazole and itraconazole."
		"Overall, 97.7%-100% of isolates were susceptible to caspofungin, micafungin and"
		"anidulafungin, but 2.3% of C. glabrata were non-susceptible to anidulafungin."
		There was no azole/echinocandin co-resistance. Disc diffusion and Sensititre
		YeastOne(TM) methods showed >95% categorical agreement for fluconazole and
		"voriconazole. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, reduced azole susceptibility was seen"
		among C. tropicalis. Resistance to echinocandins was uncommon.

AB	-	"PURPOSE: To determine the incidence, clinical features, and outcomes of"
		infectious endophthalmitis after Boston Type 1 Keratoprosthesis (KPro)
		"implantation. METHODS: Retrospective, consecutive case series. Chart review of"
		105 patients (126 eyes) who had KPro implantation at Cincinnati Eye Institute
		between November 2004 and November 2010 and who were followed up for at least 1
		"month (range, 1 month to 66 months; mean 25 months) revealed 3 cases who"
		developed infectious endophthalmitis. RESULTS: One patient had a history of
		"congenital glaucoma, and 2 patients had Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Two had KPro"
		implantation for penetrating keratoplasty failure and 1 had necrosis of a
		previous KPro cornea. The incidence of endophthalmitis was 2.4%. All patients
		wore a contact lens and were on vancomycin and a fourth-generation
		fluoroquinolone (moxifloxacin). Vitreous fluid cultures yielded Ochrobactrum
		"anthropi, Candida parapsilosis, and Candida albicans. All patients received"
		"intravitreal amphotericin, vancomycin, and/or ceftazidime. Topical and oral"
		antiinfective agents were tailored based on sensitivities. One patient required
		KPro removal and therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty. Vision did not recover for
		"2 patients who presented with vision decreased to light perception. One patient,"
		"who presented with decreased vision of 20/400, recovered to 20/60. CONCLUSIONS:"
		Infectious endophthalmitis is a devastating complication that can occur after
		"Boston KPro implantation even with prophylactic vancomycin, a fourth-generation"
		"fluoroquinolone, and a therapeutic contact lens. Fungal and gram-negative"
		organisms are a growing cause for concern. Further study is needed on optimal
		"prophylaxis regimens, including the use of antifungals, especially for high-risk"
		"eyes, such as those with autoimmune cicatrizing disease."

TI	-	Increasing candidaemia incidence from 2004 to 2015 with a shift in epidemiology
		in patients preexposed to antifungals.
PG	-	127-133
LID	-	10.1111/myc.12714 [doi]
AB	-	Candidaemia is an important health problem in immunocompromised patients with an
		"epidemiology varying with region, period and patient population involved. The"
		occurrence of candidaemia and the associated species distribution over a 12-year
		period at a large tertiary care centre in Belgium were analysed. The trend in
		incidence in the intensive care units (ICUs) and non-ICUs was investigated as
		well as the influence of antifungal exposure on the species distribution. From
		"2004 until 2015, 865 candidaemia episodes occurred in 826 patients at the"
		University Hospitals Leuven. Candida albicans (59%) remained the most important
		"cause of candidaemia, followed by C. glabrata (22.4%) and C. parapsilosis (8%)."
		The mean incidence in the whole hospital was 1.48 per 10 000 patient days (PD).
		The incidence in ICUs increased reaching up to 10.7 per 10 000 PD whereas in the
		"non-ICUs, the incidence decreased. Prior exposure to fluconazole and"
		echinocandins was associated with candidaemia caused by less susceptible species.
		"Candidaemia incidence increased in the whole hospital, driven by ICUs."
		Surveillance of candidaemia epidemiology on a local scale is of high value to
		guide empirical treatment strategies.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Oral candidiasis (OC) is a common opportunistic infection in
		immunocompromised patients. Species identification is sometimes important for
		treatment. objective: to determine the prevalence of different Candida species
		colonising or infecting the oral mucosa (OM) of diabetic (DM) and non-diabetic
		"(non-DM) chronic kidney disease patients, comparing both groups and exploring"
		potential risk factors. METHODS: 56 DM and 80 non-DM patients on chronic dialysis
		were examined. OM swabs were cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar plates. Candida
		species were identified with API® galleries. OC was confirmed by exfoliative
		"cytology. Statistical associations were analysed using χ2, Fisher's exact test"
		"(ET), and multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: Candida prevalence was 43.4%:"
		"53.6% DM and 36.3% non-DM, (p=.045). The species identified were C. albicans"
		"74.6%, C. glabrata 22.0%, C. tropicalis 15.2%, C. parapsilosis 3.4 %, C. kefyr"
		3.4% and C. famata 1.7% without difference between groups. DM patients had a
		higher xerostomia prevalence (p=.002) and lower salivary flow (p=.008) and lower
		"serum albumin (p=.018). 16.9% of patients had OC, 23.2% DM compared with 12.5%"
		"non-DM, (p=.101). The following were associated with the presence of Candida in"
		"the OM: the use of dental prostheses (odds ratio [OR] 25.6, 95% confidence"
		"interval [CI] 2.5 to 253, P=.001), xerostomia (OR 9.6, 95% CI 2.4 to 38.1,"
		"P=.001) and low serum albumin values (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.98, P=.044)."
		CONCLUSIONS: The presence of Candida sp. in the OM was associated with dental
		"prostheses, xerostomia and low serum albumin."

AB	-	BACKGROUND: The virulence of isolates among different Candida species causing
		"candidemia may play a role in the prognosis of the patients. Furthermore, the"
		potential relationship between genotype and virulence is still unclear and need
		to be further studied. AIMS: We aim to assess the relationship between genotype
		and virulence in Candida species using a Galleria mellonella larvae infection
		model. METHODS: One hundred and ninety-four isolates from 68 clusters (Candida
		"albicans, 114/41; Candida parapsilosis, 74/24; Candida tropicalis, 6/3) were"
		compared against the same number of each species singleton genotypes in terms of
		survival of G. mellonella larvae. RESULTS: The median of survival and the IQR
		"ranges of clusters and singleton were as follows: C. albicans (2 days, IQR 1.5-2"
		"vs. 2 days, IQR 1-2.25), C. parapsilosis (2 days, IQR 1.5-2.6 vs. 2 days, IQR"
		"2-3.3), and C. tropicalis (1 day, IQR 1-3.5 vs. 2 days, IQR 2-3.5; p<0.05). High"
		intra-cluster variability in terms of median of survival was found regardless the
		species. CONCLUSIONS: No relationship between genotype and virulence in Candida
		was observed with the G. mellonella model.

		"joint is rare. Local symptoms of Candida infections in the knee are atypical,"
		"rarely associated with systemic symptoms, and difficult to distinguish from other"
		types of knee arthritis. We here report a special case of C. parapsilosis
		infections in the knee joint. A patient had previously undergone knee puncture in
		a private clinic for the treatment of osteoarthritis and developed a left knee
		"joint infection with C. parapsilosis. However, the patient only showed more"
		"severe local knee symptoms, and there was no systemic manifestation associated"
		"with any Candida infection. Surprisingly, after receiving ozone lavage, the"
		patient showed symptoms of a systemic infection such as fever and chills. There
		"was no positive finding in the blood cultures. Finally, the synovial fluid"
		cultures showed a C. parapsilosis infections. After antifungal treatment and
		"another knee ozone therapy, the patient did not experience recurrence of the"
		"infections. It is suggested that in this special case, the strong sterilization"
		"with ozone caused the destruction of C. parapsilosis, leading to a transient"
		"systemic toxin reaction. In addition, we reviewed the 17 cases of C. parapsilosis"
		infections that have been reported thus far.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candida parapsilosis is an important species in the genus Candida
		that plays a significant role in hospitalized patients with nosocomial
		"infections. In patients with HIV infection or AIDS, central nervous system"
		involvement by Candida species is exceptional. CASE REPORT: Here we report a case
		of an acute meningoencephalitis due to C. parapsilosis in an adult patient with
		"AIDS. We describe the clinical manifestations, the diagnosis methods, antifungal"
		therapy and outcome. CONCLUSIONS: C. parapsilosis is uncommonly reported as a
		cause of meningitis in AIDS patients. A higher index of suspicion and culture is
		necessary to confirm the diagnosis of candidal meningoencephalitis.

AB	-	Candida parapsilosis is an uncommon cause of invasive endocarditis. This pathogen
		induces severe complications and carries a high mortality rate. We describe a
		case of C. parapsilosis endocarditis in a 54-year-old man with a history of HIV
		and Hepatitis C infection who previously underwent prosthetic valve replacement
		due to bacterial endocarditis. The patient presented with prolonged febrile
		episodes and fungemia with repeat blood cultures positive for C. parapsilosis.
		The patient failed multiple regimens of antifungal therapy and the C.
		parapsilosis isolate progressively acquired resistance to a number of drugs. Due
		"to the multidrug resistant nature of the isolate, replacement of the infected"
		"valve was required to resolve his fungemia, and the patient remained asymptomatic"
		for two years. This case is unusual due to the multidrug resistant nature of the
		isolate requiring both combined medical and surgical intervention. A review of
		published reports indicates that endocarditis due to C. parapsilosis responds
		well to a combination of medical and surgical interventions; the latter is
		particularly suitable for immunocompromised hosts.

AB	-	An increasing number of outbreaks due to resistant non-albicans Candida species
		"have been reported worldwide. Between 2014 and 2016, Candida isolates causing"
		invasive candidiasis were recovered in a Mexican hospital. Isolates were
		identified to species level and antifungal susceptibility was determined. In the
		"time period studied, 74 invasive candidiasis cases were identified, with 38%"
		"(28/74) caused by Candida parapsilosis, out of which 54% (15/28) were fluconazole"
		resistant. The ERG11 gene was sequenced for 12 recoverable fluconazole-resistant
		C. parapsilosis isolates and SNPs identified. The 12 isolates had one common
		silent point mutation in ERG11 (T591C) and seven isolates had an additional
		"(A395T) mutation, which corresponded to Y132F. Four of the isolates carrying this"
		mutation were closely related within the same cluster by microsatellite typing.
		This is the first report of an invasive candidiasis outbreak in Mexico due to
		azole-resistant C. parapsilosis associated with the Y132F substitution.

AB	-	"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the incidence, risk factors, causative fungi, and"
		"outcomes of fungemia in adult, non-HIV-infected patients. DESIGN: We studied 147"
		episodes of fungemia due to Candida spp and Trichosporon spp in adult patients
		admitted to a university hospital in Northeast Thailand between 1999 and 2003.
		"RESULTS: The overall incidence of fungemia was 14.1 per 10,000 hospital"
		"admissions. Candida was the most common isolate (138 episodes, 93.9%) with"
		non-albicans Candida accounting for 68.7%. The major non-albicans Candida
		isolates were Candida parapsilosis and Candida tropicalis. Fungemia caused by
		"Trichosporon accounted for 6.1% of the cases, but their clinical features could"
		not be distinguished from fungemia due to Candida. The overall in-hospital
		mortality rate was 56.1%. The independent factors related to mortality were high
		"APACHE II score (odds ratio (OR) 1.12 per 1-point increments, 95% confidence"
		"interval (CI) 1.03-1.23), assisted ventilation (OR 3.49, 95% CI 1.04-11.64), and"

		"that caused by non-albicans Candida, was an important nosocomial infection in"
		"this tertiary care hospital in Northeast Thailand. The mortality rate was high,"
		particularly in patients who were critically ill. Rapid diagnosis and early
		treatment are therefore important challenges for improving clinical outcomes.

TI	-	An outbreak of candidemia due to Candida parapsilosis in an adult intensive care
		unit.
PG	-	403-409
AB	-	Candida spp. is one of the most common causes of nosocomial bloodstream
		"infections, and Candida parapsilosis is an emerging pathogen that is associated"
		with nosocomial outbreaks. We aimed to characterize an outbreak of candidemia due
		to C. parapsilosis in our hospital's adult intensive care unit to investigate the
		clonal relationship of isolates. This is a retrospective study designed to
		investigate an outbreak of C. parapsilosis bloodstream infections (BSIs) which
		developed during an 11-week period from July to October 2012. Thirteen outbreak
		isolates and five isolates from the previous five sporadic cases were included in
		the study. Identification and antifungal susceptibilities of the isolates were
		"determined by using MALDI-TOF MS (VITEK MS, bioMérieux, France) and by Etest"
		"(bioMérieux, France) on RPMI 1640-2% glucose agar (bioMérieux, France) at the"
		Clinical Microbiology Laboratory. Clonal relationships were investigated by
		"repetitive sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR) (DiversiLab, bioMérieux, Marcy L'Étoile,"
		"France). The mean age of the cases, seven of which were female, was 61 years. The"
		"mean Candida score was 3, the mean length of stay in the intensive care unit"
		(ICU) before infection developed was 33 days. A microbiological cure was obtained
		in nine (69.2%) patients with appropriate antifungals and catheter removal. Six
		patients died in a mean of 24 days. All of these isolates were obtained from
		"blood culture, three being also obtained from CVC tips culture. Sixteen isolates"
		"were C. parapsilosis, and two isolates were C. orthopsilosis. All of the isolates"
		"were susceptible to amphotericin B, voriconazole, and caspofungin. Three isolates"
		"were resistant to fluconazole, and two isolates were dose-dependent susceptible"
		"to fluconazole. Out of the 13 outbreak isolates and five previous isolates, 11"
		"and three, respectively, showed the same rep-PCR genotypic profile (genotype 1)."
		"Two isolates were the second same genotypic profile (genotype 2), and two"
		isolates were the third same genotypic profile (genotype 3). The outbreak was
		under control in 11 weeks. The sporadic cases occurred in a subsequent
		three-month period. Our study shows that if C. parapsilosis isolates are present
		"in a unit, it can become colonized in the unit and can spread clonally and"
		"rapidly, being able to cause a nosocomial outbreak. Moreover, even one isolate of"
		C. parapsilosis in a unit can trigger an outbreak. Molecular typing methods are
		essential in order to illustrate the epidemiology of hospital outbreaks. Early
		detection of outbreaks is crucial for the implementation of infection control
		measures such as disinfection and isolation.

TI	-	"Polymicrobial Keratitis With Cryptococcus curvatus, Candida parapsilosis, and"
		Stenotrophomonas maltophilia After Penetrating Keratoplasty: A Rare Case Report
		With Literature Review.
PG	-	e5-e10
LID	-	10.1097/ICL.0000000000000517 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To report the first case of fungal keratitis caused by Cryptococcus
		curvatus after penetrating keratoplasty (PK) in an immunocompetent patient and to
		describe its therapeutic challenge and long-term outcome. METHODS: An
		interventional case report. RESULTS: A 54-year-old female patient underwent right
		"PK for lattice dystrophy. At 5-year post-PK, she developed a polymicrobial"
		"keratitis caused by Candida parapsilosis, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia at the"
		"peripheral graft, which was successfully treated with topical antibiotic and"
		"antifungal drops. One year later, another fungal keratitis occurred which"
		apparently resolved with antifungal treatment but recurred in an unusual fashion
		and required a repeat PK revealing the diagnosis of C. curvatus keratitis. This
		"was confirmed by microbiological culture on Sabouraud dextrose agar, nuclear"
		ribosomal repeat regional sequencing of the D1-D2 and internal transcribed spacer
		"regions, and histopathological examination. Various topical, intracorneal, and"
		systemic antifungal treatments had been attempted but failed to resolve the
		"infection completely, necessitating a subsequent third PK. A further recurrence"
		"was noted 16-month post-third PK, which was eradicated with multiple topical and"
		"intracorneal antifungal treatment, and direct cryotherapy to the corneal abscess."
		No further recurrence of C. curvatus was noted at 4-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS:
		Cryptococcus curvatus should be added to the known list of organisms capable of
		causing fungal keratitis. Our experience suggests that this type of organism
		"could cause low-grade, grumbling infection, which may however be exceptionally"
		difficult to treat. Long-term eradication of this rare fungal keratitis could be
		"potentially achieved by intensive ocular and systemic antifungal treatment,"
		"repeat therapeutic keratoplasties, and focal cryotherapy."

TI	-	Candida-induced prosthetic joint infection. A literature review including 72
		cases and a case report.
PG	-	81-94
AB	-	BACKGROUND: The clinical and microbiological characteristics of prosthetic joint
		"infection (PJI) caused by Candida species is described, including 72 cases in the"
		literature and a case of Candida glabrata infection handled at the present
		centre. METHODS: We describe one patient and using the key words 'fungal
		prosthetic joint infection' and 'candida prosthetic joint infection' we searched
		"MEDLINE (National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD), Web of Science, CINAHL and"
		Cochrane systematic review databases for case reports of this condition. RESULTS:
		"Out of the 73 patients, 38 were female; mean age at diagnosis was 65.7 (± SD 18)"
		yrs; 50 had risk factors for candidal infection such as systemic disease (e.g.
		"rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus) and/or"
		"immunosuppressive therapy in 18 (24.6%) cases, diabetes mellitus in 14 (19.1%),"
		immunosuppression due to malignant or chronic disease in 24 (32.8%) and long-term
		antibiotic use in four (5.4%) patients. Infection site was the knee in 36
		patients and hip in 35; pain was present in 43 patients and swelling in 23 and
		the mean surgery-diagnosis interval was 32 months. The most frequent species was
		"C. albicans, followed by C. parapsilosis. The diagnosis was obtained from joint"
		fluid aspirate in 33 cases and intra-operative samples in 16. Susceptibility to
		antifungals was tested in only 21 isolates. The most frequently used antifungals
		were fluconazole and amphotericin B. Two-stage exchange arthroplasty was
		performed in 30 patients and resection arthroplasty in 31; 56 patients were cured
		with a combination of medical and surgical treatment; one patient died from the
		infection. CONCLUSION: PJI caused by Candida requires a high index of suspicion;
		surgery with long-term antifungal therapy is recommended.

TI	-	"Prospective observational study of candidemia in São Paulo, Brazil: incidence"
		"rate, epidemiology, and predictors of mortality."
PG	-	570-6
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Studies conducted in tertiary care hospitals of different European
		countries and the United States have shown incidence rates of candidemia ranging
		"from 0.17 to 0.76 and 0.28 to 0.96 per 1,000 admissions, respectively. So far,"
		only 1 study has evaluated the incidence rates of candidemia in tertiary care
		hospitals in Latin American countries. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the epidemiology of
		"candidemia in 4 tertiary care hospitals in São Paulo, Brazil. DESIGN:"
		"Multicenter, laboratory-based surveillance of candidemia. RESULTS: A total of"
		"7,038 episodes of bloodstream infection were identified, and Candida species"
		accounted for 282 cases (4%). The incidence rate of candidemia was 1.66
		"candidemic episodes per 1,000 hospital admissions. Candida albicans was the most"
		"frequently isolated Candida species in all hospitals, but Candida species other"
		"than C. albicans accounted for 62% of isolates, including predominantly Candida"
		parapsilosis and Candida tropicalis. Azole resistance was restricted to only 2%
		of all Candida isolates (1 isolate of Candida glabrata and 4 isolates of Candida
		rugosa). Candidemia was mostly documented in surgical patients with long
		"durations of hospital stay. The crude mortality rate was 61%, and advanced age"
		and high Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score were both
		conditions independently associated with risk of death. CONCLUSIONS: We observed
		in our series a higher incidence rate of candidemia than that reported in
		European countries and the United States. Advanced age and a high Acute
		Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score were factors associated with a
		higher probability of death in candidemic patients. Fluconazole-resistant Candida
		strains are still a rare finding in our case-based study of candidemia.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To identify the main risk factors associated with neonatal candidemia.
		PATIENTS AND METHOD: A retrospective paired case-control study was conducted from
		January 2014 to December 2016. The cases were patients with isolation in blood
		culture and/or cerebrospinal fluid of Candi da spp. after their first 48 hours in
		the hospital and the controls cases were neonates chosen from the statistical
		"census of neonatology paired according to their admission date (30-day range),"
		"birth weight, gestational age, and discharge condition (alive or deceased). For"
		"each case, we select two controls. The risk factors evaluated were intrahospital"
		"stay over seven days, use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, mechanical ventilation,"
		"parenteral nutrition longer than five days, invasive procedures such as central"
		"venous access and abdominal and thoracic surgeries, necrotizing enterocolitis and"
		growth of bacterial microorganisms in blood culture before candidemia. RESULTS:
		"During the study period, 141 patients developed candidemia. 49% of the cases"
		corresponded to Candida parapsilosis with the highest associated lethality rate.
		The multivariate analysis identified as risk factors hospital stay longer than
		"seven days (OR = 17.0, 95% CI = 2.36-122.4), use of umbilical lines (OR = 9.04,"
		"95% CI = 1.55-52.5), abdominal and/or thoracic surgery (OR = 12.4, 95% CI ="
		"1.76-87.3), and treatment with Meropenem (OR = 4.62, 95% CI = 1.34-15.9)."
		CONCLUSION: Prolonged intrahospital stay longer than seven days and thoracic
		and/or abdominal surgery were the most significant risk factors in this study for
		the development of neonatal candidemia.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Neonatal fungemia is associated with adverse neonatal outcomes and
		higher overall healthcare expenditure. Our objective is to review the
		epidemiology of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) in neonates in Canada. METHODS:
		A retrospective cohort study using data collected by the Canadian Neonatal
		"Network (CNN) was conducted. Using a nested matched cohort study design, risk"
		"factors and outcomes of neonates born <33 weeks gestation (n = 39,305) during"
		2003-2013 were compared between neonates diagnosed with an IFI during their stay
		to infection-free controls. RESULTS: Overall incidence of IFI among all admitted
		"neonates was 0.22% (n = 286), while the incidence of IFI in the group of neonates"
		"born <33 weeks gestation was 0.64%. Of the isolates, 170 (59%) had Candida"
		albicans and 59 (21%) had Candida parapsilosis. Risk factors for IFI were lower
		"gestation, male sex, Apgar score <7 at 5 minutes, higher severity of illness"
		"score, maternal diabetes and vaginal birth. Neonates with IFI had higher odds of"
		mortality [adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.60; 95% confidence interval (CI):
		"1.06-2.43], necrotizing enterocolitis (aOR: 2.97; 95% CI: 1.76-5.01) and severe"
		retinopathy of prematurity (aOR: 2.15; 95% CI: 1.26-3.67). CONCLUSIONS: The
		overall incidence of IFI in neonates was low in Canada in comparison to other
		"large population cohort studies; however, the mortality and morbidity remained"
		high.

AB	-	"Incidence, risk factors and clinical significance of late recurrent (LR)"
		candidaemia (>1 month between episodes) remains unclear. The 1219 episodes of
		candidaemia detected from January 1985 to December 2014 were reviewed. We
		selected all cases with more than one episode separated by at least 30 days after
		clinical resolution in the interim (cases) and compared each of them with two
		controls (patients with single episodes of candidaemia). Clinical strains were
		genotyped to differentiate relapses from re-infection. Eighteen patients (1.48%)
		had 36 episodes of LR candidaemia (median 4 months). Independent risk factors for
		recurrence in the multivariate analysis were: underlying gastrointestinal disease
		(OR 67.16; 95% CI 5.23-861.71; p 0.001) and fungaemia due to Candida parapsilosis
		(OR 9.10; 95% 1.33-62.00; p 0.02). All episodes of LR candidaemia diagnosed
		"during the first 3 months were due to an intravascular source of infection,"
		whereas in those occurring after 3 months the main source of the disease was the
		"abdomen, followed by endocarditis, and urinary tract. Molecular typing showed"
		that 42.9% of LR candidaemias were relapses and 57.1% were re-infections. Neither
		time of recurrence nor clinical origin could predict type of recurrence. LR
		candidaemia is a relatively rare event that is more frequent in patients who have
		an initial episode of candidaemia due to C. parapsilosis or an underlying
		gastrointestinal disease. Episodes of LR candidaemia that occur within the first
		3 months should prompt an attempt to exclude an intravascular source of
		"infection, whereas those occurring later point to an intra-abdominal origin."

		care hospitals in Spain.
PG	-	4200-6
LID	-	10.1128/JCM.00920-10 [doi]
AB	-	Candidemia studies have documented geographic differences in rates and
		"epidemiology, underscoring the need for surveillance to monitor trends. We"
		"conducted prospective candidemia surveillance in Spain to assess the incidence,"
		"species distribution, frequency of antifungal resistance, and risk factors for"
		acquiring a Candida infection. Prospective laboratory-based surveillance was
		conducted from June 2008 to June 2009 in 40 medical centers located around the
		country. A case of candidemia was defined as the isolation of a Candida species
		"from a blood culture. Incidence rates were calculated per 1,000 admissions."
		Antifungal susceptibility tests were performed by using broth microdilution assay
		according to the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute.
		"We detected 984 cases, for an overall incidence of 1.09 cases per 1,000"
		admissions. The crude mortality was 20.20%. Candida albicans was the most common
		"species (49.08%), followed by C. parapsilosis (20.73%), C. glabrata (13.61%), and"
		"C. tropicalis (10.77%). Overall, decreased susceptibility to fluconazole occurred"
		"in 69 (7.01%) incident isolates. Antifungal resistance was rare, and a moderate"
		linear correlation between fluconazole and voriconazole MICs was observed. This
		is the largest multicenter candidemia study conducted to date and shows the
		substantial morbidity and mortality of candidemia in Spain.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) occur frequently in intensive
		care units (NICUs). The aim of this study was to analyze the results of
		"surveillance of HAIs in a III level NICU in Naples, Italy during 2013-2017 and to"
		compare with those obtained during 2006-2010. METHODS: The surveillance included
		1265 neonates of all birth weight (BW) classes with > 2 days NICU stay.
		Infections were defined using standard Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
		definitions adapted to neonatal pathology. RESULTS: A total of 125 HAIs were
		registered during 2013-2017 with a frequency of 9.9% and an incidence density of
		3.2 per 1000 patient days. HAIs occurred in all BW classes with a decreasing
		trend from the lowest to the highest BW classes (p = < 0.001). Central
		line-associated blood stream infection (CLABSI) was the most frequent infection
		"(69.6%), followed by ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) (20%), urinary tract"
		"infection (UTI) (8.8%) and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) (1.6%). Also, CLABSI"
		and VAP incidence density decreased from lower to highest BW classes showing a
		significant trend (p = 0.007). Most frequent pathogens responsible for CLABSI
		"were: Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CONS) (25.3%), Candida parapsilosis"
		"(21.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.7), Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae"
		(6.8%). No microbiological diagnosis was achieved for 20.7% of CLABSI.
		"Pseudomonas aeruginosa (28%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (20%), and CONS (20%)"
		were the most frequent pathogens responsible for VAP. CLABSI incidence density
		"showed no differences between 2006 and 2010 and 2013-2017, while VAP incidence"
		density for the 751-100 g BW class was higher during 2006-2010 than during
		2013-2017 (p = 0.006). A higher incidence of the CLABSI caused by Gram positive
		bacteria (p = 0.002) or by undetermined etiology (p = 0.01) was observed during
		"2013-2017 than during 2006-2010, while a significant lower incidence of VAP"
		caused by Gram-negative bacteria was found during 2013-2017 than during 2006-2010
		(p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: HAIs in the NICU developed in all BW classes with a
		decreasing trend from the lowest to the highest BW classes in both study periods.
		Differences in the aetiology of CLABSI and VAP were found between the two study
		periods. This reinforces the importance of HAIs surveillance protocol in the
		"NICU, which monitors microbiological isolates and use of medical devices for all"
		BW classes of neonates.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Blood cultures are approximately 50% sensitive for diagnosing
		invasive candidiasis. The T2Candida nanodiagnostic panel uses T2 magnetic
		resonance and a dedicated instrument to detect Candida directly within whole
		"blood samples. METHODS: Patients with Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida"
		"parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, or Candida krusei candidemia were identified at"
		14 centers using diagnostic blood cultures (dBCs). Follow-up blood samples were
		collected concurrently for testing by T2Candida and companion cultures (cBCs).
		"T2Candida results are reported qualitatively for C. albicans/C. tropicalis, C."
		"glabrata/C. krusei, and C. parapsilosis. T2Candida and cBCs were positive if they"
		detected a species present in the dBC. RESULTS: Median time between collection of
		"dBC and T2Candida/cBC samples in 152 patients was 55.5 hours (range, 16.4-148.4)."
		"T2Candida and cBCs were positive in 45% (69/152) and 24% (36/152) of patients,"
		"respectively (P < .0001). T2Candida clinical sensitivity was 89%, as positive"
		results were obtained in 32/36 patients with positive cBCs. Combined test results
		"were both positive (T2+/cBC+), 21% (32/152); T2+/cBC-, 24% (37/152); T2-/cBC+, 3%"
		"(4/152); and T2-/cBC-, 52% (79/152). Prior antifungal therapy, neutropenia, and"
		C. albicans candidemia were independently associated with T2Candida positivity
		and T2+/cBC- results (P values < .05). CONCLUSIONS: T2Candida was sensitive for
		diagnosing candidemia at the time of positive blood cultures. In patients
		"receiving antifungal therapy, T2Candida identified bloodstream infections that"
		were missed by cBCs. T2Candida may improve care by shortening times to Candida
		"detection and species identification compared to blood cultures, retaining"
		sensitivity during antifungal therapy and rendering active candidemia unlikely if
		results are negative. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: NCT01525095.

PG	-	479-82
AB	-	We report a 77-year-old man who developed Candida parapsilosis infection
		following total knee arthroplasty. Knee joint effusion was noted 2 weeks after
		"surgery, and repeated cultures of aspirated fluid established the diagnosis of"
		Candida parapsilosis infection 4 weeks after surgery. Treatment consisted of
		debridement and lavage of the involved joint together with continuous irrigation
		"with fluconazole for 4 weeks, followed by oral fluconazole for another 6 months."
		"At 3 years follow-up, the patient was doing well and radiological examination of"
		the affected knee showed a firm attachment of the prosthesis. We suggest that
		early identification of the causative organism followed by continuous irrigation
		and use of appropriate antifungal medication may prevent joint instability and
		spares the removal of the prosthesis.

		prospective observational survey in intensive care units.
PG	-	70-78
LID	-	10.1111/myc.12700 [doi]
AB	-	Candida bloodstream infections (BSI) are a significant cause of mortality in
		"intensive care units (ICU), hereof the prospective 12-months (2014-2015)"
		hospital- and laboratory-based survey was performed at the Serbian National
		Reference Medical Mycology Laboratory (NRMML). Candida identification was done by
		a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry
		"and a susceptibility test, according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards"
		"Institute methodology. Among nine centres (265 beds; 10 820 patient admissions),"
		"four neonatal/paediatric (NICU/PICUs) and five adult centres (ICUs) participated,"
		"representing 89 beds and 3446 patient admissions, 166 beds and 7347 patient"
		"admissions respectively. The NRMML received 43 isolates, 17 from NICU/PICUs and"
		"26 from adult ICUs. C. albicans dominated highly in NICU/PICUs (~71%), whereas"
		"C. albicans and C. parapsilosis were equally distributed within adults (46%,"
		"each), both accounting for ~90% of received isolates. The resistance to"
		"itraconazole and flucytosine were 25% and 2.4% respectively. In addition, the 2"
		C. albicans were azole cross-resistant (4.6%). The overall incidence of
		CandidaBSI was ~3.97 cases/1000 patient admissions (4.93 in NICU/PICU and 3.53 in
		"adult ICU). The 30-day mortality was ~37%, most associated with C. tropicalis and"
		C. glabrataBSI. Data from this national survey may contribute to improving the
		Balkan and Mediterranean region epidemiology of CandidaBSI within ICUs.

PG	-	890-5
LID	-	10.3109/00365548.2010.498023 [doi]
AB	-	Candida prosthetic joint infections are considered to be rare. We retrospectively
		studied patients treated for Candida prosthetic infections between 1 January 1995
		"and 31 December 2007 in our infectious diseases department, a tertiary referral"
		"centre. We identified 7 patients, 4 with knee and 3 with hip prosthetic"
		"infections. The most frequent fungal agent was Candida albicans (4 cases),"
		followed by Candida parapsilosis (2 cases) and Candida guillermondii (1 case).
		All the patients received antifungal treatment for a prolonged period. Five
		"patients had their prosthesis removed and 3 had reimplantation, 1 patient was"
		"treated with debridement and prosthetic retention, and the last patient refused"
		"surgery. The mean follow-up time was 2.5 y. At the last evaluation, 3 patients"
		"were considered as cured, 3 patients presented a secondary bacterial infection"
		"leading to amputation for 2 of them, and 1 patient died from heart failure."
		"During Candida prosthetic joint infections, the epidemiological characteristics"
		and the location of the prosthesis are very similar to bacterial prosthetic
		infections. The benchmark antifungal therapies remain amphotericin B and/or
		fluconazole.

		species recovered were: 96 C. albicans; 26 C. glabrata; 18 C. parapsilosis; five
		C. tropicalis; four C. guilliermondii; one C. famata and one C. dubliniensis. We
		separated the data into two periods 2001-2003 and 2004-2006; contrary to the

		frequency of C. albicans and decreasing frequency of non-albicans species over
		"time. Although the proportion of C. albicans, C. parapsilosis and C. tropicalis"
		"isolates susceptible to fluconazole was unchanged over time, a trend of decreased"
		susceptibility of C. glabrata to fluconazole was noted over the six-year period.
		"Overall, 73% and 7.7% of C. glabrata isolates had susceptible-dose-dependent and"
		"resistant phenotypes, respectively. The percentage of C. glabrata isolates"
		susceptible to fluconazole (MIC <8 microg/ml) decreased from 36% in 2001-2003 to
		0% in 2004-2006. Flucytosine resistance was detected in only 4 (2.7%) isolates.
		None of the isolates had an amphotericin B MIC <1 microg/ml. CONCLUSION: A shift
		towards increasing dominance of C. albicans contrasts both with reports from
		other countries and previous data from Northern Ireland. Upwards fluconazole MIC
		drift among C. glabrata has important implications for empirical therapeutic
		decisions.

TI	-	Identification of Candida strains isolated from Tanzanian pregnant women with
		vaginal candidiasis.
PG	-	226-34
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To identify Candida strains isolated from Tanzanian women (13 to 45
		years) with vaginal candidiasis. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. SETTING:
		"Antenatal clinic in Ilala district hospital in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania from March"
		1998 to December 2000. RESULTS: The identities of the 272 isolates tested with
		"API Candida were: Candida albicans 180(66.2%), Candida tropicalis 13(4.7%),"
		"Candida glabrata 20(7.35%), Candida famata 6(2.2%), Candida parapsilosis 6 (2.2%)"
		and Candida lusitaniae one (0.37%). API Candida could not speciate 43 (15.8%)
		"isolates of these; two (0.7%) fell between C. albicans and C. tropicalis,"
		"17(6.25%) C. lusitaniael, C. guilliermondii/C. famata, 14(5.15%) C. krusei, C."
		"inconspicua, and C. norvegensis and nine (3.3%) either C. parapsilosis, C."
		"krusei, C. incospicua or Geotrichum spp. Four (1.5%) isolates had an assimilation"
		"pattern of Trichosporo spp, but were all germ tube positive and had morphological"
		features on cornemeal agar that were consistent with C. albicans. API 20C AUX was
		"used for testing 29 isolates and results showed: 11/29 (37.9%) C. albicans, 1/29"
		"(3.4%) C. tropicalis, 4/29 (13.8%) C. glabrata, 1/29 (3.4%) C. parapsilosis, 1/29"
		"(3.4%) C. famata, 1/29 (3.4%) C. lusitaniae, 1/29 (3.4%) C. colliculosa/C."
		"magnoliae, 5/29(17.2%) C. albicans/ C. tropicals 2/29 (6.8%) C. norvegensis/C."
		"parapsilosis, and 2/29(6.8%) C. kruseil/C. inconspicua. Results of 20 isolates"
		identified by Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPID) technique showed a 95%
		agreement with API Candida and a 100% agreement with API 20C AUX. CONCLUSION:
		Although most (66.3%) of the species isolated from Dar es Salaam women with
		"vaginal candidiasis were C. albicans, a considerable percentage (33.7%) were"
		"non-albicans, mainly C. glabrata, C. krusei and C. tropicalis. The high"
		prevalence of non-albicans Candida spp observed in this population may have
		therapeutic implications.

AB	-	"A 12 month survey of candidaemia in Scotland, UK, in which every Scottish"
		"hospital laboratory submitted all blood isolates of yeasts for identification,"

		"underlying disease involving the abdomen, 78 % had an indwelling intravenous"
		"catheter, 62 % had suffered a bacterial infection within the 2 weeks prior to"
		candidaemia and 37 % had undergone a laparotomy. Candida albicans was the
		"infecting species in 50 % of cases, followed by Candida glabrata (21 %) and"
		Candida parapsilosis (12 %). Seven cases of candidaemia were caused by Candida
		"dubliniensis, which was more prevalent even than Candida lusitaniae and Candida"
		"tropicalis (six cases each). Among C. glabrata isolates, 55 % showed reduced"
		"susceptibility to fluconazole, but azole resistance among other species was"
		extremely low. Multilocus sequence typing showed isolates with high similarity
		"came from different hospitals across the country, and many different types came"
		"from the hospitals that submitted the most isolates, indicating no tendency"
		towards hospital-specific endemic strains. Multiple isolates of C. albicans and
		C. glabrata from individual patients were of the same strain type with single
		"exceptions for each species. The high prevalence of candidaemia in Scotland,"
		"relative to other population-based European studies, and the high level of"
		reduced fluconazole susceptibility of Scottish C. glabrata isolates warrant
		continued future surveillance of invasive Candida infections.

		patients.
PG	-	49-54
AB	-	Yeast strains obtained from blood cultures and catheters from intensive care
		units (ICU) and hospitalised oncology paediatrics were studied. Yeast were the
		"first cause of catheter colonisation (51/627), and the third cause of bloodstream"
		"infection (44/6065). In catheter, the most frequent species were Candida albicans"
		"(34%), C. parapsilosis (27.7%) and C. tropicalis (15%). In blood, C. albicans"
		"(40.8%), C. parapsilosis (26.6%), C. tropicalis (15%). Malassezia furfur and"
		Malassezia sympodialis were isolated from catheters from ICU patients. All
		"isolates were susceptible to amphotericin B, 88.8% to itraconazole and 91.9% to"
		fluconazole. Candida albicans and C. tropicalis strains resistant to fluconazole
		and itraconazol were detected. These results reveal a change in the predominant
		role of C. albicans as cause of candidemia in hospitalised children and the
		emergence of antifungal resistant species. These variations emphasise the
		importance of performing a permanent surveillance to observe and assess them.

AB	-	"Many uncommon Candida spp. (species other than C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, C."
		"glabrata, C. tropicalis, and C. krusei) have been shown to emerge in tertiary"
		care facilities. We aimed to investigate these uncommon candidemia in children.
		Forty-six cases of candidemia caused by uncommon Candida spp. were identified
		during 2003-2015 from a medical center in Taiwan. The most common specie was C.
		"guilliermondii (31.2%), followed by C. lusitaniae (18.8%) and C. metapsilosis"
		(18.8%). These cases were analyzed and compared with 148 episodes of C. albicans
		candidemia. The incidence density of uncommon Candida spp. candidemia and the
		proportion to all candidemia episodes increased substantively during the study
		"period. Prior exposure to azoles was uncommon in the 30 days prior to infection,"
		"but fluconazole resistant strains were significantly more common (n = 19, 41.3%)."
		The increased incidence density of uncommon Candida spp. candidemia was
		associated with increasing use of antifungal agents. No differences in
		"demographics, underlying comorbidities, risk factors, clinical features,"
		"dissemination, and 30-day mortality were found between uncommon Candida spp. and"
		C. albicans candidemia. Patients with uncommon Candida spp. candidemia were more
		likely to require modifications in antifungal treatment and receive echinocandin
		"drugs (43.5% vs 21.6%, p = 0.007). Candidemia caused by uncommon Candida spp. had"
		"poorer response to antifungal treatment, led to longer duration of candidemia"
		"(median 4.0 versus 2.5 days, p = 0.008), and had a higher treatment failure rate"
		"(56.5% vs 38.5%, p = 0.040)."

		PERIOD COVERED: 2012-2016. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: CDC's Emerging Infections
		"Program (EIP), a collaboration among CDC, state health departments, and academic"
		"partners that was established in 1995, was used to conduct active,"
		population-based laboratory surveillance for candidemia in 22 counties in four
		"states (Georgia, Maryland, Oregon, and Tennessee) with a combined population of"
		approximately 8 million persons. Laboratories serving the catchment areas were
		recruited to report candidemia cases to the local EIP program staff. A case was
		defined as a blood culture that was positive for a Candida species collected from
		a surveillance area resident during 2012-2016. Isolates were sent to CDC for
		species confirmation and antifungal susceptibility testing. Any subsequent blood
		cultures with Candida within 30 days of the initial positive culture in the same
		patient were considered part of the same case. Trained surveillance officers
		"collected clinical information from the medical chart for all cases, and isolates"
		were sent to CDC for species confirmation and antifungal susceptibility testing.
		"RESULTS: Across all sites and surveillance years (2012-2016), 3,492 cases of"
		candidemia were identified. The crude candidemia incidence averaged across sites
		"and years during 2012-2016 was 8.7 per 100,000 population; important differences"
		"in incidence were found by site, age group, sex, and race. The crude annual"
		"incidence was the highest in Maryland (14.1 per 100,000 population) and lowest in"
		"Oregon (4.0 per 100,000 population). The crude annual incidence of candidemia was"
		"highest among adults aged ≥65 years (25.5 per 100,000 population) followed by"
		infants aged <1 year (15.8). The crude annual incidence was higher among males
		(9.4) than among females (8.0) and was approximately 2 times greater among blacks
		than among nonblacks (13.7 versus 5.8). Ninety-six percent of cases occurred in
		patients who were hospitalized at the time of or during the week after having a
		positive culture. One third of cases occurred in patients who had undergone a
		"surgical procedure in the 90 days before the candidemia diagnosis, 77% occurred"
		in patients who had received systemic antibiotics in the 14 days before the
		"diagnosis, and 73% occurred in patients who had had a central venous catheter"
		(CVC) in place within 2 days before the diagnosis. Ten percent were in patients
		who had used injection drugs in the past 12 months. The median time from
		admission to candidemia diagnosis was 5 days (interquartile range [IQR]: 0-16
		"days). Among 2,662 cases that were treated in adults aged >18 years, 34% were"
		"treated with fluconazole alone, 30% with echinocandins alone, and 34% with both."
		"The all-cause, in-hospital case-fatality ratio was 25% for any time after"
		admission; the all-cause in-hospital case-fatality ratio was 8% for <48 hours
		after a positive culture for Candida species. Candida albicans accounted for 39%
		"of cases, followed by Candida glabrata (28%) and Candida parapsilosis (15%)."
		"Overall, 7% of isolates were resistant to fluconazole and 1.6% were resistant to"
		"echinocandins, with no clear trends in resistance over the 5-year surveillance"
		"period. INTERPRETATION: Approximately nine out of 100,000 persons developed"
		culture-positive candidemia annually in four U.S. sites. The youngest and oldest
		"persons, men, and blacks had the highest incidences of candidemia. Patients with"
		candidemia identified in the surveillance program had many of the typical risk
		"factors for candidemia, including recent surgery, exposure to broad-spectrum"
		"antibiotics, and presence of a CVC. However, an unexpectedly high proportion of"
		candidemia cases (10%) occurred in patients with a history of injection drug use
		"(IDU), suggesting that IDU has become a common risk factor for candidemia. Deaths"
		"associated with candidemia remain high, with one in four cases resulting in death"
		during hospitalization. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: Active surveillance for candidemia
		yielded important information about the disease incidence and death rate and
		"persons at greatest risk. The surveillance was expanded to nine sites in 2017,"
		which will improve understanding of the geographic variability in candidemia
		incidence and associated clinical and demographic features. This surveillance
		"will help monitor incidence trends, track emergence of resistance and species"
		"distribution, monitor changes in underlying conditions and predisposing factors,"
		"assess trends in antifungal treatment and outcomes, and be helpful for those"
		developing prevention efforts. IDU has emerged as an important risk factor for
		"candidemia, and interventions to prevent invasive fungal infections in this"
		population are needed. Surveillance data documenting that approximately two
		"thirds of candidemia cases were caused by species other than C. albicans, which"
		"are generally associated with greater antifungal resistance than C. albicans, and"
		the presence of substantial fluconazole resistance supports 2016 clinical
		guidelines recommending a switch from fluconazole to echinocandins as the initial
		treatment for candidemia in most patients.

AB	-	In vitro and clinical data were analysed to evaluate the susceptibility profile
		of itraconazole in light of the new cut-off points. The in vitro activity of
		itraconazole was compared with that of eight comparators against 119 Candida
		bloodstream isolates from 2015 to 2018. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs)
		were measured by the colorimetric MICRONAUT-S assay. The content of wells without
		any color change was sub-cultured to measure killing efficacy. No major
		"differences were found against Candida albicans. Itraconazole, posaconazole and"
		amphotericin B were the most active agents against Candida parapsilosis. Of the
		"32 isolates of C. parapsilosis that were resistant to fluconazole, 96.9%, 78.1%"
		"and 93.8% were susceptible to itraconazole, voriconazole and posaconazole,"
		respectively. The ratio of the minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) to the MIC
		of itraconazole was lower than for the other azoles against C. parapsilosis and
		C. glabrata. Itraconazole achieved greater inhibition over-time of the growth of
		C. parapsilosis than fluconazole. Seventy-three critically ill patients who were
		unresponsive to antibiotics received intravenous empirical treatment with
		itraconazole (n = 28) or comparators (n = 45). Case-control matching was
		"conducted for severity, comorbidities, risk factors for candidemia, administered"
		antibiotics and days of antifungal treatment. Breakthrough candidemia was found
		in 3.6% of patients treated with itraconazole and in 32.1% of patients treated
		with comparators (P: 0.020); breakthrough candidemia by C. parapsilosis was found
		"in 3.6% and 28.6% of patients, respectively. Results indicate that itraconazole"
		"retains a valuable susceptibility profile against Candida isolates, particularly"
		C. parapsilosis. This superior profile may explain the clinical efficacy in the
		occurrence of breakthrough candidemia and warrants further clinical
		investigation.

AB	-	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To evaluate an application of fluorescence in situ
		hybridization (FISH) for the rapid identification of bacterial and fungal
		pathogens causing endophthalmitis and keratitis and compare time to detection
		with other laboratory methods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Culture-positive isolates
		obtained from vitreous and corneal samples were tested. Organisms tested were
		"Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"
		"Candida albicans, C. glabrata, and C. parapsilosis. Inoculi were prepared to a"
		final concentration between 1 × 10(2) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL to 1 × 10(8)
		CFU/mL. Samples were hybridized with peptide nucleic acid probes for pathogens
		"using the QuickFISH protocol (AdvanDx; OpGen, Gaithersburg, MD), and the slides"
		"were read with fluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: Of the 29 total isolates tested,"
		28 yielded positive identification. S. aureus was identified in four out of five
		"vitreous samples, whereas coagulase-negative staphylococci were identified in all"
		vitreous samples. Mixed staphylococci culture was identified in all samples. P.
		"aeruginosa was identified in all six keratitis samples. C. albicans, C. glabrata,"
		"C. parapsilosis, and mixed fungal culture were identified respectively in eight"
		of eight samples at minimal concentration of 1 × 10(4) CFU/mL. There were no
		false-negatives. Time to detection was 20 minutes after the 12- to 18-hour
		inoculation period and provided an identification 6 hours sooner than by
		polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and 1 to 2 days sooner than by routine culture.
		"CONCLUSIONS: This small study demonstrates the sensitive, specific, and rapid"
		"detection of gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria and fungi using FISH"
		probes in isolates from endophthalmitis and keratitis samples. This method
		decreases time to identification and reduces labor intensity compared with
		routine PCR and culture methods. [Ophthalmic Surg Lasers Imaging Retina.

PG	-	224-9
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candida spp. are increasingly important hospital-acquired pathogens
		in neonatal intensive care units (NICU) and cause considerable mortality in
		preterm infants. Most studies have been limited to a single institution. The aim
		of this study was to determine the epidemiology of candidemia in all Barcelona
		NICUs. METHODS: We conducted prospective population-based surveillance for
		"candidemia in Barcelona, Spain, during 2002-2003. This report focuses on the"
		"results from 5 participating hospitals with NICUs. RESULTS: We detected 24 cases,"
		"resulting in an annual incidence of 32.6 cases per 100,000 live births and 1.1"
		"cases per 100 NICU discharges. Median gestational age was 27.5 weeks (range,"
		"24-40.5), and there were 21 cases among very low birth weight infants. Among the"
		"20 (83%) cases evaluated for the presence of end organ infection, endophthalmitis"
		"occurred in 2 cases, and endocarditis, meningitis and peritonitis occurred in 1"
		case each. Candida parapsilosis was the most frequent species isolated (67%). All
		isolates were fluconazole-susceptible. Crude mortality was 21%. CONCLUSIONS: The
		preponderance of C. parapsilosis candidemias observed in Barcelona NICUs is
		similar to reports from the literature. Morbidity and mortality associated with
		neonatal candidemia remain high.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candida parapsilosis is an emerging non-albicans Candida that is
		associated with central line-associated infection. C. parapsilosis has higher
		"minimal inhibitory concentration to echinocandin than Candida albicans, and the"
		"effects of echinocandin on C. parapsilosis are ambiguous. Therefore, in this"
		"study, we aimed to investigate the susceptibility and the correlation between"
		incidence and drug consumption. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted
		in a tertiary teaching hospital in northern Taiwan between 2008 and 2012. The
		"Candida species distribution, the correlation between the use of antifungal"
		"agents and the incidence of C. parapsilosis bloodstream infection, demographic"
		"information, clinical characteristics, mortality rate, and in vitro"
		susceptibility of C. parapsilosis were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 77 episodes
		from 77 patients were included for analysis. The overall 90-day mortality rate
		was 41.6%. The incidence of C. parapsilosis bloodstream infection showed a
		moderate positive correlation with the increased defined daily dose of
		echinocandin. The risk factors associated with mortality included malignancy or a
		metastatic tumor. Multivariate logistical regression analysis showed that
		patients with malignancy had higher odds ratios in terms of mortality. The rate
		"of C. parapsilosis resistance to fluconazole was 3%, whereas the susceptibility"
		rate was 95.5%. CONCLUSION: Underlying comorbidity and malignancy were factors
		leading to death in patients with C. parapsilosis bloodstream infection. Catheter
		removal did not influence the mortality rate. The survival rate of patients

TI	-	Population Pharmacokinetic Model and Pharmacokinetic Target Attainment of
		Micafungin in Intensive Care Unit Patients.
PG	-	1197-1206
LID	-	10.1007/s40262-017-0509-5 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To study the pharmacokinetics of micafungin in intensive care patients
		and assess pharmacokinetic (PK) target attainment for various dosing strategies.
		METHODS: Micafungin PK data from 20 intensive care unit patients were available.
		A population-PK model was developed. Various dosing regimens were simulated:
		licensed regimens (I) 100 mg daily; (II) 100 mg daily with 200 mg from day 5; and
		adapted regimens 200 mg on day 1 followed by (III) 100 mg daily; (IV) 150 mg
		daily; and (V) 200 mg daily. Target attainment based on a clinical PK target for
		Candida as well as non-Candida parapsilosis infections was assessed for relevant
		minimum inhibitory concentrations [MICs] (Clinical and Laboratory Standards
		Institute). Parameter uncertainty was taken into account in simulations. RESULTS:
		A two-compartment model best fitted the data. Clearance was 1.10 (root square
		error 8%) L/h and V (1) and V (2) were 17.6 (root square error 14%) and 3.63
		"(root square error 8%) L, respectively. Median area under the concentration-time"
		curve over 24 h (interquartile range) on day 14 for regimens I-V were 91
		"(67-122), 183 (135-244), 91 (67-122), 137 (101-183) and 183 (135-244) mg h/L,"
		"respectively, for a typical patient of 70 kg. For the MIC/area under the"
		"concentration-time curve >3000 target (all Candida spp.), PK target attainment"
		was >91% on day 14 (MIC 0.016 mg/L epidemiological cut-off) for all of the dosing
		"regimens but decreased to (I) 44%, (II) 91%, (III) 44%, (IV) 78% and (V) 91% for"
		MIC 0.032 mg/L. For the MIC/area under the concentration-time curve >5000 target
		"(non-C. parapsilosis spp.), PK target attainment varied between 62 and 96% on day"
		14 for MIC 0.016. CONCLUSIONS: The licensed micafungin maintenance dose results
		in adequate exposure based on our simulations with a clinical PK target for
		Candida infections but only 62% of patients reach the target for non-C.
		"parapsilosis. In the case of pathogens with an attenuated micafungin MIC,"
		patients may benefit from dose escalation to 200 mg daily. This encourages future
		study.

TI	-	Candidaemia in a tertiary care academic hospital in Italy. The impact of C.
		parapsilosis complex on the species distribution and antifungal susceptibility.
PG	-	990-998
LID	-	10.1099/jmm.0.000505 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: To analyse the species distribution and the susceptibility profiles to
		the major antifungal agents of Candida isolated from bloodstream infections
		(BSIs) in both intensive care units (ICUs) and non-ICU wards in a tertiary care
		hospital in Italy from 2010 until 2015. METHODOLOGY: Episodes of Candida BSI were
		recorded in a retrospective observational cohort study. Yeasts were isolated from
		both blood and intravascuIar devices (IVDs) and their susceptibility to
		antifungal drugs was tested using the microdilution method. RESULTS: 514 Candida
		BSIs were evidenced and 19 % of these episodes were associated with the presence
		of an IVD. The trend of the general incidence increased significantly throughout
		"the study period, ranging from 1.42 to 3.63 (mean 2.52) episodes/1000 admissions."
		The incidence of Candida BSIs and IVD-associated candidaemia was significantly
		higher in ICUs relative to the other wards. The most frequently isolated species
		"were C. albicans and C. parapsilosis complex, with the latter presenting a"
		significant increased trend of isolation. C. parapsilosis complex was most
		"frequently involved in IVD-related candidaemia, coinfections and late recurrent"
		"infections. Furthermore, the MIC50s of C. parapsilosis complex were significantly"
		enhanced for echinocandins compared to the MIC50s for the same drugs and the
		"other yeasts, while the MIC50s of C. albicans for amphotericin B showed a"
		"significant increase during the study period, ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 µg ml-1."
		"CONCLUSIONS: A progressively enhanced incidence of Candida BSIs, a relatively"
		high impact of C. parapsilosis complex and changes in the susceptibility profiles
		of the isolated yeasts were evidenced during the observation period.

		causative agents.
PG	-	918-923
LID	-	10.1099/jmm.0.000985 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: To elucidate the clinical and microbial epidemiology of otomycosis in
		"Isfahan, Iran. METHODOLOGY: From January 2016 to January 2017 all patients"
		"clinically suspected of otomycosis at Al-Zahra Hospital, Isfahan, Iran were"
		recruited. Specimens were taken using sterile swabs by an otorhinolaryngologist
		and subjected to culture and microscopy using potassium hydroxide and Giemsa
		stain. Isolated fungi were identified based on morphological and molecular
		characteristics. RESULTS: Otomycosis was confirmed in 97/120 patients (80.8 %).
		Females (72.2 %) and patients aged 30-39 years (33 %) were more commonly affected
		than others. Manipulation of ear canal (62.9 %) was the most common predisposing
		factor. Pruritus was observed in 84.54  % of the patients followed by hearing
		"impairment (81.4 %), and most episodes were detected over the summer (50.5 %)."
		Culture was positive for 81 (83.5  %) of confirmed cases and molds were the most
		"prevalent causative agents (n=51, 63 %) followed by yeasts (n=19, 23.4 %) and"
		"yeast/mold mixes (n=11, 13.6 %). For the 16 remaining patients, no growth was"
		"seen in culture despite a positive result on direct examination. In total, 92"
		isolates (63 molds and 29 yeasts) were recovered in culture. Application of
		molecular methods showed 18 fungal species and the vast majority of them belonged
		"to Aspergillus (n=53, 57.6 %) and Candida genus. Among the species involved,"
		"Candida parapsilosis (n=22, 22.7 %) and Aspergillus tubingensis (n=15, 15.5 %)"
		were the most encountered species. CONCLUSION: Outcomes from this study showed a
		"different picture of prevalence, where C. parapsilosis and A. tubingensis but not"
		Aspergillus niger were the most species encountered from patients suffering from
		otomycosis.

		Literature 1954-2013.
PG	-	111-6

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Yeast with pseudohyphae or those that have been phagocytized by white
		blood cells are coincidentally found in peripheral blood smears. The clinical
		diagnostic value and outcome of candidaemia diagnosed from peripheral blood
		smears (CPBSs) are unclear. CASE PRESENTATION: A 45-year-old man with diabetes
		and panhypopituitarism for 20 years received 10 mg of hydrocortisone and 100 μg
		of levothyroxine sodium hydrate daily. He has been admitted seven times because
		of adrenal failure triggered by infections and was admitted for pneumonia. On day
		"56, some budding yeast was found microscopically in a peripheral blood smear with"
		May-Giemsa staining. Some of them were phagocytized by white blood cells. The two
		blood cultures yielded Candida parapsilosis. Despite antifungal treatment and
		"removal of an intravenous catheter, on day 98 (42 days after the candidaemia"
		"diagnosis), the patient died. CONCLUSION: We analysed 36 cases including the"
		"present case. Almost all CPBS patients (96.5 %, n = 29) were using an intravenous"
		"catheter. The most frequently isolated species was C. parapsilosis (35.1 %),"
		followed by C. albicans (29.7 %). The overall mortality rate was 53.6 % (n = 28).
		The time from the discovery of yeast-like pathogens using peripheral blood smears
		to death ranged from a few hours to 93 days (median 19 days). The present results
		suggest that intravenous catheter use and the underlying conditions of patients
		are responsible for CPBSs. The detection of yeast in peripheral blood smears
		"suggests advanced infections with uncontrollable complications, which means a"
		poor prognosis. Rapid detection methods besides blood culture are needed.

TI	-	Fungal eye disease at a tertiary care center: the utility of routine inpatient
		consultation.
PG	-	1671-6
LID	-	10.1016/j.ophtha.2011.01.038 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: Hematogenous dissemination of fungus of the eyes can manifest as
		chorioretinitis or endophthalmitis. Early reports of this condition describe the
		"prevalence to range from 10% to 40%; however, more recent studies have suggested"
		"a declining prevalence, presumably because of widespread use of prophylactic"
		antifungal therapy and earlier diagnosis and treatment of systemic illness before
		ocular symptoms become apparent. This study estimates the current prevalence and
		microbial profile of fungal chorioretinitis and endophthalmitis among patients
		with positive fungal cultures at a tertiary care medical center. DESIGN:
		Retrospective case series. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 211 adult and pediatric
		inpatients with fungemia. METHODS: All inpatient consultations at our institution
		"to evaluate for ocular involvement by fungal organisms from June 3, 2006, to"
		"September 3, 2009, were reviewed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The presence or absence"
		of ocular lesions consistent with disseminated fungus. RESULTS: A total of 211
		"patients (83 pediatric, 128 adult) had consult requests indicating concern for"
		ocular fungal infection. More than 97% of these patients had at least 1 positive
		"fungal culture. In decreasing order of frequency, the organisms identified were"
		"Candida albicans, C. parapsilosis, C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, and others. More"
		than 98% of all patients were receiving systemic antifungal therapy (average
		duration 6.5 days) at the time of examination. No pediatric patients and only 2
		"adult patients had positive findings (i.e., chorioretinitis or endophthalmitis);"
		1 of these 2 patients was able to verbalize symptoms and reported floaters and
		"blurring, whereas the other patient was unable to verbalize. Visual symptoms were"
		rare (3.5%) among patients with negative findings who could verbalize visual
		symptoms. Three adults had nonspecific fundus lesions that were considered
		inconsistent with chorioretinitis. CONCLUSIONS: Disseminated ocular fungal
		infection is rare in the current era of widespread prophylactic antifungal
		therapy. Less than 1% of patients in our study had ocular involvement from
		"fungus, and no patients who were asymptomatic had involvement. We suggest that"
		routine ophthalmic consultation on fungemic inpatients is not an efficient use of
		"clinical resources; however, validation of these findings via a prospective study"
		is desired. FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE(S): The author(s) have no proprietary or
		commercial interest in any materials discussed in this article.

AB	-	Candidemia is a common invasive fungal infection with a high mortality rate. We
		performed a retrospective audit of candidemia at a tertiary centre in Western
		"Australia, 2005-2014. There were 167 episodes of candidemia due to 173 isolates"
		"of Candida. Candida albicans (40.5%), Candida glabrata complex (30.6%), Candida"
		parapsilosis complex (14.4%) were the most common species causing candidemia
		"across the study. Of the tested isolates, 17.7% (11/62) were non-susceptible to"
		fluconazole and 13.6% (9/66) non-susceptible to caspofungin. 22.8% (8/35) C.
		glabrata complex were fluconazole resistant and 17.1% (6/35) were non-susceptible
		to caspofungin. Candida glabrata complex was more common in the latter time
		"period, but there were no susceptibility changes over time. In our setting, the"
		"prevalence of C. glabrata complex and antifungal non-susceptibility is high, and"
		the prevalence of C. glabrata complex is increasing.

PG	-	F429-33
LID	-	10.1136/adc.2008.157123 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: The value of antifungal prophylaxis depends partly on the incidence
		of neonatal fungal infection. We compared the incidence of fungal infection in
		babies in neonatal units which do and do not give antifungal prophylaxis using
		"oral nystatin. METHODS: Prospective, multi-centre surveillance study from 1993 to"
		"2006 of invasive fungal infection, defined as positive blood or cerebrospinal"
		"fluid culture, in babies <1500 g birth weight in neonatal units in Australia and"
		New Zealand. RESULTS: There were 118 episodes of invasive fungal infection in 14
		"778 babies <1500 g, an incidence of 0.80% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to"
		"0.94%). All infections were due to Candida species, mostly C. albicans (74,"
		"62.7%) and C. parapsilosis (39, 33.1%). The mortality was 16.5%. The incidence"
		was 0.54% (0.38 to 0.70%) for babies <1500 g in units using selective or
		universal oral nystatin prophylaxis and 1.23% (0.84 to 1.62%) in units using no
		prophylaxis (p<0.001). The incidence of infection in babies <1000 g was 1.78%
		(106/5948) (95% CI 1.44 to 2.12%). The incidence was 1.23% (0.92 to 1.54%) for
		babies <1000 g in units using nystatin prophylaxis and 2.67% (1.97 to 3.37%) in
		units using no prophylaxis (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of neonatal
		"fungal infection was low in Australia and New Zealand, even without antifungal"
		prophylaxis. Antifungal prophylaxis with oral nystatin was associated with a
		significantly lower incidence of fungal infection compared with no prophylaxis.

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to determine the frequency of Candida species in

		diagnosis of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC). STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study of
		"vulvovaginal candidiasis was carried out using laboratory diagnosis, with the"
		estimation of vaginal pH and the direct microscopic and biochemical examination
		of vaginal discharge/secretions. Vaginal cultures for Candida species were
		"collected from 1050 women with vulvovaginal symptoms. RESULTS: Out of 1050 women,"
		"215 (20.47%) were positive for Candida species. Of 215 women, 172 (80%) had pH"
		within the normal range and 167 (77.67%) were showing yeast cells and mycelia on
		"direct microscopic examination. Candida albicans accounted for 46.9% of cases,"
		"Candida glabrata 36.7%, Candida parapsilosis 10.2%, Candida tropicalis 2.8%,"
		"Candida krusei 1.4%, and Candida kiefer 1.9%. The frequency of culture positivity"
		"was related to pregnancy (P<0.001), an increase in parity (P<0.001), and use of"
		oral contraceptives (P<0.001) and antibiotics (P<0.001). The most common signs
		and symptoms in 215 women with positive cultures were pruritus with or without
		vaginal discharge and vaginal erythema. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that
		vulvovaginal candidiasis can only be diagnosed by using clinical criteria in
		correlation with vulvovaginal symptoms and Candida cultures.

		candidiasis in neonates. This study investigates phenotypic and genotypic
		features of C. parapsilosis microbial isolates and underlying clinical conditions
		associated with acquisition of C. parapsilosis in a neonatal intensive care unit
		(NICU) in Italy. METHODS: Identification of C. parapsilosis was performed by
		VITEK® 2 and MALDI TOF and confirmed by analysis of internal transcribed spacer
		ribosomal DNA sequences. Genotyping was performed by PCR fingerprinting.
		Antifungal susceptibility of strains was evaluated by microdilution. A
		case-control study was designed to identify risk factors for C. parapsilosis
		"bloodstream infection. RESULTS: During the study period (April 2009- April 2012),"
		C. parapsilosis was responsible for 6 umbilical catheter and 11 central
		catheter-associated bloodstream infection in 17 neonates in the NICU. Molecular
		typing identified identical fingerprinting profile in all C. parapsilosis
		isolates from neonates. Fifteen of 17 C. parapsilosis isolates were susceptible
		"to all antifungal drugs, two isolates were resistant to fluconazole and"
		"intermediate susceptible to itraconazole. Low birthweight, gestational age and"
		time to exposure to assisted ventilation were risk factors for C. parapsilosis
		infection in neonates in the NICU at univariate and multivariate analysis.
		CONCLUSION: C. parapsilosis bloodstream infections in the NICU were caused by a
		"single epidemic clone. Low birthweight, gestational age and time to exposure to"
		"invasive devices, with predominance of assisted ventilation, were the clinical"
		conditions associated with C. parapsilosis bloodstream infection in the NICU.

PG	-	32-9
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Almost one-third of patients with bloodstream infections with Candida
		species (candidemia) have onset of disease that occurs outside of the hospital or
		"< or = 2 days after hospital admission (i.e., community-onset candidemia). We"
		compared the characteristics of patients who developed candidemia by the timing
		of onset of infection. METHODS: Incident episodes of candidemia were identified
		"through active, population-based surveillance in Connecticut and in Baltimore and"
		"Baltimore County, Maryland, during 1 October 1998-30 September 2000. The"
		molecular subtypes of a sample of 45 Candida parapsilosis isolates were evaluated
		"using Southern blots hybridized with the complex probe Cp3-13. RESULTS: Overall,"
		356 (31%) of the 1143 incident episodes of candidemia were classified as
		"community-onset disease (occurring < or = 2 days after hospital admission), and"
		"132 (37%) were caused by Candida albicans, 89 (25%) were caused by Candida"
		"glabrata, 57 (16%) were caused by C. parapsilosis, and 53 (15%) were caused by"
		Candida tropicalis. Community-onset disease was less likely to be associated with
		"concurrent immunosuppressive therapy, recent surgery, or use of a central venous"
		"catheter, compared with inpatient disease. Among patients with community-onset"
		"disease, the median time from blood culture to initiation of antifungal treatment"
		"was 2.7 days, the 30-day case-fatality rate was 26%, and 262 patients (75%) had"
		been hospitalized at least once in the previous 3 months. Although there were few
		differences between patients with very recent hospitalization (in the previous 1
		"month), less recent hospitalization (previous 1-3 months), and no documented past"
		"hospitalization, C. parapsilosis was more frequently associated with"
		community-onset disease as hospitalization became more distant. C. parapsilosis
		"strains tended to be unique to the patient, with little similarity found between"
		"strain types, on the basis of epidemiologic classification of patients."
		CONCLUSION: We report that community-onset candidemia is common and occurs in
		patients with extensive contact with the health care system. Disease caused by C.
		parapsilosis tends to involve unique strains.

		Reference Center: Epidemiology and associated factors.
PG	-	812-822
LID	-	10.1111/myc.13106 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive fungal disease is a significant cause of morbidity and
		mortality in immunosuppressed children. The recognition of patients at risk for
		candidaemia is paramount to a better prognosis. OBJECTIVES: To characterize
		Candida spp bloodstream infections (BSI) in a reference centre for paediatric
		oncology and to describe the most prevalent risk factors associated with candida
		infections. PATIENTS/METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study carried out
		"with paediatric patients followed up with at the Institute of Pediatric Oncology,"
		"Brazil, who presented positive blood culture for Candida spp from January 2004 to"
		December 2016. RESULTS: Ninety episodes of candidaemia were analysed; patients
		"had a median age of 4.5 years, and 57.8% were males, with a diagnosis of solid"
		tumours in 54.5% of cases. The most common Candida species were C albicans
		"(35.6%), C parapsilosis (30.0%) and C tropicalis (16.7%). C tropicalis BSI was"
		associated with neutropenia and skin lesions. Therapy was successful in 67.1% of
		the episodes. Older age and thrombocytopenia were associated with therapeutic
		failure. Death within 30 days occurred in 24.4% of patients; predictive factors
		were older age and admission to an ICU C parapsilosis candidaemia was a
		protective factor for death when compared to C albicans. CONCLUSION: The main
		"species isolated were C albicans, C parapsilosis and C tropicalis. C tropicalis"
		BSI was associated with neutropenia and skin lesions. The death rate was
		"significant, and a worse prognosis was associated with older age,"
		thrombocytopenia and admission to an ICU C parapsilosis infection proved to be a
		protective factor against mortality.

PG	-	2023-9
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: This study determines whether the spectrum, risk factors, and outcome"
		of invasive candidiasis in liver transplant recipients have changed. METHODS:
		Thirty-five consecutive liver transplant recipients with invasive candidiasis
		"were prospectively studied in a case-controlled, multicenter study. One control"
		was matched with the case for duration of hospitalization and the other for
		antibiotic use so that risk factors unique in liver transplantation could be
		"elicited. RESULTS: In matched-pair analysis, antibiotic prophylaxis for"
		"spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (odds ratio [OR] 8.3, P=0.002), posttransplant"
		"dialysis (OR 7.6, P=0.0009), and retransplantation (OR 16.4, P=0.0018) were"
		independently significant predictors of invasive candidiasis. Candida spp.
		"included C. albicans in 65% of patients, C. glabrata in 21%, C. tropicalis in 9%,"
		"C. parapsilosis in 3%, and C. guilliermondii in 3%. Patients with C. albicans"
		infections were less likely to have received antifungal prophylaxis than those
		"with non-albicans Candida infections (13.6% vs. 50%, P=0.04). The mortality rate"
		"was 36.1% for the cases and 2.8% for the controls (OR 25.0, 95% confidence"
		"interval, 6.2-100.5, P=0.0002). Non-albicans Candida infections (P=0.04) and"
		prior antifungal prophylaxis (P=0.05) correlated with poorer outcome in the
		cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our study has identified predictors for Candida infections in
		the current era that have implications relevant for targeting the prophylaxis
		toward the high-risk patients. Routine use of antifungal prophylaxis warrants
		concern given the emergence of non-albicans Candida spp. as significant pathogens
		after liver transplantation and higher mortality in patients with these
		infections.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Few studies exist on prevalence of fungemia by Candida orthopsilosis,"
		"with variable results. AIMS: To study the incidence, epidemiology and antifungal"
		susceptibility of C. orthopsilosis strains isolated from fungemias over two years
		at a tertiary hospital. METHODS: Candidemia episodes between June 2007 and June
		"2009 in a university hospital (Puerta del Mar, Cádiz, Spain) were studied. The"
		strains initially identified as Candida parapsilosis were genotypically screened
		"for C. parapsilosis sensu stricto, C. orthopsilosis and Candida metapsilosis, and"
		their antifungal susceptibility was evaluated. RESULTS: In this period 52 cases
		of candidemia were documented. Of the 19 strains originally identified as C.
		"parapsilosis, 13 were confirmed as C. parapsilosis sensu stricto and 6 as C."
		"orthopsilosis. Of the 52 isolates, the most frequent species were Candida"
		"albicans (30.8%), C. parapsilosis sensu stricto (25%), C. orthopsilosis, Candida"
		tropicalis and Candida glabrata in equal numbers (11.5%). C. orthopsilosis
		"isolates were susceptible to amphotericin B, caspofungin, voriconazole and"
		"fluconazole, with no significant differences in MIC values with C. parapsilosis"
		sensu stricto. The source of isolates of C. orthopsilosis were neonates (50%) and
		"surgery (50%), and 100% were receiving parenteral nutrition; however C."
		parapsilosis sensu stricto was recovered primarily from patients over 50 years
		(69.2%) and 46.1% were receiving parenteral nutrition. CONCLUSIONS: These
		findings show that C. orthopsilosis should be considered as human pathogenic
		yeast and therefore its accurate identification is important. Despite our small
		sample size our study suggests that a displacement of some epidemiological
		characteristics previously attributed to C. parapsilosis to C. orthopsilosis may
		be possible.

AB	-	PURPOSE: To describe a rare case of early-onset Candida parapsilosis infection
		after laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) and review the published reports of
		post-LASIK fungal infections. METHODS: A 32-year-old woman presented with
		interface infiltration in the central interface in the right eye 2 days after
		"LASIK surgery. The right eye flap was lifted, and the opacities were scraped. Two"
		"days later, a 3- x 3-mm-dense oval opacity and diffuse hazes were noted. Surgical"
		intervention was arranged because of suspicion of interface infectious keratitis.
		RESULTS: After an apparent post-LASIK keratitis with related interface
		"inflammation failed to respond to medical therapy, corneal culture results were"
		positive for C. parapsilosis 2 weeks 6 days after presentation. The patient was
		started on topical drops of amphotericin B 0.15% every hour after the smear
		"showed the presence of yeast. The opacities decreased, and the topical antifungal"
		"drops were tapered. One month later, her uncorrected visual acuity recovered to"
		20/20. CONCLUSIONS: Candida parapsilosis interface keratitis after LASIK may
		occur in the early phase. Early diagnosis and proper treatment can result in good
		outcome.

AB	-	Candidaemia still continues to be a serious medical concern and the epidemiology
		of candidaemia varies according to geographical areas. We aim to determine the
		"incidence, local epidemiology, Candida species distribution and crude mortality"
		rates of candidaemia. We retrospectively evaluated candidaemia episodes in
		"between January 2007 and August 2014. We compared demographic, clinical,"
		microbiological findings and mortality rates of episodes caused by Candida
		albicans and non-albicans Candida species. Overall the candidaemia incidences
		were 1.23 episodes/1000 admissions. A significant negative slope among
		candidaemia episodes and years was determined. Overall C. albicans (54.6%) was
		"the most common species followed by Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis and"
		Candida parapsilosis respectively. Preinfection hospital stay and length of
		hospital stay were statistically longer in patients with non-albicans Candida
		candidaemia than in patients with C. albicans candidaemia. The source of
		candidaemia was unknown in 52.5% of all episodes. Central venous catheters among
		non-albicans Candida candidaemia episodes and urinary system among C. albicans
		candidaemia episodes were common source of candidaemia compared to each other.
		Previous antifungal therapy preceding candidaemia and concomitant bacteraemia
		were significantly associated with non-albicans Candida candidaemia. Continuous
		local surveillance will preserve its pivotal importance in formulating empirical
		antifungal therapy and improving management of candidaemia.

		AIM: To characterize the epidemiological data of candidemia in recent years.
		METHODS: A retrospective study of adult patients in a University Hospital in
		"Santiago, Chile, with 1 or more documented episodes of candidemia, from January"
		2000 to December 2013. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty episodes of candidemia
		"were identified in 120 patients, annual incidence of 0.4 cases per 1000"
		"discharges, 53.3% were male patients, 58.3% > 60 years, 77,5% had at least one"
		"co-morbidity. Candida albicans was the species most frequently identified 55%,"
		"followed by C. glabrata 18.3%, C. tropicalis 11.7% and C. parapsilosis 9.2%."
		"Comparing 2000-2006 vs 2007-2013, increased the frequency of C. parapsilosis"
		among non-albicans and echinocandins prescription. Patients with C. albicans
		"showed higher APACHE-II, more requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation,"
		"greater association with CVC, and shorter incubation time compared with"
		non-albicans species. The 30-day mortality was 31.7%. CONCLUSIONS: During this
		14-years period we observed that C. albicans was the predominant specie and more
		recently a change among C. non-albicans increasing C. parapsilosis and decreasing
		C. glabrata 30-days and attributable mortality decreased together with more
		echinocandins prescription.

AB	-	Invasive candidiasis is a life-threatening infection in patients with
		haematological malignancies. The objective of our study was to determine the
		"incidence, microbiological characteristics and clinical outcome of candidaemia"
		among hospitalized adult patients with haematological malignancies. This is a
		"population-based, prospective, multicentre study of patients ≥ 18 years admitted"
		to haematology and/or haematopoietic stem cell transplantation units of nine
		tertiary care Greek hospitals from January 2009 through to February 2012. Within
		"this cohort, we conducted a nested case-control study to determine the risk"
		factors for candidaemia. Stepwise logistic regression was used to identify
		independent predictors of 28-day mortality. Candidaemia was detected in 40 of
		"27,864 patients with haematological malignancies vs. 967 of 1,158,018"
		non-haematology patients for an incidence of 1.4 cases/1000 admissions vs.
		"0.83/1000 respectively (p <0.001). Candidaemia was caused predominantly (35/40,"
		"87.5%) by non-Candida albicans species, particularly Candida parapsilosis (20/40,"
		50%). In vitro resistance to at least one antifungal agent was observed in 27% of
		Candida isolates. Twenty-one patients (53%) developed breakthrough candidaemia
		"while receiving antifungal agents. Central venous catheters,"
		hypogammaglobulinaemia and a high APACHE II score were independent risk factors
		for the development of candidaemia. Crude mortality at day 28 was greater in
		those with candidaemia than in control cases (18/40 (45%) vs. 9/80 (11%); p
		"<0.0001). In conclusion, despite antifungal prophylaxis, candidaemia is a"
		relatively frequent infection associated with high mortality caused by non-C.
		"albicans spp., especially C. parapsilosis. Central venous catheters and"
		hypogammaglobulinaemia are independent risk factors for candidaemia that provide
		potential targets for improving the outcome.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Data suggests that invasive fungal infections (IFI) might
		complicate COVID-19. Our goal was to describe characteristics of IFI among
		critically ill COVID-19 adults. METHODS: A retrospective observational
		case-series analysis was done between March-July 2020. Consecutive patients with
		"critical COVID-19 were eligible, and have been included when proven or"
		putative/probable IFI could be confirmed during their course. For COVID-19
		"diagnosis, ECDC definitions and WHO severity criteria were followed. Candidaemia"
		was diagnosed according to the ESCMID 2012 guideline. Invasive pulmonary
		"aspergillosis (IPA) was defined following EORTC/MSG, ECMM/ISHAM and modified"
		"AspICU criteria. Outcome variables were rates of IFIs, in-hospital all-cause"
		"mortality, rate and time to negative respiratory SARS-CoV-2 PCR. RESULTS: From 90"
		"eligible patients, 20 (22.2%) fulfilled criteria for IFI. Incidence rate for IFI"
		was 2.02 per 100 patient-days at ICU. Patients were mostly elderly males with
		"significant comorbidities, requiring mechanical ventilation because of ARDS. IFI"
		"could be classified as candidaemia in 7/20 (40%), putative/probable IPA in 16/20"
		"(80.0%). Isolated species of candidaemia episodes were Candida albicans (4/9,"
		"44.4%), Candida glabrata (3/9, 33.3%), Candida parapsilosis (1/9, 11.1%), Candida"
		"metapsilosis (1/9, 11.1%). Mold isolates from lower respiratory tract were"
		"Aspergillus fumigatus, BAL galactomannan positivity was prevalent (16/20, 80.0%)."
		Mortality was 12/20 (60.0%) with a median time to death of 31.0±37.0 (5-89) days.
		Only 9/20 (45.0%) patients reached SARS-CoV-2 PCR negativity after a median time
		of 20.0±12.0 (3-38) days. CONCLUSION: In this small cohort of critically ill
		"COVID-19 adults, morbidity and mortality related to invasive fungal infections"
		proved to be significant.

AB	-	This analysis describes the epidemiology and outcomes of invasive candidiasis
		caused by non-albicans species of Candida in patients enrolled in the Prospective
		Antifungal Therapy Alliance (PATH Alliance) registry from 2004 to 2008. A total
		"of 2,496 patients with non-albicans species of Candida isolates were identified."
		"The identified species were C. glabrata (46.4%), C. parapsilosis (24.7%), C."
		"tropicalis (13.9%), C. krusei (5.5%), C. lusitaniae (1.6%), C. dubliniensis"
		(1.5%) and C. guilliermondii (0.4%); 111 infections involved two or more species
		of Candida (4.4%). Non-albicans species accounted for more than 50% of all cases
		of invasive candidiasis in 15 of the 24 sites (62.5%) that contributed more than
		"one case to the survey. Among solid organ transplant recipients, patients with"
		"non-transplant surgery, and patients with solid tumors, the most prevalent"
		"non-albicans species was C. glabrata at 63.7%, 48.0%, and 53.8%, respectively. In"
		"1,883 patients receiving antifungal therapy on day 3, fluconazole (30.5%) and"
		echinocandins (47.5%) were the most frequently administered monotherapies. Among
		"the 15 reported species, 90-day survival was highest for patients infected with"
		either C. parapsilosis (70.7%) or C. lusitaniae (74.5%) and lowest for patients
		infected with an unknown species (46.7%) or two or more species (53.2%). In
		"conclusion, this study expands the current knowledge of the epidemiology and"
		outcomes of invasive candidiasis caused by non-albicans species of Candida in
		North America. The variability in species distribution in these centers
		underscores the importance of local epidemiology in guiding the selection of
		antifungal therapy.

		candidaemia.
PG	-	352-360
LID	-	10.1111/myc.13049 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candidaemia is a common life-threatening disease among hospitalised
		"patients, but the effect of the Candida biofilm-forming ability on the clinical"
		outcome remains controversial. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to determine the impact of
		"biofilms, specifically focusing on biofilm mass and metabolic activity, on the"
		mortality in candidaemia. PATIENTS/METHODS: The clinical data of patients
		"(n = 127) treated at the University of Debrecen, Clinical Centre, between January"
		"2013 and December 2018, were investigated retrospectively. Biofilm formation was"
		"assessed using the crystal violet and XTT assays, measuring the biofilm mass and"
		"metabolic activity, respectively. Isolates were classified as low, intermediate"
		and high biofilm producers both regarding biofilm mass and metabolic activity.
		"The susceptibility of one-day-old biofilms to fluconazole, amphotericin B,"
		"anidulafungin, caspofungin and micafungin was evaluated and compared to"
		planktonic susceptibility. RESULTS: Intermediate/high biofilm mass was associated
		"with significantly higher mortality (61%). All Candida tropicalis, Candida"
		parapsilosis and Candida glabrata isolates originating from fatal infections were
		"intermediate/high biofilm producers, whereas this ratio was 85% for Candida"
		albicans. Solid malignancy was associated with intermediate/high biofilm
		producers (P = .043). The mortality was significantly higher in infections caused
		by Candida strains producing biofilms with intermediate/high metabolic activity
		"(62% vs. 33%, P = .010). The ratio of concomitant bacteraemia was higher for"
		"isolates forming biofilms with low metabolic activity (53% vs 28%, P = .015)."
		CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that the Candida biofilms especially
		with intermediate/high metabolic activity are related to higher mortality in
		candidaemia.

PG	-	19-28
AB	-	The incidence of nosocomial candidemia increased 27-fold over the past 13 years
		at National Taiwan University Hospital. In order to investigate its predisposing
		"factors, clinical manifestations and prognostic determinants, a prospective"
		observational study of nosocomial candidemia was undertaken at the hospital. From
		"1 May 1994 to 30 April 1995, 118 consecutive adult patients with 120 Candida spp"
		blood isolates were analyzed. Clinical presentations included fever (100%) with a
		"median duration of 3 days, diarrhea within 7 days of candidemia (27.9%) and"
		macronodular skin emboli (7.6%). Laboratory studies showed worsening azotemia
		"(35.6%), elevation of aminotransferase (28.3%), leukocytosis (27.1%) and"
		"thrombocytopenia (23.3%). Use of multiple antibiotics, retained vascular"
		catheters and parenteral nutritional support were the three most common
		predisposing factors for candidemia. C. albicans was the most common isolate
		"(50%), followed by C. tropicalis (20%), C. glabrata (14%), C. parapsilosis"
		"(9.2%). C. guilliermondii (2.5%), and C. Krusei (1.7%). C. tropicalis was more"
		"frequently the cause of candidemia in patients with leukemia and neutropenia,"
		while C. glabrata was more commonly seen in patients receiving fluconazole
		prophylaxis. A severity scoring system adopted from prospective bacteremia
		studies proved to be highly predictive of mortality in candidemic patients. The
		"overall case fatality rate was 70/118 (59.3%), and 51/70 (72.9%) were"
		"attributable to candidemia. In a multivariate analysis, the prognostic factors"
		"adversely influencing outcome were: higher severity scores, no removal of the"
		"catheter, persistent candidemia and lack of antifungal therapy."

		intensive care units (NICU). Prior colonization is a major risk factor for
		"candidemia, but few studies have focused on risk factors for colonization,"
		"particularly in NICU patients. METHODS: A prospective, multicenter cohort study"
		was performed in six NICUs to determine risk factors for Candida colonization.
		Infant gastrointestinal tracts were cultured on admission and weekly until NICU
		discharge and health care worker hands were cultured monthly for Candida spp.
		RESULTS: The prevalence of Candida spp. colonization was 23% (486 of 2157
		"infants); 299 (14%), 151 (7%) and 74 (3%) were colonized with Candida albicans,"
		"Candida parapsilosis and other Candida spp., respectively. Multiple logistic"
		"regression analysis adjusting for length of stay, birth weight < or = 1000 g and"
		gestational age < 32 weeks revealed that use of third generation cephalosporins
		was associated with either C. albicans (155 incident cases) or C. parapsilosis
		(104 incident cases) colonization. Use of central venous catheters or intravenous
		"lipids were risk factors for C. albicans, whereas delivery by cesarean section"
		was protective. Use of H2 blockers was an independent risk factor for C.
		"parapsilosis. Of 2989 cultures from health care workers' hands, 150 (5%) were"
		"positive for C. albicans and 575 (19%) for C. parapsilosis, but carriage rates"
		did not correlate with NICU site-specific rates for infant colonization.
		"CONCLUSIONS: We speculate that NICU patients acquire Candida spp., particularly"
		"C. parapsilosis, from the hands of health care workers. H2 blockers, third"
		generation cephalosporins and delayed enteral feedings alter gastrointestinal
		"tract ecology, thereby facilitating colonization."

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Studies on candidemia occurring among adults in Southern African are
		limited. We aimed to document the epidemiology of candidemia among adults in
		Soweto. METHODS: This was a retrospective hospital-based study in three discrete
		"periods, involving 9 years, from 1990 to 2007. RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty-six"
		patients were identified. Case rates were 2.8 cases/10 000 admissions in
		"1998-2002 and 3.6 episodes/10 000 hospitalizations in 2005-2007. In 1990, Candida"
		"albicans caused 62% and Candida tropicalis caused 23% of episodes. In 2005-2007,"
		"major species were C. albicans (46%), Candida parapsilosis (25%), and Candida"
		"glabrata (23%), with little change compared to 1998-2002. Major predisposing"
		"conditions were abdominal surgery (43%), HIV infection (19% in 2005-2007), trauma"
		"(16%), diabetes mellitus (12%), and cancer (8%). General wards superseded"
		intensive care as the major diagnostic setting in 2005-2007. The crude mortality
		"was 60%. Among 22 HIV-infected patients with a median CD4 cell count of 68/μl,"
		three were of community-onset. C. albicans caused 73% of cases. Five patients had
		another predisposing condition and five had central venous catheters. The
		mortality was 73%. CONCLUSIONS: Soweto has a pattern of Candida species different
		from other continents. HIV infection and trauma were important predisposing
		conditions.

PG	-	153-63
AB	-	A prospective multicenter study was conducted to assess the epidemiology of
		"neonatal invasive candidiasis in Spain. In a total of 20,565 admissions to the 27"
		"participating neonatal units over an 18-month period, systemic candidiasis was"
		diagnosed in 118 (0.57%) neonates. Candida species were isolated from the blood
		"in 79 infants, from the urine in 33, and from the cerebrospinal fluid in 4; in 2"
		"cases, histologic evidence of deep tissue candidiasis was found at autopsy."
		Very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants (< or = 1500 g) showed a significantly
		higher incidence of systemic candidiasis (4.8%) than infants weighing > 1500 g
		(0.2%) ( p < 0.001). Candida albicans was the most frequent species (52.5%)
		"followed by C. parapsilosis (23.7%), and C. tropicalis (7.6%). Only seven infants"
		"were treated with amphotericin B (initial dose 0.18 +/- 0.3 mg/kg, maximal daily"
		dose 1.7 +/- 0.9 mg/kg) but treatment was stopped in three of them (43%) due to
		nephrotoxicity. Liposomal amphotericin B was given to 81 neonates and
		amphotericin B lipid complex to 29. There were no differences in mortality rate
		and in the incidence of adverse effects in relation to treatment with liposomal
		amphotericin B or amphotericin B lipid complex. The mortality rate was 10.2% and
		all deaths occurred in the VLBW cohort with candidemia.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Mexican diabetic population frequently presents mycosis under foot
		"hyperkeratosis; however, in another type of onychomycosis as the ones that is"
		"assumed Candida albicans is the causal agent, it is unknown the frequency, the"
		prevalence and if another Candida species or other yeasts are found. OBJECTIVE:
		Evaluate the frequency of yeasts causing onychomycosis in diabetic patients
		"looked after in public institutions of health of the State of Hidalgo, Mexico,"
		and its association with clinical epidemiological variables. MATERIALS AND
		"METHODS: An observational, descriptive and transversal study was made on 261"
		"patients, from which one nail sample of each one was obtained, used to isolate"
		and identify dermatophytes and yeasts; the results were statistically correlated
		with 24 epidemiological parameters. The clinical study was done through
		interrogation and by medical exploration in order to evaluate Tinea pedis and
		"onychomycosis. RESULTS: Onychomycosis were caused by Candida guilliermondii,"
		"Candida parapsilosis, Candida glabrata, Candida krusei, Candida spp., Kodamaea"
		"ohmeri, Prototheca wickerhamii and unidentified yeasts. The prevalence for"
		"general onychomycosis, by dermatophytes, mixed onychomycosis and by yeasts were:"
		"24.1, 19.5, 2.3 and 14.6%, respectively. Patients with significant probability to"
		be diagnosed as having onychomycosis by yeasts are those wearing open shoes
		(2.59%); technicians and professionals (10.49%) and alcohol drinkers (3.72%).
		CONCLUSION: The fact that Candida albicans is not present in this study as causal
		"agent of onychomycosis, and emerging and non-common yeasts were indeed isolated,"
		creates new challenges. It is remarked the clinical criterion that when
		"onychomycosis is suspected in diabetics, the diagnosis for culturing"
		dermatophytes and yeasts should be included.

		"culture lead to delay diagnose of neonatal infection. Serum (1,3)-β-D-glucan"
		"(BDG) performs well in adult IC, but its use in neonatal IC is unclear. We"
		"evaluated the use of BDG, procalcitonin (PCT), high-sensitive C-reactive protein"
		(hsCRP) or platelet count (PC) in neonatal IC. METHODS: We collected the data of
		"neonates admitted to our institute. Eighty neonates were enrolled, and divided"
		"into IC group, bacterial infection (BI) group and control (CTRL) group. We"
		"analyzed the difference of these indicators between groups, and generated"
		Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve. The value of BDG in antifungal
		therapy efficacy assessment was also investigated. RESULTS: The BDG level was
		higher in IC group compared with BI and CTRL group. C. albicans lead to
		significant increase of BDG compared with C. parapsilosis. IC group had highest
		hsCRP level and lowest PC. PCT level was similar between groups. ROC showed that
		"BDG or hsCRP performs well in neonatal IC, the optimal cut-off for BDG was"
		"13.69 mg/ml. Combined BDG with hsCRP, PCT and PC increased diagnostic value."
		Serum BDG level was decreased during antifungal treatment. CONCLUSION: Serum BDG
		performs well in identification of neonatal IC and in monitoring the antifungal
		therapy efficacy.

		"Arabian hospital, 1996-2004."
PG	-	239-44
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate the Candida species and
		the change over time in the organisms causing candidemia at Saudi Aramco Medical
		Services Organization in Saudi Arabia. We also describe the risk factors
		associated with mortality. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of candidemia
		over nine years (1996-2004). RESULTS: A total of 98 distinct episodes of
		candidemia were identified over the study period. The annual incidence of
		candidemia ranged between 0.2 and 0.76 cases/1000 hospital discharges with an
		incidence per 10 000 patient-days per year of 0.45 to 1.6. The most frequent
		"Candida species were Candida albicans (53%), Candida tropicalis (19%), Candida"
		"parapsilosis (16%), and Candida glabrata (7%). In relation to predisposing"
		"factors, 83% of candidemia occurred in patients with central venous catheters and"
		96% had received broad-spectrum antibiotics. Other predisposing factors included
		"complicated abdominal surgeries (22%), total parenteral nutrition (52%),"
		"neutropenia (9%), acute renal failure (24%), malignancy (26%) and burns (15%)."
		"However, prior fluconazole use was low (8%). The overall crude mortality rate was"
		43% for all candidemia. Logistic regression analysis identified two independent
		"determinants of death, C. albicans (OR 5.91, 95% CI 1.50, 23.24, p=0.01) and"
		"acute renal failure (OR 5.15, 95% CI 1.18, 22.55, p=0.03). CONCLUSION: The study"
		showed that the rate of candidemia was low in our hospital and that C. albicans
		was the major species followed by C. tropicalis and C. parapsilosis. Future
		studies are needed to evaluate the antifungal susceptibility pattern in our
		hospital.

AB	-	The aim of this study is to identify differences in distribution of Candida
		"species, resistance to antifungals and clinical outcome, as well as the"
		identification of potential risk factors associated with candidaemia in children.
		We conducted a retrospective analysis in children ≤18 years with blood culture
		proven candidaemia identified between 2004 and 2012. Patients were divided into
		"two groups (Group 1, <3 months, n = 51; Group 2, ≥3 months, n = 197) to identify"
		any potential difference between the neonatal and early infantile periods in
		terms of risk factors and distribution of Candida species. A total of 248
		distinct episodes of candidaemia were identified over the study period. The most
		"frequently isolated Candida species were C. albicans (53.2%), followed by C."
		"parapsilosis (26.2%), C. tropicalis (8.1%). Of the 248 episodes, 71 episodes"
		(28.6%) resulted in death within 30 days from the onset of candidaemia. In Group
		"1, failure of central venous catheter (CVC) removal was found to be associated"
		"with a 20.5-fold increase in mortality [95% CI (3.9, 106.5); P < 0.001], compared"
		"to a 5.9-fold increased risk with hypoalbuminaemia [95% CI (1.03, 34.1); P ="
		"0.046]. For Group 2, the increased risk was 23-fold for failure of CVC removal"
		"[95% CI (7.48, 70.77); P < 0.001], 7.4-fold for mechanical ventilation [95% CI"
		"(2.64, 21.08); P < 0.001], 4.4-fold for hypoalbuminaemia [95% CI (1.56, 12.56); P"
		"= 0.005], 3.1-fold for neutropaenia [95% CI (1.31, 7.69); P = 0.010] and 2.2-fold"
		"for male gender [95% CI (1.02, 4.71); P = 0.043]. Therapeutic choices should be"
		guided by sound knowledge of local epidemiological trends in candidaemia. Removal
		of CVC significantly reduces mortality and is an essential step in the management
		of candidaemia.

		Involvement and Necessity of Funduscopic Screening.

AB	-	PURPOSE: To determine the generalizability of recent data assessing the necessity
		"of ophthalmic consultation for fungemic patients, we examined the prevalence,"
		"microbial profile, and treatment of fungal chorioretinitis and endophthalmitis"
		among patients with positive fungal cultures referred for ophthalmologic
		consultation at a tertiary care medical center. DESIGN: Retrospective
		cross-sectional study. METHODS: All inpatient ophthalmology consultations from
		"Wills Eye Hospital at Thomas Jefferson University between January 1, 2006 and"
		"December 31, 2012 were retrospectively reviewed and cross-referenced to a"
		microbiologic database of positive fungal blood cultures. This included 227 adult
		consecutive inpatients with positive fungal blood cultures (n = 215) or suspected
		fungemia (n = 12). Clinical data were extracted from records held by the
		microbiology laboratory and inpatient records. Patients were deemed to have
		ocular fungal involvement if dilated fundus examination demonstrated evidence of
		chorioretinitis or endophthalmitis. RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty-seven
		consultations were requested to evaluate patients for ocular manifestations of
		"fungemia. Eleven patients (4.8%, 95% CI 2.4%-8.5%) were diagnosed with fungal"
		"chorioretinitis or endophthalmitis. Of these 11 patients, 5 had visual symptoms,"
		"2 were asymptomatic, and 4 were unable to communicate. A total of 5 patients"
		(2.2%) received intravitreal injections following funduscopic screening. An
		additional 11 patients (4.8%) had nonspecific fundus lesions considered to be
		inconsistent with ocular fungal involvement. The most common fungal species
		"identified were Candida albicans (n = 85), Candida glabrata (n = 63), and Candida"
		parapsilosis (n = 44). CONCLUSIONS: The current study found a low rate of
		disseminated ocular involvement in patients with positive fungal cultures
		"referred for ophthalmologic consultation. However, 2 patients with ocular fungal"
		involvement denied visual symptoms and over half of affected patients were
		asymptomatic or unable to communicate. As the presence and severity of ocular
		involvement in fungemic patients may dictate the mode and duration of antifungal
		"treatment, funduscopic screenings may still have an important role."

TI	-	Candidemia in pediatric outpatients receiving home total parenteral nutrition.
PG	-	219-25
AB	-	This is a cohort study of pediatric outpatients receiving total parenteral
		nutrition (TPN) and follow-up care in a Tennessee hospital between January and
		June 1999. The study was conducted following an increase in the incidence of
		"candidemia. Of 13 children receiving home TPN, five had candidemia; three were"
		due to Candida parapsilosis. Case patients were more likely to have an underlying
		hematologic disease (P = 0.02) as well as previous history of fungemia (P =
		0.02). Two case patients had successive candidemia episodes 3 months apart;
		karyotypes and RAPD profiles of each patient's successive C. parapsilosis
		isolates were similar. Candida spp. were frequently detected in hand cultures
		from cohort members (four of 10) and family member caregivers (nine of 11); C
		parapsilosis was isolated from five caregivers. Our findings underscore the
		challenges of maintaining stringent infection control practices in the home
		health care setting and suggest the need for more intensive follow-up and
		coordination of home TPN therapy among pediatric patients.

LID	-	101800
AB	-	PURPOSE: To report the initial case of microbial keratitis caused by Phialophora
		"chinensis, a rare cause of fungal keratitis. OBSERVATIONS: A 66-year-old"
		gentleman with a complex right eye (OD) ocular history including herpes simplex
		"virus infectious epithelial keratitis with subsequent neurotrophic keratopathy,"
		and prior combined Candida albicans and parapsilosis fungal keratitis presented
		with pain OD in the absence of an antecedent trauma. The patient was found to
		"have a filamentous fungal keratitis, which was subsequently cultured and"
		identified as Phialophora chinensis by the laboratory. Despite topical and oral
		"antifungal treatment based on sensitivities determined by the lab, the patient"
		"ultimately required intrastromal and subconjunctival antifungal injections,"
		"corneal crosslinking, and superficial keratectomy with amniotic membrane to"
		"clinically improve. The fungal keratitis recurred twice, with each occurrence"
		rapidly progressing to corneal perforation. Months after the second penetrating
		"keratoplasty, the patient's mental status declined due to multiorgan failure. An"
		"occult pulmonary malignancy was discovered during this hospital stay, and the"
		patient was lost to follow-up after entering hospice. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPORTANCE:
		We report a unique case of fungal keratitis caused by Phialophora chinensis and
		"the subsequent management, including both medical and surgical interventions."
		"Despite a multimodal treatment regimen, this case demonstrates the recalcitrant"
		and potentially recurrent nature of fungal keratitis caused by P. chinensis.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: The clinical characteristics of internal medicine ward (IMW) patients
		with candidemia are unclear. The aim of this study was to define the clinical
		"characteristics of candidemic IMW patients and to study the incidence, species"
		"distribution, and outcomes of these patients compared to surgical and intensive"
		care unit (ICU) candidemic patients. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of
		"candidemic patients in IMWs, general surgery wards, and an ICU at Beilinson"
		Hospital during the period 2007-2014 was analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 118
		"patients with candidemia were identified in six IMWs, two general surgery wards,"
		and one ICU in the hospital. Candida albicans was the leading causative agent
		(41.1%). Higher proportions of Candida parapsilosis and Candida tropicalis
		isolates were observed in the IMW patients. IMW patients were significantly
		"older, with poorer functional capacity, and had more frequently been exposed to"
		"antibiotic therapy within 90 days, in particular β-lactam-β-lactamase inhibitor"
		"combinations and cephalosporins. At onset of candidemia, a significantly lower"
		number of IMW patients were mechanically ventilated (p<0.01); these patients did
		not have central line catheters comparable to ICU and surgical patients
		(p<0.001). They were less likely to receive adequate antifungal therapy within
		"48h, and this was the only significant predictor of survival in these patients"
		(p=0.028): hazard ratio 3.7 (95% confidence interval 1.14-12.5) for therapy
		delayed to >48h. CONCLUSIONS: IMW candidemic patients account for a substantial
		proportion of candidemia cases and have unique characteristics and high mortality
		rates.

AB	-	"INTRODUCTION: Larger populations at risk, broader use of antibiotics and longer"
		hospital stays have impacted on the incidence of Candida sp. bloodstream
		infections (CBSI). OBJECTIVE: To determine clinical and epidemiologic
		characteristics of patients with CBSI in two tertiary care reference medical
		institutions in Mexico City. DESIGN: Prospective and observational
		laboratory-based surveillance study conducted from 07/2008 to 06/2010. METHODS:
		All patients with CBSI were included. Identification and antifungal
		"susceptibility were performed using CLSI M27-A3 standard procedures. Frequencies,"
		Mann-Whitney U test or T test were used as needed. Risk factors were determined
		with multivariable analysis and binary logistic regression analysis. RESULTS:
		CBSI represented 3.8% of nosocomial bloodstream infections. Cumulative incidence
		was 2.8 per 1000 discharges (incidence rate: 0.38 per 1000 patient-days). C.
		"albicans was the predominant species (46%), followed by C. tropicalis (26%). C."
		"glabrata was isolated from patients with diabetes (50%), and elderly patients."
		Sixty-four patients (86%) received antifungals. Amphotericin-B deoxycholate
		(AmBD) was the most commonly used agent (66%). Overall mortality rate reached
		"46%, and risk factors for death were APACHE II score ≥ 16 (OR = 6.94, CI95% ="
		"2.34-20.58, p<0.0001), and liver disease (OR = 186.11, CI95% = 7.61-4550.20, p ="
		"0.001). Full susceptibility to fluconazole, AmBD and echinocandins among C."
		"albicans, C. tropicalis, and C. parapsilosis was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The"
		cumulative incidence rate in these centers was higher than other reports from
		tertiary care hospitals from Latin America. Knowledge of local epidemiologic
		patterns permits the design of more specific strategies for prevention and
		preemptive therapy of CBSI.

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To review the epidemiology of candidemia in a UK tertiary referral
		center. METHODS: Clinical and laboratory data from patients with candidemia were
		"collected prospectively from October 1, 2005 to June 30, 2008 (a 33-month"
		period). RESULTS: A total of 107 episodes were identified. The incidence was 10.9
		episodes/100 000 bed-days. The most common predisposing factors were the use of
		"broad-spectrum antibiotics (92%), the presence of an intravascular device (IVD)"
		"(82%), admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) (51%), and recent surgery (50%)."
		"Non-Candida albicans species accounted for 58% of the episodes, which is higher"
		than the percentage reported from other UK centers. C. albicans was the most
		"common species, accounting for 43% of episodes, followed by C. glabrata (31%) and"
		"C. parapsilosis (20%). Overall C. tropicalis, C. krusei, C. norvegensis, and C."
		lusitaniae caused 7% of episodes. The crude 30-day mortality rate was 37%.
		Advanced age (p = 0.003) and the presence of septic shock (p = 0.038) were
		associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Candidemia continues to be associated
		with a high mortality. Preventative measures should be targeted against high-risk
		"hospitalized patients, especially those in ICUs, the elderly, and those"
		undergoing major surgery. Local surveillance of candidemia is important to
		optimize management.

AB	-	Data on fungemia epidemiology and antifungal susceptibility of isolates from
		"children are scarce, leading frequently to pediatric empirical treatment based on"
		available adult data. The present study was designed to update the
		"epidemiological, mycological, and in vitro susceptibility data on fungal isolates"
		from children with fungemia in Spain. All fungemia episodes were identified
		prospectively by blood culture over 13 months at 30 hospitals. Tests of
		"susceptibility to amphotericin B, flucytosine, fluconazole, itraconazole,"
		"posaconazole, voriconazole, anidulafungin, caspofungin, and micafungin were"
		performed at participant institutions by a microdilution colorimetric method. New
		"species-specific clinical breakpoints for fluconazole, voriconazole, and"
		echinocandins were also applied. A total of 203 episodes of fungemia in 200
		children were identified. A higher proportion of fungal isolates was from general
		"wards than intensive care units (ICU). Candida parapsilosis (46.8%), Candida"
		"albicans (36.5%), Candida tropicalis (5.9%), Candida glabrata (3.9%), and Candida"
		guilliermondii (2.5%) were the leading species. C. parapsilosis was the
		predominant species except in neonates. C. albicans was the most frequent in
		"neonatal ICU settings (51.9%). Intravascular catheter (79.3%), surgery (35%),"
		"prematurity (30%), and neutropenia (11%) were the most frequent predisposing"
		factors. Most Candida isolates (95.1%) were susceptible to all antifungals. When
		"the new species-specific clinical breakpoints were applied, all C. parapsilosis"
		"isolates were susceptible to echinocandins except one, which was micafungin"
		resistant. This is the largest published series of fungemia episodes in the
		"pediatric setting. C. parapsilosis is the most prevalent species in Spain,"
		followed by C. albicans and C. tropicalis. Resistance to azole and echinocandin
		agents is extremely rare among Candida species. The fluconazole resistance rate
		in Spain has decreased in the last 10 years.

AB	-	"INTRODUCTION: The incidence of Candida spp. infections is worrisome, particularly"
		in critically ill patients. Previous reports suggested that increasing use of
		antifungal therapy might affect resistance profiles of invasive strains. The
		study objective was to describe the distribution resistance profile of Candida
		"spp. strains, and to correlate it with antifungal consumptions within one ICU."
		METHOD: Antifungal drug consumption was measured as the number of defined daily
		doses per 1000 hospital days. The distribution of Candida spp. over a 10 year
		period 2004-2013 and the MICs of antifungal drugs over 2007-2013 were determined.
		Time series analyses were performed. RESULTS: Of 2403 identified Candida spp.
		"from 5360 patients, Candida albicans predominated (53.1%), followed by Candida"
		"glabrata (16.2%), Candida parapsilosis (7.9%) and Candida tropicalis (7.5%). C."
		parapsilosis increased from 5.7% in 2004 to 8.4% in 2013 (P = 0.02). The increase
		in caspofungin use is correlated with the increase in caspofungin MICs of C.
		"parapsilosis (P = 0.01), C. glabrata (P = 0.001) and C. albicans (P = 0.02)."
		Polyenes consumption correlated with an increase in amphotericin B MICs of C.
		glabrata (P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Previous history of antifungal prescription
		within an ICU influences Candida species distribution and susceptibility profile
		to antifungal agents. The significant selective pressure exerted by caspofungin
		and amphotericin B on C. glabrata is a concern.

		transplantation: no adverse effect of low-dose fluconazole prophylaxis on
		incidence and outcome.
PG	-	873-8
AB	-	"Candidemia is a serious complication in patients following allogeneic blood,"
		"marrow, and organ transplantation. Fourteen patients developed nosocomial"
		fungemia among 204 allogeneic marrow transplants performed during 1997-1999.
		Incidence of hematogenous candidiasis was 6.8 per 100 allogeneic BMT. All 14 had
		an indwelling central venous catheter (CVC) and fluconazole (100-200 mg daily)
		"was given prophylactically. In 11 (78.5%) neutropenic patients, duration between"
		"agranulocytosis and diagnosis of fungemia was (median, +/- s.d.) 10 +/- 8 days."
		"Candida glabrata (53.3%) was the most common yeast species, followed by C. krusei"
		"(33.3%), and C. parapsilosis (13.3%). Candida albicans was conspicuously absent."
		Ten patients (71.4%) had primary transplant-related complication (>2 days)
		including hemolytic uremic syndrome/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (HUS/TTP)
		"(n = 5), severe hemorrhagic cystitis (n = 3), and bacteremia (n = 2). Seven"
		(50.0%) patients expired and in three (21.4%) deaths were attributed to fungemia.
		The impact of a primary transplant-related complication on short-term survival in
		this setting was not significant (P = 0.07) (HUS/TTP (P > 0.5); neutropenia (P >
		0.5); GVHD (P = 0.35)). Removal of CVC did not alter outcome in our group (P > or
		"= 0.5) although in patients with persistent fungemia (>72 h), and those with"
		"preceding bacteremia, mortality was significantly higher (P = 0.002)."
		Conventional prognosticators of poor outcome did not adversely effect short-term
		survival in our transplant recipients with hematogenous candidiasis. The
		predominance of C. glabrata and C. krusei breakthrough infections was similar to
		"what is seen with high-dose fluconazole (400 mg) prophylaxis, and no adverse"
		effects of low-dose fluconazole in terms of increased incidence of
		non-susceptible Candida species was seen.

AB	-	PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to assess the epidemiology of candidemia and
		antifungal susceptibility profiles of Candida isolates in Italy through a
		prospective surveillance study and to evaluate changes compared to a previous
		survey performed in one Italian region (Lombardy) in 1997-1999. METHODS: A
		prospective laboratory-based surveillance of candidemia was performed in Italy
		"from January to December 2009. For each case a questionnaire was filled in, and"
		the first isolate was collected and tested for in vitro antifungal
		"susceptibility. RESULTS: During our 12-month survey, 467 episodes of candidemia"
		were reported from 34 centres (30 located in Lombardy) and 464 isolates
		collected. Candida albicans was the predominant species (overall incidence 50.4
		"%), but the proportion varied considerably from 52.1 % in Lombardy hospitals to"
		45.2 % hospitals located outside this region. The second most frequent species
		was C. glabrata in Lombardy and C. parapsilosis in other regions. Comparison of
		the 1997-1999 and 2009 data on episodes of candidemia in Lombardy revealed a
		"threefold increase in incidence (from 0.38 to 1.19 per 1,000 admissions), aging"
		"of infected patients, decline in crude mortality (from 35 to 27.1 %) and an"
		increased proportion of C. glabrata etiology (from 12.8 to 20.3 %).
		Susceptibility testing confirmed the broad activity of amphotericin B and
		echinocandins. Decreased susceptibility to fluconazole was found in 24.9 % of the
		tested isolates. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this latest survey confirm the high
		rate of candidemia in Italy and show changes in some of the epidemiological
		"tracts, such as aging of infected patients, increased proportion of C. glabrata"
		"infections, increased diagnosis in medical wards, and improvement in patients'"
		survival.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candida species are important bloodstream pathogens that are being
		isolated with increasing frequency. Despite the availability of effective
		"antifungal therapy, the mortality rate associated with Candida infection remains"
		"high. With the objective of describing the epidemiology of candidemia, the"
		Canadian Infectious Disease Society conducted a study of candidemia in Canada.
		METHODS: Fourteen medical centres across Canada identified all patients with
		candidemia from March 1992 to February 1994 through blood culture surveillance
		for Candida spp. Patient-related data for invasive fungal infection were compiled
		retrospectively by chart review using a standardized data-recording form
		developed for the Fungal Disease Registry of the Canadian Infectious Disease
		Society. Cases of Candidemia were studied in relation to underlying medical
		"conditions, predisposing factors, concurrent infection, antimicrobial agents,"
		"antifungal treatment and deaths. RESULTS: In total, 415 cases of candidemia were"
		"identified, 48 (11.6%) in children and 367 (88.4%) in adults. The causative"
		"pathogens were C. albicans in 286 cases (68.9%), C. parapsilosis in 43 (10.4%),"
		"C. glabrata in 34 (8.2%), C. tropicalis in 27 (6.5%) and other Candida species in"
		18 (4.3%); polymicrobial candidemia occurred in 7 cases (1.7%). The overall
		"mortality rate was 46%, and the rate of deaths clinically related to candidemia"
		"was 19%. However, only 13 (27%) of the children died. A univariate analysis"
		"indicated that significant risk factors for death were age greater than 60 years,"
		"therapy for concomitant bacterial infection, stay in an intensive care unit,"
		"concurrent malignant disease, cytotoxic chemotherapy and granulocytopenia,"
		although only age and stay in an intensive care unit emerged as significant risk
		factors in the multivariate analysis. After adjustment for other predictors of
		"death, only infection with C. parapsilosis was associated with a lower mortality"
		rate than infection with C. albicans. Treatment was given in 352 (84.8%) of
		cases. Amphotericin B was the preferred agent in 244 cases (69.3% of those
		treated); fluconazole was used in 101 cases (28.7%) and ketoconazole in 5 cases
		(1.4%). INTERPRETATION: Candidemia in Canada is caused predominantly by C.
		"albicans. The mortality rate associated with candidemia is high, but it varies"
		with the species of Candida and is lower in children than in adults. Age greater
		than 60 years and stay in an intensive care unit were the most significant risk
		factors for overall mortality.

PG	-	697-703
AB	-	All consecutive patients with positive blood culture for Candida species over a
		6-year period were evaluated to define recent epidemiologic characteristics of
		"candidemia, and to assess the prevalence of late complications. We encountered"
		106 cases; medical records were available for 99 of them. The rate of candidemia
		"was increasing until 1990, after which it declined. C. albicans was the most"
		"common species, but in the last 2 years, C. tropicalis and C. parapsilosis were"
		emerging. Overall mortality rate was 54.5% without significant variation during
		the study period. Antifungal therapy was withheld in 24/99 cases (24.2%).
		Decision to withhold treatment was taken in 19/59 cases (32.2%) before the
		"availability of fluconazole in 1990, compared with 5/40 cases (12.5%) afterward"
		(p < 0.05). Follow-up was possible in 35 instances for an average period of 17.1
		"months (range: 1-48 months); 7 of these individuals, all with transient"
		"candidemia, were untreated. None of the survivors developed late complications."
		"These findings demonstrate that candidemia appears to be declining since 1990,"
		with a noticeable decrease in the prevalence of C. albicans but an increase in
		"that of C. tropicalis and C. parapsilosis, that fewer patients are left untreated"
		"since fluconazole became available, and that the risk of late complications among"
		the survivors is low.

TI	-	Invasive fungal infection in very low birthweight infants: national prospective
		surveillance study.
PG	-	F188-92
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiology of invasive fungal infection in very low
		birthweight (VLBW: <1500 g) infants in the United Kingdom. DESIGN: National
		prospective surveillance study between February 2003 and February 2004 using the
		British Paediatric Surveillance Unit reporting system reconciled with cases
		identified through routine laboratory reporting to the Health Protection Agency
		"(England, Wales, and Northern Ireland), the Scottish Centre for Infection and"
		"Environmental Health, and the UK Mycology Reference Laboratory. RESULTS: Ninety"
		four confirmed cases of invasive fungal infection were identified during the
		surveillance period giving an incidence of estimated annual incidence of 10.0
		(95% confidence interval (CI) 8.0 to 12.0) cases per 1000 VLBW live births.
		Eighty one (86%) of the infants were of extremely low birth weight (ELBW: <1000
		"g), incidence 21.1 (95% CI 16.5 to 25.7) per 1000 ELBW live births. Candida"
		"species, predominantly C albicans and C parapsilosis, were isolated in 93% of"
		cases. Most organisms were isolated from the bloodstream and urinary tract. Death
		occurred in 41% of the infected infants before 37 weeks postconceptional age.
		CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of invasive fungal infection in VLBW and ELBW infants
		in the United Kingdom is lower than reported in previous studies from tertiary
		centres in North America and elsewhere. The associated late neonatal and
		post-neonatal death rates are substantially higher than expected in infants
		without invasive fungal infection. These data may inform decisions about the
		evaluation and use of antifungal infection control strategies.

AB	-	A prospective multicenter surveillance program on yeast bloodstream infections
		"was implemented in the Paris, France, area without restrictions on ward of"
		"hospitalization (intensive care unit, hematology, and surgery) or age (adults and"
		"children). The present analysis concerns 2,618 isolates collected over 7 years"
		"from 2,441 patients. Centralized species identification and antifungal"
		susceptibility testing using the EUCAST methodology were performed. Almost 10%
		"(232/2,441) of the patients had recently (≤30 days) been treated with antifungal"
		drugs. We analyzed the effect of recent exposure to fluconazole (n = 159) or
		caspofungin (n = 61) on the proportions of the five major Candida species. For
		"both drugs, preexposure was associated with a decreased prevalence of Candida"
		albicans in favor of less drug-susceptible species (C. glabrata and C. krusei for
		"the former and C. parapsilosis and, to a lesser extent, C. glabrata and C. krusei"
		"for the latter; P = 0.001). In the multivariate analysis, the risk of being"
		infected with an isolate with decreased susceptibility to fluconazole was
		independently associated with an age of ≥15 years (odds ratio [OR] = 2.45; 95%
		confidence interval [CI] = 1.39 to 4.31; P = 0.002) and with recent exposure to
		"fluconazole (OR = 2.17; 95% CI = 1.51 to 3.13; P < 0.001), while the risk of"
		being infected with an isolate with decreased susceptibility to caspofungin was
		independently associated with an age <15 years (OR = 2.53; 95% CI = 1.43 to 4.48;
		P = 0.001) and with recent exposure to caspofungin (OR = 4.79; 95% CI = 2.47 to
		9.28; P < 0.001). These findings could influence future recommendations for the
		management of candidemia.

AB	-	"Nosocomial candidemia extends the length of hospital stay, increases the costs of"
		"medical care, and is associated with a high mortality rate. Epidemiological data"
		that assist in the choice of initial therapy may help to improve the prognosis.
		The present study was undertaken to investigate the epidemiology of nosocomial
		candidemia and identify risk factors for nosocomial candidemia caused by C.
		albicans and non-albicans Candida species (NAC). A retrospective chart review was
		undertaken to analyze cases of nosocomial candidemia treated at the Beijing
		Friendship Hospital between January 2008 and December 2012. All cases of
		candidemia were identified using the previously published criteria. Among 106
		"patients analyzed, 53.8% had nosocomial candidemia caused by NAC. Candida"
		"albicans was the most common causative agent, accounting for 46.2% of all cases,"
		"followed by C. glabrata (25.5%), C. tropicalis (15.1%), C. parapsilosis (10.4%)"
		and C. Krusei (0.9%). Comparison of nosocomial C. albicans and NAC candidemia by
		multivariate logistic regression showed that factors independently associated
		with nosocomial NAC candidemia included exposure to azole agents (odds ratio
		[OR]: 3.359; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.136-10.154; P = .031) and artificial
		surgical implants (OR: 37.519; 95% CI: 2.5-562.998; P = .009). A significant risk
		factor for nosocomial C. albicans candidemia was cancer surgery (OR: 0.075; 95%
		CI: 0.013-0.437; P = .004). Clinical and epidemiological differences in the risk
		factors between nosocomial candidemia caused by C. albicans and NAC should be
		considered when selecting an initial antifungal regimen for the treatment of

PG	-	e3140

LID	-	e3140
AB	-	Meningitis is a common and life-threatening infection of the central nervous
		system (CNS) in infants with long-term and disabling sequelae like hydrocephalus.
		Hydrocephalus is treated by diverting cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) either to another
		body cavity (via CSF shunt) or externally (via CSF drain) which are prone to
		"infection. Though rare, Candida parapsilosis (C. parapsilosis) is a known"
		"pathogen in device-associated CNS infections and has been reported in both,"
		infants and adults. A six-month-old male infant was brought to the hospital with
		disproportionate head enlargement of three months duration. Magnetic resonance
		imaging (MRI) was suggestive of gross asymmetrical hydrocephalus. An external
		"ventricular drain (EVD) was placed, and vancomycin and meropenem were started."
		"Four weeks later, he developed a fever with a blocked EVD. Repeat MRI revealed"
		gross asymmetric dilatation of left lateral ventricle along with pneumocephalus
		in the right periventricular region. A right temporoparietal craniotomy with
		drainage of a multiloculated abscess was done along with the removal of right EVD
		and placement of left EVD. CSF showed pan-susceptible C. parapsilosis and
		"fluconazole was started. Despite treatment, CSF continued to grow C. parapsilosis"
		"through day 10. The EVD was removed, and an Ommaya reservoir along with the"
		ventricular catheter was placed for better interventricular antibiotic
		"administration. After day 13 CSF became sterile. Ommaya reservoir was removed,"
		"fluconazole was continued for three weeks, and a ventriculoperitoneal shunt was"
		placed five weeks later. The device-associated CNS infections are insidious with
		nonspecific manifestations making diagnosis difficult. C. parapsilosis has been
		"increasing in prevalence, especially in immunocompromised hosts, infants, and in"
		patients with indwelling catheters. Amphotericin B or fluconazole is the usual
		treatment with excellent outcomes and no mortality. This case underscores the
		need for suspicion of C. parapsilosis as a cause of device-associated CNS
		infections.

		patients with Candida colonization.
PG	-	1077-88
LID	-	10.1007/s00134-015-3791-4 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: To assess the evolution of patient deep colonization by Candida spp. in
		"a surgical ICU over an 8-year period. METHODS: This retrospective, observational"
		study included all patients hospitalized for more than 2 days in a surgical and
		"trauma ICU of a university hospital, from 2005 to 2012. Mycological samples were"
		"monitored weekly from five sites (oropharyngeal, rectal, gastric, tracheal and"
		urinary). Preemptive fluconazole therapy was started in patients highly colonized
		with Candida albicans. The evolution in Candida spp. involved in the deep
		"colonization sites distribution over the study period (main outcome measure,"
		"trend chi-square and time-series analysis), antifungal consumption, ICU-acquired"
		candidemia and mortality were determined. RESULTS: Among the 3029 patients with
		"ICU stay >48 h, 2651 had at least one set of mycological sampling. Thirty percent"
		"of the 31,171 samples were positive to Candida spp. Caspofungin consumption"
		"increased over the years, whereas fluconazole consumption decreased. No trend in"
		"C. albicans colonization was observed, after adjusting on colonization"
		risk-factors. A significant increase of acquired C. glabrata colonization was
		"observed, whereas the clearing of C. parapsilosis colonization significantly"
		decreased. No significant shift of colonization to other Candida spp. and
		mortality was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Preemptive strategy of antifungal drug
		prescriptions in highly colonized ICU patients induced an increase in C. glabrata
		colonization without significant shift of colonization to other Candida spp. in
		"surgical ICU patients. However, the potential detrimental impact of fluconazole"
		on Candida ecology in ICU and/or on Candida susceptibility to antifungal drugs
		"should be considered, and deserves further studies."

AB	-	"AIM OF THE STUDY: To determine the prevalence of C. parapsilosis sensu stricto,"
		C. orthopsilosis and C. metapsilosis among candidemia at Nantes University
		Hospital and to evaluate the in vitro susceptibility of the isolates against
		"three echinocandin drugs (caspofungin, micafungin and anidulafungin). MATERIAL"
		AND METHODS: Retrospective study (march 2004 to july 2009) of 178 cases of
		candidemia corresponding to 183 Candida spp. strains identified by means of
		routine phenotypical methods. Re-identification of C. parapsilosis sensu lato
		isolates was performed by ITS rDNA sequencing analysis. Minimal inhibitory
		concentrations (MIC) were determined by E-test(®). All echinocandin
		non-susceptible isolates (MIC>2 μg/mL) were analyzed for the presence/absence of
		"FKS1 mutations associated with resistance. RESULTS: During this period, C."
		"parapsilosis sensu lato was responsible for 27 candidemia, ranging at the second"
		"most common Candida species after C. albicans (n=99, 54.1%). Neither isolates"
		"belong to C. orthopsilosis nor C. metapsilosis. According to the literature, all"
		the isolates displayed high MICs against the three echinocandin drugs. All the
		isolates displayed both susceptibility (MIC ≤ 2 μg/mL) and a good agreement
		between MICs read at 24h and 48 h for caspofungin and micafungin (MIC(50)=0.75
		"μg/mL, MIC(90)=1.5 μg/mL). Surprisingly, whereas most of the strains were"
		"susceptible to anidulafungin at 24h (MIC(50)=1 μg/mL, MIC(90)=1.5 μg/mL), 14 (52"
		"%) displayed non-susceptibility, despite the lack of mutation associated with"
		"resistance on FKS1, when reading was performed at 48 h (MIC(50)=3 μg/mL,"
		MIC(90)=12 μg/mL). CONCLUSION: Prevalence of C. orthopsilosis and C. metapsilosis
		in patients with candidemia is low at Nantes University Hospital. The difficulty
		encountered with MIC reading by E-test(®) are discussed.

TI	-	A 7-year study of the distribution of nosocomial candidemia in children with
		cancer.
PG	-	225-9
AB	-	Candidemia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in cancer patients.
		The incidence of candidemia has been reported to have shifted toward nonalbicans
		species. The aim of this study was to determine the distribution of Candida
		species resulting in bloodstream infections or catheter-related blood stream
		infections (CRBSIs) in pediatric hematology-oncology (PHO) patients over a
		7-year-period. Medical and computerized microbiology laboratory records of all
		positive blood fungal cultures during the study period were analyzed
		retrospectively. The ratio of non-albicans Candida species (81.4%) was nearly
		"four times higher than that of C. albicans candidemia (18.5%). Overall, C."
		"parapsilosis caused the majority (61.4%) of candidemia episodes, followed by C."
		"tropicalis (14.8%), C. famata (2.9%), C. ciferrii (1.4%) and C. glabrata (0.7%)."
		The rate of CRBSIs was significantly higher in C. Parapsilosis candidemia. The
		overall rate of 30-day mortality in 135 candidemia episodes was 4.44%. Nearly
		"half of the C. parapsilosis candidemia was associated with CRBSIs, suggesting its"
		"importance in PHO, in which several types of central venous catheters have been"
		used.

TI	-	Outbreak of Candida parapsilosis endophthalmitis after cataract extraction and
		intraocular lens implantation.
PG	-	625-8
AB	-	"Between November 1983 and January 1984, 13 cases of Candida parapsilosis"
		"endophthalmitis occurred in Florida, Georgia, and Tennessee in patients who had"
		had an intraocular lens implantation (IOLI) or cataract extraction with an IOLI.
		This outbreak followed the introduction in July 1983 of a new brand of balanced
		salt solution (BSS) used as an intraoperative ophthalmic irrigation solution.
		This product was subsequently recalled because of intrinsic fungal contamination.
		A retrospective cohort study including 704 ophthalmology patients at risk for
		exposure to this brand of BSS revealed that definite exposure to that product was
		"a significant risk factor for C. parapsilosis endophthalmitis (P less than 0.001,"
		Fisher exact test). A retrospective case control study including 203 control
		patients with definite exposure to BSS suggested that exposure to systemic
		"steroids (P = 0.007, Fisher exact test) was an additional risk factor for C."
		parapsilosis endophthalmitis. Treatment modalities among the 13 patients included
		"topical, intraocular, or systemic antifungal therapy (or a combination of these"
		modalities) in 13 patients and vitrectomy in 10 patients. No patients had
		systemic symptoms or complete visual loss. Laboratory investigations showed a
		6.7% overall contamination of the product with C. parapsilosis. After recall of
		"the product by the manufacturer, no patients having a cataract extraction or IOLI"
		at the institutions studied are known to have developed C. parapsilosis
		endophthalmitis.

AB	-	Cerebrovascular stroke due to Candida (C.) parapsilosis native valve endocarditis
		"(NVE) is rarely reported. Herein, we report a 53-year man with C. parapsilosis"
		NVE and acute ischemic stroke. Diabetes mellitus and recent dental manipulation
		were the preceding events. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging study revealed
		"occlusion of left common carotid artery, and infarcts of the pons and territory"

TI	-	Global distribution and outcomes for Candida species causing invasive
		candidiasis: results from an international randomized double-blind study of
		caspofungin versus amphotericin B for the treatment of invasive candidiasis.
PG	-	470-4
AB	-	"In a randomized study, caspofungin was compared with amphotericin B for the"
		treatment of invasive candidiasis in a total of 239 adults from 56 sites in 20
		countries. This study provided a unique opportunity to assess the frequency and
		"outcome of invasive candidiasis caused by different Candida species worldwide,"
		and the results are presented here. Efficacy was primarily assessed at the end of
		intravenous therapy using a modified intent-to-treat (MITT) analysis. This
		analysis was performed on 224 of the 239 patients enrolled in the study. Attempts
		were made to collect baseline Candida isolates from all patients for species
		identification at a central laboratory. Yeasts were identified to the species
		level using two commercial systems and microscopic examination. Viable baseline
		isolates were recovered from 210 of the 224 (94%) patients included in the MITT
		analysis. Candida albicans was the most frequently isolated species in all
		"regions and was responsible for 45% of cases overall. Nevertheless, the majority"
		of cases of infection were caused by non- albicans Candida species. In the USA
		"and Canada, Candida glabrata was the second most commonly isolated pathogen"
		"(18%). In contrast, Candida parapsilosis and Candida tropicalis accounted for 55%"
		of cases in Latin America. Outcomes were comparable for patients treated with
		caspofungin (74% overall; 64% and 80% for infections due to Candida albicans and
		non- albicans species) and amphotericin B (62% overall; 58% and 68% for
		"infections due to Candida albicans and non- albicans species), and were generally"
		similar across continents. The distribution of Candida species isolated from
		patients enrolled in a clinical trial may not be representative of pathogens
		"causing invasive candidiasis in the general population. Nevertheless, our"
		findings may affect the regional choice of empirical antifungal therapy for
		seriously ill patients with suspected or documented invasive candidiasis since
		different Candida species have varying susceptibility to conventional antifungal
		drugs.

		period.
PG	-	390-6
AB	-	In a retrospective analysis of 128 cases of Candida bloodstream infections in a
		"London teaching hospital between 1995 and 2001, the incidence of candidaemia"
		increased from 0.2/1000 admissions in 1995 to 0.5 and 0.4/1000 admissions in 2000
		"and 2001, respectively. Risk factors for candidaemia included the presence of"
		"intravascular (IV) lines (88%), admission to intensive care (51%), parenteral"
		"nutrition (35%), multiple antibiotics (74%), corticosteroid therapy (12%), cancer"
		"chemotherapy (11%), renal transplantation (5%) and neutropenia (3%). The sources"
		"of infection were IV lines (77%), the urinary tract (7%) and the gastrointestinal"
		"tract (7%). Serious infective complications (endocarditis, endophthalmitis or"
		brain abscess) were noted in 6% of cases. The most frequently isolated species
		"were Candida albicans (64%), C. glabrata (20%), C. tropicalis (9%) and C."
		parapsilosis (5%). The overall fluconazole-resistance rate of Candida spp. was 7%
		(MIC > or = 64 mg l-1). All the C. albicans isolates were sensitive to
		fluconazole (MIC < or = 8 mg l-1) whereas 20% of non-C. albicans isolates (27% of
		C. glabrata and 14%C. tropicalis) were resistant. The mortality rate (35%) was
		lower than in other reports and may be due to the early recognition of
		candidaemia and the prompt removal of IV lines together with the initiation of
		"appropriate antifungal therapy. Regular surveillance of local Candida species,"
		resistance profiles and risk factors is important in order to identify patients
		at risk and to develop empirical treatment protocols to reduce the incidence and
		mortality of candidaemia.

PG	-	1822-9
LID	-	10.1007/s00268-009-0120-5 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Infections caused by Candida are an emerging pathology on surgical
		"wards. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the incidence,"
		"characteristics, and predictive factors of mortality in patients colonized and/or"
		infected by Candida spp. in this setting. METHODS: A consecutive series of 105
		patients hospitalized on a general surgery ward between 2000 and 2004 were
		"included, and 118 positive cultures for Candida were identified. The variables"
		"age, sex, previous medical history, current disease, anemia, ICU stay, type and"
		"localization of the microorganism, need for parenteral nutrition, and"
		transfusions were recorded. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. A
		univariate analysis was performed to determine which of these variables were
		"associated with mortality. With a logistic regression model, independent"
		prognostic factors of mortality were determined. RESULTS: The prevalence of
		patients colonized and/or infected by Candida on our surgical ward was 0.98% (CI
		"95%: 0.79-1.17), and the incidence was 49 cases per 1,000 patient-years. Of the"
		"105 patients in this series, 56 were men (53%) and 49 women (47%); the mean age"
		was 63.8 years (SD +/- 15.7). Twelve patients (11.4%) had candidemia. Crude
		"mortality was 23% (24 patients), whereas the mortality attributable to candidemia"
		"was 25% (3/12 cases). Anemia (p = 0.001); transfusions (p = 0.003), and an ICU"
		stay (p = 0.002) were associated with mortality. Candidemia was associated with
		neoplasms (p = 0.02) and the infection caused by Candida parapsilosis (p = 0.04).
		The only independent factor related to mortality was the anemia (p = 0.028; Odds
		Ratio: 6.43; 95% CI: 1.23-33.73). CONCLUSIONS: Colonization and/or infection by
		Candida spp. in non-ICU hospitalized surgical patients implies a relative high
		mortality. Anemia is an independent factor for mortality.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Despite being associated with a high mortality and economic burden,"
		data regarding candidemia are scant in Algeria. The aim of this study was to
		"unveil the epidemiology of candidemia in Algeria, evaluate the antifungal"
		susceptibility pattern of causative agents and understand the molecular
		"mechanisms of antifungal resistance where applicable. Furthermore, by performing"
		environmental screening and microsatellite typing we sought to identify the
		source of infection. METHODS: We performed a retrospective epidemiological-based
		surveillance study and collected available blood yeast isolates recovered from
		"the seven hospitals in Algiers. To identify the source of infection, we performed"
		environmental screening from the hands of healthcare workers (HCWs) and high
		touch areas. Species identification was performed by API Auxa-Color and MALDI-TOF
		MS and ITS sequencing was performed for species not reliably identified by
		MALDI-TOF MS. Antifungal susceptibility testing followed CLSI M27-A3/S4 and
		included all blood and environmental yeast isolates. ERG11 sequencing was
		performed for azole-resistant Candida isolates. Microsatellite typing was
		"performed for blood and environmental Candida species, where applicable. RESULTS:"
		Candida tropicalis (19/66) was the main cause of candidemia in these seven
		"hospitals, followed by Candida parapsilosis (18/66), Candida albicans (18/66),"
		and Candida glabrata (7/66). The overall mortality rate was 68.6% (35/51) and was
		81.2% for C. tropicalis-infected patients (13/16). Fluconazole was the main
		antifungal drug used (12/51); 41% of the patients (21/51) did not receive any
		systemic treatment. Candida parapsilosis was isolated mainly from the hands of
		"HCWs (7/28), and various yeasts were collected from high-touch areas (11/47),"
		"including Naganishia albida, C. parapsilosis and C. glabrata. Typing data"
		revealed interhospital transmission on two occasions for C. parapsilosis and C.
		"glabrata, and the same clone of C. parapsilosis infected two patients within the"
		same hospital. Resistance was only noted for C. tropicalis against azoles (6/19)
		and fluconazole-resistant C. tropicalis isolates (≥8 μg/ml) (6/19) contained a
		novel P56S (5/6) amino acid substitution and a previously reported one (V234F;
		"1/6) in Erg11p. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our data suggest an urgent need for"
		antifungal stewardship and infection control strategies to improve the clinical
		outcome of Algerian patients with candidemia. The high prevalence of C.
		tropicalis joined by fluconazole-resistance may hamper the therapeutic efficacy
		"of fluconazole, the frontline antifungal drug used in Algeria."

TI	-	Epidemiology of candidemia--a nationwide survey in Israel.
PG	-	26-9
AB	-	Bloodstream infections with Candida are often lethal and have been reported to be
		increasing in frequency. The current retrospective study describes the magnitude
		and epidemiological characteristics of candidemia in all western-type hospital
		facilities in Israel in 1994. Comprehensiveness of the data from the reporting
		hospitals was checked by cross-study of the data from the infectious diseases
		records and from the hospitalization records. Vital status of all reported cases
		was evaluated 1 year after the diagnosis. Data on 298 newly diagnosed cases of
		candidemia were received from 14 of the 18 general hospitals in Israel. The
		proportion of candidemia in the Israeli hospitals ranged from 0.1 to 0.01% of all
		"admissions, with a mean of 0.05%. The incidence of candidemia differed"
		"significantly between the wards from 4-5/10,000 in general surgery and internal"
		"medicine wards to about 60/10,000 and 80/10,000 in intensive care and preterm"
		"units, respectively. Of all detected cases 53.6% were Candida albicans. Another"
		"nine specific species of Candida (mainly Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis"
		"and Candida glabrata) were detected, with major differences between the various"
		hospitals. The species of Candida differed significantly by sex and age. Of the
		cases of candidemia 21.5% died within 30 days of the isolation of the pathogen.
		The one-year mortality rate was 31.9%. Species-specific 30-day mortality rate was
		"highest for C. glabrata. Throughout the analysis, C. glabrata emerged as a unique"
		"cause of candidemia, producing higher mortality, appearing at a younger age and"
		predominating among females.

PG	-	81-6
AB	-	A 72 year-old man was referred to our department with white curd-like material on
		"the surface of his tongue as well as the mucosal surface of the lower lip, after"
		unsuccessful treatment with itraconazole for 3 weeks. He also had a history of
		depression and had received topical steroid and/or antibiotics treatment for
		persistent oral aphtha and irritation of his upper lip for 4 years. A diagnosis
		of oral candidiasis was made through positive KOH direct microscopic examination
		and he was instructed to rinse his oral mucosal lesion with amphotericin B syrup.
		Although no significant eruption was observed on his upper lip at his first
		"visit, he applied the steroid ointment for 4 weeks and came back to our clinic"
		with his upper lip red and swollen. It was also covered with yellow crusty
		material mixed with a pustule. Histological examination of the lips revealed
		non-specific chronic inflammation in the mid to lower dermis. Hyphae in the
		cornea detected by PAS and Grocott staining. KOH direct microscopic examination
		from the pustule and crust showed positive pseudohyphae although no sign of
		parasitism to the hair was seen. Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis were
		detected by culture from the crust and a biopsy sample. He was successfully
		treated with 2 courses of pulse therapy of oral itraconazole for sycosis
		"candidiasis, accompanied by 2% miconazole gel for oral candidiasis."

TI	-	Risk factors for disseminated candidiasis in children with candidemia.
PG	-	635-41
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk factors for disseminated infection in
		hospitalized children with candidemia. METHODS: We performed a nested
		case-control study within a cohort of hospitalized children with candidemia. The
		cohort was defined by all patients with positive blood cultures for Candida
		"species in a large, urban, academic, tertiary care children's hospital from 1998"
		"to 2001. Cases were patients with clinical, microbiologic or radiographic"
		evidence of disseminated candidiasis. Controls were patients with no evidence of
		"disseminated candidiasis. RESULTS: Among 168 total children with candidemia, the"
		"median age was 3.5 years (interquartile range, 0.6-14.3). There were 189 episodes"
		"of candidemia. Candida species included:Candida albicans (41%), Candida"
		"parapsilosis (24%), Candida glabrata (13%) and Candida tropicalis (9%). The most"
		"common underlying diagnoses were oncologic (24%), gastrointestinal (15%) and"
		cardiac (10%) diseases. Eighty-nine patients (53%) were admitted to an intensive
		"care unit, 46 (27%) to a general pediatric or surgical ward and 33 (20%) to the"
		"oncology ward. Of the 168 patients with candidemia, 153 were included in the"
		"analysis of risk factors for disseminated candidiasis. Of 153 (17%) patients, 26"
		had evidence of organ dissemination. Organ involvement was most commonly
		"identified in the lung (58%), followed by the liver (23%), kidney (16%), brain"
		"(12%), spleen (8%), eye (8%) and heart (8%). Eight of the 26 patients had"
		evidence of dissemination to more than 1 organ. Independent risk factors for
		disseminated candidiasis were persistently positive blood cultures for Candida
		"(>3 days) with a central venous catheter in place (odds ratio, 3.0; 95%"
		"confidence interval, 1.2, 7.8; P = 0.02) and immunosuppression (odds ratio, 2.9;"
		"95% confidence interval, 1.2, 7.0; P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged duration of"
		candidemia with a central venous catheter in place and immunosuppression were
		independent risk factors for disseminated candidiasis in children with
		candidemia. Furthermore review of the epidemiology of candidemia at our
		institution revealed a heterogeneous population of children at risk for
		candidemia and a predominance of non-albicans species as the cause of these
		infections. Future studies are needed to determine the extent of evaluation
		needed for detecting dissemination among children with candidemia and to explore
		interventions for its prevention.

		molecular typing of causative isolates.
PG	-	745-50
AB	-	A prospective observational study of invasive candidiasis was conducted in the
		neonatal intensive care unit of Aristotle University in Hippokration Hospital
		"between 1994 and 2000. During this period, 59 neonates developed invasive"
		"candidiasis (58 cases of candidemia and 1 case of peritonitis), resulting in an"
		overall incidence of 1.28% that showed a decreasing trend over the study period.
		Eleven (18.6%) cases developed within the first week of life and the others
		within a mean (+/-SEM) of 13.4+/-1.7 days after birth. The three most frequent
		"causative species were Candida albicans (65.5%), Candida parapsilosis (15.5%),"
		and Candida tropicalis (7%). C. albicans was the predominant species between 1994
		"and 1998, whereas, non-albicans Candida spp., particularly C. parapsilosis, were"
		the most frequent species during the period 1999-2000 (P<0.001). While the
		"overall mortality due to candidemia was 29% (17 of 59 cases), mortality"
		"associated with C. albicans and C. parapsilosis was 39.5% and 11.1%, respectively"
		"(P=0.032), and that observed in the 1999-2000 period was 0% (P=0.011). Virtually"
		"all isolates were susceptible to amphotericin B, flucytosine, fluconazole, and"
		"itraconazole, and no increases in minimal inhibitory concentrations were observed"
		during these years. With the exception of a limited cluster of cases due to
		"genotypically identical isolates, no clonal relation of C. albicans isolates was"
		"found. Moreover, no clonal persistence of C. albicans and no decrease in"
		antifungal drug susceptibility occurred over the 6-year study period.
		"Non-albicans Candida spp., mostly C. parapsilosis, have emerged as important"
		"pathogens in neonatal intensive care units, with infected patients having better"
		outcomes as compared to patients infected with C. albicans.

AB	-	"OBJECTIVE: To describe the evolving epidemiology, management, and risk factors"
		for death of invasive Candida infections in intensive care units (ICUs). DESIGN:
		"Prospective, observational, national, multicenter study. SETTING: One hundred"
		"eighty ICUs in France. PATIENTS: Between October 2005 and May 2006, 300 adult"
		patients with proven invasive Candida infection who received systemic antifungal
		therapy were included. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: One
		"hundred seven patients (39.5%) with isolated candidemia, 87 (32.1%) with invasive"
		"candidiasis without documented candidemia, and 77 (28.4%) with invasive"
		"candidiasis and candidemia were eligible. In 37% of the cases, candidemia"
		occurred within the first 5 days after ICU admission. C. albicans accounted for
		"57.0% of the isolates, followed by C. glabrata (16.7%), C. parapsilosis (7.5%),"
		"C. krusei (5.2%), and C. tropicalis (4.9%). In 17.1% of the isolates, the"
		causative Candida was less susceptible or resistant to fluconazole. Fluconazole
		"was the empirical treatment most commonly introduced (65.7%), followed by"
		"caspofungin (18.1%), voriconazole (5.5%), and amphotericin B (3.7%). After"
		"identification of the causative species and susceptibility testing results,"
		treatment was modified in 86 patients (31.7%). The case fatality ratio in ICU was
		45.9% and did not differ significantly according to the type of episode.
		Multivariate analysis showed that factors independently associated with death in
		ICU were type 1 diabetes mellitus (odds ratio [OR] 4.51; 95% confidence interval
		"[CI] 1.72-11.79; p = 0.002), immunosuppression (OR 2.63; 95% CI 1.35-5.11; p ="
		"0.0045), mechanical ventilation (OR 2.54; 95% CI 1.33-4.82; p = 0.0045), and body"
		"temperature >38.2 degrees C (reference, 36.5-38.2 degrees C; OR 0.36; 95% CI"
		0.17-0.77; p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: More than two thirds of patients with
		invasive candidiasis in ICU present with candidemia. Non-albicans Candida species
		reach almost half of the Candida isolates. Reduced susceptibility to fluconazole
		is observed in 17.1% of Candida isolates. Mortality of invasive candidiasis in
		ICU remains high.

		"with candidaemia in intensive care units at the Children's Medical Center,"
		"Tehran, Iran. All blood and other normally sterile specimen cultures positive for"
		Candida species were included. Isolates were identified by morphological and
		molecular methods. Unidentified/doubtful yeast isolates were subjected to ITS
		"sequencing. A total of 156 episodes of invasive candidiasis, with an overall"
		"incidence of 15.2 per 1000 ICU admissions, was recorded. Risk factors included"
		"presence of central venous lines (89.1%), mechanical ventilation (55.8%) and"
		parenteral nutrition (51.3%). Candida albicans (57.1%) and Candida parapsilosis
		"(24.4%) were the most commonly isolated species. Candida orthopsilosis, Candida"
		"glabrata, Candida dubliniensis, Candida lusitaniae, Candida kefyr and Candida"
		intermedia accounted for about 11% of the cases. The overall mortality rate was
		42.5%. Non-albicans Candida species accounted for nearly half of the cases of
		paediatric candidaemia. This is the first prospective study of candidaemia in
		paediatric settings in Iran and serves to inform necessary interventions for the
		prevention of candidaemia.

TI	-	Distributions and antifungal susceptibility of Candida species from mucosal sites
		in HIV positive patients.
PG	-	282-7
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Mucocutaneous candidiasis (almost endogenous) is one of the most
		common manifestations of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The aim of
		"this study was the investigation of colonization patterns of Candida species,"
		"particularly C. dubliniensis, among mucosal sites of HIV-positive patients and"
		determining corresponding in vitro susceptibility patterns to the antifungals.
		"METHODS: From July 2006 to May 2008, specimens from the mucosal sites of 273"
		seropositive HIV patients were collected for Candida colonization. All isolates
		were identified by standard methods and carbohydrate assimilation patterns.
		Isolates phenotypically identified as C. albicans or C. dubliniensis were
		subjected to molecular identification. Susceptibility patterns of the isolated
		species to seven antifungal agents were determined using the broth microdilution
		method. RESULTS: The 359 samples from mucosal sites which consisted of 273 oral
		and 86 vaginal were collected and evaluated for Candida species distributions and
		their corresponding susceptibility patterns. The most commonly isolated species
		"were: C. albicans (50%) followed by C. glabrata (21.4%), C. dubliniensis (13.3%,"
		"reported for the first time in Iran), C. krusei (9.8%), C. kefyr (3.1%), C."
		"parapsilosis (1.6%), and C. tropicalis (0.8%). All species were sensitive to"
		"amphotencin B, ketoconazole, nystatin, voriconazole, and caspofungin. In some"
		"isolates, resistance to fluconazole and itraconazole was noted. CONCLUSION: As"
		"demonstrated, resistance to fluconazole and itraconazole, the most frequent"
		antifungals in use in the region suggests regular investigation into antifungal
		resistance in medical centers should be undertaken in order to promote the
		effective management of invasive candidiasis in HIV/AIDS patients.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: This retrospective study investigated clinical manifestations of
		candidemia caused by uncommon Candida species and antifungal susceptibility of
		the isolates in a regional hospital in Taiwan. METHODS: The uncommon Candida
		"species was initially defined as Candida species other than C. albicans, C."
		"tropicalis, C. glabrata complex, C. parapsilosis complex and C. krusei. All"
		uncommon Candida isolates were identified and confirmed by molecular methods.
		In vitro susceptibility testing of the uncommon Candida species to nine
		antifungal agents was conducted using the broth microdilution method with the
		"Sensititre YeastOne (SYO) system (Trek Diagnostic Systems, Ltd., East Grimstead,"
		"UK). RESULTS: Twenty-one patients, comprising 11 males and 10 females with a"
		"median age of 69 years, were recruited. Cancer (n = 11) was the most common"
		"underlying disease, 19 (90.5%) cases had prior antibiotic exposure, and only two"
		patients had prior antifungal use. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was
		"38.1% (n = 8). C. guilliermondii (n = 11) was the most common pathogen, followed"
		by C. curvata (n = 3). C. guilliermondii isolates exhibited relatively high rates
		of azole minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) above epidemiological cut-off
		"values (ECVs), whereas C. pelliculosa and C. lusitaniae isolates all remained"
		susceptible to azoles. All three C. curvata isolates had high caspofungin
		(>8 mg/L) and fluconazole MICs (8 mg/L) and could be defined as
		multidrug-resistant. CONCLUSIONS: Uncommon Candida species frequently exhibit
		high rates of non-susceptibility to antifungals. Identification of all Candida
		isolates at the species level from blood samples is of value for treatment.

AB	-	PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence of Candida auris candidaemia in our ICU
		patients and its molecular epidemiology. METHODS: A prospective observational
		study was conducted on candidaemia in our ICU patients over 18 months during
		"2016-2017. Demographics, underlying disease, risk factors, antifungal therapy and"
		outcome were studied. Risk factors of C. auris and non-auris candidaemia were
		"compared. RESULTS: During the study period, among 108 candidaemia cases recorded,"
		"the incidence was 6.75/1000 ICU bed days. C. auris topped the list (n = 42,"
		"39.9%), followed by C. tropicalis (34.3%), and C. parapsilosis (15.7%). On"
		"bivariate analysis prior antibiotic therapy, long central line days, mechanical"
		ventilation and length of ICU stay were significant risk factors for C. auris
		candidaemia compared to non-auris candidaemia. Multivariate analysis showed
		underlying respiratory and neurological diseases as significantly associated with
		"risk of C. auris candidaemia. Fluconazole, amphotericin B, and caspofungin"
		"resistance were noted in 97.0%, 93.7% and 3% of C. auris isolates respectively."
		"CONCLUSION: Longer duration of central line days, prior antibiotic use,"
		mechanical ventilation and prolonged ICU stay were important risk factors
		associated with C. auris candidaemia along with underlying respiratory or
		"neurological disease. The isolates are non-clonal in origin, but they belong to a"
		single clade.

		admitted patients. This infection is caused by a diverse range of Candida species
		having varied minimum inhibitory concentrations. OBJECTIVES: To identify Candida
		species causing bloodstream infections with their antifungal susceptibility
		determination. METHODS: Candida species isolated from the blood of ICU admitted
		patients were identified by phenotypic as well as by molecular methods including
		PCR-RFLP using MspI restriction enzyme and MALDI TOF MS. The minimum inhibitory
		"concentration of fluconazole, voriconazole, amphotericin B and caspofungin was"
		determined against isolated Candida species by CLSI M27A(3) guidelines. RESULTS:
		"A total of 119 Candida species were isolated. Among them, C. tropicalis(n=29) was"
		"the predominant isolate followed by C. parapsilosis(n=18), C. glabrata (n=12), C."
		krusei (n=11) and C. albicans(n=11). Uncommon Candida species isolated were;
		"Wickerhamomyces anomalus(n=15), Kodaemia ohmeri(n=8), C. lusitaniae (n=5) and C."
		auris (n=2). A varied antifungal MIC values were observed. Caspofungin had the
		lowest MIC among the tested antifungals. Increased fluconazole MIC was observed
		against the isolated Candida species including C. tropicalis. All the isolated C.
		lusitaniae and C. auris strains have ≥1mcg/ml amphotericin B MIC. In comparison
		"to fluconazole, voriconazole was more effective when tested in vitro. CONCLUSION:"
		Emergence of uncommon Candida species having varied antifungal MIC warns the
		"physicians to have a prompt, accurate identification with antifungal MIC"
		determination in each case of bloodstream Candida infections.

		candidemia in eleven medical centers.
PG	-	2816-23
AB	-	Candidemia studies have documented geographic differences in rates and
		"epidemiology, underscoring the need for surveillance to monitor trends. We"
		"conducted prospective candidemia surveillance in Brazil to assess the incidence,"
		"species distribution, frequency of antifungal resistance, and risk factors for"
		fluconazole-resistant Candida species. Prospective laboratory-based surveillance
		was conducted from March 2003 to December 2004 in 11 medical centers located in 9
		major Brazilian cities. A case of candidemia was defined as the isolation of
		"Candida spp. from a blood culture. Incidence rates were calculated per 1,000"
		"admissions and 1,000 patient-days. Antifungal susceptibility tests were performed"
		"by using the broth microdilution assay, according to the Clinical and Laboratory"
		"Standards Institute guidelines. We detected 712 cases, for an overall incidence"
		"of 2.49 cases per 1,000 admissions and 0.37 cases per 1,000 patient-days. The"
		"30-day crude mortality was 54%. C. albicans was the most common species (40.9%),"
		"followed by C. tropicalis (20.9%) and C. parapsilosis (20.5%). Overall, decreased"
		"susceptibility to fluconazole occurred in 33 (5%) of incident isolates, 6 (1%) of"
		which were resistant. There was a linear correlation between fluconazole and
		voriconazole MICs (r = 0.54 and P < 0.001 [Spearman's rho]). This is the largest
		multicenter candidemia study conducted in Latin America and shows the substantial
		"morbidity and mortality of candidemia in Brazil. Antifungal resistance was rare,"
		but correlation between fluconazole and voriconazole MICs suggests
		cross-resistance may occur.

LID	-	10.3855/jidc.4186 [doi]
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: This study was conducted to determine characteristics of Candida
		colonization and candidemia in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of a
		tertiary care children's hospital. METHODOLOGY: Patients between 6 months and 15
		years of age consecutively admitted to the PICU of Mansoura University Children's
		"Hospital in Mansoura, Egypt, during one year period, were evaluated for Candida"
		colonization and candidemia. Susceptibility of Candida species isolated from
		blood to fluconazole and amphotericin B was determined by Etest. RESULTS:
		Sixty-six patients without prior fluconazole prophylaxis had 88 episodes of
		"candidemia, representing 19% of all cases with blood stream infections (BSIs)."
		Candida albicans (CA) and non-albicans Candida (NAC) species accounted for 40%
		"and 60% of candidemia episodes respectively. C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, and"
		"C. glabrata accounted for 25%, 17%, and 8% of NAC candidemias respectively."
		Fluconazole resistance was detected in 11.4% and 18.9% of CA and NAC isolates
		"respectively. Of the fluconazole resistant NAC isolates, four were C. krusei."
		Amphotericin B resistance was detected in 17% of NAC isolates. Candida
		"colonization was detected in 78.8% of patients. Compared to CA candidemia, higher"
		"risk for NAC candidemia was associated with age older than 1 year, Candida"
		isolation from endotracheal tube (ETT) and from central venous catheter.
		"Mortality rate was 42.4%, attributable mortality of candidemia was 16.7%."
		Regression analysis showed that the most significant independent predictors of
		"death were ETT and mechanical ventilation (MV), MV longer than 7 days, and"
		candiduria. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents important epidemiological features
		of Candida BSIs in a non-neonatal population.

AB	-	This study aimed to describe the effect of initial antifungal therapy on patient
		mortality and to detail the current distribution and resistance patterns of
		Candida spp. among patients with candidaemia. A prospective observational study
		was performed among consecutive patients with candidaemia from 10 Turkish medical
		centres between January 2015 and November 2018. The primary outcome was 10-day
		mortality. Species were identified using MALDI-TOF/MS. A total of 342 patients
		"with candidaemia were included, of which 175 (51.2%) were male and 68 (19.9%)"
		"were aged <18 years. The most common species were Candida albicans (47.4%),"
		"Candida parapsilosis (26.6%), Candida tropicalis (9.6%) and Candida glabrata"
		"(7.6%). Among all Candida spp., the 10-day case fatality rate (CFR) was 32.2%."
		The CFR was highest in patients with C. albicans (57.3%) and lowest in patients
		with C. parapsilosis (21.8%). The resistance rate to fluconazole was 13% in C.
		"parapsilosis, with no significant effect on mortality. No resistance to"
		"echinocandins was detected. In the multivariate analysis, being in the ICU"
		"[OR = 2.1 (95% CI 1.32-3.57); P = 0.002], renal failure [OR = 2.4 (1.41-3.97);"
		"P = 0.001], total parenteral nutrition [OR = 2 (1.22-3.47); P = 0.006], C."
		albicans infection [OR = 1.7 (1.06-2.82); P = 0.027] and echinocandin as primary
		agent [OR = 0.6 (0.36-0.99); P = 0.047] were significantly associated with
		"mortality. Candidaemia is a deadly infection. Fluconazole resistance is emerging,"
		although it was not significantly related to mortality. Using an echinocandin as
		the primary agent could be life-saving.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: There are few epidemiological studies on candidaemia in the
		paediatric population in Spain. We sought to determine the epidemiology of
		"candidaemia in these patients. METHODS: Prospective, observational and"
		multicentre study in 44 Spanish hospitals. All candidaemia episodes in paediatric
		patients from 0 to 15 years old between January 2009 and February 2010 were
		studied. RESULTS: There were 197 episodes and 200 species were isolated. The most
		"frequent species was Candida parapsilosis sensu stricto (43%), followed by C."
		"albicans (36%), C. tropicalis (6%), C. orthopsilosis, and C. glabrata (4%)"
		"respectively. C. albicans was the most prevalent in newborns, and C. parapsilosis"
		"was most frequent in the other age groups. As regards the regions of Spain, C."
		"albicans was most prevalent in patients from Catalonia, the Balearic Islands and"
		"Canary Islands, and C. parapsilosis in patients from Andalusia, Castilla-León,"
		"Galicia, Valencia, and Madrid. The rate of resistance to fluconazole was 1.5%"
		(4.1% with the new species-specific Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute
		[CLSI] criteria). Fluconazole resistance was lower in neonates than the other age
		groups. The Neonatal Wards were the areas with most episodes (31.5%). In the
		"multivariate analysis, the variables associated independently with candidaemia"
		due to C. albicans were: catheter (OR: 5.967; 95% CI: 1.614-22.057; P=.007) and
		prematurity (OR: 2.229; 95% CI: 1.141- 4.631; P=.020). CONCLUSIONS: The
		"epidemiology of paediatric candidaemia varies between Spanish regions, but,"
		"globally, C. parapsilosis and C. albicans, are respectively, the first and second"
		"most frequently isolated species, and they show resistance rates to fluconazole"
		of less than 5%.

AB	-	Candidemia remains a major cause of disease worldwide and is associated with a
		high mortality rate. We conducted a retrospective study of candidemia at Nantes
		"Hospital, France, between 2004 and 2010. A total of 191 episodes (n = 188"
		"patients) were reviewed. Incidence, demographics, risk factors, antifungal"
		"management, species identification, in vitro susceptibility and 12 weeks survival"
		were analysed. Global incidence of candidemia was 0.37‰ admissions. Higher
		incidences were observed in haematology (6.65‰) and intensive care units (2‰).
		Central venous catheter and antibiotic exposure were the most frequent risk
		factors (77% and 76% respectively). Candida albicans was the predominant species
		"(51.8%) followed by C. parapsilosis (14.5%), C. glabrata (9.8%), C. tropicalis"
		"(9.8%) and C. krusei (4.1%). However, species distribution differed significantly"
		between medical units with frequency of C. tropicalis being higher in haematology
		compared to other medical units. Fluconazole and caspofungin were the main
		"antifungals given as first-line therapy. Although not significant, 12 weeks"
		"mortality rate was 30.9%, being higher for C. tropicalis (44.4%) than for C."
		parapsilosis (16%). Acquired azole or echinocandin resistance was noted in some
		"isolates, underlining the need for systematic antifungal susceptibility testing"
		in patients with candidemia. These epidemiological findings will be of interest
		for antifungal stewardship at our hospital.

TI	-	"Epidemiology, risk factors, and outcomes of Candida albicans versus non-albicans"
		candidemia in nonneutropenic patients.
PG	-	568-73
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candidemia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in
		hospitalized patients. OBJECTIVES: To describe the epidemiology of and risk
		factors for non-albicans candidemia (NAC) in nonneutropenic adults and the impact
		of NAC on patient outcomes and treatment cost. METHODS: We conducted a
		retrospective cohort analysis comparing demographics and risk factors for Candida
		albicans candidemia (CAC) versus NAC in 144 nonneutropenic patients with
		candidemia over a 6 year period (1997-2002) at Detroit Receiving Hospital.
		"RESULTS: Candida species distribution included albicans (50%), parapsilosis"
		"(13%), tropicalis (10%), and glabrata (13%). Predominant species varied by"
		"patient care unit, with C. glabrata more common in the medical intensive care"
		"unit (ICU) and C. parapsilosis in the burn ICU. In multivariate analysis, NAC was"
		"associated with the absence of antibiotic use at the onset of candidemia, recent"
		"history of solid tumor, and male sex. NAC was not associated with an increase in"
		"mortality or length of stay compared with CAC, but was found to have a higher"
		cost of antifungal therapy ($2030 vs $780; p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The
		epidemiology of candidemia is complex and varies among the different patient care
		"units. Specifically, patients appear less likely to develop NAC if they are"
		receiving antibiotics at the onset of candidemia. Increased awareness of risk
		factors for NAC can be used to guide adequate initial antifungal therapy.

		pregnant and non-pregnant women.
PG	-	89-97
AB	-	Pregnancy represents a risk factor in the occurrence of vaginal candidosis. The
		objectives of our study were: to make determination of the microscopic findings
		"of vaginal swab, frequency of Candida species in the culture of pregnant women"
		"and patients who are not pregnant, determine the Candida species in all cultures,"
		and to determine the frequency and differences in the frequency of C. albicans
		"and other non-albicans species. In one year study performed during 2006 year, we"
		tested patients of Gynaecology and Obstetrics clinic of the Clinical Centre in
		Sarajevo and Gynaecology department of the General hospital in Sarajevo. 447
		woman included in the study were separated in two groups: 203 pregnant (in the
		"last trimester of pregnancy), and 244 non-pregnant woman in period of fertility."
		"Each vaginal swab was examined microscopically. The yeast, number of colonies,"
		and the species of Candida were determined on Sabouraud dextrose agar with
		"presence of antibiotics. For determination of Candida species, we used germ tube"
		"test for detection of C. albicans, and cultivation on the selective medium and"
		assimilation tests for detection of non-albicans species. The results indicated
		"positive microscopic findings in the test group (40,9%), as well as greater"
		"number of positive cultures (46,8%). The most commonly detected species for both"
		"groups was C. albicans ( test group 40.9% and control group 23,0%). The most"
		"commonly detected non-albicans species for the test group were C. glabrata (4,2"
		"%) and C. krusei (3,2%), and for the control group were C. glabrata (3,2%) and C."
		"parapsilosis (3,2%). The microscopic findings correlated with the number of"
		"colonies in positive cultures. In the test group, we found an increased number of"
		"yeasts (64,3%), and the pseudopyphae and blastopores by microscopic examination"
		"as an indication of infection. In the control group, we found a small number of"
		"yeasts (64,6%) , in the form of blastopores, as an indication of the candida"
		"colonisation. Our results indicate that gravidity, as the risc factor for"
		"incidence of infection, has the significant role in the incidence of vaginal"
		candidosis.

		parapsilosis is a commensal of human skin and can be acquired by nosocomial
		"spread. Necrotizing fasciitis due to Candida has rarely been reported, but to"

		necrotizing fasciitis. This is the first documented case of human periocular soft
		"tissue infection by C. parapsilosis, and also the first report providing evidence"
		of mycotic infection in a necrotizing fasciitis concurrently infected by

		antifungal agents. The GenMark Dx ePlex investigational use only blood culture
		identification fungal pathogen panel (BCID-FP) rapidly detects 15 fungal targets
		simultaneously in blood culture samples positive for fungi by Gram staining. We
		aimed to determine the performance of the BCID-FP in a multicenter clinical
		study. Blood culture samples collected at 10 United States sites and tested with
		BCID-FP at 4 sites were compared to the standard-of-care microbiological and
		"biochemical techniques, fluorescence in situ hybridization using peptide nucleic"

		bi-directional PCR/sequencing of residual blood culture samples. A total of 866
		"clinical samples, 120 retrospectively and 21 prospectively collected, along with"
		725 contrived samples were evaluated. Sensitivity and specificity of detection of
		"Candida species (C. albicans, C. auris, C. dubliniensis, C. famata, C. glabrata,"
		"C. guilliermondii, C. kefyr, C. krusei, C. lusitaniae, C. parapsilosis, and C."
		"tropicalis) ranged from 97.1 to 100% and 99.8 to 100%, respectively. For the"
		"other organism targets, sensitivity and specificity were as follows: 100% each"
		"for Cryptococcus neoformans and C. gattii, 98.6% and 100% for Fusarium spp., and"
		"96.2% and 99.9% for Rhodotorula spp., respectively. In 4 of the 141 clinical"
		"samples, the BCID-FP panel correctly identified an additional Candida species,"
		undetected by standard-of-care methods. The BCID-FP panel offers a faster
		turnaround time for identification of fungal pathogens in positive blood cultures
		"that may allow for earlier antifungal interventions and includes C. auris, a"
		highly multidrug-resistant fungus.

		central venous catheters and the hands of healthcare workers.
PG	-	243-9
AB	-	"A cluster of six cases of fungemia among hematology, bone marrow transplant, and"
		oncology patients was investigated in a case-control study (18 controls). The use
		of implantable and semi-implantable central venous catheters was significantly
		associated with cases (p = 0.016). The hands of three healthcare workers (HCWs)
		were positive for Candida parapsilosis. Electrophoretic karyotyping showed two
		"profiles among patients and HCWs, and five among six unrelated strains. The"
		profiles of two HCWs matched the ones of the patients they had handled. The
		"patients' strains were moderate or strong slime producers, whereas none of the"
		"HCWs' were strong producers. In conclusion, our results indicated the occurrence"
		of an outbreak C. parapsilosis fungemia related to long-term central venous
		catheters in which the hands of HCWs were implicated. The amount of slime
		production might be associated with the pathogenicity of the strains.

TI	-	Prevalence and antifungal susceptibility of Candida species in a tertiary care
		"hospital in Islamabad, Pakistan."
PG	-	986-991
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and antifungal susceptibility pattern of
		"Candida species. METHODS: This prospective, cross-sectional study was conducted"
		"at the Quaid-e-Azam International Hospital, Islamabad, Pakistan, from January"
		"2014 to February 2015, and comprised different clinical samples which were"
		analysed for various types of microbial infections. Species differentiation was
		confirmed by biochemical and molecular methods. Antifungal susceptibility against
		"amphotericin B, fluconazole and voriconazole was determined by Clinical and"
		Laboratory Standards Institute M44-A disk diffusion method. RESULTS: Of the 219
		"Candida isolates, majority of them were isolated from urine 78(35.6%) and vaginal"
		"swabs 59(26.9%). Moreover, 144(65.8%) samples were of females and 75(34.2%) were"
		of males. Candida albicans 128(58.45%) was the most predominant species followed
		"by Candida glabrata 30(13.69%), Candida tropicalis 26(11.87%), Candida krusei"
		"17(7.76%), Candida parapsilosis 12(5.47%), Candida dubliniensis 3(1.37%) and"
		Candida lusitaniae 3(1.37). All isolates were least susceptible to amphotericin B
		with a susceptibility rate of 213(97.26%). The highest resistance was found for
		voriconazole 40(18.26%) compared to fluconazole 32(14.61%). CONCLUSIONS: Candida
		species possessed high resistance rate against various antifungal agents.

		pediatric population.
PG	-	664-8
LID	-	10.1097/INF.0b013e318213da0f [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Non-albicans Candida (NAC) species have been implicated as major
		pathogens in patients with hospital-acquired candidemia. Few studies have
		investigated the impact of NAC fungemia among pediatric patients outside of the
		"neonatal age group. MATERIALS/METHODS: Between 2000 and 2009, we performed a"
		retrospective case-control study in children aged 6 months to ≤18 years with
		"blood culture proven candidemia at Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX."
		RESULTS: A total of 276 episodes of candidemia occurred in 226 patients. The
		overall incidence ranged between 0.06 and 0.3 per 1000 inpatient days. The median
		"patient age was 50 months (range, 6 months to ≤18 years) with 55.4% males; 40.2%"
		Hispanics; and 31.8% whites. Candida albicans (CA) was the most common (44.2%)
		"species although, collectively, NAC was more frequently (55.8%) isolated. Among"
		"the NAC group, Candida parapsilosis was most common (23.9%) followed by Candida"
		"tropicalis (14.8%), Candida glabrata (6.5%), and Candida lusitaniae (5.4%). No"
		"difference was found between CA and NAC candidemia in terms of demographics,"
		"underlying diagnosis, risk factors, clinical features, dissemination, or 30-day"
		mortality. Disseminated candidiasis was independently associated with the use of
		"vasopressors (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 4.58; confidence interval [CI]:"
		"1.03-20.5; P = 0.05), prolonged fungemia (≥3 days of persistently positive"
		"cultures) after catheter removal (OR, 3.2; CI: 1.08-9.3; P = 0.04), and"
		"neutropenia (OR, 4.06; CI: 1.2-13.2; P = 0.02), but not with NAC fungemia."
		"CONCLUSIONS: Though CA was the single most common species, NAC species"
		collectively have emerged as the predominant pathogens responsible for candidemia
		"in non-neonatal patients at our institution. Risk factors, clinical features, and"
		outcomes were not different between the 2 groups.

		study.
PG	-	156-61
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To determine risk factors for late-onset candidemia among infants in
		the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). STUDY DESIGN: We performed a matched
		case-control study from March 2001 to January 2003 in 2 level III-IV NICUs. Case
		subjects had candidemia diagnosed more than 48 hours after hospitalization.
		"Control subjects (3 per case) were matched by study site, birth weight, study"
		"year, and date of enrollment. Potential risk factors included medical devices,"
		"medications, gastrointestinal (GI) pathology (congenital anomalies or necrotizing"
		enterocolitis) and previous bacterial bloodstream infections (BSIs). RESULTS:
		Forty-five cases of candidemia occurred during the study period and accounted for
		"15% of BSIs. C. albicans caused 62% of infections (28/45); C. parapsilosis, 31%"
		(14/45). Multivariate analysis revealed that catheter use (odds ratio [OR]=1.06
		"per day of use; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.02 to 1.10), previous bacterial"
		BSIs (OR=8.02; 95% CI=2.76 to 23.30) and GI pathology (OR=4.57; 95% CI=1.62 to
		"12.92) were significantly associated with candidemia. In all, 26/45 cases (58%)"
		of candidemia occurred in infants who would not have qualified for fluconazole
		prophylaxis according to the Kaufman criteria. CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed previous
		risk factors (catheter-days) and identified novel risk factors (previous BSI and
		GI pathology) for candidemia in critically ill infants that could guide future
		targeted antifungal prophylaxis strategies.

		"logistic regression models were performed using ICI by Candida spp., Candida"
		"albicans, Candida parapsilosis or Candida tropicalis as dependent variables."
		Scores were constructed. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty five ICI (47 C.
		"albicans, 37 C. parapsilosis, 19 C. tropicalis and 22 others) and 1022 controls"
		"were included. Incidence (cases/100 PICU admissions): 4.22 (all Candida), 2.44"
		"(C. albicans), 1.41 (C. parapsilosis), 0.19 (C. tropicalis). ICI was associated"
		"[Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) = 0.764, 95%"

		"0.001) with chronic metabolic disease (OR = 10.7; score:+4), surgical digestive"
		"process (OR = 2.8; +1), fever (OR = 2.8; +1) and parenteral nutrition (OR = 2.3;"
		"+1); C. parapsilosis ICI (AUC = 0.808, 95% CI = 0.739-0.877, P < 0.001) with"
		"previous colonization (OR = 7.1; score:+3), tracheostomy (OR = 5.1; +2),"
		"parenteral nutrition (OR = 4.3; +2), thrombopenia (OR = 3.6; +1) and previous"
		"bacterial infection (OR = 3.0; +1) and ICI by C. tropicalis (AUC = 0.941, 95%"
		"CI=0.886-0.995, P < 0.001) with thrombopenia (OR = 53.8; score: +10), neutropenia"
		"(OR = 7.2; +1), pre-PICU hospitalization ≥ 15 days (OR = 17.2; +3) and"
		hematologic (OR = 22.4; +4) and cardiovascular infectious processes (OR = 5.5;
		"+1). Specificity was >90% for cut offs of 5 (all Candida), 3 (C. albicans), 3 (C."
		"parapsilosis) and 11 (C. tropicalis). CONCLUSIONS: Once validated, these scores"
		may help for identification of ICI by specific species allowing adequate

TI	-	Clinical profile and risk factors for oral candidosis in sick newborns.
PG	-	299-303
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To provide the clinical profile and assess the significance of
		various risk factors contributing to the occurrence of oral candidosis in
		newborns. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Neonatal Intensive Care Unit
		(NICU). SUBJECTS: Twenty newborns with oral candidosis and an equal number of age
		and weight matched controls. INTERVENTIONS: All cases of oral candidosis were
		treated with local application of 1% Clotrimazole. RESULTS: Oral candidosis was
		documented in 3.2% (20/650) cases in the NICU. Acute pseudomembranous candidosis
		was the most common presentation. The mean age of onset was 10.5 days. Candida
		"albicans was isolated in 50% cases in addition to C. tropicalis, C."
		"paratropicalis, C. krusei, C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis. On univariate"
		"analysis, male sex, birth asphyxia and prolonged antibiotic therapy had a"
		significant correlation with occurence of oral candidosis in neonates. Out of
		"these, birth asphyxia was the only factor significantly associated with oral"
		"candidosis (OR 8.09, 95% CI 1.34-48.8, p = 0.0226) on multivariate analysis."
		CONCLUSIONS: C. albicans was the predominant isolate in this series of oral
		candidosis. Clinical manifestations were evident in the second week of life and
		birth asphyxia was the most important associated perinatal event.

OAB	-	"During February-September 1992, all 650 infants admitted to the neonatal"
		intensive care unit of the University College of Medical Sciences and G.T.B.
		Hospital were screened for oral thrush. A case control study was conducted to
		determine risk factors for oral candidiasis in newborns. The rate of oral
		candidiasis in this population was 3.2% (20 cases). The most common pathogen was
		Candida albicans (50%). All but 1 oral thrush case had acute pseudomembranous
		candidiasis. 75% of oral thrush cases were asymptomatic. Mean age of onset was
		"10.4 days (median, 9.5 days). Clotrimazole solution was applied to oral lesions"
		of all oral thrush cases. The multiple logistic regression revealed that birth
		asphyxia was the only significant factor responsible for oral thrush in newborns
		(odds ratio = 8.09; p = 0.0226). These findings show that the most important
		perinatal event associated with oral thrush in newborns was birth asphyxia.

		care unit: a retrospective cohort study.
PG	-	10
LID	-	10.1186/1471-2334-13-10 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: The incidence of fungal healthcare-associated infection (HAI) has
		increased in a major teaching hospital in the northern part of Taiwan over the
		"past decade, especially in the intensive care units (ICUs). The purpose of this"
		study was to determine the factors that were responsible for the outbreak and
		trend in the ICU. METHODS: Surveillance fungal cultures were obtained from
		"""sterile"" objects, antiseptic solutions, environment of infected patients and"
		"hands of medical personnel. Risk factors for comparison included age, gender,"
		"admission service, and total length of stay in the ICU, Acute Physiology and"
		"Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores at admission to the ICU, main"
		"diagnosis on ICU admission, use of invasive devices, receipt of hemodialysis,"
		"total parenteral nutrition (TPN) use, history of antibiotic therapy before HAI or"
		"during ICU stay in no HAI group, and ICU discharge status (ie, dead or alive)."
		Univariable analysis followed by multiple logistic regression analysis was
		performed to identify the independent risk factors for ICU fungal HAIs and ICU
		mortality. RESULTS: There was a significant trend in ICU fungal HAIs from 1998 to
		2009 (P < 0.001). A total of 516 episodes of ICU fungal HAIs were identified; the
		"rates of various infections were urinary tract infection (UTI) (54.8%), blood"
		"stream infection (BSI) (30.6%), surgical site infection (SSI) (6.6%), pneumonia"
		"(4.5%), other sites (3.5%). The fungi identified were: yeasts (54.8%), Candida"
		"albicans (27.3%), Candida tropicalis (6.6%), Candida glabrata (6.6%), Candida"
		"parapsilosis (1.9%), Candida species (0.8%), and other fungi (1.9%). Candida"
		albicans accounted for 63% of all Candida species. Yeasts were found in the
		environment of more heavily infected patients. The independent risk factors (P <
		"0.05) of developing ICU fungal HAIs from all sites were TPN use, sepsis, surgical"
		"patients, mechanical ventilation and an indwelling urinary catheter. The"
		"independent risk factors for ICU fungal UTI included TPN use, mechanical"
		ventilation and an indwelling urinary catheter. The independent risk factors for
		"ICU fungal BSI included TPN use, sepsis, and higher APACHE II score. The"
		"independent risk factors for ICU fungal pneumonia included TPN use, surgical"
		patients. The independent risk factors for ICU fungal SSI included surgical
		"patients, and TPN use. The odds ratios of TPN use in various infection types"
		ranged from 3.51 to 8.82. The risk of mortality in patients with ICU fungal HAIs
		was over 2 times that of patients without ICU HAIs in the multiple logistic
		regression analysis (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: There was a secular trend of an
		increasing number of fungal HAIs in our ICU over the past decade. Patients with
		ICU fungal HAIs had a significantly higher mortality rate than did patients
		without ICU HAIs. Total parenteral nutrition was a significant risk factor for
		"all types of ICU fungal HAIs, and its use should be monitored closely."

AB	-	We conducted this cross-sectional retrospective study using clinical and
		"laboratory data from two tertiary hospitals in Cuiabá, Mato Grosso, Brazil, in"
		"order to explore the risk factors and estimate mortality, prevalence and"
		lethality of candidemia between 2006 and 2011. A total of 130 episodes of
		"candidemia were identified. The prevalence of candidemia was 1.8 per 1,000"
		"admissions, the mortality rate was 0.9 per 1,000 admissions, and the lethality"
		"was 49.2 %. The main agent in this population was Candida parapsilosis (n = 50),"
		followed by C. albicans (n = 45). Comparison between the numbers of episodes in
		the two triennia revealed that the non-albicans group grew by 48.2 %. The
		distribution of yeast species of Candida per hospital unit revealed that C.
		albicans was more prevalent than C. parapsilosis in the adult ICU and C.
		parapsilosis was more prevalent than C. albicans in the neonatal ICU. Patients
		"remained hospitalized for an average of 53.5 days. Central venous catheters,"
		parenteral nutrition and age were the variables that proved to be independent in
		the multivariate analysis and that maintained a statistically significant
		association with the incidence of death in patients with candidemia. The annual
		prevalence of candidemia showed a significant increase in the second triennium
		(2009-2011) compared with the first (2006-2008) probably due to increased
		"exposure to risk factors: central venous catheter, H2 blockers, nutrition"
		parenteral corticosteroids and mean hospital duration.

PG	-	83-9
LID	-	10.1111/j.1600-0714.2010.00937.x [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the epidemiology of oral
		yeast colonization and infection amongst cancer patients. METHODS: Patients with
		"solid tumor, head-neck cancer or hematological malignancy were recruited into the"
		"study. Demographic data on age, gender, type of cancer, preceding treatment with"
		"antibiotics, anti-fungal agents, chemotherapy, radiation or surgery and presence"
		of dentures were recorded on admission. Oral examination and microbial swabs were
		"obtained and yeast culture, identification and antifungal susceptibility"
		performed. RESULTS: Oral yeast colonization was prevalent in 56.8% (227/400) of
		all cancer patients and 18.9% (43/227) of those had clinical and microbiological
		evidence of infection. The incidence of oral candidiasis in yeast colonized
		patients was highest in head neck cancer (29.2%) followed by hematological
		malignancies (20.5%) and solid tumor (17%) patients. Age and dentures were
		identified as independent risk factors associated with yeast carriage. Candida
		albicans was the dominant (74%) species (497.5 per 1000 cancer admissions)
		"followed by C. glabrata (11.5%), C. tropicalis (2.6%), C. krusei (2.6%) and C."
		parapsilosis (1.9%). The overall resistance to azoles was 28.2% (75/266).
		"Resistance to specific drugs was seen for fluconazole (4.5%), itraconazole"
		"(11.7%), ketoconazole (11.3%), voriconazole (0.75%) and caspofungin (41.1%) but"
		none to amphotericin B or nystatin. CONCLUSIONS: The highest incidence of oral
		candidiasis amongst cancer patients was seen in head neck cancers. The majority
		of infections were caused by C. albicans but almost one third of patients
		harbored non-C. albicans strains such as C. glabrata which were often more
		resistant to anti-fungal agents.

TI	-	Candida arthritis in adult patients who are not intravenous drug addicts: report
		of three cases and review of the literature.
PG	-	224-41
AB	-	"Candida species are an uncommon cause of infectious arthritis, although the"
		frequency has increased during recent years. Three cases of septic arthritis
		"caused by Candida species are reported, and the literature is reviewed. The first"
		patient developed a popliteal cyst infected by Candida albicans after multiple
		intravenous antibiotic treatments. The second patient had acute myelogenous
		"leukemia and experienced knee arthritis after chemotherapy, and the third"
		suffered oligoarthritis after a second heart transplantation. All patients
		received treatment with a standard dose of intravenous amphotericin B. Responses
		were achieved only in the first two cases; the third patient died despite
		"therapy. Thirty-six previously reported Candida arthritis cases are reviewed, and"
		"epidemiologic, diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic features are analyzed."
		Cases are divided into two categories: direct inoculation of fungus and
		hematogenously disseminated disease; these two categories are compared in terms
		"of sex, age, pathogen species, treatment, and survival. Arthritis induced through"
		"direct inoculation of fungus is seen in older individuals, is more frequently"
		"produced by species other than C albicans (Candida parapsilosis especially), and"
		has a better prognosis than arthritis caused by disseminated candidiasis.
		Arthritis can be resolved even in the persistence of the systemic disease. It is
		believed that the first case of Baker's cyst infected by C albicans and the first
		case of Candida arthritis in a heart transplant patient are reported here.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Surveillance of current changes in the epidemiology of Invasive
		Fungal Diseases (IFDs) as an important component of the antifungal stewardship
		"programs (ASP), requires careful regular monitoring, especially in high-risk"
		settings such as oncology centers. This study aimed to examine Candida
		colonization status and corresponding current changes in children with malignancy
		during repeated admissions and also investigate the possible epidemiological
		shifts after the implementation of ASP. METHODS: In this prospective
		"observational study, all eligible patients younger than 18 years were recruited"
		"during 2016-2017 at Amir Medical Oncology Center (AMOC) in Shiraz, Iran. Totally,"
		136 patients were enrolled and 482 samples were collected from different sites
		"(oral/nasal discharges, urine and stool). Weekly regular sampling was carried out"
		during hospitalization. Candida colonization status and epidemiological changes
		were monitored during repeated admissions. Samples were cultivated on Sabouraud
		Dextrose agar medium and identified by Polymerase Chain Reaction -Restriction
		Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). RESULTS: Estimated Candida colonization
		incidence was 59.9% (82/136) in our patients. Candida colonization was found to
		be higher in oral cavity and rectum than that in nasal cavity. Among those
		"long-term follow ups and repetitive hospitalizations, a significant number of"
		patients exhibited changes in their colonization patterns (37.7%). Candida
		"colonization did not reveal any significant relationship with age, sex, oncologic"
		diseases and degree of neutropenia. C. albicans (72.0%) was found as the most
		"common Candida species in colonized patients, followed by C. krusei, C. kefyr, C."
		glabrata and C. parapsilosis. CONCLUSION: Given the high incidence of Candida
		"infections in children with cancers, close monitoring of epidemiologic changes is"
		"essential for judicious management, based on local surveillance data and"
		improvement of overall quality of care in high risk patients.

		cardiac transplantation.
PG	-	1333-7
AB	-	Acalculous cholecystitis is a life-threatening complication in critically ill
		surgical patients. Whereas Candida albicans and Torulopsis glabrata have been
		reported as the primary pathogens in 14 previous cases of acalculous
		"cholecystitis, we report the first case of Candida parapsilosis as a biliary"
		pathogen in a patient after cardiac transplantation. Although cardiac transplant
		recipients often have many of the risk factors for acalculous candidal
		"cholecystitis, including major surgery, immunosuppression, antibiotic therapy,"
		"parenteral nutrition, and prolonged intensive care unit stay, this entity has not"
		"been previously reported in the cardiac transplant population. Although rare,"
		acalculous candidal cholecystitis is associated with very high morbidity and a
		mortality rate of 40%. Early diagnosis necessitates an aggressive approach to the
		critically ill patient with abdominal complaints. Prompt drainage or
		"cholecystectomy, if possible, represent the mainstays of therapy and offer the"
		greatest chance for survival.

TI	-	Low rate of Candida parapsilosis-related colonization and infection in
		hospitalized preterm infants: a one-year prospective study.
PG	-	193-7
AB	-	We determined the rate of Candida parapsilosis colonization in preterm neonates
		(NN) and the relationship between colonization and systemic infection through a
		prospective study in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of a university hospital.
		All NN born at a gestational age of 32 weeks or less were included. Specimens
		"from rectum, mouth and retro-auricular skin were obtained at admission and weekly"
		"thereafter. All samples were inoculated on to Sabouraud agar, CHROMagar and Dixon"
		media. Candida species were identified using API Candida and API 20C. DNA
		analysis was performed using pulse field gel electrophoresis.Fifty-four patients
		were included (mean age: 30 +/- 1.5 weeks; mean birthweight: 1347 +/- 301 g;
		male: 40%). Fungal colonization was detected in 43 (79.6%). Causative agents were
		"C. parapsilosis (N= 7);Malassezia furfur (N= 30);C. albicans (N= 21), C."
		guillermondii (N= 1). No sample was positive for two different yeasts at the same
		"time. C. parapsilosis colonization included anal (N= 6), buccal (N= 1), and skin"
		(N= 2). The average age at time of colonization was 17.8+/-9.8 days. Neither
		fungal septicaemia nor death were observed in colonized infants. Two central
		"venous catheters were found to be colonized, one with C. parapsilosis and one"
		with M. furfur. Logistic regression showed a link between colonization and
		gestational age alone. Three different DNA profiles were observed. This study
		"suggests that in our units, the occurrence of C. parapsilosis colonization is low"
		and bears no relation to systemic infection. The systematic identification of C.
		parapsilosis carriers for the purposes of isolation and preventive treatment does
		not appear to be warranted.

AB	-	Candida parapsilosis is an emerging fungal pathogen that was once thought to be
		solely a colonizing organism. C. parapsilosis is increasingly becoming reported
		as the most common Candida species that causes onychomycosis. Clinical findings
		include typically severe dystrophy of the nail fold and plate as well as
		"thickening and fragmentation of the plate, particularly in the distal plate. We"
		present a unique case of C. parapsilosis infection of the nail bed without
		infection of the nail plate and with twenty-nail melanonychia.

AB	-	The low incidence of mixed candidaemia (MC) may have precluded a better knowledge

		"factors, clinical presentation and prognosis of MC episodes. A comparison between"
		MC and monomicrobial candidaemia within a prospective programme on candidaemia
		was performed in 29 hospitals between April 2010 and May 2011. In fifteen
		"episodes of candidaemia corresponding to 15 patients, out of 752, two species of"
		Candida (1.9%) were isolated. MC was more frequent in patients with HIV infection
		"(12%, P = 0.038) and those admitted due to extensive burns (23%, P = 0.012). The"
		Candida species most frequently identified in MC were C. albicans 12 patients
		"(40%), C. glabrata seven patients (23.3%) and C. parapsilosis six patients (20%)."
		"Early mortality was higher (nine patients, 60%) in patients with MC than in"
		"patients with MMC (223 patients, 30.3%, P = 0.046). In conclusion, MC was was"
		independently associated with increased mortality even after considering other
		prognostic factors. MC is an infrequent event that is more common in HIV
		"infection and in patients suffering from burns, and is associated with increased"
		mortality.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive Candida bloodstream infections are frequent and display high
		mortality in clinical practice. There is scarce published on this topic in
		Central America. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the epidemiology of candidemia in a
		hospital setting in Costa Rica. METHODS: 210 cases of nosocomial candidemia were
		"analyzed in patients over 17 years of age, admitted to Hospital Mexico, between"
		2007 and 2011. Descriptive and temporary analyses were performed and the risk
		factors associated with C. parapsilosis and survival were evaluated. RESULTS: The
		"incidence rate of candidemia was 1.47 cases per 1,000 admissions. The"
		"non-albicans Candida represented 62% of the isolated yeasts. Except for 2009, C."
		parapsilosis was the most commonly isolated species in four out of the five years
		"reviewed, followed by C. albicans. There was a strong association between C."
		"parapsilosis, the presence of a central venous catheter (OR: 4.8, CI 95%:"
		"1.8-14.6, p < 0.001) and the use of parenteral nutrition (p: 0.008). The 30-day"
		mortality was 50%. Candida albicans displayed the highest mortality and C.
		parapsilosis the lowest. Patients who did not receive anti-fungal treatment
		showed a significantly higher probability of death. CONCLUSIONS: The high
		incidence of candidemia from C. parapsilosis is directly related to the use of
		central venous catheters and parenteral nutrition. There is a need for creating
		local guidelines addressing the use of central venous catheters and parenteral
		"nutrition, as well as implementing hand hygiene protocols."

PG	-	1043-1045
AB	-	PURPOSE: To characterize the clinical features and therapeutic outcome of Candida
		"keratitis. DESIGN: Retrospective, observational case series. METHODS: We reviewed"
		"26 patients treated for Candida keratitis, including two with recurrent keratitis"
		and one with bilateral infection. RESULTS: Of 29 keratitis episodes resulting
		"from Candida albicans (n = 20) or Candida parapsilosis (n = 9), 16 (55%)"
		"complicated chronic ocular surface disease, and nine (31%) followed previous"
		keratoplasty. Only two were clinically suspected to have keratomycosis at initial
		"presentation, and 21 (72%) used antibacterial therapy before corneal scrapings."
		Reconstructive keratoplasty occurred more often in previously grafted eyes (P =
		.03). Visual outcome was 20/60 or better in six (100%) medically treated eyes
		with good presenting visual acuity but in only five eyes (24%) with worse initial
		vision (P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: Candida keratitis is an opportunistic infection
		"of a compromised cornea that often is misdiagnosed initially and, despite"
		"antifungal therapy, occasionally requires corneal grafting."

AB	-	BACKGROUND: To characterize and identify prognostic factors for 28-day mortality
		among patients with hospital-acquired fungemia (HAF) in the Intensive Care Unit
		"(ICU). METHODS: A sub-analysis of a prospective, multicenter non-representative"
		cohort study conducted in 162 ICUs in 24 countries. RESULTS: Of the 1156 patients
		with hospital-acquired bloodstream infections (HA-BSI) included in the EUROBACT
		"study, 96 patients had a HAF. Median time to its diagnosis was 20 days (IQR"
		"10.5-30.5) and 9 days (IQR 3-15.5) after hospital and ICU admission,"
		respectively. Median time to positivity of blood culture was longer in fungemia
		than in bacteremia (48.7 h vs. 38.1 h; p = 0.0004). Candida albicans was the most
		"frequent fungus isolated (57.1%), followed by Candida glabrata (15.3%) and"
		Candida parapsilosis (10.2%). No clear source of HAF was detected in 33.3% of the
		episodes and it was catheter-related in 21.9% of them. Compared to patients with
		"bacteremia, HAF patients had a higher rate of septic shock (39.6% vs. 21.6%; p ="
		0.0003) and renal dysfunction (25% vs. 12.4%; p = 0.0023) on admission and a
		higher rate of renal failure (26% vs. 16.2%; p = 0.0273) at diagnosis. Adequate
		treatment started within 24 h after blood culture collection was less frequent in
		HAF patients (22.9% vs. 55.3%; p < 0.001). The 28-day all cause fatality was
		"40.6%. According to multivariate analysis, only liver failure (OR 14.35; 95% CI"
		"1.17-175.6; p = 0.037), need for mechanical ventilation (OR 8.86; 95% CI"
		1.2-65.24; p = 0.032) and ICU admission for medical reason (OR 3.87; 95% CI
		1.25-11.99; p = 0.020) were independent predictors of 28-day mortality in HAF
		patients. CONCLUSIONS: Fungi are an important cause of hospital-acquired BSI in
		the ICU. Patients with HAF present more frequently with septic shock and renal
		dysfunction on ICU admission and have a higher rate of renal failure at
		"diagnosis. HAF are associated with a significant 28-day mortality rate (40%), but"
		delayed adequate antifungal therapy was not an independent risk factor for death.
		"Liver failure, need for mechanical ventilation and ICU admission for medical"
		reason were the only independent predictors of 28-day mortality.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: The incidence of candidemia is increasing in developing countries.
		Very little is known about the epidemiology of candidemia in Peru. The aim of
		"this study is to describe the incidence, microbiology, clinical presentation and"
		outcomes of Candida bloodstream infections in three Lima-Callao hospitals.
		METHODS: Candida spp. isolates were identified prospectively at participant
		hospitals between November 2013 and January 2015. Susceptibility testing for
		"amphotericin B, fluconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole and anidulafungin was"
		performed using broth microdilution method. Clinical information was obtained
		from medical records and evaluated. RESULTS: We collected information on 158
		"isolates and 157 patients. Median age of patients was 55.0 yrs., and 64.1% were"
		males. Thirty-eight (24.2%) episodes of candidemia occurred in those <18 yrs. The
		frequency of non-Candida albicans was 72.1%. The most frequently recovered
		"species were C. albicans (n = 44, 27.8%), C. parapsilosis (n = 40, 25.3%), C."
		"tropicalis (n = 39, 24.7%) and C. glabrata (n = 15, 9.5%). Only four isolates"
		"were resistant to fluconazole, 86.7% (n = 137) were susceptible and 17 were"
		susceptible-dose dependent. Decreased susceptibility to posaconazole was also
		"observed in three isolates, and one to voriconazole. All isolates were"
		susceptible to anidulafungin and amphotericin B. The most commonly associated
		"co-morbid conditions were recent surgery (n = 61, 38.9%), mechanical ventilation"
		"(n = 60, 38.2%) and total parenteral nutrition (n = 57, 36.3%). The incidence of"
		"candidemia by center ranged between 1.01 and 2.63 cases per 1,000 admissions,"
		with a global incidence of 2.04. Only 28.1% of cases received treatment within 72
		"hrs. of diagnosis. Overall, the 30-day survival was 60.4% (treated subjects,"
		"67.4%; not-treated patients, 50.9%). CONCLUSIONS: We found a very high proportion"
		"of non-albicans Candida species. Despite this, the decreased"
		susceptibility/resistance to fluconazole was only 13.3% and not seen in the other
		"antifungals. Overall, the incidence of candidemia mortality was high when"
		"compared to other international studies. It is possible, that the delay in"
		"initiating antifungal treatment contributed to the elevated mortality rate, in"
		spite of low antifungal resistance.

AB	-	Abstract We conducted a four-year (2003-2006) retrospective study of yeasts
		recovered in a hospital laboratory in the centre of Portugal to evaluate the
		epidemiology of yeast infections. Clinical isolates and data were gathered from
		751 patients corresponding to 906 episodes of yeast infection. The isolates were
		"first identified using classical and commercial methods, routinely employed at"
		the hospital laboratory. We then re-identified the same isolates using RFLP of
		the ITS 5.8S rRNA gene and sequence of the D1/D2 domain of the 26S rRNA gene.
		Candida parapsilosis isolates were re-identified using the Ban I digestion of the
		SADH gene. C. albicans was the most frequently isolated of the yeasts found in
		"the analysed specimens, with an overall incidence of 69.6% and then in decreasing"
		"order, C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis and C. krusei. C. parapsilosis"
		"was most frequently recovered from younger patients, decreasing with age, while"
		C. glabrata occurrence increased with age. We found an increased number of cases
		"of fungemia per 100,000 people per year, reaching a maximum of 4.4 during 2006."

TI	-	Time to initiation of fluconazole therapy impacts mortality in patients with
		candidemia: a multi-institutional study.
PG	-	25-31
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Inadequate antimicrobial treatment is an independent determinant of
		"hospital mortality, and fungal bloodstream infections are among the types of"
		infection with the highest rates of inappropriate initial treatment. Because of
		"significant potential for reducing high mortality rates, we sought to assess the"
		impact of delayed treatment across multiple study sites. The goals our analyses
		were to establish the frequency and duration of delayed antifungal treatment and
		to evaluate the relationship between treatment delay and mortality. METHODS: We
		conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with candidemia from 4 medical
		centers who were prescribed fluconazole. Time to initiation of fluconazole
		therapy was calculated by subtracting the date on which fluconazole therapy was
		initiated from the culture date of the first blood sample positive for yeast.
		"RESULTS: A total of 230 patients (51% male; mean age +/- standard deviation, 56"
		+/- 17 years) were identified; 192 of these had not been given prior treatment
		with fluconazole. Patients most commonly had nonsurgical hospital admission (162
		"patients [70%]) with a central line catheter (193 [84%]), diabetes (68 [30%]), or"
		cancer (54 [24%]). Candida species causing infection included Candida albicans
		"(129 patients [56%]), Candida glabrata (38 [16%]), Candida parapsilosis (25"
		"[11%]), or Candida tropicalis (15 [7%]). The number of days to the initiation of"
		"antifungal treatment was 0 (92 patients [40%]), 1 (38 [17%]), 2 (33 [14%]) or >"
		or = 3 (29 [12%]). Mortality rates were lowest for patients who began therapy on
		"day 0 (14 patients [15%]) followed by patients who began on day 1 (9 [24%]), day"
		"2 (12 [37%]), or day > or = 3 (12 [41%]) (P = .0009 for trend). Multivariate"
		"logistic regression was used to calculate independent predictors of mortality,"
		"which include increased time until fluconazole initiation (odds ratio, 1.42; P <"
		.05) and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (1-point
		"increments; odds ratio, 1.13; P < .05). CONCLUSION: A delay in the initiation of"
		fluconazole therapy in hospitalized patients with candidemia significantly
		impacted mortality. New methods to avoid delays in appropriate antifungal
		"therapy, such as rapid diagnostic tests or identification of unique risk factors,"
		are needed.

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: We aimed to describe the epidemiology of Candida bloodstream
		infection in an intensive care unit (ICU) in Reunion Island. METHODS: We
		"performed a retrospective cohort study and evaluated 63 candidemia episodes,"
		which occurred between January 2004 and December 2015 in the ICU of a University
		Hospital in St-Pierre. RESULTS: The incidence rate of candidemia in the ICU was
		estimated at 7.6%. Candida albicans was the most common yeast pathogen species
		"recovered (54%), followed by Candida glabrata (17%), Candida tropicalis (12%) and"
		"Candida parapsilosis (10%). Between 2012 and 2015, we also observed a"
		modification of antifungal use. CONCLUSION: The epidemiology of candidemia in
		Reunion Island is characterized by the predominance of Candida albicans and by
		the relative importance of Candida tropicalis. This pattern corresponds to a
		model of epidemiological transition between the one usually observed in tropical
		areas and the one observed in temperate countries.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Infection and instability are the complications of prosthetic
		shoulder surgery of more difficult management. Instability builds up to half of
		"the cases, while the fungal infection accounts for less than 1% of all and can"
		cause severe damage to bone and soft tissue. METHODS: In this case clinical
		fungal infection by Candida parapsilosis is presented in a shoulder
		hemiarthroplasty indicated by a fracture of the proximal humerus. He received
		surgical treatment in two-stages and administration of fluconazole for eight
		weeks prior to the second surgical time. In revision surgery was placed a reverse
		"prosthesis as definitive treatment; however, the patient suffered several"
		episodes of dislocation in the postoperative period; a second revision prosthetic
		"surgery was necessary to use more stable components. During this surgery, we"
		"extracted samples that were analyzed, obtaining negative results for infection."
		"RESULTS: Now after three years of follow-up, the patient is well, no limitations"
		in their daily work and has a Constant Score of 50.5. DISCUSSION: We report our
		"experience in this exceptional situation. We know, this is one of the first cases"
		where the fungal infection and dislocation prosthetics in the same patient meet.
		"This situation is a challenge for the surgeon, which has to treat complications"
		two practically at the same time; we do not have scientific evidence to establish
		a criterion unified for the treatment of complications after surgery for revision
		"of arthroplasty of the shoulder, especially in reverse or mega-denture"
		prosthesis.

		hospitalized in 28 Belgian hospitals participating in a National Surveillance
		"Program, were evaluated. A total of 81% of the patients were more than 50 years"
		"of age. Candida albicans was the cause of infections in 55% of patients, 22% were"
		due to C. glabrata and 13% to C. parapsilosis. The most common predisposing
		"factors were antibacterial therapy (42%), residence in an intensive care unit"
		(32.9%) and presence of an intravascular catheter (29.7%). Most patients had more
		than one predisposing factor. Fluconazole alone or in association with another
		antifungal agent was the treatment of choice for 89.7% of the cases. In vitro
		susceptibility testing of the isolates revealed that 99% were susceptible to
		"amphotericin B, 95% to 5-fluorocytosine, 82% to fluconazole and 69% to"
		itraconazole. Resistance to azoles was more common among C. glabrata isolates in
		the elderly. We conclude that the frequency of C. albicans infection is
		"decreasing in Belgium and this is associated with the emergence of other species,"
		"most notably, C. glabrata."

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candida Parapsilosis is an unusual agent of prosthetic endocarditis
		in immunocompetent individuals but Coronavirus disease 2019 is reported to be
		associated with a transient immunodeficency that exposes patientes to
		opportunistic infections. CASE REPORT: We describe a dreadful case of Candida
		Parapsilosis endocarditis in a transient immunosuppressed patient recently
		infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus 2019. CONCLUSION:
		Considering that the symptoms of Candida Parapsilosis infection and the symptoms
		"of Coronavirus disease-2019 may overlap, it is important never to understimate"
		"the non-specific symptoms to improve patient outcome, especially in patient with"
		previous Coronavirurs disease-2019 infection and with prosthetic material
		grafting.

PG	-	550-5
AB	-	"The incidence, risk factors and prognostic factors for candidal infection were"
		determined in a prospective study of 280 infected patients. Thirty-one (11%)
		"patients were infected with Candida spp., sub-divided into 18 (58%) with C."
		"albicans, and 13 (42%) with non-albicans spp. (six C. glabrata, three C."
		"parapsilosis, and one each of C. krusei, C. tropicalis, C. guilliermondii and C."
		lusitaniae). Infection with Candida spp. was always associated with concurrent
		"bacterial infection. By univariate logistic regression analysis, the degree of"
		morbidity and the duration of mechanical ventilation were independent predictive
		"factors for death, but infection with Candida spp., was not. Factors associated"
		"with Candida spp. infection were the degree of morbidity, intensive care unit"
		"length of stay, alterations of immune response, and the number of medical devices"
		"involved. By multivariate logistic regression analysis, the only independent risk"
		factor for candidal infection was intensive care unit length of stay.

PG	-	225-30
LID	-	10.3109/13693786.2012.708107 [doi]
AB	-	"From 2006 to 2010, a retrospective study was conducted in a university referral"
		tertiary care hospital to study the frequency and distribution of Candida species
		"in different medical specialties. The use of mechanical ventilation, central"
		"venous catheter, and urinary catheter were recorded per 1,000 patient-days and"
		the use of antifungals was calculated using defined daily dose (DDD). A total of
		313 episodes were identified and the overall incidence was 0.54 (0.41-0.71)
		"episodes per 1,000 patient-days. Candida albicans caused 44% of the overall"
		"episodes, followed by C. tropicalis (21.7%), C. parapsilosis (14.4%), C. glabrata"
		"(11.2%), and C. krusei (3.5%). The incidence of C. glabrata significantly"
		increased from 2006-2010 (range: 4.8-23.5%) (P = 0.024). Candida glabrata was
		associated with malignancies (P = 0.004) and C. krusei with hematologic
		malignancies (P < 0.0001). The use of antifungals was higher in the
		hematology/bone marrow transplant units and represented 40% of all fluconazole
		prescription in the hospital. There was no correlation with the use of
		fluconazole and the increasing ratio of C. glabrata (r = 0.60). The use of
		invasive devices was significantly higher in the intensive care units (ICUs) than
		"the medical and surgical emergencies units (P < 0.001). In contrast, the"
		"emergencies had higher incidence of candidemia (2-2.1 episodes/1,000"
		"patient-days) than the ICUs (1.6 episodes 1,000 patient-days). Candida glabrata"
		candidemia showed a significant increase in contrast to the current national
		literature where C. parapsilosis remained the most important non-C. albicans
		Candida species in Brazilian hospitals. Our findings suggested that the
		increasing incidence of C. glabrata was not associated with use of fluconazole
		and other risk factors might play an important role.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Candidemia is the worldwide life-threaten disease, especially in"
		cancer patients. This study was aimed to identify and evaluate the risk factors
		"of candidemia in cancer patients, which will prompt the improvement on current"
		"therapeutic strategies and prognosis. METHODS: A retrospective, case-control"
		study was conducted from inpatients of Tianjin Medical University Cancer
		"Institute and Hospital, during 2006 to 2013. Analyses were performed between"
		"cancer patients with candidemia as study case, and patients with bacterial"
		"bloodstream infections as control. Each case was matched up with two controls,"
		"for gender and inpatient duration. Candida species, clinical characteristics,"
		risk factors and outcomes were reviewed in details. RESULTS: Total number of 80
		cases and 160 controls were enrolled and analyzed in this study. Candida albicans
		"was identified as the most prevalent species and account for 55.0% candidemia,"
		"followed by Candida parapsilosis complex (21.3%), Candida tropicalis (8.8%),"
		"Candida glabrata complex (7.5%), Candida lusitaniae (3.8%), and Candida famata"
		"(3.8%). The crude mortality at 30-days of candidemia was up to 30.0%, which is"
		significantly higher than bacterial bloodstream infections (p = 0.006).
		Logistical analysis demonstrated that total parenteral nutrition >5 days
		"(p = 0.036), urinary catheter >2 days (p = 0.001), distant organ metastasis of"
		cancer (p = 0.002) and gastrointestinal cancer (p = 0.042) were the independent
		risk factors for candidemia. CONCLUSIONS: Candidemia showed significant higher
		"mortality than bacterial bloodstream infections, C. albicans was cited as the"
		"primary pathogen. Total parenteral nutrition, urinary catheter, distant organ"
		metastasis of cancer and gastrointestinal cancer are independent predictors for
		"candidemia, this findings provides potential therapeutic targets for improving"
		the outcome.

PG	-	2962-7
AB	-	A single pair of primers was used in a PCR assay to amplify and identify the DNAs
		"from four medically important Candida species: C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, C."
		"tropicalis, and C. (Torulopsis) glabrata. The report describes the first"
		successful amplification of a chitin synthase-specific fragment from the four
		Candida species responsible for more than 90% of all cases of neonatal
		candidemia. The primer pair sequence was based on that from the C. albicans
		"chitin synthase gene, CHS1 (J. Au-Young and P.W. Robbins, Mol. Microbiol."
		"4:197-207, 1990). Each of the four amplified products is a single band of a"
		"different size. The DNA sequence of each PCR product was determined, and four"
		species-specific probes were synthesized. The DNAs from as few as 10 organisms in
		100 microliters of plasma could be detected after amplification and Southern blot
		analysis. In a retrospective study of 27 paired blood samples from 16 patients
		"with culture-proven candidemia, PCR analysis was successful at detecting and"
		correctly identifying to the species level 26 of the 27 Candida isolates. The
		speed and accuracy of this PCR-based technology make it a very powerful tool for
		detecting and diagnosing candidemia. Implementation of this assay for analyzing
		"blood samples should result in the more timely treatment of neonatal candidemia,"
		thereby reducing morbidity and mortality.

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To compare Candida species distribution and antifungal susceptibility
		at South African public- and private-sector hospitals. METHODS: From February
		"2009 through to August 2010, laboratory-based surveillance for candidaemia was"
		undertaken at 11 public-sector hospitals and >85 private-sector hospitals across
		South Africa. A case was defined as a patient of any age admitted to a sentinel
		hospital with isolation of Candida species from blood culture. Viable isolates
		were identified and tested for antifungal susceptibility at a reference
		laboratory. Demographic and limited clinical data were abstracted from laboratory
		"records. RESULTS: In total, 2172 cases of candidaemia were detected. Among"
		"patients with available data, almost two-thirds were critically ill (719/1138,"
		"63%). On multivariable analysis, neonates [adjusted OR (aOR), 2.2; 95% CI,"
		"1.5-3.1; P < 0.001] and patients diagnosed in Gauteng province (aOR, 1.9; 95% CI,"
		"1.3-2.7; P < 0.001) or in the private sector (aOR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.2-3.2;"
		P = 0.008) were significantly more likely to be infected with Candida
		"parapsilosis than any other Candida species. Of 531 C. parapsilosis isolates,"
		only 199 (37%) were susceptible to fluconazole and voriconazole; 44% (123/282) of
		fluconazole-resistant isolates were voriconazole cross-resistant. Factors
		associated with fluconazole non-susceptible C. parapsilosis infection on
		"multivariable analysis included diagnosis in Gauteng province (aOR, 4.2; 95% CI,"
		"2.7-6.7; P < 0.001), an ICU (aOR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.5-3.6; P < 0.001) or the private"
		"sector (aOR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.4-3.5; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The dominance of"
		triazole non-susceptible C. parapsilosis limits the choice of antifungal agents
		"for management of candidaemia among critically ill neonates, children and adults"
		in resource-limited South African hospitals.

AB	-	We report the first case of non-dermatophytic onychomycosis of the toenail
		described in Kazakhstan caused by Candida parapsilosis. The biological properties
		"of the strain were studied. C. parapsilosis forms white creamy colonies, smooth"
		"with focal wrinkles, and the reversum is light-yellow. The culture of C."
		"parapsilosis is represented by a yeast form, characterized by the presence of"
		round or cylindrical yeast cells with active budding. The strain has a high
		saccharolytic and urease activity and is indifferent to the sucrose and maltose.
		The C. parapsilosis strain was sensitive to polyene and azole antifungal agents.
		"The highest sensitivity was found to ketoconazole, itraconazole and nystatin."

TI	-	Economic analysis of inadequate fluconazole therapy in non-neutropenic patients
		with candidaemia: a multi-institutional study.
PG	-	557-62
AB	-	Mortality significantly increases in patients with candidaemia who receive
		inappropriate fluconazole therapy. The goals of this study were to compare
		hospital length of stay and costs for non-neutropenic patients with candidaemia
		treated with fluconazole based on the empirical dose and time until initiation of
		therapy. A retrospective cohort study was conducted of patients with candidaemia
		who were prescribed fluconazole at the onset of candidaemia or later.
		Hospital-related costs were compared based on time to initiation of fluconazole
		therapy and empirical fluconazole dose. A total of 192 non-neutropenic patients
		"(55% male; mean age+/-standard deviation, 56+/-17 years) were identified."
		"Isolated Candida species included C. albicans (59%), C. glabrata (15%), C."
		"parapsilosis (11%), C. tropicalis (6%), C. krusei (3%) or other Candida spp."
		"(6%). Time to initiation of fluconazole was Day 0 (35.4%), Day 1 (14.1%), Day 2"
		(26.6%) or Day >or=3 (23.9%). Thirty-two patients (17%) received a dose of
		fluconazole >or=6 mg/kg on Day 0. Total costs were lowest for patients started on
		"fluconazole on the culture day with adequate doses ($35,459+/-25,988) compared"
		"with all other patients ($52,158+/-53,492) (P=0.0088). After controlling for"
		"covariates, each 1-day delay in fluconazole therapy was associated with increased"
		"total hospital costs of $6392+/-3000 (P=0.0344), and an adequate fluconazole dose"
		"was associated with decreased total hospital costs of $18,744+/-7173 (P=0.0097)."
		A delay or an inadequate dose or fluconazole in patients with candidaemia was
		associated with increased hospital costs. Improved methods to diagnose patients
		with candidaemia quickly are needed.

PG	-	563-7
AB	-	"A total of 2,153 high vaginal swabs were processed for the presence of yeasts."
		The specimens were obtained from pregnant and non-pregnant Malaysian women with
		and without vaginitis. The yeast species most commonly isolated were Candida
		"albicans, C. glabrata, C. famata and C. parapsilosis. C. albicans was isolated"
		"from 27% of pregnant women with vaginitis, 14% of pregnant women with no overt"
		"vaginitis, 15% of non-pregnant women with vaginitis, and 3% of non-pregnant women"
		with no vaginitis. The significant difference of the isolation rates from women
		with and without vaginitis indicates that C. albicans is likely to be a vaginal
		pathogen.

PG	-	1210-4
AB	-	"OBJECTIVES: To isolate, identify, and determine the prevalence of Candida and"
		"other yeasts of clinical importance in Aseer region, Saudi Arabia. METHODS: This"
		is a cross-sectional study involving retrospective analysis of 6100 samples
		"submitted to the Microbiology Laboratory, Aseer Central Hospital, Abha, Saudi"
		"Arabia between 2011 and 2012, and prospective isolation and identification of 84"
		isolates recovered from various clinical specimens presented to the Microbiology
		Laboratory between 2012 and 2013 using the classic morphological schemes and the
		Vitek 2 automated system. RESULTS: The results of the retrospective analysis
		(2011-2012) indicated that of the 6100 various clinical specimens submitted to
		"the routine microbiology analysis, 143 (2.35%) revealed the presence of Candida"
		spp. The distribution of the 143 Candida spp according to specimens was as
		"follows: urine 72%, sputum 10.5%, endotracheal tube 7%, blood 4.2%, catheter tip"
		"2.1%, throat swab 2.1%, eye swab 0.7%, wound exudates 0.7%, and cerebrospinal"
		"fluid 0.7%. The results of the prospective study (2012-2013), which involved the"
		identification of yeast recovered from 84 specimens indicated that Candida
		"albicans 28.6% was the predominant species, followed by Candida parapsilosis"
		"21.4%, Candida tropicalis 14.3%, and Candida lusitaniae 9.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Along"
		"with the commonly encountered Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis, Candida"
		"tropicalis, and Candida lusitaniae were detected with significant rates. Many"
		other Candida species and some other pathogenic yeasts have been detected for the
		first time in the region. Urinary tract samples were the main source of Candida
		species.

		agents (2001-2007): stable incidence but changing epidemiology of a still
		frequently lethal infection.
PG	-	4745-52
LID	-	10.1002/cncr.24507 [doi]
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: The incidence, epidemiology, Candida species distribution, resistance"
		"patterns, and outcome of candidemia in high-risk hematologic malignancy and/or"
		stem cell transplantation patients have not been extensively described since the
		"introduction of new antifungal agents. METHODS: In this retrospective study, the"
		authors reviewed the medical records and microbiologic data of hematologic
		malignancy patients with candidemia at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson
		Cancer Center from March 2001 to February 2007. RESULTS: The authors analyzed 173
		"episodes of candidemia (170 patients), 125 (72%) of which were breakthrough cases"
		"after prior antifungal agents, mainly fluconazole (28 [22%]), caspofungin (25"
		"[20%]), and voriconazole (18 [14%]). The incidence of candidemia (per 100,000"
		"inpatient days) remained relatively stable, from 13.9 in 2001 to 19.2 in 2006."
		"However, compared with the findings of previous studies at the authors'"
		"institution, the frequency of Candida glabrata and C. krusei infection decreased"
		"(to 5% and 17%, respectively) and C. parapsilosis (24%) and C. tropicalis (21%)"
		increased. C. parapsilosis fungemia was associated with prior caspofungin use
		"(P<.001). The overall 30-day crude mortality rate was 38%, and the attributable"
		"mortality rate was 19%, similar to previous findings at the authors' institution."
		The Candida species associated with the highest mortality rate was C. glabrata.
		CONCLUSIONS: Despite the widespread use of antifungal prophylaxis and the
		"introduction of new antifungal agents, the incidence and associated mortality"
		rates of candidemia remained stable in high-risk hematologic malignancy patients.
		"However, its epidemiological characteristics have shifted, with C. parapsilosis"
		and C. tropicalis becoming more common.

AB	-	"Disseminated fungal infections are still rare conditions, mostly caused by"
		Candida spp. during immunosuppression. Infection of immunocompetent individuals
		"is uncommon. Endocarditis is a rare manifestation during candidaemia, mostly in"
		patients with prosthetic valves. Affection of previously unaltered valves is
		"uncommon. CASE PRESENTATION: We presented a case of a young, previously healthy"
		"female patient with endocarditis, caused by Candida parapsilosis. The initial"
		"symptom, fever, was present four months before hospital admittance. She was"
		febrile without other symptoms and during observation in a local hospital. After
		"her condition deteriorated, she was transferred to the Institute for infectious"
		"and tropical diseases, Belgrade. Clinical findings on admission include petechial"
		skin rash and moderate hepatosplenomegaly. Newly developed systolic murmur was
		"noted, and Candida parapsilosis was isolated in multiple blood cultures."
		Echocardiography revealed 15 × 14 mm vegetations on the right aortic vellum. She
		"was treated with antifungal drugs (fluconasole, liposomal amphotericin B), and"
		the affected valve was successfully replaced. The same strain of Candida
		parapsilosis was isolated from the intraoperative material of the valve. There
		were no markers of immunosuppression or other conditions which could affect the
		immune system. CONCLUSION: After a prolonged period of treatment she was
		"successfully cured, and she received a long-term intermittent suppressive"
		fluconasole therapy for the time being.

AB	-	"Neonatal candidaemia is a common, deadly and costly hospital-associated disease."
		To determine the genetic diversity of Candida parapsilosis causing fungaemia in
		South African neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). From February 2009 through
		"to August 2010, cases of candidaemia were reported through laboratory-based"
		surveillance. C. parapsilosis isolates from neonatal cases were submitted for
		"identification by internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region sequencing, antifungal"
		susceptibility testing and microsatellite genotyping. Cluster analysis was
		performed using Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA). Of
		"1671 cases with a viable Candida isolate, 393 (24%) occurred among neonates."
		Isolates from 143 neonatal cases were confirmed as C. parapsilosis sensu stricto.
		Many isolates were resistant to fluconazole (77/143; 54%) and voriconazole
		"(20/143; 14%). Of 79 closely-related genotypes, 18 were represented by ≥2"
		"isolates; 61 genotypes had a single isolate each. Seven clusters, comprised of 82"
		"isolates, were identified at five hospitals in three provinces. Isolates"
		belonging to certain clusters were significantly more likely to be fluconazole
		"resistant: all cluster 7 isolates and the majority of cluster 4 (78%), 5 (89%)"
		and 6 (67%) isolates (P<.001). Candida parapsilosis-associated candidaemia in
		public-sector NICUs was caused by closely related genotypes and there was
		molecular evidence of undetected outbreaks as well as intra-hospital
		transmission.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candida prosthetic endocarditis is associated with high mortality
		"rates and valve replacement surgery, together with antifungal treatment, play a"
		major role in eradicating the fungal infection. Valve reoperations in these
		"scenarios may be relatively common due to the high infection relapse rates and,"
		"in some cases, heart transplantation may be an imposing therapy for infection"
		resolution and for the heart failure related to the myocardial reoperation
		injury. Among the many postoperative complications related to heart
		"transplantation, chylopericardium is a rare but challenging example. CASE"
		PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 55-year-old man who was admitted to our
		hospital with a 1-month history of progressive dyspnea and fatigue. His past
		medical history included four open-heart surgeries for aortic and mitral valve
		replacement due to recurrent Candida parapsilosis infective endocarditis.
		Transthoracic echocardiogram showed a markedly reduced left ventricular systolic
		function and normofunctioning bioprosthetic valves. An inotropic dependency
		condition led to heart transplantation surgery. In the early postoperative
		"period, a persistent chylous fluid started to drain from the pericardial tube,"
		compatible with the diagnosis of chylopericardium. The lack of clinical response
		to total parenteral nutrition and intravenous infusion of octreotide imposed the
		need of interventional radiology with diagnostic lymphography through cisterna
		"chyli puncture and thoracic duct catheterization, confirming the presence of a"
		lymphatic fistula. A successful treatment outcome was achieved with percutaneous
		"thoracic duct embolization using coils and n-butyl-cyanoacrilate glue,"
		possibiliting hospital discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Fungal endocarditis requires
		combined treatment (surgical and antimicrobial) for eradication. Valve
		"replacement, while necessary, may lead to severe ventricular deterioration and"
		heart transplantation may be the only viable therapeutic solution. Among the
		"several postoperative complications of heart transplantation, chylopericardium is"
		an uncommon and defiant example. Advances in interventional radiology like the
		percutaneous embolization allow a less invasive and highly efficient approach for
		this complication.

AB	-	Emphysematous pyelonephritis (EPN) is a necrotizing gas producing infection of
		the renal parenchyma that commonly occurs in patients with diabetes. EPN requires
		early diagnosis and treatment due to the possible life-threatening septic
		complications. We report a rare case of EPN caused by an unfavorable mixed
		"infection of Candida parapsilosis and Finegoldia magna. To our knowledge, this is"
		the first reported case of EPN caused by Finegoldia magna. A 62-year-old male
		"with diabetes mellitus (DM) presented with abdominal pain, shortness of breath,"
		and nausea in which a diagnosis of septic shock was made due to EPN. Our patient
		"first noticed abdominal pain 3 weeks prior to hospital presentation; however, he"
		avoided getting treatment due to a fear of contracting severe acute respiratory
		syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This patient exhibited deterioration and
		expired after surgical intervention despite uneventful nephrectomy. This case
		suggests that medical care avoidance behaviors among patients could potentially
		complicate their clinical course.

TI	-	Determining risk factors for candidemia among newborn infants from
		"population-based surveillance: Baltimore, Maryland, 1998-2000."
PG	-	601-4
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Our objective was to determine risks factors for late onset
		"candidemia, independent of birth weight, in newborn infants. METHODS: We"
		"performed a matched case-control study. Cases were identified through active,"
		"population-based surveillance for candidemia, conducted in Baltimore City and"
		"County during 1998-2000, and were defined as the incident isolation of any"
		Candida species from the bloodstream of an infant 3 months old or younger. Four
		"controls, matched by age, hospital, birth weight category, hospital stay and"
		"admission date, were selected for each case. Potential risk factors included"
		"clinical, demographic and maternal prenatal data. RESULTS: Of the 35 cases, 19"
		"(54%) infections were with Candida albicans, 9 (26%) were with Candida"
		parapsilosis and 5 (14%) were with Candida glabrata. Cases had a median birth
		"weight of 680 g (range, 430-3200 g); median gestational ages of cases and"
		"controls were 25 and 27 weeks, respectively. Compared with controls, cases had"
		significant higher mortality (20% versus 4%; P = 0.004). No maternal factors were
		associated with increased risk of disease; cases were as likely as controls to be
		of black race. Multivariable conditional logistic regression analysis revealed
		"that gestational age younger than 26 weeks [adjusted odds ratio, 6.5; 95%"
		"confidence interval (95% CI), 1.3-32], vaginal delivery (adjusted odds ratio,"
		"4.3; 95% CI 1.3-14.2) and abdominal surgery (adjusted odds ratio, 10.9; 95% CI"
		1.9-62) were independently associated with increased risk of candidemia.
		"CONCLUSIONS: Independent of birth weight, infants born at <26 weeks or those who"
		have had abdominal surgery are at a significantly increased risk of candidemia.
		This study helps define a subgroup of preterm infants at high risk of developing
		bloodstream infections with Candida species.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to evaluate the epidemiological and
		"clinical characteristics of candidemia in a typical burn ICU, and to determine"
		the risk factors associated with candidemia among major burn patients. METHOD:
		This retrospective observational study of candidemia from 2012 to 2017 in a burn
		"ICU was conducted in the Department of Burn, Southwest hospital, Chongqing,"
		China. RESULTS: The study included 410 major burn patients (≥40% total body
		"surface area), 39 (9.51%) of which were diagnosed with candidemia. The annual"
		"incidences of candidemia varied from 6.06% to 17.54%, and increased gradually in"
		the 6 years. Candida parapsilosis was the dominant pathogen (28.21% strains). The
		overall resistance rate of Candida spp. to fluconazole was 35.89%. Candidemia
		cases most frequently occurred in the 2nd (30.77%) and 3rd (23.08%) weeks after
		"burn, and intravascular catheters were the most common sources of bloodstream"
		"Candida infections (31.58%). The crude mortality of candidemia was 23.08%, and"
		the mortality attributable to candidemia was 14.99%. Risk factors of candidemia
		"included inhalation injury, renal dysfunction with replacement therapy, severe"
		"gastrointestinal complications, T-cell lymphopenia and prior Candida"
		colonization. CONCLUSION: Candidemia has a high incidence and mortality in major
		burn patients. The changes in etiology and drug sensitivity may make new
		challenges for the management of candidemia in burn ICUs.

AB	-	"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this work was to identify differences in incidence,"
		"risk factors, microbiology, treatment, and clinical outcome of candidemia in"
		"neonates, children, and adults that might impact on management. PATIENTS AND"
		METHODS: Cases of candidemia in Australia were identified prospectively by blood
		"culture surveillance over 3 years. Episodes of candidemia in neonatal, pediatric,"
		"and adult age groups were analyzed and compared. RESULTS: Of 1005 incident cases,"
		"33 occurred in neonates, 110 in children, and 862 in adults. The respective"
		"annual age-specific incidences were 4.4, 0.9, and 1.8 per 100,000 population."
		Prematurity and ICU admission were major risk factors in neonates. Hematologic
		malignancy and neutropenia were significantly more frequent in children than in
		"neonates and adults. Diabetes, renal disease, hemodialysis, and recent surgery"
		were more common in adults. Candidemia was attributed to a vascular access device
		"in 58% of neonates, 70% of children, and 44% of adults. Candida albicans caused"
		approximately 48% of cases in all of the age groups. Candida parapsilosis was
		significantly more common in neonates and children (42% and 38% vs 15%). Candida
		glabrata was infrequent in neonates and children (9% and 3% vs 17%).
		Significantly more isolates from children were susceptible to fluconazole
		compared with those from adults (95% vs 75%). Fluconazole-resistant candidal
		isolates were infrequent in all of the age groups. Neonates and children were
		more likely to receive amphotericin B compared with adults. Adults were more
		"likely to receive fluconazole. Survival rates at 30 days were 78% in neonates,"
		"90% in children, and 70% in adults. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies"
		"significant differences in candidemia in neonates, children, and adults."
		Neonatologists and pediatricians must consider age-specific differences when
		interpreting adult studies and developing treatment and prevention guidelines.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To explore the microbiological and clinical characteristics of
		patients with candidemia and analyze their prognostic risk factors. METHODS: A
		retrospective analysis was conducted for hospitalized patients with candidemia
		"from January 2008 to December 2012 at Affiliated Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan"
		"University. Pathogen spectrum, resistance pattern, underlying diseases, therapy"
		received and patient prognosis were collected by chart review. The univariate and
		multivariate Logistic regression analyses were used to determine the prognostic
		risk factors of candidemia. RESULTS: A total of 138 inpatients were identified.
		There were 98 males and 40 females with a mean age of (61.3 ± 16.6) years. The
		morbidity rate of candidemia in annual discharged patients was 0.034%-0.051%. The
		"most common pathogens were Candida albicans (n = 72, 52.2%), Candida parapsilosis"
		"(n = 29, 21.0%) and Candida tropicalis (n = 16, 11.6%). The antibiotic"
		susceptible rate of azole for Candida was 90.9%-97.4% while 55.6%-83.3% for
		Candida tropicalis. The overall case fatality rate of candidemia was 39.1%
		(54/138) while the attributable case fatality rate 31.9% (44/138). Multivariate
		Logistic regression analysis indicated acute physiology and chronic health
		"evaluation II(APACHE II) score ≥ 20 points (OR = 8.025, 95%CI: 2.032-31.696, P ="
		"0.003), hypoproteinemia (OR = 6.213, 95%CI: 1.849-20.879, P = 0.003), concurrent"
		"bacteremia (OR = 5.541, 95%CI: 1.576-19.487, P = 0.008) and indwelling urethral"
		"catheter (OR = 13.776, 95%CI: 1.402-135.352, P = 0.024) were the independent risk"
		"factors of candidemia-related mortality, while removal or replacement of central"
		"venous catheter (OR = 0.231, 59%CI: 0.075-0.716, P = 0.011) and surgery within 30"
		"days (OR = 0.206, 95%CI: 0.050-0.857, P = 0.030) were the protective factors."
		CONCLUSIONS: Candida albicans is the most common causative agent. The case
		"fatality rate of candidemia has remained high. APACHE II score ≥ 20 points,"
		"hypoproteinemia, indwelling urethral catheter and concurrent bacteremia are"
		independent risk factors attributing to candidemia-related mortality while
		removal or replacement of central venous catheter and surgery within 30 days are
		the protective ones.

		Report.
PG	-	95-98

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Prosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a rare complication of total
		"knee replacement (TKR), yet it is a serious and debilitating condition. Bacterial"
		infection accounts for the majority of cases and fungal infection is estimated to
		cause 1% of all prosthesis infection. CASE REPORT: This case presents a 60years
		"female, who presented to our outpatient orthopedic clinic complaining of right"
		"knee pain, swelling, and hotness. The physical examination revealed redness,"
		"hotness, restricted range of movement, and tibial loosening, 9 months following"
		"TKR revision. Culture of the joint aspirate showed growth of ""Candida"
		"parapsilosis"" and second aspirate confirmed the diagnosis. The patient then"
		underwent two stages revision surgery with placement of amphotericin B loaded
		"cement, to maintain high local antifungal concentration in addition to decrease"
		the side effects of amphotericinB infusion such as thrombophlebitis and the more
		serious systemic effect as nephrotoxicity. The post-operative course was
		"uneventful, with gradual improvement and restoration of normal movement range."
		"CONCLUSION: Fungal PJI is a rare complication of TKR, yet it results in severe"
		debilitating symptoms and impairment of the patient functional capacity. Careful
		evaluation of the patient followed by a detailed workup is necessary for the
		identification of the underlying causative micro-organism. Two-stage revision
		surgery with antifungal loaded cement spacer and antifungal therapy currently is
		"the standard of management. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first"
		fungal PJI following total knee arthroplasty reported in Jordan.

		clinical features of 111 cases.
PG	-	504-8
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To determine changes in the incidence of candidemia in a neonatal
		intensive care unit (NICU) during a 15-year period (1981 to 1995) and to compare
		the prevalence and case fatality rates of Candida albicans and Candida
		parapsilosis infections. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted of
		"candidemia occurring in infants in a NICU between January 1, 1981, and December"
		"31, 1995. Cases were identified through computerized searching of a microbiology"
		blood culture database. Candidemia was considered contributory to mortality if
		death occurred within 3 days of positive blood cultures or if there was autopsy
		evidence of disseminated candidiasis. RESULTS: One hundred eleven cases of
		"candidemia occurred in 107 infants, representing 1% of all NICU patients during"
		the study period. The rate of candidemia in the NICU increased from 2.5 cases per
		"1000 admissions in 1981 to 1985, to 4.6 per 1000 admissions in 1986 to 1990 and"
		to 28.5 per 1000 in 1991 to 1995 (P = 0.001). C. albicans was the predominant
		cause of candidemia between 1981 and 1990. C. parapsilosis was the most prevalent
		"species between 1991 and 1995, causing 53 of 89 cases (60%). The mortality from"
		"C. albicans, 13 of 50 cases (26%), was significantly higher than the mortality"
		"from C. parapsilosis, 2 of 54 (4%) (P = 0.002; relative risk, 7; 95% confidence"
		"interval, 1.7 to 30). CONCLUSIONS: The rate of candidemia in our neonatal"
		intensive care unit increased >11-fold in the 15 years from 1981 to 1995; the
		prevalent Candida species shifted from C. albicans to C. parapsilosis; and
		candidemia associated with C. albicans has significantly higher mortality than
		with C. parapsilosis.

		Retrospective Study.
PG	-	981-986
LID	-	10.1097/INF.0000000000003225 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candidemia is one of the leading causes of bloodstream infections in
		the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). The aim of this study was to define
		characteristics and risk factors for candidemia in the PICU setting and propose a
		predictive model to identify the patients at risk. METHODS: This was a
		retrospective matched case-control study in the PICU during a 9-year period.
		Patients with candidemia were studied and matched with control patients without
		candidemia. Univariate analysis was performed for potential risk factors and
		multivariate analysis was conducted to determine the prediction score for
		candidemia. RESULTS: Forty-two cases of candidemia were matched with 84 control
		patients. Candida parapsilosis was the most common (71.4%) species. Risk factors
		independently associated with candidemia were: the use of >2 antibiotics in a
		maximum period of 4 weeks before the candidemia (odds ratio [OR]: 10.59; 95%
		"confidence interval [CI]: 2.05-54.83), a previous bacterial infection in a"
		maximum period of 4 weeks before the candidemia (OR: 5.56; 95% CI: 1.44-21.5) and
		the duration of PICU stay of >10 days (OR: 4.22; 95% CI: 1.02-17.41). The
		"proposed predictive scoring system has a sensitivity of 95.24%, specificity of"
		"76.12%, OR 64.0, 95% CI 14.2-288.6, the positive predictive value of 66.67% and"
		the negative predictive value of 96.97%. CONCLUSIONS: Previously reported risk
		factors for candidemia have been confirmed and some new have been detected. The
		presented scoring system can help identify patients who would benefit from
		prophylactic antifungal therapy.

TI	-	The epidemiology of Candida species associated with vulvovaginal candidiasis in
		an Iranian patient population.
PG	-	199-203
LID	-	10.1016/j.ejogrb.2010.11.022 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: Vulvovaginal candidiasis is a common infection among women worldwide.
		"According to previous epidemiological studies, Candida albicans is the most"
		"common species of Candida. The prevalence of non-Candida species, however, is"
		increasing. Identification of Candida species among the population will not only
		"help health professionals to choose suitable antifungal treatments, but also"
		"prevent development of drug resistance. The aim of this study was to identify,"
		"using chromogenic agar medium, the Candida species associated with vulvovaginal"
		candidiasis among a sample of the Iranian population. STUDY DESIGN: In a
		"prospective cohort study during a two year period from March 2006 to March 2008,"
		swab samples of vaginal discharge/secretion were taken from 200 patients admitted
		"to the gynecology clinic of Mahdieh Hospital (Tehran, Iran) with a clinical"
		presentation suggestive of vulvovaginal candidiasis. The isolates obtained were
		cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar and chromogenic agar medium. Candida species
		"were also identified by germ tube formation in serum, chlamydospore production on"
		Corn Meal Agar and carbohydrate absorption using the API 20C-AUX kit.
		Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire investigating the risk
		factors associated with candidiasis. An assessment of the different species of
		"recurrent and non-recurrent candidiasis was also made. Descriptive statistics,"
		"chi-square test, and t-test were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: A total of"
		191 isolates were obtained from 175 vaginal specimens. Candida albicans accounted
		for 67% of the strains including single and mixed infections. The other
		"identified species were Candida glabrata (18.3%), Candida tropicalis (6.8%),"
		"Candida krusei (5.8%), Candida parapsilosis (1.6%), and Candida guilliermondii"
		(0.5%) respectively. Mixed infection with two or more species of Candida was seen
		in 10.3% of patients. The most common mixed cause was the combination of Candida
		albicans and Candida glabrata. Participants who were sexually active and those
		who had orogenital sex were more likely to suffer recurrent vulvovaginal
		candidiasis. CONCLUSIONS: Candida albicans was the most common cause of recurrent
		and non-recurrent vulvovaginitis. The second most common species was Candida
		glabrata. This study suggests CHROMagar method as a convenient and cost effective
		yet reliable method to isolate the species of Candida especially in cases where
		more than one species is present.

PG	-	197-201
AB	-	The aim of this study was to observe the prevalence of Candida spp. in the oral
		cavity of children undergoing treatment with inhaled corticosteroids. Thirty
		children treated with inhaled corticosteroids and thirty control children were
		studied. Saliva samples were collected through oral rinses with phosphate
		buffered saline (PBS). The samples were plated on Sabouraud's dextrose agar and
		"incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 h. After this period, the number of"
		colony-forming units per ml (cfu/ml) of saliva was calculated. The isolates were
		identified by phenotypic characterization. Candida spp. was isolated from 43.33%
		"of the samples of children treated with corticosteroids, with a mean of 780"
		"cfu/ml of saliva, and from 30% of the samples of the control group, with a mean"
		of 560 cfu/ml of saliva. No significant statistical difference was observed
		"between the groups. C. albicans was the prevalent species in both groups,"
		"followed by C. guilliermondii, C. parapsilosis and C. stellatoidea. Furthermore,"
		Rhodotorula rubra and C. lusitaniae were also isolated from the treated group. We
		concluded that there was no significant increase in the prevalence and number of
		Candida spp. in the oral cavity of children treated with inhaled corticosteroids.

TI	-	Systemic Candidiasis in Extremely Low Birthweight (ELBW) Neonates Despite the
		"Routine Use of Topical Miconazole Prophylaxis: Trends, Risk Factors and Outcomes"
		over an 11-Year Period.
PG	-	255-62
AB	-	"INTRODUCTION: This study aims to determine the incidence, trends of systemic"
		candidiasis and meningitis in extremely low birthweight (ELBW) neonates (<1000
		gms) despite the routine use of topical miconazole prophylaxis and to compare the
		"risk factors, adverse outcomes and comorbidities with controls. MATERIALS AND"
		METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of ELBW neonates with systemic candidiasis
		and meningitis over an 11-year period (1997 to 2007). Matched case control
		analyses were performed to determine the risk factors and comorbidities which
		"were severe intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), severe retinopathy of prematurity"
		"(ROP), patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) requiring treatment, necrotising"
		"enterocolitis (NEC), chronic lung disease (CLD) and cholestatic jaundice."
		Mortality and end organ involvement secondary to systemic candidiasis were
		"identified as adverse outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 757 ELBW neonates, 51 (6.7%) had"
		evidence of systemic candidiasis with a significant 3-fold increase in trend
		"noted in 2007 as compared against 1997 (12.1% vs 3.8%) (RR 1.2, 95% CI, 1.06 to"
		"1.36, P <0.001). This corresponds to a significant increasing trend of preceding"
		or co-existent bacterial blood stream infections (BSI) in neonates with systemic
		"candidiasis (0% in 1997 vs 7.1% in 2007, RR 1.40, 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.25, P ="
		"0.005). On logistic regression analysis, decreasing gestational age was an"
		"independent risk factor for systemic candidiasis (OR 2.0, 95% CI, 1.52 to 2.63, P"
		<0.001). Candida meningitis was detected in 4/38 (10.5%) and end organ
		involvement in 17 (33%). The organisms isolated were Candida parapsilosis 31
		"(61%), Candida albicans 17 (33%) and Candida glabrata 3 (5.8%). Significantly"
		higher mortality was seen in cases when compared to controls 10/51 (19.6%) vs
		"76/706 (10.7%) (OR 2.02, 95% CI, 1.02 to 4.40, P <0.001). CONCLUSION: Increasing"
		trend in the incidence of systemic candidiasis despite routine use of topical
		miconazole prophylaxis is of concern and future studies comparing the use of
		systemic fl uconazole versus oral nystatin may need to be considered.

TI	-	Secular trends of candidemia in a large tertiary-care hospital from 1988 to 2000:
		emergence of Candida parapsilosis.
PG	-	548-52
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To analyze the secular trends of candidemia in a large tertiary-care
		"hospital to determine the overall incidence, as well as the incidence by ward and"
		"by species, and to detect the occurrence of outbreaks. DESIGN: Retrospective"
		descriptive analysis. Secular trends were calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel
		test. SETTING: A large tertiary-care referral center in Spain with a pediatric
		intensive care unit (ICU) to which more than 500 children with congenital cardiac
		disease are admitted annually. PATIENTS: All patients with candidemia occurring
		from 1988 to 2000 were included. Cases were identified from laboratory records of
		blood cultures. RESULTS: There were 331 episodes of candidemia. The overall
		"incidence of nosocomial candidemia was 0.6 episode per 1,000 admissions and"
		remained stable throughout the study period (P = .925). The species most
		"frequently isolated was Candida albicans, but the incidence of C. parapsilosis"
		"candidemia increased (P = .035). In the pediatric ICU, the incidence of C."
		"parapsilosis was 5.6 episodes per 1,000 admissions and it was the predominant"
		"species. Outbreaks occurred occasionally in the pediatric ICU, suggesting"
		"nosocomial transmission. CONCLUSIONS: During this 13-year period, the incidence"
		"of candidemia remained stable in this hospital, but C. parapsilosis increased in"
		frequency. Occasional outbreaks of candidemia suggested nosocomial transmission
		of Candida species.

AB	-	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To investigate in vitro microbiological
		susceptibilities of Candida vitreous endophthalmitis isolates using traditional
		and newer antifungal agents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The current study is a
		"retrospective, consecutive case series of 17 vitreous culture-proven Candida"
		endophthalmitis isolates from 2011 to 2017 from Bascom Palmer Eye Institute.
		"Susceptibilities to echinocandins, triazoles, polyenes, and nucleoside analogs"
		"were obtained. RESULTS: The study isolates consisted of 59% C. albicans, 17% C."
		"glabrata, 12% C. tropicalis, and 12% C. parapsilosis. Isolates demonstrated 100%"
		sensitivity to all antifungals tested except anidulafungin (85% sensitive) and
		"fluconazole (88.2% sensitive). Comparing in-class agents, minimum inhibitory"
		"concentration (MIC) values for voriconazole were lower than other triazoles,"
		whereas micafungin had lower MIC values compared with other echinocandins.
		CONCLUSION: Both traditional and newer antifungals included agents that were
		highly efficacious against in vitro Candida species. Although the authors' study
		"data suggest that older, established antifungals are likely adequate for the"
		"treatment of Candida endophthalmitis, newer antifungal agents also can be"
		considered. [Ophthalmic Surg Lasers Imaging Retina. 2019;50:S13-S17.].

PG	-	1164-70
AB	-	"We conducted prospective, active population-based surveillance for candidemia"
		(defined as any Candida species isolated from blood) in Atlanta and San Francisco
		"(total population, 5.34 million) during 1992-1993. The average annual incidence"
		"of candidemia at both sites was 8 per 100,000 population. The highest incidence"
		"(75 per 100,000) occurred among infants </=1 year old. In 19% of patients,"
		candidemia developed prior to or on the day of admission. Underlying medical
		"conditions included cancer (26%), abdominal surgery (14%), diabetes mellitus"
		"(13%), and human immunodeficiency virus infection (10%). In 47% of cases, species"
		"of Candida other than Candida albicans were isolated, most commonly Candida"
		"parapsilosis, Candida glabrata, and Candida tropicalis. Antifungal susceptibility"
		testing of 394 isolates revealed minimal levels of azole resistance among C.
		"albicans, C. tropicalis, and C. parapsilosis. These data document the substantial"
		burden of candidemia and its changing epidemiology. Continued surveillance will
		be important to monitor the epidemiology of candidemia and to detect emergence of
		resistance to azoles.

TI	-	Changing epidemiology of nosocomial bloodstream infections in 11 teaching
		hospitals in Taiwan between 1993 and 2006.
PG	-	416-29

AB	-	"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Healthcare-associated infections, formerly known as"
		"nosocomial infections, are one of the most important issues in current practice."
		"Understanding trends in overall infection rates, as well as their incidence and"
		"proportion among different causative organisms, can help us to better define our"
		infection control methods and therapy goals. To understand the changing
		"epidemiology of nosocomial bloodstream infections (BSI) in Taiwan, we"
		retrospectively collected nosocomial infection data from 11 hospitals and
		examined the trends and changing patterns of nosocomial BSI. METHODS: Eleven
		major teaching hospitals in Taiwan were invited to participate in the study. The
		"overall density of nosocomial infections and major BSI-causing organisms,"
		"including Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii,"
		"and Candida species, were collected. The distribution of the different Candida"
		"species was also recorded. Background parameters from the 11 hospitals, including"
		"the size of the hospital, hospital capacity, the number of blood stream infection"
		"events, and average length of stay, were also recorded. RESULTS: The incidence of"
		"nosocomial BSI ranged 0.23-2.56 per 1,000 patient-days, which accounted for 8-43%"
		of all nosocomial infections. The most common causative organism of nosocomial
		"bacteremia was S. aureus, ranging 0.88-0.01 per 1,000 patient-days. Overall, the"
		"incidence of S. aureus bacteremia has decreased over the last 13 years, but this"
		difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.053). The rate of Candida
		fungemia (p < 0.01) and A. baumannii (p = 0.03) bacteremia increased
		"significantly. C. albicans accounted for most cases of nosocomial fungemia,"
		"ranging from 40% to 80%, followed by Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis and"
		"Candida glabrata. However, the incidence varied significantly from hospital to"
		"hospital, and the highest incidence was observed in a cancer center. CONCLUSION:"
		The overall incidence rate of S. aureus bacteremia in the 11 major hospitals
		"studied had decreased over the last decade, though the difference was not"
		"statistically significant. However, the rate of Candida fungemia and A. baumannii"
		bacteremia had increased significantly.

AB	-	"We conducted a prospective, multicenter observational study of adults (n=1447)"
		and children (n=144) with candidemia at tertiary care centers in the United
		States in parallel with a candidemia treatment trial that included nonneutropenic
		adults. Candida albicans was the most common bloodstream isolate recovered from
		adults and children (45% vs. 49%) and was associated with high mortality (47%
		among adults vs. 29% among children). Three-month survival was better among
		children than among adults (76% vs. 54%; P<.001). Most children received
		"amphotericin B as initial therapy, whereas most adults received fluconazole. In"
		"adults, Candida parapsilosis fungemia was associated with lower mortality than"
		was non-parapsilosis candidemia (24% vs. 46%; P<.001). Mortality was similar
		among subjects with Candida glabrata or non-glabrata candidemia; mortality was
		also similar among subjects with C. glabrata candidemia who received fluconazole
		rather than other antifungal therapy. Subjects in the observational cohort had
		higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores than did
		"participants in the clinical trial (18.6 vs. 16.1), which suggests that the"
		former subjects are more often excluded from therapeutic trials.

TI	-	Hematogenous infections due to Candida parapsilosis: changing trends in fungemic
		patients at a comprehensive cancer center during the last four decades.
PG	-	6-Nov
AB	-	This study was performed to evaluate trends in species distribution in patients'
		with hematogenous candidiasis at a comprehensive cancer center. The results of a
		"retrospective analysis from January 1, 1993 to December 31, 1998 were compared"
		with prior reports from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in the last forty
		"years. In 570 total episodes since 1974, 43.9% were due to Candida albicans."
		"During 1990's, C. parapsilosis emerged as the most frequent yeast species in the"
		non-C. albicans group (36.1% during 1993-1998 from 20.9% 1974-1982; p < 0.01). An
		increase in C. krusei from 5.9% (1974-1982) to 10.5% during the recent six years
		(1993-1998) was also noticed. The proportion of C. tropicalis among non-albicans
		"fungemia during 1974-1982 was 42.8%, whereas in 1993 to 1998 a marked decline in"
		"C. tropicalis hematogenous infection was observed (27.8%; p < 0.01). During 1998,"
		the incidence of candidemia declined from 7.1% (1972-1973) and 6.5% (1982) to
		"3.4% (p < 0.01), and improved survival among fungemic patients (33% mortality in"
		1998; 77.3% during 1974-1982; p < 0.001) was encouraging. The increase in C.
		parapsilosis bloodstream invasion during 1990's was associated with a significant
		reduction in the endogenous non-albicans Candida tropicalis infection that
		"probably resulted in part due to the common prophylaxis, and/or preemptive"
		fluconazole given routinely in high-risk patients undergoing treatment for
		cancer. The widespread use of extraneous implantable and/or semi-implantable
		indwelling intra-vascular devices may also have played an important role in
		promoting (exogenous) C. parapsilosis infection. This study emphasizes the
		"importance of periodic evaluation of candidemia, especially at centers caring for"
		patients at risk.

PG	-	137-43
LID	-	10.1080/13693780802144339 [doi]
AB	-	The aim of this study was to determine in vitro susceptibility profiles of
		Venezuelan strains of Candida spp. to four antifungal agents. One hundred and
		forty five (145) isolates were recovered during a 1-year period (June 2006 to
		June 2007) from clinical specimens of patients with severe Candida spp.
		"infections in 15 hospitals. In vitro susceptibilities to amphotericin B,"
		"fluconazole, itraconazole and voriconazole were determined by modified Etest. Non"
		Candida albicans Candida spp. were the most frequently isolated yeasts (72.4%) in
		comparison with C. albicans (27.6%). Candida spp. strains showed MIC ranges
		between <0.002 and 0.5 mug/ml to amphotericin B. While none were found to be
		"resistant to voriconazole, 5.5% and 27.6% of the test strains were resistant to"
		"fluconazole and itraconazole, respectively. C. albicans remains the most"
		susceptible of the yeasts studied to fluconazole and itraconazole (P<0.05) when
		compared with non C. albicans Candida spp. C. krusei showed the greater
		"cross-resistance to azoles, followed by C. glabrata, C. tropicalis and C."
		"parapsilosis, while C. albicans isolates did not demonstrate this characteristic."
		It is very important to carry out the correct species identification of clinical
		yeast isolates because they show up variations in both distribution and
		"susceptibility profiles according to the hospital, patient's underlying disease,"
		"clinical specimen analyzed, and the geographical region in which the studies were"
		conducted. The Mycology Department of the INHRR is the national reference center
		"responsible for antifungal resistance surveillance, performing the susceptibility"
		tests with isolates recovered from hospitalized patients in public health centres
		which do not have mycological diagnosis laboratories.

TI	-	Neonatal Candida glabrata sepsis: clinical and laboratory features compared with
		other Candida species.
PG	-	39-43
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown a rise in Candida glabrata infections among
		"immunocompromised adults. In published case series of neonatal candidemia,"
		"however, the species glabrata is uncommon. We conducted a retrospective chart"
		"review to examine the epidemiology, clinical presentation and outcome of neonatal"
		infection with C. glabrata compared with other species of Candida. METHODS:
		Neonatal and microbiology databases of two affiliated hospitals were searched for
		all cases of candidemia in neonatal intensive care unit patients with suspected
		"sepsis from 1991 through 1998. RESULTS: Of 58 cases of Candida sepsis, 9 (15%)"
		"were caused by C. glabrata (CG), 41 (71%) by C. albicans (CA) and 8 (14%) by C."
		parapsilosis (CP). There was no change in the proportion of candidemia caused by
		glabrata species in the years studied. Although there was a significantly higher
		"proportion of CG cases at 1 hospital (29% vs. 6%, P = 0.01), there was no case"
		clustering to suggest direct nosocomial spread. Compared with other Candida
		"species, CG occurred in infants of higher gestational age (CG 29.7 weeks, CA 26.6"
		"weeks, CP 27.3 weeks) and birth weight (CG 1442 g, CA 931 g, CP 965 g). Patients"
		with CG sepsis were more likely to be receiving broad spectrum antibiotics at the
		"time of diagnosis (CG 67%, CA 38%, CP 38%), were less likely to present with"
		"apnea and had less severe thrombocytopenia. Of 9 patients with CG sepsis, 1 had"
		"meningitis, 1 had necrotizing enterocolitis and 3 had candiduria. CONCLUSION: C."
		glabrata is a significant nosocomial pathogen in the neonate.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candidemia is an increasing problem in tertiary care hospitals
		"worldwide. Here, we report the first outbreak of candidemia caused by"
		fluconazole-resistant C. parapsilosis (FRCP) strains in Brazil. METHODS: This was
		a cross-sectional study of clinical and microbiological data of all candidemic
		episodes diagnosed from July 2011 to February 2012 in a 200-bed tertiary care
		hospital. Initial yeast identification and susceptibility testing were performed
		using the VITEK 2 - System. Isolates of Candida spp. resistant to fluconazole
		were sent to a reference laboratory (LEMI-UNIFESP) for further molecular
		identification and confirmation of resistance by CLSI microdilution test. A
		multivariate analysis was conducted to identify factors associated with FRCP
		infection. RESULTS: We identified a total of 40 critically ill patients with
		candidemia (15 women) with a median age of 70 years. The incidence of candidemia
		"was 6 cases/1,000 patients admissions, including 28 cases (70 %) of infection"
		"with C. parapsilosis, 21 of which (75 %) were resistant to fluconazole. In only"
		19 % of FRCP candidemia cases had fluconazole been used previously. The results
		of our study indicated that diabetes is a risk factor for FRCP candidemia
		"(p = 0.002). Overall, mortality from candidemia was 45 %, and mortality from"
		episodes of FRCP infections was 42.9 %. CONCLUSIONS: The clustering of incident
		cases in the ICU and molecular typing of strains suggest horizontal transmission
		of FRCP. Accurate vigilant monitoring for new nosocomial strains of FRCP is
		required.

		parapsilosis in an immunocompetent young adult.
PG	-	69-71
LID	-	10.1016/j.mmcr.2019.04.012 [doi]
AB	-	Candida parapsilosis (C. parapsilosis) and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa (R.
		mucilaginosa) have emerged as a potential pathogen in immunosuppressed hosts;
		they rarely induce onychomycosis in immunocompetent hosts without assistance from
		other pathogens. Here we present onychomycosis induced by two strains on
		different toenails in an immunocompetent young adult. The patient presented with
		onychomycosis on left and right first toenails due to R. mucilaginosa and C.
		"parapsilosis, respectively. Based on the diagnosis, he had been orally treated"
		with itraconazole 200 twice daily for one week every four weeks that repeated 7
		"times; however, the toenails did not respond satisfactorily to the treatment."
		"After two months of drug cessation, we confirmed that the two toenails were"
		infected with different fungi. R. mucilaginosa was isolated from the left first
		"toenail, and C. parapsilosis was isolated from the right first toenail."
		Identifications were confirmed by morphological and cultural characteristics as
		well as by DNA molecular analysis. After determining in vitro drug
		"susceptibility, the patient was successfully treated with a topical application"
		of ketoconazole cream on the left toenail and oral itraconazole. It is the rare
		known case of different nails being infected by R. mucilaginosa and C.
		parapsilosis respectively.

		Jordan.
PG	-	103-7
AB	-	Due to the rising importance of Candida glabrata and other non-albicans Candida
		"as principle human opportunistic pathogens, 356 women with abnormal vaginal"
		"discharge who attended a private obstetrics and gynecology clinic in Amman,"
		"Jordan, between January 1999 and February 2001 were examined. The isolation rate"
		of Candida spp. from high-vaginal swabs was 44.9%. CHROMagar Candida and
		"conventional mycological methods identified six isolated Candida spp., including"
		"C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, C. krusei, and C."
		"kefyr. The percentages of C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. tropicalis isolates"
		"were 43.1%, 32.5%, and 8.1%, respectively. C. albicans was isolated in"
		combination with C. tropicalis and C. krusei in two patients. Statistical
		analysis of the present results clearly show an increase in the incidence of
		"vulvovaginal candidiasis caused by C. glabrata in the two study periods,"
		"1994-1996 and 1999-2001 (P = 0.0186). In contrast, comparing the proportions of"
		"vulvovaginal candidiasis caused by C. albicans in the two periods, there was no"
		"significant difference. These results may have significant clinical implications,"
		as C. glabrata are innately less susceptible to most antifungal agents than C.
		albicans; these findings support viewing this organism as a major pathogen.

AB	-	"In view of the new viral COVID-19 pandemic, the fungal Candida auris epidemic"
		still in progress worldwide highlights non-Candida albicans candidal infections.
		We describe an immunocompetent woman with a cutaneous manifestation of Candida
		"parasilopsis fungemia, a prominent eschar, which proved to be the nidus for the"
		candidemia. We stress the value of selectively removing eschars. C. parasilopsis
		and C. auris are increasingly important causes of sepsis and wound infections. We
		emphasize that commercially available biochemical-based tests may misidentify C.
		"auris as C. parapsilosis, and stress the added danger of C. auris to critically"
		ill-hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Any health care facility with evidence of
		"infection or colonization with C. auris requires very close monitoring, since"
		this fungus is a nosocomial threat comparable to SARS-CoV-2 in its mortality and
		fomite adhesiveness! Both organisms have the potential to be transmitted as
		nosocomial pathogens; health care workers need to follow strict CDC guidelines.
		"During this COVID-19 pandemic, every health care facility should closely monitor"
		for the possible deadly combination of the SARS-CoV-2 and C. auris. The
		identification of C. auris necessitates use of sophisticated technology not
		readily available to make this essential diagnosis since C. auris is multi-drug
		resistant and isolation precautions would become paramount.

		Candida-associated intraabdominal infection.
PG	-	185-91
LID	-	10.1345/aph.1K328 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Concerns surrounding the potential extra gut complication of gastric
		acid suppression are becoming increasingly realized. OBJECTIVE: To determine
		whether chronic antisecretory treatment with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or
		histamine(2)-receptor antagonist (H(2)RA) is associated with the presence of
		Candida spp. in cases of complicated intraabdominal infection. METHODS: We
		conducted a case-controlled study of adult surgical intensive care unit patients
		with complicated intraabdominal infection during a 5-year period. Exclusion
		"criteria consisted of primary peritonitis, diagnosis of intraabdominal infection"
		"more than 72 hours before hospital admission, or a stay in the intensive care"
		unit of less than 72 hours. Patients were categorized into either the
		antisecretory group (H(2)RA or PPI therapy prior to admission) or control group
		(no prior antisecretory therapy). RESULTS: One hundred eighteen patients met
		inclusion criteria. Chronic antisecretory (n = 41) and control (n = 77) patients
		were similar except in median age (69.0 vs 59.0 y; p = 0.026) and preadmission
		antibiotic use (36.6% vs 15.6%; p = 0.010). The 2 groups had a similar proportion
		of patients with Candida (30.3% vs 32.1%; p = 0.857); the cultures included C.
		"albicans, C. glabrata, and C. parapsilosis. Yeast was recovered more often in"
		patients diagnosed with community-acquired intraabdominal infection and in
		"patients who had used PPIs before hospital admission (p = 0.066). Additionally,"
		Candida was cultured more often in antisecretory patients with a history of prior
		abdominal surgery than in control patients (91.7% vs 62.5%; p = 0.066).
		CONCLUSIONS: No significant difference was found in the number of patients in the
		antisecretory and control groups from whom peritoneal Candida was recovered.
		"However, patients with prior abdominal surgery and those in the community with"
		chronic PPI use may be predisposed to Candida-associated intraabdominal
		infections.

AB	-	The incidence of Candida bloodstream infection has increased over the past years.
		"In the Center-West region of Brazil, data on candidemia are scarce. This paper"
		reports a retrospective analysis of 96 cases of Candida bloodstream infection at
		"a Brazilian tertiary-care teaching hospital in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul,"
		"from January 1998 to December 2006. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data"
		were collected from medical records and from the hospital's laboratory database.
		"Patients' ages ranged from three days to 92 years, with 53 (55.2%) adults and 43"
		"(44.8%) children. Of the latter, 25 (58.1%) were newborns. The risk conditions"
		"most often found were: long period of hospitalization, utilization of venous"
		"central catheter, and previous use of antibiotics. Fifty-eight (60.4%) patients"
		died during the hospitalization period and eight (13.7%) of them died 30 days
		after the diagnosis of candidemia. Candida albicans (45.8%) was the most
		"prevalent species, followed by C. parapsilosis (34.4%), C. tropicalis (14.6%) and"
		C. glabrata (5.2%). This is the first report of Candida bloodstream infection in
		the state of Mato Grosso do Sul and it highlights the importance of considering
		the possibility of invasive Candida infection in patients exposed to risk
		"factors, particularly among neonates and the elderly."

TI	-	A prospective epidemiological survey of candidaemia in Sweden.
PG	-	52-5
AB	-	A prospective epidemiological survey of candidaemia was performed in central
		"Sweden from January 1998 to December 1999. In total, 191 episodes were reported"
		with an overall rate of 0.32/1000 admissions. Candida albicans was identified in
		"128 cases (67%), followed by Candida glabrata in 30 (15.7%) and Candida"
		"parapsilosis in 14 (7.3%). Predisposing factors included surgery (31.4%),"
		"intensive care (18.8%), solid tumour or haematological malignancy (15.7%), and"
		foetal immaturity (15.7%). Non-albicans Candida species were more prevalent among
		"patients with haematological malignancies (56%), compared to surgical (30%) and"
		ICU patients (19%). The crude mortality rate of candidaemia was 31%. The highest
		"mortality rate was observed in patients with haematological malignancies (41.2%),"
		"age > 70 y (41%), surgery (38.5%) and infections with > 1 Candida species (40%)"
		or C. glabrata (38%).

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: Candida could become the second most frequent cause of nosocomial
		"urinary tract infection. Although Candida albicans is the most important species,"
		others have arisen as emerging pathogens. The aim of this study was to analyze
		the presence of candiduria in inpatients. METHODS: We performed a retrospective
		"study of Candida isolates from adult inpatient urocultures over five years,"
		"gathering and tabulating data on: the species; susceptibility to fluconazole,"
		"amphotericin B, and voriconazole (Vitek2, BioMerieux); presence of catheter;"
		hospital department of origin; and patient age and sex. RESULTS: We detected 289
		"yeast episodes, observing an annual increase: 134 (46.4%) were non-C. albicans"
		"yeasts, with 57 (19.7%) being Candida glabrata, 37 (12.8%) Candida tropicalis, 25"
		"(8.6%) Candida parapsilosis, and 10 (3.5%) Candida lusitaniae. Most isolates"
		"derived from catheterized (240, 83.0%) and Internal Medicine Department (118,"
		"40.8%) patients, observing an annual increase; 152 (52.6%) isolates were from"
		"males, and the mean age was >65 years. Susceptibility to antifungals was >85%."
		CONCLUSIONS: Inpatient urocultures should include data on the presence of
		"Candida, which is more prevalent in Internal Medicine Department inpatients, in"
		"those with urinary catheter, and in over 65-year-olds. Almost half of the"
		"isolates were non-C. albicans yeasts, and we recommend complete identification of"
		the species involved.

		review of the literature.
PG	-	185-7
AB	-	The description of the association between the use of amphotericin-B (amB) and
		the development of systemic arterial hypertension was only anecdotal so far. We
		describe the case of a 19-year-old female patient who had acute lymphoblastic
		leukemia and developed prolonged neutropenia after reinduction chemotherapy.
		"Candida parapsilosis was isolated from blood cultures, and amB was started."
		Sustained severe arterial hypertension developed shortly after amB administration
		"and continued for several hours after the infusion. Aldosterone, blood urea"
		"nitrogen, and creatinine levels were normal. After clinical improvement, amB was"
		"replaced by fluconazole, and blood pressure normalized. Severe hypertension may"
		be an adverse event associated with AmB treatment that requires intensive
		treatment.

		"pneumonia in Nairobi, Kenya."
PG	-	1286-91
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To determine the significance of Pneumocystis jirovecii infection in
		the Kenyan paediatric population. DESIGN: Sixty samples of induced sputum from
		"children aged < or =23 months, half of whom were human immunodeficiency virus"
		"(HIV) positive, admitted with severe pneumonia in Nairobi were subjected to"
		immunofluorescent staining for detection of P. jirovecii and microbiological
		culture. RESULTS: P. jirovecii was detected in 8/60 (13%) as a copathogen with
		other respiratory pathogens. Five of eight samples with >5 oocysts were from
		"HIV-positive children aged < or =6 months, while equivocally scored samples (< or"
		=5 oocysts) were from HIV-negative children aged >6 months. Klebsiella pneumoniae
		"was significantly recovered in 26/ 60 (43%), followed by Escherichia coli 11/60"
		"(18%) and Staphylococcus aureus 8/60 (13%). Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus"
		influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated infrequently. Candida
		"albicans was recovered from 27/60 (45%), while the frequency of C. tropicalis, C."
		"glabrata and C. parapsilosis was 7%, 5% and 3% respectively. Multidrug resistance"
		"among E. coli and K. pneumoniae were: sulphamethoxazoletrimethoprim 100% vs. 69%,"
		chloramphenicol 55% vs. 73% and ampicillin 100% vs. 89%. CONCLUSION:
		"Paediatricians in Kenya should be aware of Pneumocystis pneumonia, irrespective"
		of the patient's HIV status.

PG	-	65-8
AB	-	The objective of this study was to characterize the epidemiology of candidemia in
		"cancer patients in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. An 18-month survey of"
		fungemia in patients with cancer was undertaken in three Hospitals in Rio de
		"Janeiro. Forty-three episodes of candidemia were identified in 43 patients, 43 of"
		which were episodes of candidemia; in ten case the strains were not available for
		further identification of species and were excluded from this analysis. The
		"overall distribution of fungi causing fungemia was: Candida albicans (5), Candida"
		"tropicalis (16), Candida parapsilosis (6), Candida guilliermondii (4), Candida"
		lusitaniae (1) and Candida stellatoidea (1). Antifungal prophylaxis had been
		administered before the episode of fungemia in only six patients (18.2%): oral
		"itraconazole in three patients and oral nistatin, low dose intravenous"
		amphotericin B and oral fluconazole in one patient each. There was no difference
		"in the presence of risk factors, clinical characteristics or in the outcome"
		"between albicans and non-albicans species, nor between Candida tropicalis and"
		other non-albicans species. There was a clear predominance of non-albicans
		"species, regardless of the underlying disease, antifungal prophylaxis or the"
		presence of neutropenia.

		patients with suspected sepsis were processed. Candidaemia was diagnosed in 7927
		(1.31%) cases. The frequency of cases rose significantly (P = 0.000) in the last
		"quarter of the study. Candida tropicalis (40.1%) was the most common species,"
		"followed by Candida albicans (15.2%), Wickerhamomyces anomalus (13.1%), Candida"
		"krusei (6.6%), Candida parapsilosis (4.7%) and others. Rare species such as"
		"Candida auris, Candida lambica, Candida orthopsilosis, Candida vishwanathii were"
		identified after the introduction of MALDI-TOF. The minimum inhibitory
		concentrations of amphotericin B rose significantly from the first to last
		quarter (0.5%-4.9%). Fluconazole resistance was fairly constant at 7.4%-8.8%.
		CONCLUSION: Local epidemiology of candidaemia at our centre was distinct
		regarding prevalence and change of spectrum of species. The identification of
		rare species was possible after the introduction of MALDI-TOF. With the emergence
		"of multidrug-resistant C. auris and resistance in other species, routine AFST has"
		become imperative.

AB	-	Candida parapsilosis may be responsible for bloodstream infections (BSI) and it
		is characterised by an increased incidence of fluconazole resistance. A 75-year
		old woman with severe comorbidities received the insertion of a peripherally
		inserted central venous catheter. Fluconazole did not prevent a C. parapsilosis
		BSI hence caspofungin was started after a nephrotoxic first-line treatment with
		amphotericin B. The ratio of peak plasma concentration over the minimum
		inhibitory concentration (C(max)/MIC) was adopted to maximise efficacy of
		caspofungin. MIC and plasma C(max) values were obtained by broth microdilution
		"and LC-MS, respectively. Interestingly, daily doses of 1 mg/kg (total daily dose,"
		50 mg) allowed the achievement of C(max)/MIC values > 10. The optimised regimen
		"was safe and effective, leading to negative blood culture at day 8. The patient"
		"was discharged home at day 21. Therefore, individualised dosing regimens of"
		caspofungin may be effective and safe even in the case of C. parapsilosis BSI.

		in the neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) of three US hospitals were collected
		over periods of 3.5-9 years. Two previously published microsatellite markers and
		"three additional trinucleotide markers were used to produce multiplex genotypes,"
		which revealed broad strain diversity among the NICU isolates with a combined
		index of discrimination (D) = 0.997. A cluster of eight related CP strains from
		four infants in a single NICU was observed. An extended collection of 24 CP
		isolates from the general population of that hospital showed that the cluster of
		NICU isolates was related to three isolates from general hospital patients. This
		microsatellite marker set is suitable to investigate clusters of colonizing and
		infecting strains of CP.

AB	-	Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients may suffer increased morbidity and mortality
		"through colonisation, allergy and invasive infection from fungi. The black yeast,"
		Exophiala dermatitidis (synonym Wangiella dermatitidis) has been found with
		"increasing frequency in sputum specimens of CF patients, with reported isolation"
		"rates ranging from 1.1 to 15.7%. At present, no diagnostic PCR exists to aid with"
		the clinical laboratory detection and identification of this organism. A novel
		species-specific PCR-based assay was developed for the detection of E.
		"dermatitidis, based on employment of rDNA operons and interspacer (ITS) regions"
		"between these rDNA operons. Two novel primers, (designated ExdF & ExdR) were"
		designed in silico with the aid of computer-aided alignment software and with the
		"alignment of multiple species of Exophiala, as well as with other commonly"
		"described yeasts and filamentous fungi within CF sputum, including Candida,"
		"Aspergillus and Scedosporium. An amplicon of approximately 455 bp was generated,"
		spanning the partial ITS1 region - the complete 5.8S rDNA region - partial ITS2
		"region, employing ExdF (forward primer [16-mer], 5'-CCG CCT ATT CAG GTC C-3' and"
		"ExdR (reverse primer [16-mer], 5'-TCT CTC CCA CTC CCG C-3', was employed and"
		optimised on extracted genomic DNA from a well characterised culture of E.
		"dermatitidis, as well as with high quality genomic DNA template from a further 16"
		"unrelated fungi, including Candida albicans, C. dubliniensis, C. parapsilosis, C."
		"glabrata, Scedosporium apiospermum, Penicillium sp., Aspergillus fumigatus,"
		"Aspergillus versicolor, Pichia guilliermondii, Rhodotorula sp., Trichosporon sp.,"
		"Aureobasidium pullulans, Fusarium sp., Mucor hiemalis, Bionectria ochroleuca,"
		Gibberella pulicaris. Results demonstrated that only DNA from E. dermatitidis
		"gave an amplification product of the expected size, whilst none of the other"
		fungi were amplifiable. Subsequent employment of this primer pair detected this
		yeast from mycological cultures from 2/50 (4%) adult CF patients. These two
		patients were the only patients who were previously shown to have a cultural
		history of E. dermatitidis from their sputum. E. dermatitidis is a slow-growing
		"fungus, which usually takes up to two weeks to culture in the microbiology"
		"laboratory and therefore is slow to detect conventionally, with the risk of"
		bacterial overgrowth from common co-habiting pan- and multiresistant bacterial
		"pathogens from sputum, namely Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia"
		"complex organisms, hence this species-specific PCR assay may help detect this"
		"organism from CF sputum more specifically and rapidly. Overall, employment of"
		"this novel assay may help in the understanding of the occurrence, aetiology and"
		"epidemiology of E. dermatitidis, as an emerging fungal agent in patients with CF."

TI	-	The changing face of candidemia: emergence of non-Candida albicans species and
		antifungal resistance.
PG	-	617-23
AB	-	"OBJECTIVES: To assess the changing epidemiology of candidemia in the 1990s, to"
		evaluate the clinical implications for the presence of non-Candida albicans in
		"blood, and to evaluate the presence of antifungal resistance in relation to prior"
		antifungal administration. DESIGN: Multicenter prospective observational study of
		patients with positive blood cultures for Candida species or Torulopsis glabrata.
		SETTING: Four tertiary care medical centers. RESULTS: Four hundred twenty-seven
		consecutive patients were enrolled. The frequency of candidemia due to non-C.
		albicans species significantly increased in each hospital throughout the 3.5-year
		study period (P = 0.01). Thirteen percent of candidemias occurred in patients who
		were already receiving systemic antifungal agents. Candidemias developing while
		receiving antifungal therapy were more likely caused by non-C. albicans species
		than by C. albicans species (P = 0.0005). C. parapsilosis and C. krusei were more
		"commonly seen with prior fluconazole therapy, whereas T. glabrata was more"
		commonly seen with prior amphotericin B therapy. Candida species isolated during
		episodes of breakthrough candidemia exhibited a significantly higher MIC to the
		antifungal agent being administered (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In this large scale
		"study, the non-C. albicans species, especially T. glabrata, emerged as important"
		and frequent pathogens causing fungemia. This finding has major clinical
		implications given the higher complication and mortality rate associated with the
		non-C. albicans species. The change in the pattern of candidemia might be partly
		attributed to the increase in number of immunocompromised hosts and the
		widespread use of prophylactic or empiric antifungal therapy. This is an ominous
		sign given the in vitro resistance of the non-C. albicans species to currently
		available antifungal agents.

TI	-	Review of 49 neonates with acquired fungal sepsis: further characterization.
PG	-	61-6
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Neonatal acquired fungal sepsis (AFS) is a risky condition that
		warrants every effort for early diagnosis and management. METHODS: We
		retrospectively reviewed the medical charts of all 4445 neonatal intensive care
		unit (NICU) admissions in the past 10 years and detected 49 neonates with AFS. We
		then compared their data with those of 49 matched control neonates who did not
		"have AFS. The following details were collected: gestational, perinatal and"
		neonatal courses; bacterial sepsis; antibacterial therapy; laboratory and imaging
		investigations; and antifungal therapy and its complications. RESULTS: The
		incidence of AFS was.4 to 2 cases per 1000 live-births and 3.8% to 12.9% of very
		"low birth weight (VLBW) infants. Compared with 1989 through 1992, between 1993"
		and 1995 the rate of AFS in VLBW neonates significantly increased (3. 8%-5.6% -->
		"9.6%-12.9%), along with a significant increase of NICU admission rate (369-410"
		"--> 496-510 admissions/year). Compared with controls, AFS neonates had"
		"significantly longer hospitalizations, higher rates of mechanical ventilation,"
		"umbilical vein catheterization, and previous treatment with broad-spectrum"
		"antibacterial agents (amikacin, vancomycin, ceftazidime, or imipenem). At the"

		treatment challenge: A case report.

LID	-	10.1097/MD.0000000000022487 [doi]
LID	-	e22487
AB	-	"RATIONALE: Fungal endocarditis (FE) is a rare disease, in which antifungal"
		treatment is necessary. When FE is complicated with prosthetic heart valve and/or
		"atrial fibrillation, the coadministration of antifungal agents and warfarin is"
		inevitable. We report a case of rheumatic heart disease with atrial fibrillation
		who developed FE following prosthetic heart valve replacement. The international
		normalized ratio (INR) increased significantly during the antifungal treatment
		with fluconazole. A discussion of the antifungal strategy in FE patients with
		prosthetic heart valves and/or atrial fibrillation and the interaction between
		antifungal agents and warfarin was performed. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 54-year-old
		"Chinese woman experienced intermittent fevers, aphemia, and weakness in her right"
		"extremities. Her temperature was 38.7°C, and there was atrial fibrillation with"
		heart rate 110 times/min. Neurological examination revealed that she had
		"drowsiness, Broca aphasia, right central facial paralysis, and hemiplegia"
		"(Medical Research Council scale, upper limb grade 0, lower limb grade II)."
		DIAGNOSES: Multiple infarction on magnetic resonance imaging and the occlusion of
		left middle cerebral artery suggested the occurrence of cerebral embolism. The
		presence of Candida parapsilosis in the results of 4 blood cultures and the
		existence of valve vegetation in the reexamination of echocardiogram supported
		the diagnosis of FE. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was given antifungal therapy with
		fluconazol. The INR increased dramatically on the 9th day of antifungal
		"treatment, and subcutaneous bruising occurred at the intravenous infusion site."
		The antagonist of vitamin K1 was used and warfarin was reduced to a smaller
		dosage. The antifungal agent was replaced with caspofungin. OUTCOMES: Her speech
		"improved significantly, and the muscle strength of her paralyzed side reached the"
		Medical Research Council scale of grade IV. She continued to receive caspofungin
		for antifungal treatment with relatively stable INR and waited for heart valve
		surgery. LESSONS: The choice of antifungal agents is often a big challenge for FE
		"patients, especially when they need warfarin for anticoagulation. It is better to"
		administer a low dose of warfarin while carefully monitoring the INR or choose
		the antifungal drugs with little or no effect on warfarin.

AB	-	"PURPOSE: to characterize, phenotypically, yeasts isolated from the vaginal"
		content of 223 symptomatic (S) and asymptomatic (A) adult women with
		"vulvovaginitis, and to determine the clinical indicators which may lead to the"
		appearance of signs and symptoms related to the mucosa involvement by this
		pathology. METHODS: a questionnaire with open and closed questions on
		"epidemiological clinical data was applied initially. Then, mycological diagnosis"
		"with sowing in Chrom Agar Candida was done, followed by micro-morphological and"
		biochemical identification. Specific methods for the detection of the virulence
		"factors, proteinase and phospholipase were employed. Statistical analysis was"
		performed through chi2 and Pearson's chi2 tests. RESULTS: the most prevalent
		"species found was Candida albicans (87%, S and 67%, A) followed by Candida"
		"glabrata (4%, S e 17% A). The number of women reporting the use of contraceptives"
		"was higher among the symptomatic, 77%. In the two groups studied, about 87% of"
		the women presented regular menstrual cycles and 57% were married with ages
		"between 30 to 40 years old. Concerning the sexual practices, there has been"
		"concomitance among anal, oral and vaginal habits from the patients. Only Candida"
		albicans produced the virulence factor phospholipase in 37.5% of them. Proteinase
		"has been detected in Candida albicans, Candida glabrata and Candida parapsilosis."
		This latter virulence factor was mainly associated to isolates from symptomatic
		patients. CONCLUSIONS: it is a fact that the vaginal mucosa can be colonized and
		"infected by yeasts, with several Candida species present. Nevertheless, Candida"
		albicans is the most prevalent in the vaginal mucosa of adult women. It is
		"evident the emergence of non-albicans Candida species, some of them with"
		"intrinsic resistance to azolics, such as Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis,"
		"Candida tropicalis, and Candida guillermondii, which can be explained by the"
		inadequate use of medicines and empirical treatment.

AB	-	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of echinocandins in the
		treatment of Candida prosthetic joint infection (PJI) based on published
		literature and on patients we examined. A structured literature review of
		multiple databases was conducted to identify patients who received echinocandins
		"for Candida PJIs. Additionally, we describe here the first cases of PJIs due to"
		"C. parapsilosis, successfully treated with prolonged anidulafungin therapy. Out"
		"of 17 patients, 12 were female and the mean age at diagnosis was 66.0 years. No"
		risk factors associated with Candida PJIs were found in four patients (23.5%).
		"Infection sites included the knee (n = 10, 62.5%), the hip (n = 6, 35.3%) and the"
		"shoulder (n = 1, 5.9%). The most frequently isolated Candida species were C."
		"albicans (n = 7, 41.2%) and C. glabrata (n = 7, 41.2%), followed by C."
		"parapsilosis (n = 2, 11.8%) and C. freyschussii (n = 1, 5.9%). All patients were"
		cured with the combination of systemic antifungal therapy and surgical
		interventions. Two-stage exchange arthroplasty and resection arthroplasty were
		"performed in five and nine patients, respectively. The most frequently used"
		"echinocandins were caspofungin (n = 11, 64.7%), followed by anidulafungin (n = 4,"
		"23.5%) and micafungin (n = 2, 11.8%). The median duration (days) of echinocandin"
		"therapy was as follows: caspofungin (25.5, range 8-56), micafungin (14.0, range"
		"4-56) and anidulafungin (58, range 14-90). This study supports the effective role"
		"of echinocandins, as well as the potential advantage of surgical intervention in"
		"the treatment of Candida PJIs. Furthermore, it provides fundamental data on the"
		safety of long-term echinocandin therapy.

TI	-	Invasive fungal infections in Chile: a multicenter study of fungal prevalence and
		susceptibility during a 1-year period.
PG	-	333-9
AB	-	During the first year of an ongoing surveillance program of invasive fungal
		infections (IFI) a total of 130 patients (56% male) with fungal strains isolated
		from blood and other sterile sites were reported from 13 hospitals in Chile.
		"Significant yeast isolates were obtained from 118 patients, and molds affected 12"
		"patients. The main patient groups affected were neonates, children less than 1"
		year old and adults aged 50-79 years. All fungal bloodstream infections (BSI)
		were due to yeasts; 79 patients (61%) were affected. The main risk factors
		"recorded were antibiotic therapy (76%), stay in the intensive care unit (ICU)"
		(70%) and presence of a central venous catheter (65%). Nosocomial infections were
		"represented in 83.5% of BSI. Overall, Candida albicans (40.8%), C. parapsilosis"
		"(13.1%), C. tropicalis (10%) and Cryptococcus neoformans (10%) were the most"
		common species. Aspergillus fumigatus (3.1%) was the most frequent mold. C.
		"albicans (48.1%) and C. parapsilosis (17.7%), were the most frequent agents"
		"recovered from blood. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Trichosporon mucoides, two"
		"emerging pathogens, were also isolated. All yeasts tested were susceptible to"
		amphotericin B with minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) < or = 1 microg/ml.
		Resistance to itraconazole (MIC > or = 1 microg/ml) and fluconazole (MIC > or =
		"64 microg/ml) was observed in 4 and 6% of cases, respectively. C. glabrata was"
		"the least susceptible species, with 50% of isolates resistant to itraconazole and"
		"33% resistant to fluconazole, with one strain showing combined resistance."
		Reduction of BSI requires greater adherence to hand-washing and related infection
		control guidelines.

TI	-	Evaluation of blood stream infections by Candida in three tertiary hospitals in
		"Salvador, Brazil: a case-control study."
PG	-	36-40
AB	-	Invasive infections caused by Candida spp. are an important problem in
		immunocompromised patients. There is scarce data on the epidemiology of blood
		"stream candidiasis in Salvador, Brazil. This study evaluates the risk factors"
		"associated with candidemia, among patients admitted to three tertiary, private"
		"hospitals, in Salvador, Brazil. We conducted a case-control, retrospective study"
		to compare patients with diagnosis of candidemia in three different tertiary
		"hospitals in Salvador, Brazil. Patients were matched for nosocomial, acquired"
		"infections, according to the causal agent: cases were defined by positive blood"
		cultures for Candida species. Controls were those patients who had a diagnosis of
		"systemic bacterial infection, with a positive blood culture to any bacteria,"
		within the same time period (+/- 30 days) of case identification. The groups were
		compared for the main known risk factors for candidemia and for mortality rates.
		"A hundred thirty-eight patients were identified. Among the 69 cases, only 14 were"
		diagnosed as infected by Candida albicans. Candida species were defined in only
		"eight cultures: C. tropicalis (4 cases), C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, C."
		"guillermondi, C. formata (1 case each). The main risk factors, identified in a"
		"univariate analysis, were: presence of a central venous catheter (CVC), use of"
		"parenteral nutrition support (PNS), previous exposure to antibiotics, and chronic"
		"renal failure (CRF). No association was detected with surgical procedures,"
		"diabetes mellitus, neutropenia or malignancies. Patients were more likely to die"
		"during the hospitalization period, but the rates of death caused by the"
		infections were similar for cases and controls. The length of hospitalization was
		"similar for both groups, as well as the time for a positive blood culture. Blood"
		"stream infection by Candida spp. is associated with CVC, PNS, previous use of"
		"antibiotics, and CRF. The higher mortality rate for cases probably better"
		"reflects the severity of the underlying diseases, than as a direct consequence of"
		Candidemia.

TI	-	Molecular and phenotypic analysis of Candida dubliniensis: a recently identified
		species linked with oral candidosis in HIV-infected and AIDS patients.
PG	-	S96-101
AB	-	"The discovery and characterisation of a novel species of Candida, termed Candida"
		"dubliniensis, associated with oral candidosis in HIV-infected individuals is"
		described. These organisms share several phenotypic characteristics in common
		"with Candida albicans and Candida stellatoidea, including the ability to produce"
		"germ tubes and chlamydospores. However, in contrast to these latter two species,"
		"C. dubliniensis isolates produce abundant chlamydospores, which are often"
		"arranged in contiguous pairs, triplets and other multiples suspended from a"
		single suspensor cell. They belong to C. albicans serotype A and exhibit atypical
		substrate assimilation profiles. Genomic DNA fingerprinting analysis with the C.
		albicans-specific probe 27A and five different oligonucleotide probes consisting
		"of short repeat sequence-containing motifs, demonstrated that C. dubliniensis has"
		a distinct genomic organisation relative to C. albicans and C. stellatoidea. This
		was confirmed by karyotype analysis and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)
		analysis. Comparison of 500 bp of the V3 variable region of the large ribosomal
		subunit genes from 14 separate C. dubliniensis isolates and the corresponding
		"sequences from C. albicans, C. stellatoidea, C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, C."
		"parapsilosis, C. kefyr and C. krusei demonstrated that the C. dubliniensis"
		"isolates formed a homogenous cluster (100% similarity), representing a discrete"
		taxon within the genus Candida that was significantly different from the other
		species analysed.

TI	-	Mycotic keratitis caused by concurrent infections of Exserohilum mcginnisii and
		Candida parapsilosis.
PG	-	37
LID	-	10.1186/1471-2415-13-37 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Mycotic keratitis in human cornea has been rarely reported to be
		associated with a co-infection of filamentous fungi and yeast. This paper aims to
		report a case of mycotic keratitis concurrently infected by Exserohilum
		mcginnisii and Candida parapsilosis. CASE PRESENTATION: A Chinese female
		presented two superposed corneal infiltrates with different size and texture on
		her left eye. In vivo confocal microscopy showed hyper-reflective multiple linear
		with highly branching structures distributing in the anterior corneal stroma.
		Inoculations of the corneal lesion scrape concurrently grew two similar
		superposed colonies on Sabouraud dextrose and chocolate agar plate. The larger
		"colony exhibited mould, cottony and floccose at the edge, while the smaller one"
		showed creamy and shiny surface. Modified slide culture for mould revealed hyphae
		"were septate, and conidia were brown, smooth-walled, cylindrical to slight"
		clavate with 6 to 13 pseudosepta. Based on the morphology of microscopic and
		"macroscopic characteristics, the mould was identified as Exserohilum mcginnisii."
		Smear of the non-mould colony showed ellipse or ovoid budding yeast-like cells
		with abundant pseudomycelium. Vitek Yeast Biochemical Card test identified the
		yeast as Candida parapsilosis. With treatment of combined oral itraconazole with
		"topical amphotericin B, a complete resolution of the corneal infiltrate was"
		achieved within 1.5 months. CONCLUSION: This is the first documented case of
		"human corneal infection by Exserohilum mcginnisii, and also the first report"
		providing evidence of mycotic keratitis in human cornea concurrently infected by
		filamentous fungi and yeast.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the"
		"incidence of fungal infections attributed to Candida species worldwide, with a"
		"major shift toward non-albicans Candida (NAC). In this study, we have described"
		the distribution of Candida species among different hospital departments and
		calculated the antifungal consumption in our facility. We also correlated the
		consumption of certain antifungals and the prevalence of specific Candida
		species. METHODS: This was a retrospective review of all the Candida isolates
		recovered from the computerised microbiology laboratory database of Makassed
		"General Hospital, a tertiary care centre in Beirut, Lebanon, between January 2010"
		and December 2015. Data on antifungal consumption between January 2008 and
		December 2015 were extracted from the hospital pharmacy electronic database. We
		used Spearman's coefficient to find a correlation between Candida species
		"distribution and antifungal consumption. RESULTS: Between 2008 and 2015, we"
		observed that the highest antifungal consumption was in the haematology/oncology
		"department (days of therapy/1000 patient days = 348.12 ± 85.41), and the lowest"
		"was in the obstetrics/gynaecology department (1.36 ± 0.47). In general, the"
		difference in antifungal consumption among various departments was statistically
		"significant (P < 0.0001). Overall, azoles were the most common first-line"
		antifungals in our hospital. Echinocandins and amphotericin B were mostly
		prescribed in the haematology/oncology department. As for Candida species
		"distribution, a total of 1377 non-duplicate isolates were identified between 2010"
		and 2015. A non-homologous distribution of albicans vs. non-albicans was noted
		among the different departments (P = 0.02). The most commonly isolated NAC was
		"Candida glabrata, representing 14% of total Candida species and 59% of NAC."
		"Candida famata (9% of NAC), Candida parapsilosis (3.6% of NAC) and Candida krusei"
		(3% of NAC) were recovered unequally from the different departments. The total
		antifungal consumption correlated positively with the emergence of NAC. The use
		"of azoles correlated positively with Candida glabrata, while amphotericin B"
		formulations correlated negatively with it. None of these correlations reached
		statistical significance. CONCLUSION: Different Candida species were unequally
		"distributed among different hospital departments, and this correlated with"
		"consumption of antifungals in respective departments, highlighting the need for"
		antifungal stewardship.

AB	-	"Candida parapsilosis is a normal saprophyte of the skin, characterized by their"
		"affinity for catheters. This species has, in vitro, a level of sensitivity"
		"against the echinocandins, significantly lower than that observed with other"
		"Candida species. Recently, new species: Candida orthopsilosis and Candida"
		"metapsilosis, phenotypically identical to C. parapsilosis, have been identified"
		"by molecular biology. From 2003 to 2007, in the Cochin hospital, the proportion"
		of C. parapsilosis among non-albicans species isolated from blood cultures
		increased from 17 (3/18) to 38% (5/13). To understand the reasons for this
		"emergence, we retrospectively characterized isolates, conducted a case-control"
		and researched a link between the emergence and introduction of caspofungin in
		our hospital. We analysed data from 26 patients who had candidemia with C.
		parapsilosis. Genotypic analysis of isolates has not identified the new species
		C. orthopsilosis and C. metapsilosis. The case-control study showed a
		broad-spectrum antibiotics was significantly more frequent for candidemia with C.
		"parapsilosis compared to C. albicans (52 versus 26%, P=0.04) as a previous"
		"treatment with caspofungin (11 versus 0%, P=0.04). The introduction of"
		caspofungin is contemporary with the emergence of candidemia with C. parapsilosis
		with a tendency to be related to its level of consumption in the ICU. Our results
		should encourage biologists to closely monitor the frequency and level of
		sensitivity of strains of C. parapsilosis isolated in hospital.

AB	-	Candida infection among multiple sclerosis (MS) patients has not been studied in
		depth. We determined whether there is an association between serological evidence
		of Candida infection and MS. Blood specimens were obtained from 80 MS patients
		and 240 matched controls. Immunofluorescence analysis and ELISA were used to
		detect Candida species antibodies and slot-blot to detect antigens. Using
		"immunofluorescence analysis, moderate to high concentrations of serum antibodies"
		to Candida famata were present in 30 (37.5%) MS patients vs. 30 (12.5%) controls
		(p < 0.001). Results for Candida albicans were 47.5% (38/80) in MS patients vs.
		"21.3% (51/240) in controls (p < 0.001), for Candida parapsilosis 37% (28/80) vs."
		17.1% (41/240) (p < 0.001) and for Candida glabrata 46.3% (37/80) vs. 17.5%
		"(42/240) (p < 0.001), respectively. After adjusting for age and gender, the odds"
		"ratios (95% confidence intervals) for MS, according to the presence of Candida"
		"antigens were: 2.8 (0.3-23.1, p = 0.337) for Candida famata; 1.5 (0.7-3.4, p ="
		"0.290) for Candida albicans; 7.3 (3.2-16.6, p < 0.001) for Candida parapsilosis;"
		"and 3.0 (1.5-6.1, p = 0.002) for Candida glabrata. The results were similar after"
		excluding ten patients on immunosuppressants. The results of this single study
		suggest that Candida species infection may be associated with increased odds of
		MS.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Fungal endocarditis is reported less frequently than bacterial
		"endocarditis, with an incidence of 0-12% of the total pediatric infective"
		"endocarditis. OBJECTIVE: In this study, the incidence of infective endocarditis"
		in Candida bloodstream infections in a tertiary hospital during the periods of
		2007 and 2016 was reviewed. METHODS: Patients with positive blood or catheter
		cultures in terms of Candida spp. during the study period of January 2007 and
		January 2016 were analyzed in terms of Candida infective endocarditis. Infective
		"endocarditis was defined according to the modified Duke criteria. The outcome,"
		possible associated predisposing factors for Candida endocarditis were
		determined. RESULTS: 221 patients and 256 attacks with positive blood or catheter
		cultures in terms of Candida were included in the study. The most common Candida
		"species was Candida parapsilosis, isolated in 157 (61.3%) attacks, followed by"
		"Candida albicans in 70 (27.3%). Neurological diseases (23%), hemato-oncological"
		"diseases (12.1%), previously known heart diseases (8.2%), inborn errors of"
		metabolism (9%) were common comorbidities. Twelve (5.4%) patients had a previous
		"history of cardiac surgery. Among the 221 patients, Candida endocarditis was"
		present in only two (0.9%) of them. CONCLUSION: Although Candida infective
		"endocarditis is an uncommon but frequently fatal infection in pediatrics,"
		echocardiography should be performed routinely for patients with positive blood
		or catheter cultures in terms of Candida. Prompt and effective antimicrobial
		"therapy might prevent cardiac surgery in selected cases, however this could not"
		be a general rule for all patients.

TI	-	Neonatal Candida parapsilosis outbreak with a high case fatality rate.
PG	-	776-81
AB	-	A Candida parapsilosis outbreak of 58 cases in a neonatal intensive care unit
		lasted for 55 months. Patients infected by or colonized with C. parapsilosis were
		mainly very low birth weight infants (birth weight < 1500 g). Their mean birth
		weight was 817 g and their mean gestational age was 28 weeks. Statistical
		analysis including logistic regression confirmed that prematurity was the main
		risk factor. The analysis also suggested that C. parapsilosis infection (or
		colonization) was associated with a poor prognosis. In infants with gestational
		age < 29 weeks the risk for death in C. parapsilosis-infected patients was
		16-fold greater than in those with no C. parapsilosis infection. The case
		fatality rate of C. parapsilosis patients was higher than that of the controls (9
		of 23 vs. 1 of 40; P < 0.0001). The outbreak was most likely a result of
		cross-infection because C. parapsilosis could be isolated only from the patients
		and from the hands of four nurses immediately after they had cared for a
		colonized patient. Cessation of the outbreak was temporally associated with long
		term parenteral fluconazole (6 mg/kg/day) prophylaxis.

		distributed in Venezuela with an incidence of 92.9%. The aim of this study was to
		determine the genera and species that cause dermatomycoses in residents of
		"Anzoátegui state, Venezuela, during the period 2002-2012. A total of 4257"
		"patients with a presumptive diagnosis of superficial mycoses were studied, with"
		ages from 7 months to 79 years. The overall prevalence was 30.9%. The most
		frequent were dermatophytosis (44.7%). M. canis produced 148 cases of tinea
		"capitis. Three dermatophytic agents represented 95% of all cases, with a"
		significant predominance of T. mentagrophytes with 50%. Candidosis occurred in
		"28.4%. C. albicans, and the C. parapsilosis complex, were responsible for 80% of"
		"the cases. The other species identified were C. tropicalis (n = 41, 11.0%), C."
		"glabrata (n = 10, 2.7%), C. guilliermondii (n = 6, 1.6%), C. krusei (n = 4,"
		"1.1%). Pityriasis versicolor occurred in 22.4% of the cases studied, and less"
		frequently were present onychomycosis produced by a non dermatophytic mold:
		"Fusarium oxysporum (n = 34, 65.4%), Aspergillus terreus (n=16, 30.8%) and"
		Scytalidium dimidiatum (n=2; 3.8%). Rare cases of Trichosporon onychomycosis
		(0.5%) and one case of black tinea were also found. Health education in the
		population is recommended to promote measures to prevent transmission of these
		fungi and prevent the spread of this silent public health problem.

		"infection symptoms. RESULTS: Over 7 years, CE was diagnosed in 57 patients aged"
		"17 to 77 years (median age 48 years). Among the patients with CE, there was a"
		preponderance of those with lymphomas (54%) and acute leukemias (30%). The
		"pathogens of CE were C. albicans (33%), C. guilliermondii (26%), C. parapsilosis"
		"(12%), C. krusei (8%), C. lusitaniae (5%), C. famata (4%), C. tropicalis (4%), C."
		"glabrata (4%), and C. pelliculosa (4%). The major risk factors were"
		"polychemotherapy (85%), granulocytopenia (63%), mucosal Candida spp. colonization"
		"(82%), the presence of central venous catheter (CVC) (97%), antibiotics (100%),"
		and glucocorticosteroids (70%). The infection occurred with the intake of an
		antifungal agent in 33% of the patients; 60% had concomitant infections of other
		etiology. Antifungal agents were given to 52 (91%) patients. Within 30 days after
		"CE diagnosis, 20 (35%) patients died; of them 12 (60%) patients showed tumor"
		progression concurrent with the infection. The cure rate for CE was significantly
		"higher in the use of echinocandin as a first-line drug (92%), in complete or"
		"partial remission in hemoblastosis (90%), CVC removal (76%) and in the"
		administration of an antifungal drug on day 1 of detection of positive blood
		cultures (75%). The cure rate was significantly lower when septic shock developed
		"and a patient was transferred to an intensive care unit (15%), when amphotericin"
		"B was used as a first-line drug (45%), when granulocytopenia occurred (53%), or"
		glucocorticoids were given (55%). CONCLUSION: Candida non-albicans constitute a
		high proportion among the pathogens of CE. A number of risk factors influencing
		survival rates in CE have been identified. It is crucial to use echinocandin as a
		first-line agent as soon as possible after isolation of Candida spp. from blood
		cultures.

PG	-	30-40
AB	-	"PURPOSE: Candida endocarditis are rare, with a poor prognosis. Actually, the"
		principal problem concerns the growing incidence of nosocomial fungal infections.
		The objective of the present investigation is to assess a disease which risks
		becoming more pronounced in the future. METHODS: We have collected observations
		of Candida sp. endocarditis between 1985 to 1997 from three French university
		hospitals. RESULTS: Twelve of the observations fit the Duke criteria of acute
		"endocarditis. Patients were eight men and four women, with a mean age of 46"
		"years. An immunodepression was found in seven cases, and four patients were"
		active drug addicts. Six had an underlying heart disease at risk to acute
		"endocarditis. Candidemia risk factors were found in nine cases, with an average"
		of 2.7 risk factors per patient. The fungal agents detected were Candida albicans
		"(eight cases), C. tropicalis (one case), C. parapsilosis (two cases), and C."
		"glabrata (one case). These vegetations were on aortic (seven cases), mitral"
		"(three cases), tricuspid valves (two cases) or in other areas (three cases), with"
		"multiple localizations (two cases). In three observations, vegetations were"
		"associated with myocardium abscesses. Eight patients had embolic complications,"
		two had a cardiac insufficiency leading to death. The treatment was medical in
		all of the cases and combined with a surgical treatment in ten cases. The surgery
		"was performed, on an average, 17 days after diagnosis, allowing seven surviving"
		"patients. Among them, five received a secondary prophylaxis and no recurrence was"
		"recorded. CONCLUSIONS: Prognosis remains severe because of the voluminous,"
		"friable and necrotic vegetations, which favor embolic migrations and which are"
		"not easily accessible to antifungals, which penetrate poorly into these"
		vegetations. Therapy is based on a medical treatment combined with a valve
		"replacement which needs to be done early on, and is followed by a relapse"
		prevention which can occur several years after the initial episode.

		a retrospective epidemiological survey of candidemia and causative Candida
		species. Data from 2003 to 2014 were collected from 10 Japanese university
		"hospitals. A total of 328,318 blood cultures were included. The prevalence of"
		"fungi in all cultures and in positive cultures were 0.58±0.09% and 4.46±0.66%,"
		"respectively. Among the results that were positive for Candida species (N=1,921),"
		Candida albicans was the most common species (39.5%) and was followed by Candida
		"parapsilosis (23.3%), Candida glabrata (13.2%), Candida tropicalis (7.1%),"
		"Candida krusei (3.2%), and others (13.7%). During the last 6 years, the frequency"
		"of C. albicans has significantly decreased in Japan, while that of C. glabrata"
		has increased. Additional surveys are needed to continuously monitor the trends
		in the distribution of candidemia.

		five-year period (1997-2001)].
PG	-	488-92
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: This retrospective study investigates the incidence of candidemia
		and antifungal susceptibility of Candida spp. isolates from blood cultures
		performed in the period from January 1997 to December 2001. METHODS: Amphotericin
		"B, fluconazole, itraconazole and flucytosine minimal inhibitory concentrations"
		(MICs) were determined using the Sensititre YeastOne broth microdilution assay
		"for the 53 isolates detected in the study period: C. parapsilosis (22), C."
		"albicans (19), C. glabrata (5), C. krusei (3), C. tropicalis (2) and C."
		guilliermondii (2). RESULTS: The incidence of candidemia was 0.25 episodes per
		1000 admissions in the period studied. C. parapsilosis was present in 41.5% of
		"cases, followed by C. albicans (35.8%), C. glabrata (9.4%), C. krusei (5.5%), C."
		tropicalis (3.7%) and C. guilliermondii (3.7%). Isolation of C. parapsilosis was
		significantly associated with the neonatal and pediatric ICU. None of the
		isolates presented an amphotericin B MIC > 1 micro g/ml. All the C. krusei
		isolates were resistant to fluconazole. Itraconazole resistance and
		dose-dependent fluconazole susceptibility was found in 80% of C. glabrata
		isolates. Only one C. parapsilosis isolate was resistant to flucytosine.
		CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of candidemia in our hospital was low. C. parapsilosis
		was the most common species and was associated with neonatal and pediatric ICUs.
		Fluconazole and itraconazole resistance was only found among C. krusei and C.
		"glabrata isolates, which accounted for 15% of the total Candida spp. isolated"
		from blood cultures in our hospital.

PG	-	189-96
AB	-	Candidemia outbreaks that due to cross-infection are an emerging problem in
		hospitals. Typing of microorganisms is an essential tool for understanding the
		epidemiologic aspects of the infection. Techniques based on phenotypic
		characteristics are inexpensive and easy to perform but are limited by their lack
		of reproducibility. This study assessed the value of several phenotypic and
		genotypic techniques that are used in epidemiologic investigations of Candida
		parapsilosis in clinical practice and used a combination of these methods to
		analyze outbreak of C. parapsilosis candidemia. Random amplification of
		polymorphic DNA polymerase chain reaction with several primers was unsatisfactory
		because it lacked discriminatory power. By simplifying the reading of the
		"morphotypes, we increased their reproducibility for each malt agar and"
		"2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium media (97% and 90%) and thus their suitability for its"
		use. The combination of electrophoretic karyotype and the simplified morphotypes
		was rapid and practical to characterize the different clusters involved in the
		intensive care unit outbreak.

AB	-	Fungal colonization is a common occurrence in preterm neonates. Our objective was
		to describe the profile and characteristics of fungal colonization in preterm
		"infants admitted to the Martinique NICU. From March 2012 to January 2013, an"
		epidemiological prospective cohort study was conducted with 57 very
		"low-birth-weight infants. Cutaneous, rectal, gastric, respiratory, and urinary"
		"swabs were collected on admission, then every week for 4 weeks. The prevalence of"
		"fungal colonization was 68% (39/57): 46% by Malassezia species, 28% by"
		"Candida parapsilosis, 19% by C. albicans, 5% by C. glabrata, and 2% by"
		C. guilliermondii. The colonized patients had a duration of parenteral nutrition
		and antibiotic therapy longer than the others (P<0.05). Nosocomial colonization
		(after 2 days of life) occurred in 52% of cases: Malassezia species and
		C. parapsilosis were the commensal skin yeasts most frequently implicated.
		Forty-nine percent (28/57) had suspected invasive fungal infections that received
		probabilistic treatment. Only one case of invasive fungal infection with
		C. glabrata was diagnosed. This study highlights the important role played by
		nosocomial transmission in the colonization of preterm newborns. Mycological
		surveillance cultures in the NICU are very useful for monitoring fungal ecology
		and can improve the prevention of fungal colonization in preterm infants at risk
		of invasive fungal infection.

AB	-	The aim of this multicenter prospective study was to evaluate the incidence of
		invasive fungal infections (IFIs) in adult and pediatric patients with
		"hematologic malignancies, involving nine nosocomial facilities in Southern Italy"
		"over a period of 18 months. Furthermore, results of an environmental microbial"
		surveillance routinely carried out in some of the enrolled hospitals are
		reported. A total of 589 onco-hematological patients were enrolled and 27 IFIs
		"were documented. The main infections were caused by yeasts, more than filamentous"
		"fungi (overall incidence of 2.7% and 1.9%, respectively). The yeasts were mainly"
		"represented by Candida spp. (87.5%), all isolated by blood cultures; C."
		"parapsilosis was the most common species. Among mould infections, the most"
		"frequent site was the lung, with regard to aspergillosis (81.8%). In six of the"
		"10 patients with suspected aspergillosis, the diagnosis was made by the detection"
		"of galactomannan and (1,3)-β-d-glucan antigens. The microbiological surveillance"
		"carried out on 156 air, 312 water and 312 surface samples revealed low"
		environmental contamination: Alternaria alternata was the only fungus isolated
		"from two surface samples. Our data, especially the low occurrence of filamentous"
		"fungi, suggest a particular local epidemiology. Further studies are needed to"
		confirm this microbiological trend in onco-hematological patients in Southern
		"Italy, the results of which might be helpful to improve the management of these"
		patients.

PG	-	e28247
LID	-	10.1371/journal.pone.0028247 [doi]
LID	-	e28247
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Fungal peritonitis is a serious complication of peritoneal dialysis
		(PD) therapy with the majority of patients ceasing PD permanently. The aims of
		this study were to identify risk factors and clinical associations that may
		discriminate between fungal from bacterial peritonitis. METHODS: We
		retrospectively identified episodes of fungal peritonitis from 2001-2010 in PD
		patients at Liverpool and Westmead Hospitals (Australia). Fungal peritonitis
		cases were matched in a 1:2 ratio with patients with bacterial peritonitis from
		"each institution's dialysis registry, occurring closest in time to the fungal"
		"episode. Patient demographic, clinical and outcome data were obtained from the"
		medical records. RESULTS: Thirty-nine episodes of fungal peritonitis (rate of
		0.02 episodes per patient-year of dialysis) were matched with 78 episodes of
		bacterial peritonitis. Candida species were the commonest pathogens (35/39; 90%
		"episodes) with Candida albicans (37%), Candida parapsilosis (32%) and Candida"
		glabrata (13%) the most frequently isolated species. Compared to bacterial
		"peritonitis, fungal peritonitis patients had received PD for significantly longer"
		"(1133 vs. 775 catheter-days; p = 0.016), were more likely to have had previous"
		"episodes of bacterial peritonitis (51% vs. 10%; p = 0.01), and to have received"
		prior antibacterial therapy (51% vs. 10%; p = 0.01). Patients with fungal
		"peritonitis were less likely to have fever and abdominal pain on presentation,"
		"but had higher rates of PD catheter removal (79% vs. 22%; p<0.005), and permanent"
		transfer to haemodialysis (87% vs. 24%; p<0.005). Hospital length of stay was
		significantly longer in patients with fungal peritonitis (26.1 days vs. 12.6
		"days; p = 0.017), but the all-cause 30-day mortality rate was similar in both"
		groups. Fluconazole was a suitable empiric antifungal agent; with no Candida
		"resistance detected. CONCLUSION: Prompt recognition of clinical risk factors,"
		initiation of antifungal therapy and removal of PD catheters are key
		considerations in optimising outcomes.

TI	-	Candidaemia in an Irish tertiary referral hospital: epidemiology and prognostic
		factors.
PG	-	251-9
AB	-	There were two parts to this study. Part 1 evaluated the epidemiology of Candida
		bloodstream isolates within the Southern Health Board (SHB) of Ireland from 1992
		to 2003 by retrospective surveillance of all such isolates of patients reported
		from SHB hospitals to our laboratory database during that period. Part 2 reviewed
		candidaemia cases occurring in Cork University Hospital (CUH) from 1999 to 2003
		using surveillance of all positive blood culture isolates in CUH microbiology
		"laboratory during the 5-year period. In part 1, 250 Candida bloodstream isolates"
		were reported in the SHB over 12 years. There was a pattern of decreasing
		"percentage of C. albicans with time. Whereas in part 2, 63 cases of candidaemia"
		were identified in CUH from 1999 to 2003. Candida albicans constituted 50% of all
		"isolates, while C. parapsilosis and C. glabrata accounted for 21.2% and 18.2%"
		respectively. Average annual incidence rate was 0.48 episodes/1000 admissions and
		0.70 episodes/10 000 patient-days. Vascular catheters were the commonest source
		of candidaemia (61.9%) followed by the urinary tract (12.7%). Risk factors
		included exposure to multiple antibiotics (75%); central vascular catheterization
		(73%); multiple colonization sites (71%); severe gastrointestinal (GI)
		dysfunction (54%) and acute renal failure (43%). Crude 7-day and 30-day mortality
		rates were 20.6% and 39.7% respectively. Logistic regression multivariate
		analysis identified the following to be independent predictors for mortality: age
		"> or =65 years [odds ratio (OR) 7.2, P = 0.013]; severe GI dysfunction (OR 10.6,"
		"P = 0.01); acute renal failure (OR 7.6, P = 0.022); recent/concurrent bacteraemia"
		"(OR 5.2, P = 0.042); endotracheal intubation (OR 7.7, P = 0.014); while major"
		"surgery was associated with a better prognosis (OR 0.05, P = 0.002). Appropriate"
		antifungal treatment was also found to be associated with survival (Fisher's
		"exact test, P < 0.001). The epidemiology of Candida bloodstream isolates within"
		our health board had changed over the years. Incidence and mortality of
		candidaemia were relatively high in our hospital. Dysfunction of major organ
		systems and recent bacteraemia were found to predict mortality.

TI	-	Characterization of Candida species isolated from cases of lower respiratory
		tract infection.
PG	-	290-4
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: (1) To identify and characterize the Candida species isolates from
		lower respiratory tract infection. (2) to determine the rate of isolation of
		Candida species from sputum samples. METHODS: This study was carried out in the
		"Department of Microbiology, Manipal Teaching Hospital, Pokhara, Nepal from June"
		2002 to January 2003. A total of 462 sputum samples were collected from patients
		suspected lower respiratory tract infection. The samples were processed as Gram
		"staining to find out the suitability of the specimen, cultured on Sabouraud's"
		Dextrose Agar (SDA) and also on blood agar and chocolate agar to identify the
		"potential lower respiratory tract pathogens. For the identification of Candida,"
		"sputum samples were processed for Gram stain, culture, germ tube test, production"
		"of chlamydospore, sugar fermentation and assimilation test. For the"
		"identification of bacteria, Gram stain, culture, and biochemical tests were"
		"performed by standardized procedure. RESULT: Out of 462 samples, 246 (53.24%)"
		samples grew potential pathogens of lower respiratory tract. Among them
		Haemophilus influenzae 61(24.79%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae 57 (23.17%) were
		the predominant bacterial pathogens. Candida species were isolated from 30
		samples (12.2%). The majority of Candida species amongst the Candida isolates
		were Candida albicans 21(70%) followed by Candida tropicalis 4(13.33%). Candida
		"krusei 3(10%), Candida parapsilosis 1(3.33%) and Candida stellatoidea 1(3.33%)."
		The highest rate of isolation of Candida was between the age of 71 and 80.
		CONCLUSION: Candida isolation from sputum samples is important as found in the
		present study in which Candida species were the third most common pathogen
		isolated from patients with lower respiratory tract infection.

TI	-	Risk factors for nosocomial candidaemia: a case-control study in children.
PG	-	304-8
AB	-	Candida spp. are increasingly important nosocomial pathogens in critically ill
		children. Data on risk factors of acquisition in children with candidaemia are
		"limited. To determine the incidence, prognosis and risk factors for acquisition"
		"of nosocomial candidaemia in children, a prospective case-control study was"
		performed between July 1998 and January 2000. Candidaemia was defined as the
		presence of at least one positive blood culture containing Candida spp. For each
		"case, two controls were selected and matched for time and site of hospital"
		admission. Logistic regression was used to obtain estimates of risk after
		simultaneous control for other variables. Candidaemia was diagnosed in 24
		children (1.09/1000 admissions). The species most frequently isolated were
		Candida albicans (50%) and Candida parapsilosis (17%). Mean age was 58.2+/-58
		months between cases and 41.8+/-52.2 months in controls (P not significant). The
		strongest risk factors for acquisition found in the univariate analysis were
		"underlying disease, previous antibiotic treatment, the number of antibiotics"
		"administered, presence of a long-duration catheter and total parenteral nutrition"
		"(P<0.05). Sex, the site of hospital admission, artificial ventilatory assistance,"
		"transitory venous catheters, arterial and peripherally venous accesses, bladder"
		catheter and transfusions were not statistically significant. The risk factors
		identified by multiple logistic regression analysis were: permanent catheter (OR
		31.5; 3.19-310) and total parenteral nutrition (OR 10.5; 2.76-40.0). Nine (37%)
		children with nosocomial candidaemia and seven (15%) controls died (P=0.05).
		These findings should facilitate development of rational approaches to preventing
		infection and assist clinicians in identifying those patients in whom this
		life-threatening complication is likely to occur.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Aorto-enteric fistula is a rare and potentially lethal entity. Its
		"presentation may be as an enteric-paraprosthetic fistula, due to injury in the"
		gut caused by direct contact with the vascular prosthesis. OBJECTIVE: We report a
		case of enteric-paraprosthetic fistulae with the unusual finding of Candida
		"parapsilosis as the only isolated pathogen. CLINICAL CASE: A 65-year-old male,"
		"smoker, with aortobifemoral revascularisation with dacron due to aortoiliac"
		"occlusive disease, and re-intervention for thrombosis of left arm at 6 months."
		"Hospitalisation at 22 months was required due to a toxic syndrome, which was"
		diagnosed as enteric-paraprosthetic fistulae after complementary studies. The
		graft was removed and an extra-anatomic revascularisation was performed.
		Microbiology specimens taken from the duodenal segment in contact with the
		prosthesis showed the prosthetic segment and peri-prosthetic fluid were positive
		to C. parapsilosis. DISCUSSION: The finding of C. parapsilosis in all cultures
		"taken during surgery, along with negative blood cultures and no other known"
		"sources of infection, is of interest. It is an unusual pathogen with low"
		virulence and limited as regards other Candida species. Our patient had no
		"clinical data common to cases of infection with C. parapsilosis, and the"
		mechanism of graft infection is unknown. CONCLUSION: Graft infection by C.
		"parapsilosis may be anecdotal. However, its consequences can also be severe."
		Microbiological tests can be useful to adjust antimicrobial therapy in the
		"post-operative period, but their usefulness for determining the aetiology is"
		"doubtful, as it may be just an incidental finding."

TI	-	Candidemia in non-neutropenic critically ill patients: analysis of prognostic
		factors and assessment of systemic antifungal therapy. Study Group of Fungal
		Infection in the ICU.
PG	-	23-30
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence and prognosis of candidemia in
		"non-neutropenic critically ill patients, to define mortality-related factors, and"
		to evaluate the results of systemic antifungal therapy. DESIGN: A prospective
		multicenter survey in which medical and/or surgical intensive care units (ICUs)
		in 28 hospitals in Spain participated. PATIENTS: All critically ill patients with
		positive blood cultures for Candida species admitted to the participating ICUs
		over a 15-month period were included. INTERVENTIONS: Candidemia was defined as
		the presence of at least one positive blood culture containing Candida species.
		The follow-up period was defined as the time elapsed from the first positive
		blood culture for Candida species to discharge or death during hospitalization.
		"Antifungal therapy was considered to be ""early"" when it was administered within"
		"48 h of the date when the first positive blood culture was obtained and ""late"""
		when it was administered more than 48 h after the first positive blood culture.
		MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Candidemia was diagnosed in 46 patients (mean age
		"59 years), with an incidence of 1 critically ill patient per 500 ICU admissions."
		The species most frequently isolated were Candida albicans (60%) and C.
		"parapsilosis (17%). Fluconazole alone was given to 27 patients, amphotericin B"
		"alone to 10, and sequential therapy to 6. Three patients did not receive"
		antifungal therapy. The overall mortality was 56% and the attributable mortality
		"21.7%. In the univariate analysis, mortality was significantly associated with a"
		higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score at the
		onset of candidemia (p = 0.04) and with the time elapsed between the episode of
		candidemia and the start of antifungal therapy 48 h or more later (p < 0.02).
		Patients with an APACHE II score lower than 21 at the onset of candidemia had a
		higher probability of survival than patients who were more seriously ill (p =
		"0.04). Patients with ""early"" antifungal therapy (< or = 48 h between the onset of"
		candidemia and the start of antifungal therapy) had a higher probability of
		survival compared with patients with late therapy (p = 0.06). No significant
		differences were noted between the two groups on different antifungal therapy.
		CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of candidemia in ICU patients was very low. An APACHE
		II score > 20 at the time of candidemia was associated with a higher mortality.
		Further studies with a large number of patients are needed to assess the effect
		of early antifungal therapy on the decrease in mortality associated with
		candidemia and to determine the appropriate dosage of fluconazole and duration of
		treatment.

TI	-	Pichia anomala outbreak in a nursery: exogenous source?
PG	-	843-8
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Pichia anomala is a rare cause of fungemia. From February to April,"
		"1998, eight cases of fungemia occurred in the intensive care and high risk units"
		"of the Nursery. There were four infants with P. anomala infection, one of whom"
		"also had Candida parapsilosis infection, two cases with C. parapsilosis infection"
		and two with Candida albicans infection. OBJECTIVE: To determine factors
		associated with fungemia in the intensive care and high risk units of the
		"Nursery, especially P. anomala. METHODS: A cohort study with 59 newborns."
		RESULTS: Factors associated with fungemia were: central venous catheter (CVC) (P
		= 0.0006); total parenteral nutrition (TPN) (P = 0.0005); lipid emulsion (P =
		0.002); previous antimicrobial use (P = 0.002); and other invasive procedures (P
		= 0.002). Factors associated with P. anomala fungemia were: CVC (P = 0.004); TPN
		(P = 0.018); previous antibiotic use (P = 0.037); and other invasive procedures
		(P = 0.037). Evaluation of the units demonstrated that there were several
		technical problems involving administration of TPN that was manipulated in the
		Nursery without precautions. Changes in TPN formulation and education as to
		adequate technique were implemented. During follow-up (1998 to 1999) only two
		fungemias occurred that were caused by C. albicans. Cultures of hands of
		personnel were negative for P. anomala. Electrophoretic karyotyping of P. anomala
		showed three profiles. CONCLUSIONS: Factors associated with fungemia were
		"catheter use, invasive procedures and total parenteral nutrition, suggesting that"
		the acquisition of P. anomala was exogenous.

		neonates.
PG	-	603-7
AB	-	High-dose (5-7 mg/kg/day) liposomal amphotericin B was evaluated prospectively
		during the period 1995-2001 in 41 episodes of systemic candidiasis occurring in
		37 neonates (36 of the 37 were premature infants with very low birth weights).
		Median age at the onset of systemic candidiasis was 17 days. Candida spp. were
		"isolated from blood in all patients and from urine, skin abscesses and peritoneal"
		"fluid in 6, 5 and 1 neonates, respectively. Candidiasis was due to Candida"
		"parapsilosis in 17 cases, Candida albicans in 15 cases, Candida tropicalis in 5"
		"cases, Candida guilliermondii in 2 cases, Candida glabrata in 2 cases and an"
		"unidentified Candida sp. in 1 case. Twenty-eight, five and eight infants received"
		"7, 6-6.5 and 5 mg/kg/day, respectively. Median duration of therapy was 18 days;"
		median cumulative dose was 94 mg/kg. Fungal eradication was achieved in 39 of 41
		(95%) episodes; median duration of therapy until fungal eradication was 8.7+/-4.5
		days. Fungal eradication was achieved after 10.9+/-4.8 days in patients who had
		received previous antifungal therapy compared to 8.2+/-4.3 days in those treated
		with liposomal amphotericin B as first-line therapy. One patient died due to
		systemic candidiasis on day 12 of therapy. High-dose liposomal amphotericin B was
		effective and safe in the treatment of neonatal candidiasis. Fungal eradication
		was more rapid in patients treated early with high doses and in patients who
		received high-dose liposomal amphotericin B as first-line therapy.

PG	-	182-6
AB	-	"Thirty patients with otitis externa were included in a prospective, randomized,"
		parallel group comparison study. Treatment regimens used were ciprofloxacin (2
		mg/ml) as ear drops twice daily or drops containing oxytetracycline (5 mg/ml)
		"polymyxin B (10,000 units/ml) and hydrocortisone (15 mg/ml) twice daily for 7"
		days. Evaluation was by clinical signs and symptoms and bacteriological findings
		"from ear swabs prior to and 3 and 8 days after start of therapy, together with"
		long-term follow-up if necessary. Sixteen patients were included in the
		ciprofloxacin and 14 in the combined antibiotic group. Six of 16 and 7 of 14
		"initial swabs, respectively, contained Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Mixed"
		Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens were found in 3 patients in the
		ciprofloxacin group. All Gram-negative isolates were sensitive to ciprofloxacin.
		Microbiological evaluation showed rapid eradication of all bacterial pathogens in
		the ciprofloxacin group with 1 persistence of Candida albicans but eradication of
		Staphylococcus aureus in the same ear with marked clinical improvement. There was
		1 case of supercolonization in the ciprofloxacin group with Candida parapsilosis.
		"In the combined antibiotic group, there were 7 persistencies of which 5 were P."
		aeruginosa. No adverse effects were noted in either group. Treatment was assessed
		"as a complete success in 14/16 and 5/14 cases, partial success in 2/16 and 4/14"
		"cases and unsuccessful or indeterminate in 0/16 and 5/14 cases, respectively."
		Ciprofloxacin thus appears to be a useful and effective agent in the local
		therapy of otitis externa.

		unit].
PG	-	382-5
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To conduct a retrospective analysis of the invasive fungal infection
		(IFI) in surgical intensive care unit (SICU). METHODS: The IFI data of the
		patients who were admitted in SICU during January 2003 to December 2008 was
		retrospectively analyzed. A total of 3743 patients were admitted into SICU. Among
		"them, 271 patient's SICU duration was more than 48 hours, who had fungi"
		"examination. RESULTS: Seventy-five patients were diagnosed IFI, the morbidity was"
		"2.00% (75/3743), the incidence of fungemia was 0.27% (10/3743), the mortality of"
		IFI patients was 49.33% (37/75). The morbidity rate of each year was almost the
		same. The mortality of 2007 and 2008 was higher than before (both P < 0.05).
		"Thirty-four of all the 75 IFI patients got urinary tract infected, 37 got fungal"
		"pneumonia, 10 got fungemia, 1 got catheter-related fungal infection, 2 got fungal"
		"infection in abdomen, 2 got biliary tract infected. Eighty-six fungi strains"
		which caused fungal infection were spotted. Candida albicans was the most common
		"isolate (46.51%). Other isolates were Candida glabrata (22.09%), Candida"
		"tropicalis (13.95%), Candida parapsilosis (8.14%), Candida krusei (3.49%),"
		"Trichosporon (4.65%), Aspergillus (1.16%). Assist ventilation, combination of"
		"bacterial infection, treatment by broad spectrum antibiotics or more than three"
		kinds of antibiotics were the most important risk factors of IFI in SICU.
		Prophylactic antifungal treatment may be useful. CONCLUSION: The morbidity of IFI
		"in our SICU was comparatively low, and the same of the incidence of fungemia. The"
		mortality of IFI patients was markedly high. The main sites of infection were
		"lung and urinary tract, and the pathogenic fungi strains were mostly Candidas."
		"Assist ventilation, combination of bacterial infection, broad spectrum"
		antibiotics treatment were the most important risk factors of IFI in SICU.

PG	-	393-404
LID	-	10.1007/s15010-013-0570-4 [doi]
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Bloodstream infections (BSIs) due to Candida spp. constitute the
		predominant group of hospital-based fungal infections worldwide. A retrospective
		study evaluated the performance of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
		time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) for the identification of BSI
		"Candida isolates. The epidemiology, risk factors, demographic features, species"
		"distribution, and clinical outcome associated with candidemia in patients"
		"admitted to a single tertiary-care hospital in Qatar, were analyzed. METHODS: A"
		"single-center, retrospective analysis covering the period from January 1, 2004 to"
		"December 31, 2010 was performed. Molecular identification used sequence analysis"
		of the D1/D2 domains of the large subunit ribosomal DNA (LSU rDNA) and the ITS1/2
		regions of the rDNA. MALDI-TOF MS-based identification of all yeast isolates was
		performed with the ethanol/formic acid extraction protocol according to Bruker
		"Daltonics (Bremen, Germany). The susceptibility profiles of 201 isolates to"
		"amphotericin B, itraconazole, fluconazole, voriconazole, anidulafungin,"
		"caspofungin, posaconazole, and isavuconazole were tested using CLSI standard"
		broth microdilution method (M27-A3 and M27 S4) guidelines. Statistical analyses
		were performed with the statistical package SPSS 19.0. RESULTS: A total of 187
		patients with 201 episodes of candidemia were identified. Candida albicans was
		"the most common species isolated (33.8 %; n = 68), whereas non-albicans Candida"
		species represented 66.2 % (n = 133) of the episodes. The species distribution
		and outcome of candidemia showed a difference in the crude mortality between
		patients infected with C. albicans (n = 30; 45.5 %) and non-albicans Candida
		"species. For example, C. parapsilosis candidemia was associated with the lowest"
		"mortality rate (40.6 %), and patients with other non-albicans species had the"
		highest mortality rate (68-71.4 %). High mortality rates were observed among
		pediatric (<1 year of age) and elderly patients (>60 years of age). All strains
		showed low minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) (MIC90 of 0.063 μg/ml) to
		isavuconazole. The overall resistance to voriconazole in vitro antifungal
		activity was 2.5 %. C. glabrata (n = 38) had an MIC90 of 8 μg/ml for fluconazole.
		Most yeast isolates were susceptible to anidulafungin (>99.5 %) and 81.1 % to
		caspofungin. Resistance to anidulafungin was detected in 1/8 (12.5 %) isolates of
		C. orthopsilosis. According to new Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute
		"(CLSI) breakpoints, C. glabrata (n = 38) showed 100 % resistance, and 37/68 (54.4"
		%) C. albicans isolates were susceptible dose dependent (SDD) to caspofungin.
		Identification by MALDI-TOF MS was in 100 % concordance with molecular
		identification. CONCLUSION: The Middle East epidemiology of candidemia has a
		unique species distribution pattern distinct from other parts of the globe. High
		mortality rates were observed among pediatric (<1 year of age) and elderly
		patients (>60 years of age). All strains were susceptible to isavuconazole. All
		isolates of C.glabrata were resistant to caspofungin based on M27 S4. MALDI-TOF
		MS is a highly useful method for the routine identification of yeast isolates in
		clinical setting to achieve successful therapeutic treatment.

TI	-	[Nosocomial fungemias in a general hospital. Epidemiology and prognostic factors.
		Prospective study 1993-1998].
PG	-	304-7
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Nosocomial fungemias are infections with a high mortality rate. In
		last years the incidence of these infections has increased probably because of
		the growing population of immunocompromised patients who undergo aggressive
		diagnostic and therapeutic techniques. OBJECTIVE: To know the epidemiologic
		"characteristics, risk factors, clinical features and prognosis of fungemia."
		PATIENTS AND METHODS: We prospectively evaluated all the patients with proven
		fungemia in our center during a 5 year-period. After finishing antifungal
		treatment a minimum follow-up of 1 month was carried out. Fungal isolation and
		identification were performed by standard tests. RESULTS: During the period of
		study we evaluated 81 patients with an episode of nosocomial fungemia. Global
		"incidence was 0,9 episodes per thousand admitted patients. Candida albicans was"
		"the more frequently isolated species (n=53), followed by C. parapsilosis (n=11),"
		C. tropicalis (n=6) and C. glabrata (n=5). Most of the patients had a central
		intravenous line and were on parenteral nutrition therapy. All of them previously
		received at least one course of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Overall mortality was
		"49,6%. A worst prognosis was significantly associated with: age over 65 years,"
		"surgical procedures during present admission, leucocytosis, shock, and delay in"
		antifungal treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Fungal bloodstream infection incidence is high
		"in our environment. It is associated with a high mortality rate, specially in"
		patients in whom the beginning of antifungal treatment was delayed. A higher
		clinical suspicion index may improve the poor outcome in these patients.

TI	-	Pancreatic infection with Candida parapsilosis.
PG	-	415-6
AB	-	Candida species other than C. albicans have been implicated as pathogens in
		"intravascular (bloodstream, intravascular devices, endocarditis) and"
		"extravascular (arthritis, osteomielitis, endophtalmitis) infections. C."
		"parapsilosis, however, is rarely implicated in intra-abdominal infections"
		"(peritonitis during peritoneal dialysis, complicating surgery or solid-organ"
		transplantation). We describe a case of a 48-y-old male with acute pancreatitis
		who had a pancreatic abscess produced by primary C. parapsilosis infection.
		Although he received adequate treatment with antifungal medication and surgical
		"drainage, the outcome was fatal. Because the clinical findings are"
		"indistinguishable from bacterial abscesses, Candida species should be considered"
		"in cases of complicated pancreatitis, in order to establish a prompt adequate"
		treatment.

TI	-	"Candida fungemia in neonates treated with fluconazole: report of forty cases,"
		including eight with meningitis.
PG	-	1012-5
AB	-	PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: To assess efficacy and safety of fluconazole in neonates
		with Candida fungemia. STUDY DESIGN: Multicenter prospective protocol of all
		"fungemias appearing between January 1, 1993, and December 31, 1997, in four major"
		"university hospitals. RESULTS: Forty neonates, 28 of them with very low birth"
		"weight (<1500 g; 30.5 median gestation week), with documented Candida albicans"
		fungemia were treated with intravenous fluconazole in a daily dosage of 6 mg/kg
		once daily for 6 to 48 days. Thirty-four received fluconazole as monotherapy and
		6 received it in combination with amphotericin B. Thirty-two (80%) were cured; 4
		"of them relapsed despite at least 14 days of therapy, but they were ultimately"
		"cured without sequelae. Eight other neonates died, 4 because of fungal infection"
		"and 4 because of prematurity or hemorrhage or lung failure, with fungemia (20%"
		overall and 10% attributable mortality). Two neonates had elevated liver enzymes
		during fluconazole therapy and 2 others had elevated serum creatinine during
		fluconazole monotherapy. In none of them did these abnormalities necessitate
		discontinuation of antifungal therapy. In 8 neonates fungal meningitis developed
		as a complication of fungemia. All but 3 fungemias were C. albicans; 3 were
		Candida parapsilosis. CONCLUSIONS: Fluconazole was safe and effective antifungal
		therapy even in complicated or Candida fungemia in neonates and in infants with
		very low birth weight.

TI	-	An outbreak of Candida parapsilosis prosthetic valve endocarditis.
PG	-	147-53
AB	-	"Candida parapsilosis, an important nosocomial pathogen and the most common"
		"species of Candida found on the hands of health care workers, is a rare cause of"
		"prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE). From March through June 1994, four cases of"
		C. parapsilosis PVE were diagnosed at a 400-bed community hospital. The mean time
		"to presentation after valve replacement surgery was 148 days (range, 20 to 345)."
		Three of the four patients died of complications of PVE. Multiple environmental
		"cultures were performed, and only one was positive for C. parapsilosis. Cultures"
		"from the bypass pump, cell saver, cardioplegia solution, and subsequent valves"
		were all negative. All valve replacements were performed by the same operating
		"room team. Interviews with the surgeon and physician assistant, the only"
		"personnel involved in all cases, revealed that their hypoallergenic gloves were"
		"subject to frequent tears during valve replacement procedures, often requiring"
		"several glove changes per procedure. Hand cultures of personnel were obtained,"
		and cultures from 20 individuals (26%) were positive for C. parapsilosis. Hand
		cultures of the surgeon and physician assistant obtained 8 months after the last
		case had surgery were negative for yeasts. Molecular typing of the 3 available
		"case isolates, 14 epidemiologically unrelated patient isolates, 1 environmental"
		"isolate, and 20 hand isolates was performed by electrophoretic karyotyping and"
		restriction endonuclease analysis of genomic DNA using restriction enzymes BssHII
		and EagI followed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. The three case isolates
		"were identical by restriction endonuclease analysis of genomic DNA, and two of"
		the three shared the same electrophoretic karyotyping profile. The remaining
		"patient, environmental, and hand isolates represented 29 different DNA types and"
		were distinctly different from the case isolates. All of the isolates tested were
		"susceptible to amphotericin B, 5FC, fluconazole, and itraconazole. The"
		circumstantial evidence suggests the probability of glove tears during valve
		replacement surgery and subsequent transmission of C. parapsilosis to patients.

TI	-	Multiple rare opportunistic and pathogenic fungi in persistent foot skin
		infection.
PG	-	208-18
AB	-	Persistent superficial skin infection caused by multiple fungi is rarely
		"reported. Recently, a number of fungi, both opportunistic and persistent in"
		nature were isolated from the foot skin of a 24-year old male in Malaysia. The
		"fungi were identified as Candida parapsilosis, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, Phoma"
		"spp., Debaryomyces hansenii, Acremonium spp., Aureobasidium pullulans and"
		"Aspergillus spp., This is the first report on these opportunistic strains were"
		co-isolated from a healthy individual who suffered from persistent foot skin
		infection which was diagnosed as athlete's foot for more than 12 years. Among the
		"isolated fungi, C. parapsilosis has been an increasingly common cause of skin"
		infections. R. mucilaginosa and D. hansenii were rarely reported in cases of skin
		"infection. A. pullulans, an emerging fungal pathogen was also being isolated in"
		"this case. Interestingly, it was noted that C. parapsilosis, R. mucilaginosa, D."
		hansenii and A. pullulans are among the common halophiles and this suggests the
		association of halotolerant fungi in causing persistent superficial skin
		infection. This discovery will shed light on future research to explore on
		effective treatment for inhibition of pathogenic halophiles as well as to
		understand the interaction of multiple fungi in the progress of skin infection.

		and neck cancer].
PG	-	605-8
AB	-	PURPOSE: To investigate the distribution of oral candida species in head and neck
		"cancer (HNC) patients treated with radiation therapy, and provide the basis for"
		planning of clinical preventive measures. METHODS: Saliva was sampled from 60 HNC
		"patients before, during and after radiation. Concomitantly, 60 healthy"
		individuals whose age and sex matched that of the patient group were selected as
		control group. Oral candida carriages were quantitatively detected and the
		different candida species were identified by multiple measures such as CHROMagar
		candida culture medium and API 20C AUX yeast identification system. Then the
		differences between the two groups in terms of the candida detection rate and the
		distribution of each species of candida were analyzed with SPSS 17.0 software
		package. RESULTS: Xerostomia and dysphagia was found in 54 HNC patients during
		"radiotherapy, radiation-induced oral mucotitis(RIOM) was found in 50 HNC"
		"patients,and oral candidiasis was found in 18 HNC patients; In radiation group,"
		"the detection rate of candida colonization during radiation was 56.7%, 63.3%"
		"postradiation, which showed significant differences compared with pre-radiation"
		"(X² =18.320,P<0.001 ); Among the 54 identified clinical isolates, candida"
		"albicans (n=42) was the most frequent, followed by candida parapsilosis (n=6),"
		"candida tropicalis (n=4) and candida glabrata (n=2). In radiation group, the oral"
		"candida pathogens detection rate was 30%, and candida colonization was 46.7%."
		CONCLUSIONS: The oral candida colonization rate was significantly higher in HNC
		"patients after radiotherapy, which indicated that the candida infection may be"
		closely related to RIOM.

TI	-	Secular trends in nosocomial candidaemia in non-neutropenic patients in an
		Italian tertiary hospital.
PG	-	908-13
AB	-	A retrospective study was performed in an Italian tertiary hospital to evaluate
		"trends in candidaemia between 1992 and 2001, and to compare the characteristics"
		"of episodes of fungaemia between 1992--1997 and 1998--2001. In total, 370"
		"episodes of candidaemia were identified, with an average incidence of 0.99"
		episodes/10 000 patient-days/year (range 0.49--1.29 episodes). On an annual trend
		"basis, the overall incidence was essentially stable in surgical and medical"
		"wards, but decreased in intensive care units (ICUs) (p 0.0065). The average use"
		"of fluconazole was 37.9 g/10 000 patient-days/year (range 21.4--56.1 g), and did"
		not change significantly during the 10-year period. Nearly two-thirds of patients
		"were in ICUs at the onset of candidaemia, but none was neutropenic in either"
		study period. Candida albicans remained the predominant species isolated (53.8%
		"vs. 48.1%), followed by Candida parapsilosis, Candida glabrata and Candida"
		"tropicalis, the distribution of which did not change significantly. The 30-day"
		crude mortality rate was essentially similar (44% vs. 35%) in both study periods.
		"Thus the incidence of nosocomial candidaemia, although high in this institution,"

AB	-	The aim of our study was to perform molecular typing on 25 clinical samples of
		Candida spp that were isolated from children with candidemia who were
		hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit of a university hospital between
		1998 and 2006. Demographic and clinical data were obtained from the medical
		records to ascertain the clinical and epidemiological characteristics. Yeast
		identification was done using conventional methods and susceptibility to
		antifungals was assessed using a microdilution method. The genetic profile was
		determined using the RAPD-PCR technique. Candida albicans (11; 44%) and Candida
		parapsilosis (10; 40%) were the species most frequently isolated. Seventeen (68%)
		"of the newborns weighed less than 1,500 g. Prematurity (92%) and use of a central"
		venous catheter (100%) were the risk conditions with greatest association.
		Nineteen patients (76%) died. Only one strain of Candida parapsilosis showed
		dose-dependent sensitivity to fluconazole. Molecular analysis showed 11 distinct
		"genetic patterns. An epidemiological relationship was seen in only two cases,"
		thus suggesting the same source of infection.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: The epidemiology of candidemia vary by region. AIM: To determine the
		epidemiology of candidemia in a hospital for 16 years. MATERIAL AND METHODS:
		Episodes of candidemia occurred in the Hospital de Clinicas of Buenos Aires were
		"reviewed, from 01/01/98 to 31/12/13. RESULTS: 374 episodes of candidemia were"
		"identified. The incidence was 2.21/1,000 discharges and increased from 1.96"
		(1998-2005) to 2.25 (2006-2013) (p = 0.023). Candidemia was diagnosed: 5.4% in
		"neonates, 1.7% in infants, 6.5% in children, 31.8% in adults and 52.7% in elderly"
		"adults over 64 years old. The episodes were caused by C. albicans (40.9%), C."
		"parapsilosis (21.7%), C. tropicalis (15.5%), C. glabrata (13.9%), other species"
		of Candida (5.1%) and more than one species of Candida (2.9%). The 5.3% of the
		isolates were resistant to fluconazole. 74% of patients were treated. Initial
		"treatments were with fluconazole (70.3%), amphotericin B deoxycholate (25%),"
		"echinocandins or lipidic amphotericin (4,7%). The 81% of central venous catheters"
		"were taken off. Mortality rate was of 47.9%, but in the elderly adults was of"
		60.8%. CONCLUSION: The incidence of candidemia showed an increase over the years.
		"It was higher in the elderly adults, being the group with worse outcomes."

TI	-	Invasive fungal infections in neonatal intensive care units of Southern Italy: a
		multicentre regional active surveillance (AURORA project).
PG	-	125-30
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: During the past years invasive fungal infections (IFIs) have become
		an increasingly important problem in infants hospitalized in the Neonatal
		Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Candida species is the third most-common agent of
		"late-onset infections in critically ill neonates, with an estimated incidence of"
		2.6-10% in very low birth weight and 5.5-20% in extremely low birth weight
		infants. The aim of this observational study is to evaluate the epidemiology of
		IFIs among infants admitted to NICUs of one Italian region by a multicenter
		surveillance (Aurora Project). METHODS: The IFIs surveillance was carried out
		prospectively in Apulia (Southern Italy) between February 2007 and August 2008.
		This report focuses on the results from 6 enrolled NICUs. RESULTS: Twenty-one
		neonates developed IFIs: the overall incidence was 1.3% and crude mortality was
		23.8%. Infants weighing < or = 1500 g (4.3%) showed a significantly higher
		incidence than those > or = 2500 g (0.2%). C. parapsilosis (61.9%) was the most
		frequent isolated species. The main potential risk factors were having a central
		"venous catheter placed, length of stay in NICU > 7 days and total parenteral"
		"nutrition for > 5 days. The (1,3)-beta-D glucan (BDG), mannan antigens and"
		anti-Candida antibodies' evaluation was performed in 7 neonates. All neonates
		"were positive to the BDG; the mannan antigen result was positive in 5 newborns,"
		the anti-mannan antibodies were always negative. All isolates were amphotericin B
		and fluconazole-susceptible. DISCUSSION: This first prospective study on neonatal
		fungal infection in one Italian region gives evidence of a preponderance of
		non-albicans Candida spp and indicates potential utility of BDG as an adjunct
		diagnostic test.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Hemodialysis has been described as an important risk factor for the
		development of candidemia in patients suffering from chronic renal failure. AIMS:
		The aim of this study was to evaluate the epidemiology of candidemia in
		outpatients with renal replacement therapy (RRT) by hemodialysis where the
		fungemia clearly represents a healthcare-associated infection. METHODS: We
		retrospectively collected clinical and laboratory data from patients undergoing
		at least 3 months of RRT by hemodialysis who developed candidemia within 48h of
		hospital admission. RESULTS: We identified 14 patients with candidemia with
		central venous catheters (CVC) in place for 11-277 days before developing
		fungemia. Deep-seated infection was documented in 6 out of 14 candidiasis cases
		"(43%), including 5 cases of endocarditis (36%). CONCLUSIONS: CVC in patients"

PG	-	212-6
AB	-	We describe a case of Candida parapsilosis endophthalmitis with a consecutive
		keratitis after phacoemulsification and posterior chamber intraocular lens
		implantation in an otherwise healthy eye. Despite aggressive medical and surgical
		"management during a 2-year period, multiple episodes recurred, with the"
		development of an intracapsular plaque and an infectious nidus on the corneal
		endothelium 6 months after the initial presentation. After subtotal removal of
		"the culture-positive capsule, intravitreal and topical amphotericin B, and oral"
		"fluconazole, the inflammation improved. However, the corneal endothelial plaque"
		"persisted with recurrent inflammation 2 months later, prompting debridement of"
		the culture-positive plaque and further removal of the culture-negative capsular
		remnants and lens implant. The infection was quiescent for the subsequent
		12-month period until recurrent intraocular inflammation developed with
		enlargement of the endothelial plaque. Culture of this plaque was again positive
		for C. parapsilosis. After debridement and intraocular and topical amphotericin
		"B, the eye has now been quiescent for 13 months. This case demonstrates the"
		development of a secondary keratitis in an eye affected by pseudophakic C.
		"parapsilosis endophthalmitis, with the posterior cornea serving as a sanctuary"
		site for the fungus despite aggressive management leading to recurrent infection
		1 year after the clinical disease appeared to be quiescent.

TI	-	A randomized trial of amorolfine 5% solution nail lacquer in association with
		itraconazole pulse therapy compared with itraconazole alone in the treatment of
		Candida fingernail onychomycosis.
PG	-	151-6
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Treatment failures and relapses are not uncommon in onychomycosis.
		"Therefore, it is worthwhile to consider the combination of systemic and topical"
		antifungals to improve the cure rates further and to reduce the duration of
		systemic treatment. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate and compare itraconazole pulse
		therapy combined with amorolfine with itraconazole alone in the treatment of
		Candida fingernail onychomycosis. METHODS: Ninety patients with moderate to
		severe Candida fingernail onychomycosis were randomized into two treatment groups
		of 45 subjects each. Group 1 received itraconazole pulse therapy for 2 months and
		"applied amorolfine 5% solution nail lacquer for 6 months, while group 2 received"
		monotherapy with three pulses of itraconazole. The primary efficacy criterion was
		the result of mycological examination at 3 months. The secondary criterion was
		the combined mycological and clinical response at 9 months. A pharmacoeconomic
		analysis was also performed to compare the cost-effectiveness of combined therapy
		vs. monotherapy. RESULTS: Eighty-five patients were analysed (73 women and 12
		"men, mean +/- SD age 44.2 +/- 12.9 years). Patients had a mean +/- SD of 3.64 +/-"
		2.0 nails involved and 228.6 +/- 148.0 mm2 of their nail surface diseased. The
		mean duration of onychomycosis was 11 months. Paronychial involvement was evident
		"in 71 patients. C. albicans was isolated in 85 cases, C. parapsilosis in three"
		and other Candida species in two cases. Side-effects were uncommon and in only
		"one case led to withdrawal. At the 3-month visit, mycological cure was seen in 32"
		(74%) of 43 patients in group 1 and in 25 (60%) of 42 patients in group 2. At the
		"9-month visit, a global cure was seen in 40 patients (93%) in group 1 and in 34"
		patients (81%) in group 2. Statistical analysis showed no statistically
		significant difference (P > 0.1) between the two treatment groups. The cost per
		"cure ratio was 1.63 and 1.70euro for groups 1 and 2, respectively. CONCLUSIONS:"
		"The combination of amorolfine and oral itraconazole, which interfere with"
		"different steps of ergosterol synthesis, exhibited substantial synergy. Compared"
		"with oral itraconazole alone, the combination achieved greater mycological cure"
		"and increased total cure rate. However, no statistically significant difference"
		was documented for this number of observations. Combination treatment with
		amorolfine and two pulses of itraconazole is at least as safe and effective as
		"three pulses of itraconazole, with a lower cost per patient. In our opinion, the"
		addition of amorolfine to oral itraconazole pulse therapy is of value in the
		treatment of moderate to severe Candida fingernail onychomycosis.

		testing was performed using a commercial agar diffusion test. RESULTS: Of the
		"1,070 cases of VVC reported in this study, 36.5% were uncomplicated VVC, and"
		63.5% were complicated VVC. Twenty-four patients were identified as having two
		species of Candida. Candid albicans alone was isolated from 89.5% of cases (n =
		"958). Candida glabrata was isolated from 85 cases (7.9%), Candida tropicalis from"
		"10 (0.9%), Saccharomyces cerevisiae from eight (0.7%), Candida parapsilosis from"
		"six (0.6%), Candida famata from two (0.2%), and Candida krusei from one case"
		(0.1%). All isolates of Candida albicans were susceptible to nystatin. The
		resistant rate of Candida albicans to azole agents was 0-4.9%. CONCLUSION:
		Candida albicans was the predominant Candida species isolated from this series of
		patients with VVC. Resistance of vaginal Candida albicans isolates to antifungal
		agents was infrequent.

AB	-	"A 10-year prospective survey of fungaemia in the Slovak Republic, involving 31"
		"microbiology laboratories and 71 hospitals, was conducted from 1989-1998 (10"
		"years): 310 fungaemias were analyzed for etiology, clinical characteristics,"

		review of the literature.
PG	-	100-3
AB	-	"Prosthetic arthritis due to Candida species is uncommon, with only 15 cases"
		reported in the literature. We recently cared for a human immunodeficiency
		virus-infected patient who developed Candida parapsilosis prosthetic arthritis
		"unresponsive to resection arthroplasty, intravenous amphotericin B, and"
		suppressive ketoconazole therapy. Treatment with fluconazole led to mycologic
		"cure and symptom improvement, although he subsequently underwent above-the-knee"
		amputation due to continued joint instability. Fluconazole may be useful
		follow-up therapy after a course of amphotericin B combined with resection
		arthroplasty or when removal of the prosthesis cannot be accomplished.

PG	-	23-30
AB	-	"This study, included in the prospective survey of candidaemia in Europe supported"
		"by the European Confederation of Medical Mycology, presents the epidemiological"
		and antifungal susceptibility results of 290 cases of candidaemia (80 in children
		<15 years old) reported from September 1997 to August 1999 by 19 Spanish
		hospitals. Presence of an intravenous catheter and previous antibiotic therapy
		were the most frequent risk factors. The percentages of the four most common
		"species isolated (adults/children) were as follows: Candida albicans (46/36.2),"
		"C. parapsilosis (21.9/50), C. tropicalis (12.8/3.75), and C. glabrata (10.1/5)."
		"As initial therapy, fluconazole was preferred in adults (54%) and liposomal"
		"amphotericin B in children (58%). The 30-day mortality rate was 40.6%, and the"
		species most frequently associated with a fatal outcome was C. krusei (60%). The
		"rates of susceptibility to antifungal agents were as follows: amphotericin B,"
		"91%; flucytosine, 99%; fluconazole, 93.6%; itraconazole, 87.4%; and voriconazole,"
		92%. These results provide baseline data for future epidemiological and
		susceptibility studies and for evaluating the impact of new antifungal agents on
		the distribution of species and the mortality rates associated with candidaemia
		in Spain.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Knowledge of fungal colonization patterns in very low birth weight
		infants (VLBWI) admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is essential
		in understanding the process of fungal infections in neonates. We analyzed
		"prospectively, during 2009-2010, the patterns and dynamics of fungal colonization"
		"in VLBWI, including timing, colonization sites, and species involved. METHODS:"
		"Weekly skin, oropharynx, and rectum/stool surveillance fungal cultures were"
		collected from admission until discharge in VLBWI in the NICU. None received
		"antifungal prophylaxis. RESULTS: Overall, 118 VLBWI provided 1723 samples; 34"
		(29%) had 104 positive samples at least once during the first 10 hospitalization
		weeks. Thirty-nine (33%) weighed < 1000 g; 68 were delivered by cesarean section.
		"Candida albicans (57/104, 55%) and Candida parapsilosis (26/104, 25%) were the"
		main fungi isolated. Eight (24%) VLBWI were colonized during the first week and
		23 (68%) during the second week. No differences in colonization were recorded
		between cesarean section and vaginally delivered VLBWI. The colonization risk at
		"least once during the first 10 weeks was 23% for skin, 14% for oropharynx, 27%"
		"for rectum/stool, and 38% for any anatomic site sampled. Persistent colonization"
		"was recorded in 5/34 (15%), while transient colonization was found in 14/34 (41%)"
		VLBWI; 16/34 (47%) were discharged or died colonized with Candida spp. Candidemia
		was diagnosed in 4 (3%) VLBWI and previous/simultaneous colonization was found in
		"3/4. CONCLUSIONS: The cumulative risk of colonization, at any sampled site and at"
		"least once during follow-up, was high. Initial colonization occurred most often"
		during the first 2 weeks of life. Colonization dynamics were characterized by
		"various persistence, disappearance, and recolonization patterns. Candidemia was"
		rare.

TI	-	[Epidemiology of candidemia: results of a one month French hospitals-based
		surveillance study in 2004].
PG	-	523-30
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: The aim of our study was to determinate the frequency of
		"candidemia, the species encountered and their susceptibility to antifungal agents"
		"in French hospitals in 2004. METHODS: A prospective survey of septicaemia,"
		including candidaemia was conducted among 193 non teaching French hospitals
		during October 2004. All bloodstream infections were reported and the bloodstream
		isolates sent to two coordinating centers. Species identification and
		"susceptibility were performed by biologists as usual, and further confirmed by"
		"use of alternative methods, including Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC)"
		"determination. RESULTS: The survey was effective in 93 hospitals, where 2013"
		"bloodstream infections were noticed, including 46 candidaemia (2.3%). Candida sp."
		"Is the 7th pathogen responsible for bloodstream infection, without concern of the"
		origin of the infection. Candidaemia was hospital acquired in 80.4% of cases
		(N=37/46). Candidaemia represents 0.7% (N=9/1211) of community-acquired
		"bloodstream infections but 4.5% (N=37/802) of nosocomial cases, placing Candida"
		sp. at the 5th row of frequency in this last group. No mistakes were noticed
		"during identification, but two strains were not named. After confirmation of"
		"identification, species are distributed as follows: 23 C.albicans (50%), 13"
		"C.glabrata (28.3%), 5 C.tropicalis (10.9%), 3 C.parapsilosis (6.5%), 1 C.krusei"
		"(2.2%), and 1 C.kefyr (2.2%). The overall susceptibility is 97.7% for"
		"amphotericin B, 93.2% for 5-fluorocytosin, 88.6% for fluconazole, 70.5% for"
		"itraconazole, 95.5% for voriconzole and 100% of strains had very low MIC for"
		"caspofungin. Concerning the two main species isolated, 95.5% of C.albicans"
		"strains remain susceptible to fluconazole, but only 69% of C.glabrata strains."
		"Two strains, 1 C.albicans and 1 C.glabrata exhibit cross resistance to azoles."
		"The majority of amphotericin, fluconazole, and itraconazole decreased"
		"susceptibility strains are found into C.glabrata strains, but susceptibility to"
		5-fluorocytosin and very low MCI to caspofungin remained in this species.
		CONCLUSION: Our survey allowed us to get data from French non-teaching hospitals
		in 2004 about frequency of candidaemia among septicaemia. Candida species
		distribution and in vitro susceptibility patterns of the strains isolated.
		"Candidaemia is not a rare event, specially when septicaemia is nosocomially"
		acquired. C.albicans is the main species isolated and remains highly in vitro
		susceptible to antifungals. One important feature is the frequency of C.glabrata
		"in our survey. Considering its decreased susceptibility to azoles, this finding"
		confirms the need for rapid identification of yeast isolated from bloodstream
		"samples, and antifungal susceptibility testing each time it is available."

PG	-	425-33
AB	-	"The incidence of fungal infections has been increasing for the last 3 decades,"
		"especially among neutropenic, cancer, and critically ill patients. These"
		infections are associated with high mortality rates. We retrospectively reviewed
		medical charts of adult patients with fungemia from 1989 to 2000 at our
		institution. The characteristics of the population groups served by the hospital
		"were described. Of 328 patients with fungemia, we reviewed 315 (96%) medical"
		"records, and focused on those with candidemia (n = 294). The species distribution"
		in patients with candidemia showed that the most commonly identified species were
		"Candida albicans (66%), followed by C. glabrata (17%), and C. parapsilosis (6%)."
		"The incidence of candidemia ranged from 0.2 to 0.46 per 10,000 patient-days with"
		the highest incidence in 1993 and the lowest in 1997. Although most studies show
		"an increased incidence of candidemia, we observed a reduction over the study"
		"period. Furthermore, we observed no shift from C. albicans to non-albicans"
		Candida species despite a significant increase in the use of fluconazole. The
		"overall mortality among patients with candidemia was 44%, with the highest rate"
		in patients over 65 years (52%). Factors independently associated with higher
		"mortality were patient age greater than 65 years, intensive care unit admission,"
		and underlying cancer.

		Patients: Three Cases from a Single Center in Northern Israel.
PG	-	615-617
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Patients with severe coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) are
		susceptible to superimposed infections. OBJECTIVES: To describe COVID-19 patients
		who presented with complications due to Candida bloodstream co-infection
		(candidemia) and their outcome in a single center in northern Israel (Emek
		Medical Center) during the second outbreak of COVID-19 in Israel (15 June 2020 to
		20 September 2020). METHODS: A retrospective study of COVID-19 patients
		"presenting with candidemia was conducted, including clinical and laboratory data."
		The incidence of candidemia among hospitalized COVID-19 patients was compared to
		a historical cohort of non-COVID-19 controls. RESULTS: Three COVID-19 patients
		complicated with candidemia were documented. All three patients died shortly
		after the detection of candidemia. Three different Candida sp. were isolated from
		"the blood cultures: C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, and C. glabrata. The incidence"
		of candidemia among COVID-19 patients was 0.679 episodes per 1000 hospital days.
		CONCLUSIONS: Our small sample suggests a much higher incidence of candidemia
		among COVID-19 patients compared to a historical cohort of non-COVID-19 controls.
		All clinicians treating COVID-19 patients in GICU should be aware of this
		complication.

		hemodialysis patient.
PG	-	E66-E68
LID	-	10.1111/hdi.12566 [doi]
AB	-	Fungal endocarditis (FE) is commonly regarded as a rare but fatal disease. The
		incidence of infective endocarditis (IE) in hemodialysis (HD) patients is thought
		"to be obviously higher than that in the general population. Moreover, IE occurs"
		more likely in HD patients with catheters. With the increase of HD population and
		"extensive use of catheters in HD patients, FE, as a special form of IE, may"
		increase and bring new challenges to clinicians. We reported a case of FE
		associated with catheter infection in a 44-year-old woman on HD. The risk factors
		and treatment strategies of FE in HD patients were discussed.

TI	-	A comparative study of risk factors and outcome among outpatient-acquired and
		nosocomial candidaemia.
PG	-	129-34
AB	-	Candidaemia is perceived as a nosocomial infection. The aim of this study was to
		"describe all cases of candidaemia that occurred in the outpatient setting, and to"
		compare risk factors and outcome among patients with outpatient-acquired and
		"nosocomial candidaemia. During 1995 and 2003, 210 patients developed candidaemia"
		"at our institution, and 9.0% were outpatient acquired. Major underlying diseases"
		were cancer (47.4%) and chronic renal failure (36.8%). Most occurred within 24 h
		"of hospitalization (63.2%), and 83.7% were caused by species other than Candida"
		"albicans, mainly Candida parapsilosis (36.8%). Candida spp. were isolated from"
		"catheters in 21% of cases, and 52.6% of patients had been admitted to hospital in"
		the 60 days preceding candidaemia. Compared with patients with nosocomial
		"candidaemia, chronic renal failure was more frequent in the outpatient group, who"
		"were also more commonly exposed to haemodialysis. Ileus, gastrointestinal"
		"bleeding, previous bacteraemia, use of proton pump inhibitors, previous stay in"
		"the intensive care unit and requirement for antibiotics, blood transfusion,"
		vasopressors and invasive medical procedures were more frequent in the nosocomial
		group. Overall mortality was high in both groups. Candidaemia must be considered
		"as a potential cause of sepsis in the community, and it is associated with a high"
		mortality rate.

		university hospital in 2004].
PG	-	531-6
AB	-	This study aimed to retrospectively evaluate the adequate use of antifungal drugs
		"in the treatment of the candidaemia. A collection of clinical, biological and"
		therapeutic data was carried out for the patients who had a positive blood
		culture for Candida species during the year 2004. The antifungal therapy was
		"compared to the guidelines of the French Conference of consensus named ""Prise en"
		"charge des candidoses et aspergilloses invasives de l'adulte"". The degree of"
		"conformity was classified as follows: complying, partly complying (molecule in"
		conformity but delay of treatment or unsuited dosing) and not complying with the
		"guidelines. The analysis was performed, according to the guidelines, before and"
		after knowledge of Candida species growing from the blood culture. On 29
		"candidaemia, the found species were: Candida albicans 55%, Candida glabrata 14%,"
		"Candida krusei 10%, Candida parapsilosis and Candida lusitaniae 7%, Candida"
		pelliculosa and Candida tropicalis 3.5%. Only 19 candidaemia were included in
		this study because blood cultures were known positive for Candida on the day of
		death (N=7) or medical charts were not available (N=3). For treatment before
		"identification of Candida species, 37% were complying, 37% in partly complying"
		and 26% not complying with the guidelines. For the treatment after identification
		"of the species, 26% were complying, 63% partly complying and 11% not complying"
		"with the guidelines. As a whole, antifungal therapy was totally or partly"
		complying in 74 to 89% of candidaemia in adult patients. Lower dosages of
		fluconazole explained most of the treatments that partly complied with
		guidelines.

TI	-	Frequency of Candida albicans in Patients with Funguria.
PG	-	113-6
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of Candida albicansin patients with
		funguria. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive cross-sectional study. PLACE AND DURATION OF
		"STUDY: Department of Microbiology, Sindh Institute of Urology and"
		"Transplantation, from July to December 2012. METHODOLOGY: Patients’ urine samples"
		with fungus/Candida were included. Candida albicans was identified by the
		production of tubular structures (germ tubes) on microscopy as per standard
		procedure followed by inoculation on Chrom agar (Oxoid) and Corn Meal-Tween 80
		agar (Oxoid). The identification of other non-albicans Candidaspecies was also
		done both microscopically and macroscopically as per standard procedure. RESULTS:
		"Out of the 289 isolates, 204 (70.6%) were male patients and 85 (29.4%) were"
		"female patients, with 165 (57.1%) from the out-patients and 124 (42.9%) from the"
		in-patients. Five species of Candidawere found to be prevalent including 87
		"(30.1%) Candida albicans, 176 (60.9%) Candida tropicalis, 14 (4.8%) Candida"
		"parapsilosis, 8 (2.8%) Candida glabrata and 4 (1.4%) Candida lusitaniae. Majority"
		of patients with funguria were aged above 50 years (60.2%). CONCLUSION: In the
		"present study, 30.1% patients with funguria had Candida albicans. The most"
		"frequently isolated species was Candida tropicalis(60.9%), followed by other"
		non-albicansCandida. This study has shown the emergence of non-albicans Candidaas
		a major cause of candiduria.

		Candida species].
PG	-	593-603
AB	-	"Among nosocomial infections in the newborns, the incidence of fungal infections"
		has been rising over the last decades. Fluconazole has been a new option for
		"treatment however, expanded use of the drug brought up the development of"
		"resistance. In this study, species of the Candida isolates from neonates with"
		"candida infections, their antifungal susceptibilities and the effectiveness of"
		"the therapy were evaluated. All the species of Candida isolates from blood, urine"
		and sterile body fluids of 54 neonates and their antifungal susceptibilities were
		"evaluated retrospectively over the 13-year period. Demographic characteristics,"
		"risk factors, infection foci, Candida species causing infection and their in"
		vitro susceptibilities for fluconazole (FCZ) and amphotericin B (AMB) and
		treatment responses were analyzed. The antifungal susceptibility testing of
		isolates was performed by microdilution technique. The median birth weight and
		"gestational age of the study groups were 1735 (660-3990) g and 33 (24-40) weeks,"
		"respectively. Among the patients, 19 (35%) were term, while 35 (65%) were preterm"
		"[< 32 weeks n = 20 (37%), < 28 weeks n = 7 (13%)]. The percentage of low birth"
		"weight infants was 65% (42% was < 1500 g, 13% was < 1000 g). Candida spp. were"
		"isolated mostly from blood samples (63%), followed by urine (46%), cerebrospinal"
		"fluid (CSF; 5%), peritoneal fluid (3%) and endotracheal aspirate (2%). Multifocal"
		growth was determined in 10 (18%) cases. The isolated species were C.albicans (n
		"=36) as being the most common isolate followed by C.parapsilosis (n = 12),"
		"C.tropicalis (n = 1), C.kefyr (n = 1), C.lusitaniae (n = 1), C.pelluculosa (n ="
		"1) and Candida spp. (n = 2). Prior antibiotic use, long term hospitalization,"
		"total parenteral nutrition and use of lipid solutions, prematurity and catheter"
		use were determined as the most frequently associated factors causing candidal
		"infections. A congenital abnormality, mainly myeloschisis and hydrocephaly, was"
		detected in 18 (33%) of the cases. Overall FCZ resistance rate was 5.5% and the
		rate of resistance according to the species was 2.8% for C.albicans and 11% for
		non-albicans isolates. No resistance was observed to AMB. Initial treatment was
		FCZ for 78% and AMB for 22% of the newborns. The treatment was switched to AMB in
		15 (28%) cases because of no clinical or laboratory response to FCZ although only
		three of these babies showed resistance to FCZ (MIC ≥ 64 mcg/ml). Among the cases
		"with no clinical/microbiological response, C.albicans was the most frequently"
		(66%) isolated species followed by non-albicans species (33%). All of the
		isolates in the study group were susceptible to AMB and the rate of FCZ
		"resistance was 5.5%. However, it was noted that the clinical treatment failure"
		was higher than the resistance rate when FCZ was considered. Although antifungal
		"susceptibility tests are helpful for guiding the therapy, in vivo and in vitro"
		differences should be taken into account in case of treatment failure encountered
		with the use of in vitro effective agents.

AB	-	Subcutaneous mycoses are fungal infections that predominantly affect the dermis
		and subcutaneous tissue. The most common pathogen responsible for these
		"infections is Candida albicans; however, another yeast from this group, Candida"
		"parapsilosis, becomes the cause of increasing numbers of mycotic infections."
		Recent reports suggested that this microorganism may be particularly resistant to
		"disinfectants, which can facilitate its spread through the medical staff,"
		"instruments, and biomaterial. We report a case of a patient in whom a C."
		parapsilosis infection occurred as a complication following a minor
		electrocoagulation procedure. Because all obtained laboratory findings were
		"nonspecific, the infection could be properly diagnosed only through cultures from"
		the skin lesion.

AB	-	Several cases of Candida bloodstream infections were documented from June to
		"October 2004 at a tertiary care center in Bogotá, Colombia. Since no cases of"
		"candidemia had occurred during the preceding four months, an outbreak was"
		"declared. As a result, a microbiological study, a revision of infection control"
		"practices and a case-control study were performed. In all, 18 cases of candidemia"
		"were ascertained. Parenteral nutrition (p=0.04), presence of a central line"
		"(p=0.03), and severity of illness (p=0.03) were associated with candidemia in"
		bivariate analysis. Diverse Candida species were observed. Candida parapsilosis
		contamination was found in plastic containers used for transient intravenous (IV)
		"medication storage at the bedside, plastic bags reused for the transportation of"
		IV medicines and cotton used for disinfection of IV ports. Poor infection control
		practices were widely observed. The outbreak was controlled after elimination of
		"plastic bags used for transportation, instauration of daily disinfection of IV"
		"medication containers, acquisition of sterile alcohol swabs for port disinfection"
		and staff education. It was concluded that candidemia was associated with
		previously-described risk factors and that poor infection-control practices were
		likely responsible for the outbreak.

AB	-	We herein report the case of a 72-year-old man with endocarditis of the aortic
		valve who underwent urgent aortic valve replacement 36 hours after admission due
		to an aggravation of aortic valve regurgitation. Postoperative cultures of the

		Antifungal therapy with amphotericin B and fluconazole was initiated after
		"surgical treatment. Thereafter, the patient displayed a favorable clinical"
		course. Candida parapsilosis endocarditis involving the native valves is
		extremely rare and associated with a very high mortality rate. Prompt surgical
		treatment and the aggressive use of antifungal agents are required to save the

TI	-	Nosocomial candidemia in non-neutropenic patients at an Italian tertiary care
		hospital.
PG	-	602-7
AB	-	"In a retrospective study conducted in an Italian tertiary care hospital, the"
		incidence of nosocomial candidemia was evaluated together with causative
		"pathogens, treatment, and risk factors for death. Over a 6-year period"
		"(1992-1997), a total of 189 episodes of candidemia occurred in 189 patients (mean"
		"age 58+/-19 years), accounting for an average incidence of 1.14 episodes per"
		"10,000 patient-days per year. The most common reasons for hospitalization were"
		"solid neoplasia (21%), trauma (17%), abdominal diseases requiring surgery (13%),"
		and cardiovascular diseases (13%). No patient was neutropenic within 3 weeks
		prior to the onset of candidemia. One hundred thirty patients were hospitalized
		"in intensive care units, 47 patients in surgical wards, and 12 patients in"
		"medical wards. Candida albicans was the most frequently isolated pathogen,"
		"accounting for 54% of fungal isolates, followed by Candida parapsilosis (23%),"
		"Candida glabrata (7%), Candida tropicalis (5%), Candida pelliculosa (4%), Candida"
		"lusitaniae (1%), Candida humicula (1%), and other non-albicans Candida spp. (5%)."
		Seventy-six (41%) patients received adequate antifungal therapy. Seventy-one
		(58%) of the 123 evaluable patients with central venous catheters underwent line
		removal; 51 of them had catheter-related candidemia. The 30-day crude mortality
		"rate was 45%. Older age, hospitalization in an intensive care unit, a longer"
		"duration of candidemia, retention of central lines, and inadequate antifungal"
		"therapy were significantly associated with poor outcome. In the present study,"
		nosocomial candidemia was a frequent and relatively underestimated illness.
		Adequate antifungal therapy and central line removal independently reduced the
		high mortality of the disease.

AB	-	"Despite the relative high frequency of Candida bloodstream infection, Candida"
		"endocarditis is a rare entity. We report seven cases, which occurred during a"
		"period of 1 year in western France. Six cases were because of Candida albicans,"
		and one pacemaker endocarditis was because of Candida parapsilosis. All patients
		were men and presented risk factors for candidaemia. Of the six patients with
		"valvular involvement, five received caspofungin and two had surgical valve"
		replacement. Three patients treated with caspofungin antifungal therapy without
		valve replacement were cured from endocarditis. Antifungal and surgical
		"strategies are discussed, in particular, the possible role of new antifungal"
		therapies and long-term suppression therapy without surgery. One patient died in
		"the acute phase of endocarditis, three patients died of causes unrelated to"
		infective endocarditis and three patients had a favourable outcome.

AB	-	Fungal endocarditis is a rare clinical form of infective endocarditis. The main
		etiology of FE is Candida albicans but also Candida parapsilosis and the overall
		mortality is high. We report a case of an acute ischemic stroke treated by
		"mechanical thrombectomy, with the histopathological analysis of the retrieved"
		clot followed by the confirmation of fungal endocarditis. An extensive review of
		the literature has been proposed and three key points concerning the fungal
		"endocarditis predisposing factors, the relation between thrombolysis and"
		"hemorrhagic risk and, finally, the importance of clot analysis have been"
		discussed.

PG	-	89-93
AB	-	The incidence rate of invasive infections due to Candida species has increased
		"drastically in the last 20 years, causing a 40% mortality rate in hospitalized"
		patients. In order to comprehend the epidemiology of Candida bloodstream
		"infection, the study was carried out. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective"
		study was done based on microbiology laboratory reports from five terciary care
		hospitals from the city of Cordoba between January 2010 and August 2012. RESULTS:
		"158 patients had candidemia, the average age was 55,8 years, and 54% of patients"
		"were in the intensive care unit. Candida albicans (44%), Candida parapsilosis"
		(22%) and Candida tropicalis (12%) were the main fungi isolated. Candida
		parapsilosis was commonly associated with catether infections. CONCLUSIONS: The
		"data from the city of Cordoba showed that C. albicans, C. parapsilosis y C."
		tropicalis were the more frequent species isolated from blood cultures. This is
		similar to what is seen in other series published from Argentina and
		Latinamerica. This study may have implications when it comes to deciding which
		empiric antifugal agent is best for the treatment of candidemia.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infections are a frequent ailment in patients in
		intensive care units. Candida and other yeasts cause 5-12% of these infections.
		"The value of the finding of any yeast is controversial, and there is no consensus"
		about which parameters are adequate for differentiating urinary infections from
		colonization or contamination. AIMS: To analyse the epidemiological
		"characteristics of patients with funguria, to determine potential cut-off points"
		"in cultures (to distinguish an infection from other conditions), to identify the"
		"prevalent yeast species, and to determine the value of a second urine sample."
		METHODS: A multicentre study was conducted in intensive care units of 14
		hospitals in the Buenos Aires City Mycology Network. The first and second samples
		of urine from every patient were cultured. The presence of white cells and yeasts
		"in direct examination, colony counts, and the identification of the isolated"
		"species, were evaluated. RESULTS: Yeasts grew in 12.2% of the samples. There was"
		no statistical correlation between the number of white cells and the fungal
		colony-forming units. Eighty five percent of the patients had indwelling
		catheters. Funguria was not prevalent in women or in patients over the age of 65.
		"Candida albicans, followed by Candida tropicalis, were the most frequently"
		isolated yeasts. Candida parapsilosis and Candida glabrata appeared less
		"frequently. The same species were isolated in 70% of second samples, and in 23%"
		of the cases the second culture was negative. CONCLUSIONS: It was not possible to
		determine a useful cut-off point for colony counts to help in the diagnosis of
		"urinary infections. As in other publications, C. albicans, followed by C."
		"tropicalis, were the most prevalent species."

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candida parapsilosis was the most common species causing candidemia
		in the 2010 China Hospital Invasive Fungal Surveillance Net (CHIF-NET) database.
		"Compared to Candida albicans, the description of azole resistance and mechanisms"
		in C. parapsilosis is very limited. We report a patient with C. parapsilosis
		"candidemia over several months, due to a probable intravascular source, who"
		developed fluconazole resistance after prolonged treatment. CASE PRESENTATION: An
		82 year-old male had a hospital admission of approximately 1.5 years duration. He
		was initially admitted with acute pancreatitis. Prior to succumbing to the
		"illness, he developed candidemia and treated with three antifungal drugs for"
		"nearly 5 months, at suboptimal doses and without source control. Following"
		"treatment, 6 blood cultures were still positive for C. parapsilosis. The last 2"
		strains were resistant to fluconazole (MICs 32 μg/mL) and intermediate to
		voriconazole (MICs 0.5 μg/mL). Microsatellite multilocus analysis indicated that
		the 6 isolates from the patient belonged to a single genotype. The first 4
		isolates were susceptible to fluconazole (MICs 2 μg/mL) and voriconazole (MICs
		"0.015-0.03 μg/mL), which were slightly higher than susceptible control strains"
		from other patients. Overexpression of MDR1 genes were detected in the two
		"resistant isolates, and this was associated with a homozygous mutation in MRR1"
		"genes (T2957C /T2957C), with the amino acid exchange L986P. CONCLUSIONS: This"
		case corroborates that the resistant C. parapsilosis isolates can emerge in the
		"setting of complicated infections and the extensive use of antifungal agents,"
		emphasizing the need for standardizing and improving the antifungal treatment as
		well as source control in the treatment of infection diseases.

TI	-	Endophthalmitis in patients with disseminated fungal disease.
PG	-	67-70; discussion 70-1
AB	-	BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Fungal endophthalmitis caused by dissemination from
		extraocular fungal infections has been reported to vary between 9% and 45%.
		"However, recent clinical experience disagrees with that. This study is an"
		"investigation of patients in an inner city teaching hospital, the risks"
		"associated with endogenous fungal endophthalmitis, and this incidence. METHODS:"
		All ophthalmology consultations between February 1995 and August 2000 that might
		be associated with disseminated fungal infection were examined in a prospective
		manner. Patients were excluded if there was no evidence of a positive fungal
		culture from any site at any time. Visual symptoms were recorded along with
		"ophthalmologic and systemic examination features. Information was gathered,"
		"including the identity of cultured organisms, the sites from which the organisms"
		"were obtained, and the patients' disposition. RESULTS: During this interval, 170"
		"consultation requests contained the words ""endophthalmitis"" or ""retinitis"" and/or"
		indicated concern about disseminated fungal infections. Extraocular fungal
		"infections were found in 114 patients, but only 82 of them had evidence of"
		systemic dissemination. Some patients had more than one organism. The following
		"are listed in decreasing frequency of occurrence: Candida albicans, Torulopsis"
		"glabrata, Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis, Candida krusei, Aspergillus"
		"niger, and others. Only two patients had evidence of chorioretinitis and"
		progressed to fungal endophthalmitis. CONCLUSIONS: Endophthalmitis was rare among
		these patients with known fungal infections. Less than 2% had any related
		"ophthalmic manifestations. Nevertheless, since treatment can save vision,"
		evidence of intraocular infection should be sought as eagerly as before.

AB	-	We report a case of isolated pulmonary infectious endocarditis (IE) with Candida
		parapsilosis. A 66-year-old man presented with fever and cough. Echocardiography
		showed severe pulmonary regurgitation and vegetations on the pulmonary valves.
		"Initially, antibiotics were prescribed against bacterial IE, and the vegetations"
		"disappeared; however, the pulmonary vegetations relapsed, and C. parapsilosis was"
		grown from blood cultures. We performed a debridement without a pulmonary valve
		"replacement. There was no recurrence of IE for 3 years, and then the patient"
		developed right ventricular enlargement and severe tricuspid regurgitation due to
		severe pulmonary regurgitation. Pulmonary valve replacement was performed. Now
		the patient is free from infection.

AB	-	Candida parapsilosis is an extremely rare cause of meningitis. We report the case
		of a neonate born at 26+4 weeks of gestation who was admitted to the neonatal
		intensive care unit at our institution due to respiratory immaturity. During the
		"course of a 3-month hospitalization, the neonate developed fever and lethargy. A"
		"lumbar puncture revealed milky-white, turbid cerebrospinal fluid which contained"
		"many nucleated cells, mostly neutrophils. Microscopic examination of the"
		"cerebrospinal fluid revealed marked acute inflammation and fungal yeast forms,"
		and cultures of the cerebrospinal fluid and peripheral blood yielded C.
		parapsilosis. Imaging studies subsequently revealed a subdural empyema related to
		epidural migration of a central venous catheter (CVL). The neonate received
		extended therapy with amphotericin B and fluconazole. He responded favorably to
		therapy and was discharged 3 months after birth. This case underscores the
		clinical importance of the recognition and treatment of a potentially lethal
		fungal pathogen of the central nervous system and the need for awareness of
		complications resulting from CVL malposition.

AB	-	We investigated a nosocomial cluster of four Candida parapsilosis fungemia
		episodes that occurred in a neurological intensive care unit over a two-week
		period. The four infected patients had received parenteral nutrition through
		"central lines, and all four had catheter-related candidemia. All of the isolates"
		"were susceptible to all of the antifungals tested, including amphotericin B,"
		"fluconazole, voriconazole, and caspofungin. They had strictly related"
		"fingerprints, based on randomly amplified polymorphic DNA analysis. Additional"
		DNA sequencing data revealed that they were same strain. Although no isolate of
		"Candida parapsilosis was recovered from other clinical, surveillance, or"
		"environmental samples, nosocomial spread of this yeast ceased, following the"
		reinforcement of infection-control measures. Candida parapsilosis may require an
		"intravascular foreign body to cause fungemia, but this outbreak shows that it can"
		be transmitted nosocomially and can cause epidemics.

		"keratitis caused by an association between Candida lusitaniae, C. parapsilosis,"
		and Geotrichum candidum. METHODS: A three-year-old child with an antecedent
		trauma with vegetable matter and a prolonged use of corticosteroid eyedrops
		developed fungal keratitis. RESULTS: The isolates of the corneal scraping using
		"Sabaraud dextrose agar grew C. lusitaniae, C. parapsilosis, and G. candidum."
		"After topical 0.2% and systemic fluconazole treatment, the corneal lesion"
		resolved with no recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Corneal trauma with vegetables and the
		indiscriminate use of corticosteroids are important risk factors for mycotic
		keratitis. A combination of topical 0.2% and systemic fluconazole therapy was
		effective in the treatment of this mycotic association. This is the first report
		of fungal keratitis caused by C. lusitaniae and G. candidum.

		adult patients in a tertiary-care hospital].
PG	-	489-503
AB	-	Candida species which are currently the fourth most common cause of nosocomial
		"bloodstream infections, are associated with a significant morbidity and"
		mortality. The aim of this retrospective case-control study which included adult
		patients was to determine the epidemiology of candidemia and to evaluate risk
		factors for the development of candidemia and mortality at a tertiary-care
		education hospital over a 1-year period. A total of 38 candidemia cases (23 were
		male; age range: 17-82 yrs; mean age: 61.4 ± 13.5 years) were identified among
		"22.507 patients hospitalized during the study period (January 1-December 31,"
		2008) and the overall incidence was found as 16.8 per 10.000 hospital admissions.
		Control group (n= 36; 22 were male; mean age: 60.9 ± 16.3 years) was selected
		among patients who had no signs and symptoms of candidemia and had negative blood
		cultures during the study period. Thirty-six (95%) patients with candidemia were
		identified as nosocomial infection. The most frequently isolated species were
		C.albicans (55.2%) and C.parapsilosis (28.9%) and the primarily identified origin
		of infection was central venous catheter use (39%). Candida spp. İsolation was
		"most frequent in patients hospitalized in intensive care units (13/38; 34.2%),"
		followed by surgery (n= 8; 21%) and chest diseases (n= 5; 13). Univariate
		analysis revealed that presence of a central venous catheter [odds ratio (OR):
		"4.33; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.63-11.47, p= 0.003] and the length of"
		"hospitalization (OR: 0.97; CI: 0.94-1.00, p= 0.01) were the most frequently"
		associated factors with an increased risk of candidemia compared to controls.
		"However, multivariate analysis exhibited presence of a central venous catheter"
		"(OR: 2.90; CI: 1.04 8.11, p= 0.04) as the only independent risk factor for the"
		development of candidemia. Therapy was initiated with intravenous fluconazole
		(mean duration of therapy 13.2 ± 6.25 days) and in three patients following
		fluconazol use step-up therapy was initiated. Total mortality rate was 58%
		(22/38) in our case series. Risk factors for mortality due to candidemia in the
		univariate analysis were detected as no response to antifungal treatment (OR:
		"0.23; CI: 0.11-0.51, p< 0.001), underlying disease other than trauma (OR: 0.06;"
		"CI: 0.003-1.24, p= 0.02), and high Charlson index (OR: 0.60; CI: 0.38-0.93, p="
		"0.03), however those factors were not found significant by multivariate analysis."
		There was also a statistically significant correlation between Charlson index and
		treatment response (mean Charlson index was 3.5 ± 1.9 in therapy-responded
		patients and 4.8 ± 1.8 in non-responders; p= 0.03). Since the risk of developing
		candidemia was significantly higher in severely diseased patients using central
		"venous catheter or with prolonged hospitalization, response to antifungal therapy"
		"may be insufficient, leading to higher mortality."

AB	-	PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of various
		Candida species and study some of their virulence factors among thevulvovaginal
		candidiasis(VVC)patients. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTINGS: The study was conducted in a
		Tertiary Care University Hospital in North India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This
		study was carried out prospectively for a period of 1 year. High vaginal swabs
		(HVSs) were collected from women in childbearing age group attending the
		gynecology and obstetrics out-patient departments with the complaints suggestive
		of vulvovaginitis. Samples were plated on Sabouraud's dextrose agar slope.
		"Candida spp. isolated was further speciated based on microscopy, biochemical"
		tests and culture characteristics on special media. Virulence factors of these
		strains were determined by biofilm formation and phospholipase activity. RESULT:
		A total of 464 HVS from 232 patients with the complaints of vulvovaginitis were
		"included in this study. Following laboratory workup, 71 specimens were positive"
		"for genus Candida (30.6%). Further speciation showed 32.4% as Candida albicans,"
		45.07% Candida parapsilosis and 22.53% of Candida glabrata. Biofilm production
		was shown by 50 candidal strains (70.4%) and phospholipase activity was given by
		41 candidal strains (57.74%). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests increasing
		prevalence of non-albicans Candida among the VVC cases along with their virulence
		"factors. Therefore, we recommend that microbiological investigation upto species"
		level should be mandatory to determine the emergence of non-albicans Candida as a
		major cause of VVC.

PG	-	642-5
AB	-	Candida species are increasingly important nosocomial pathogens in critically ill
		children. A 2.3-fold increase in the rate of nosocomial candidemia at our 200-bed
		tertiary care children's hospital prompted a study to identify risk factors for
		"this infection. Twenty-six cases were identified between 1992 and 1993,"
		representing 21% of all nosocomial bloodstream infections. Candida albicans was
		"the most frequent isolate (58%), followed by Candida parapsilosis (27%). A"
		case-control study revealed that there was a statistically significant
		association between the occurrence of candidemia and placement of a central
		"venous catheter in the femoral vein (P = .03), the use of a tunneled central"
		"venous catheter (P = .05), and prolonged hyperalimentation (P = .04). Patients"
		with candidemia also were noted to have candiduria more often than controls (P =
		.003) and were more likely to have had topical antifungal agents prescribed (P =
		.04). Multivariate analysis showed that hyperalimentation was an independent risk
		factor for the development of candidemia. We conclude that measures must be taken
		to reduce these risk factors whenever possible.

AB	-	The importance of epidemiological monitoring of yeasts involved in pathologic
		processes is unquestionable due to the increase of these infections over the last
		"decade, the changes observed in species causing candidiasis, and empirical"
		"antifungal treatment. At the Mycology Center, 1006 isolates from a wide range of"
		clinical samples were studied during 1999-2001. Candida albicans (40.3%) was the
		"most isolated species, although, the Candida no albicans species with 54.9%"
		"showed the major prevalence. In blood cultures Candida parapsilosis (34.9%), C."
		albicans (30.2%) and C. tropicalis (25.6%) were recovered most frequently while
		C. glabrata represented only 2.3%. C. albicans with 60%-80% was the predominant
		"specie in mucosal surface. We also detected Candida mediastinistis, which alert"
		us over the importance at this location. Urinary tract infections caused by
		"yeasts were more frequent in hospitalized patients, being C. albicans (47.7%),"
		"the most commonly isolated, followed by C. glabrata (24.8%) and C. tropicalis"
		"(20.0%). In the candidal onychomycoses, C. parapsilosis (37.7%) outplaced C."
		albicans (22.0%). Fluconazole susceptibility studies of Candida species allowed
		"us to conclude that the majority of C. albicans islolates are susceptible, and"
		that the highest resistance averages were observed in C. glabrata (21.41%) and C.
		krusei (69.23%).

		"4.15, p = 0.04 and chi2 = 8.32, p = 0.004). C. glabrata was the second most"

AB	-	Objective: To analyze the distribution and drug resistance of pathogens from the
		"wounds of thermal burn patients, so as to provide reliable basis for the rational"
		use of antibiotics and the effective control over nosocomial infection. Methods:
		Wound samples of 1 310 thermal burn patients admitted into our burn wards from
		January 2012 to December 2017 were collected and retrospectively analyzed. API
		bacteria identification panels and automatical bacteria identification equipment
		were used to identify pathogens. E test was conducted to detect drug resistance
		"of pathogens to vancomycin, tigecycline, and oxacillin. Kirby-Bauer paper disk"
		diffusion method was used to detect drug resistance of pathogens to 31
		"antibiotics including penicillin G, gentamicin and rifampicin, etc., and drug"
		"resistance of fungi to 5 antifungal agents (voriconazole, amphotericin B,"
		"fluconazole, itraconazole, and ketoconazole). The WHONET 5.6 software was used to"
		"analyze the constituent ratios of Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria,"
		and fungi in each year; the distribution of fungi; the distribution of top 10
		bacteria with the highest constituent ratios in each year; the constituent ratios
		of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-sensitive
		Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA); the drug resistance of top 3 bacteria with the
		highest constituent ratios to commonly used antibiotics in each year; and the
		drug resistance of Candida to commonly used antifungal agents. Results: (1)
		"Totally 2 183 strains of pathogens were isolated for the first time, including"
		"Gram-negative bacteria 1 194 (54.70%) strains, Gram-positive bacteria 879"
		"(40.27%) strains, and fungi 110 (5.04%) strains. From 2012 to 2016, the"
		"constituent ratio of Gram-negative bacteria showed a decreasing trend, while that"
		of Gram-positive bacteria showed an increasing trend year by year; and the
		constituent ratio of fungi was with a significantly increasing trend from 2016 to
		"2017. (2) Among all the fungi, the constituent ratio of Candida parapsilosis"
		"ranked the first, Aflatoxin ranked the second, Candida albicans and Candida"
		"tropicalis both ranked the third. (3) From 2012 to 2017, top 10 bacteria with the"
		"highest constituent ratios, from high to low, were Staphylococcus aureus,"
		"Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae,"
		"Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Klebsiella pneumoniae,"
		"Enterococcus faecalis, Aeromonas hydrophila, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia"
		respectively. The constituent ratio of Staphylococcus aureus ranked the first in
		each year. The constituent ratio of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was fluctuating but
		showed a rising trend comprehensively. The constituent ratio of Acinetobacter
		"baumannii went up after decreasing. (4) Among all the Staphylococcus aureus,"
		"constituent ratio of MRSA was above 65.00%, while that of MSSA was below 31.00%"
		"in each year. (5) From 2012 to 2017, Staphylococcus aureus resistant to"
		"vancomycin, linezolid, or teicoplanin was not detected; the drug-resistant rates"
		"of MRSA to penicillin G, oxacillin, gentamicin, rifampicin, tetracycline,"
		"ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and levofloxacin were above or equal to 80.0% in each"
		year; the drug-resistant rates of Staphylococcus aureus to clindamycin and
		"erythrocin showed an obviously increasing trend, the drug-resistant rates of"
		Staphylococcus aureus to moxifloxacin and queenoputin/daputin in 2017 were higher
		"than those in 2016, while the drug-resistant rates of Staphylococcus aureus to"
		the other 14 antibiotics showed no significant change in trend. From 2012 to
		"2017, Acinetobacter baumannii was sensitive to polymyxin B and tigecycline; the"
		drug-resistant rate of Acinetobacter baumannii to ceftriaxone was relatively
		"high; the drug-resistant rates of Acinetobacter baumannii to levofloxacin,"
		"minocycline, and tetracycline were decreasing while those to the other 14"
		"antibiotics went up after decreasing. From 2012 to 2017, Pseudomonas aeruginosa"
		"wasn't resistant to polymyxin B, and its drug-resistant rates to the other 14"
		antibiotics showed decreasing trends. (6) The drug-resistant rates of Candida
		"albicans to voriconazole, amphotericin B, fluconazole, itraconazole, and"
		ketoconazole were all zero. The drug-resistant rates of non-Candida albicans to
		"voriconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, and ketoconazole were higher than those"
		of Candida albicans. Conclusions: Among the pathogens from the wounds of thermal
		"burn patients, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter"
		baumannii had the top 3 constituent ratios; the constituent ratio of non-Candida
		albicans was obviously higher than that of Candida albicans. The high drug
		resistance rates of Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumanni require more
		attention from clinicians and the local hospital's infection control department.

		keratopathy.
PG	-	2142-5
AB	-	A 63-year-old man developed infectious crystalline keratopathy (ICK) in his right
		eye 1 year after phacoemulsification. The white peripheral lesion was adjacent to
		the corneal phacoemulsification incision. Infiltrates in the form of
		"creamy-white, midstromal branching, needle-like opacities without evidence of"
		inflammatory cells were noted. A corneal biopsy by double lamellar flap was done
		"and studied by 3 techniques: microbiological culture, stain, and polymerase chain"
		reaction (PCR). Fungal and bacterial PCR were positive. A second sample was
		necessary to obtain a positive stain and culture. The DNA sequence analysis
		showed Candida parapsilosis and Staphylococcus aureus as the causal agents of the
		crystalline keratopathy. Treatment was started with amphotericin B 1% and
		"cefazolin 6 times a day, and systemic voriconazole was recommended. This is the"
		first reported case of ICK after cataract surgery. Polymerase chain reaction
		amplification and subsequent DNA typing were useful tools in detecting and
		identifying the ocular pathogens involved in this case.

PG	-	581-584
LID	-	4571 [pii]
AB	-	Pulmonary valve infections without the involvement of other valves account for
		only 1.5- 2% of all infective endocarditis cases. Isolated pulmonary valve
		endocarditis due to fungus is extremely rare. The case is presented of a
		36-year-old male who was found to have isolated pulmonary valve endocarditis
		"caused by a very rare organism, Candida parapsilosis, and that was solely managed"
		with medical therapy. The patient was evaluated for three weeks of lowgrade
		"fever, generalized rash and fatigue, and found to have C. parapsilosis in the"
		blood. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) demonstrated a 4.5 cm vegetation on
		"the pulmonary valve, without involvement of other valves. The patient was deemed"
		not to be a surgical candidate and was subsequently started on intravenous
		"liposomal amphotericin B and 5-flucytosine, with excellent clinical outcome."
		"Based on these case details, it must be emphasized that in selective cases and if"
		"there are no known complications, fungal endocarditis can be managed successfully"
		using anti-fungal agents.

AB	-	The aim of this study was to detect fungi in three ontocenoses of 947 women (aged
		20-45). The prevalence of multifocal fungal infections in women varied from 62.2
		+/- 2.99% to 81.0 +/- 3.92% in different ontocenoses. They assumed the following
		"mean values: 38.4 +/- 1.77% for the vagina, 42.2 +/- 1.80% for the oral cavity,"
		and 25.0 +/- 1.58% for the anus. The clinical manifestations of sexual organs
		inflammations were statistically significantly (p < 0.01) more frequent in women
		infected with fungi than in those without fungi in the vaginal ontocenosis. The
		highest convergence of the fungi presence with subjective and objective symptoms
		(assessed using the Yule Q index value) concerned: pruritus of the vulva or/and
		"vaginal walls, burning sensation or painful urethra, as well as oedema of the"
		"external opening of the urethra, vulva or/and the vagina (Q from +0.808 to"
		"+0.970). However, there was no statistically significant convergence between"
		occurrence of the fungi and vaginal discharge and painful hypogastrium. Based on
		"more than 40 phenotypical features (morphological, biochemical) of the axenic"
		"strains originating from vaginal, oral, and anal ontocenoses, a total of 12"
		"species of fungi were identified: Candida albicans, C. guilliermondii, C. krusei,"
		"C. tropicalis, C. kefyr, C. utilis, C. humicola, C. viswanathii, C. glabrata, C."
		"parapsilosis, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, and Geotrichum candidum. For"
		"intraspecific features, depending on the profile of the compounds used for"
		"auxanogram, 9 codes were read for Candida albicans and only one code for each of"
		other species was detected. In API ZYM test based on assessment of 19 hydrolase
		activities the enzymograms of species included from 6 to 11 enzymes.

LID	-	e28270
AB	-	RATIONALE: Candida bloodstream infection continues to be a significant cause of
		mortality in premature infants. Amphotericin B has been recommended as the
		"primary treatment; however, its use is limited due to drug-induced nephrotoxicity"
		and amphotericin B-resistant candidemia. PATIENT CONCERNS: The gestational age
		"was 29 (+6) weeks, and birth weight was 1760 g. DIAGNOSIS: The infant was"
		diagnosed with Candida parapsilosis bloodstream infection. INTERVENTIONS:
		"Fluconazole, 12 mg/kg/day, combined with caspofungin (loading dose 3 mg/kg, at a"
		maintenance dose of 2 mg/kg every 24 h) therapy was administered to premature
		infant with Candida bloodstream infection. When fluconazole or caspofungin was
		"used to treat Candida bloodstream infection in preterm infants, the blood"
		cultures of the infant remained positive for Candida parapsilosis. OUTCOMES: All
		persistent candidemia resolved on fluconazole combined with caspofungin therapy.
		"There were no adverse effects, hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, anemia, or"
		thrombocytopenia. LESSONS: Fluconazole combined with caspofungin successfully
		treated Candida bloodstream infection in premature infants at 29 + 6 weeks'
		"gestational age, but large-scale clinical trials are required."

PG	-	179-85
AB	-	A 79-year-old woman developed Candida parapsilosis endophthalmitis nine weeks
		after an uneventful cataract extraction. The diagnosis was suspected on clinical
		examination and documented by culture of the vitreous biopsy obtained during
		vitrectomy. The endophthalmitis was treated by pars plana vitrectomy and
		intravitreous injection of amphotericin B and dexamethasone. The patient was also
		"treated with systemic flucytosine, to which the operative isolate proved"
		"resistant. This was therefore immediately discontinued; however, the intraocular"
		infection cleared rapidly after the initial vitrectomy and intravitreous
		injection. The patient's visual acuity ultimately returned to 20/20. The
		combination of these two newer methods of treatment for fungal endophthalmitis
		achieved a favorable outcome in a disease process that has often previously
		wrought disaster.

PG	-	211-8
AB	-	Oesophageal candidiasis is an epithelial infection which requires an immune
		"deficiency. C. albicans is commonly the cause, although other species may also be"
		"responsible. Resistance to fluconazole, drug of choice for treatment, is an"
		emerging problem. The objectives of the current paper were: to determine the
		frequency of oesophageal candidiasis in patients submitted to upper
		"gastrointestinal endoscopy, analyze risk factors, identify Candida species and"
		"determine in vitro susceptibility to fluconazole. During 12 months, 34 patients"
		with oesophageal candidiasis were detected. Out of 1.230 HIV negative and 91 HIV
		"positive patients submitted to upper endoscopy, 11 (0.9%) and 23 (25.3%),"
		"respectively, had candidiasis. Risk factors for HIV negative patients were"
		"systemic antibiotic therapy in 2, deficient dental cleaning in 2 aged patients,"
		"use of proton pump inhibitors in 3, inhaled steroids in 2, malignancy in 1 and"
		oral steroids in 1. The histopathologic diagnosis was confirmed in 48.6% of
		"cases. Cultures were positive in 91.2% C. albicans was prevalent (93.5%), and was"
		"associated to other species in 5 cases (16.1%), (3 C. glabrata, 1 C. tropicalis"
		"and 1 C. parapsilosis). One case cultured only C. glabrata and 1, only C"
		"tropicalis. Out of 31 cultures, 25 were susceptible to fluconazole, 4 dose"
		"dependent (1 C. albicans, 3 C. glabrata), and 2 resistant (1 C. albicans, 1 C."
		"glabrata). Frequency of oesophageal candidiasis was low, except for HIV positive"
		"patients. The most common etiologic agent was C. albicans, though other Candida"
		species were also found. C. albicans and C. glabrata showed dose dependency and
		resistance to fluconazole.

TI	-	Secular trends in the epidemiology of nosocomial fungal infections at a teaching
		"hospital in Taiwan, 1981 to 1993."
PG	-	369-75
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To describe the incidence and patterns of nosocomial fungal infection
		"in a large teaching hospital in Taiwan. DESIGN: Prospective, hospitalwide"
		nosocomial surveillance data from 1981 through 1993 were analyzed to show the
		secular trend in nosocomial fungal infection rates and to identify the most
		common pathogens and sites of infection (other than skin) in this hospital.
		SETTING AND PATIENTS: The National Taiwan University Hospital is a medical
		"school-affiliated hospital in the city of Taipei, Taiwan, with a 1200-bed"
		capacity before 1991 and 1500 beds since 1992. It provides both primary and
		tertiary medical care. RESULTS: The overall nosocomial fungal infection rate rose
		from 0.9 infections per 1000 discharges in 1981 to 6.6 per 1000 discharges in
		"1993, with the highest rate at the medical intensive-care unit (26.5/1000"
		discharges in 1993). This increase in infection rate was found at four major
		"anatomic sites of infection, particularly including the bloodstream"
		(0.08-2.19/1000 discharges) and the urinary tract (0.36-2.95/1000 discharges). Of
		"256 pathogens causing nosocomial fungemia from 1981 through 1993, Candida"
		"albicans was the most commonly isolated (50.8%), followed by Candida tropicalis"
		"(17.6%). Candida parapsilosis (11.7%), and Candida glabrata (8.2%). As compared"
		"to isolates from 1981 through 1988, the proportion of C parapsilosis and C"
		"glabrata isolated between 1989 and 1993 increased more than sixfold and fourfold,"
		respectively. The increasing importance of fungal infections was confirmed
		further by the increased use of amphotericin B and azoles in this hospital.
		CONCLUSIONS: Candida species and other yeasts have become a prominent cause of
		nosocomial infections in this hospital. These fungal pathogens accounted for a
		higher proportion of nosocomial bloodstream and urinary infections than any
		"single bacterial species. Therefore, it is important to conduct a prospective"
		epidemiological study and to establish in vitro antifungal susceptibility testing
		to enhance efforts to control nosocomial fungal infections and to minimize the
		risk of emergence of antifungal resistance.

		among hospitalized patients].
PG	-	145-50
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Catheter related infections (CRI) and bloodstream infection (BSI)
		associated to central venous catheter (CVC) is cause of frequent
		hospital-acquired infection (HAI) and a major reason of morbidity and mortality
		among patients and it is itself an indicator of quality health care. OBJECTIVE:
		To determine the incidence of CRI and BSI and to identify the hospital areas
		where they occurred over a five-year period. METHODS: A prospective study from
		2004 to 2008 in a population of hospitalized patients who required the use of CVC
		was made. The HAI team detected the appearance of CRI during a daily routine
		"surveillance. RESULTS: During the period of observation, 176 BSI were detected,"
		"accounting for 11 % of all HAI, and represented the third place in frequency."
		Incidence rate for 1000 catheter-days varied from 2.7 in 2006 to 5.4 in 2008; 57
		% of these BSI were detected in the intensive care units. Candida spp. accounted
		as the more frequently isolated microorganism with predominance of C.
		parapsilosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results and the incidence rate found in our study
		occurred within rates established in other studies.

		"bloodstream isolates, and implications for antifungal therapy."
PG	-	529-35
AB	-	Candida spp. are common causes of bloodstream infections among hospitalized
		patients. Fluconazole (FLC) remains a first-line therapy for candidemia; and
		"voriconazole (VRC), an expanded-spectrum triazole, was recently approved for the"
		treatment of candidemia in nonneutropenic patients. In vitro studies have
		suggested that VRC has potent activity against Candida spp. with reduced
		susceptibilities to FLC. We present a case report of invasive candidiasis and
		candidemia due to a Candida glabrata isolate that developed resistance to all
		currently available triazole antifungals after a course of FLC treatment. This
		case prompted us to determine the frequency of cross-resistance among bloodstream
		"Candida isolates collected during a recent 12-month period at a large, academic"
		medical center. FLC MICs were determined for 125 of 153 isolates (81.7%). Thirty
		of 125 isolates (24%) were resistant or showed reduced susceptibilites to FLC
		(MICs >/= 16 microg/ml). When 28 of these 30 isolates were tested for their VRC
		"susceptibilities, 9 (32%) had MICs that were >/=2 microg/ml. Five of these nine"
		"isolates were C. glabrata, two isolates were Candida tropicalis, one isolate was"
		"Candida albicans, and one isolate was Candida parapsilosis. All five Candida"
		krusei isolates tested had VRC MICs </=0.5 microg/ml. These data have prompted
		the introduction of reflexive FLC susceptibility testing of first bloodstream
		Candida isolates at our institution. The case report and our data also suggest
		that VRC should be avoided as initial therapy in unstable patients with invasive
		"candidiasis, particularly in the setting of prior azole exposure. Studies are"
		needed to define the clinical significance of in vitro resistance to the newer
		antifungal agents.

TI	-	A case of recurrent episodes of Candida parapsilosis fungemia.
PG	-	295-8
AB	-	Candida species is the fourth most commonly isolated organism in blood stream
		infections in the hospital setting. Patients with candidemia frequently succumb
		"to this infection. For those that survive an initial candidemia, an increasing"
		number of cases of breakthrough or recurrent candidemias have been reported in
		the literature. We report three episodes of C. parapsilosis fungemia in a cancer
		patient. Molecular testing was performed and confirmed that all these episodes
		occurring within an eight-month period were caused by the same organism. The
		incidence of recurrent candidemia is likely to increase in the near future.
		Studies and therapeutic interventions for patients at risk for recurrent
		candidemias are warranted.

PG	-	85-6
AB	-	PURPOSE: To present a case of Candida parapsilosis following laser in situ
		keratomileusis (LASIK). METHODS: Retrospective chart review. RESULTS: A case
		report of a 51-year-old woman who underwent bilateral LASIK is presented. Two
		"weeks after the procedure, the patient presented with epithelial ingrowth OD. The"
		"ingrowth was treated with flap lifting and scraping, followed by postoperative"
		"antibiotics. Four weeks later, the patient presented with numerous interface"
		infiltrates. Smears were positive for yeast forms and cultures grew Candida
		parapsilosis. Administration of topical and systemic antifungal therapy resulted
		in clearing of the infection with partial visual recovery. CONCLUSIONS: To our
		"knowledge, this represents the first reported case of a post-LASIK Candida"
		parapsilosis keratitis. A high degree of suspicion coupled with rapid and
		appropriate treatment can result in visual recovery.

PG	-	159-63
LID	-	10.3341/kjo.2009.23.3.159 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: Postoperative endophthalmitis is a dreaded outcome of any intraocular
		surgery. Fungal endophthalmitis is a particularly severe complication that poses
		a significant threat of blindness. We experienced seven consecutive cases of
		postoperative fungal endophthalmitis stemming from a single local clinic in which
		extensive early intervention resulted in favorable final visual acuity. METHODS:
		The present study is retrospective observational case series of fungal
		"endophthalmitis. The initial case, as diagnosed by fungal culture, resulted in"
		"blindness. In the ensuing eight months, seven consecutive cases were referred to"
		our institution. All were presumed to be fungal endophthalmitis as the cases
		possessed similar inflammatory findings to the preceding case and occurred in the
		same environment. Extensive surgical and antifungal treatment was immediately
		"administered, including complete vitrectomy with removal of the intraocular lens"
		and lens capsule and Amphotericin B injections. RESULTS: Retinal infiltration was
		identified in three cases and the lesion site was photocoagulated with an
		endolaser. All cases were confirmed fungal endophthalmitis by culture (4 cases:
		"Candida parapsilosis, one case each: Fusarium, Acremonium, Candida tropicalis)"
		and five cases required secondary intraocular lens implantation. Final corrected
		visual acuity ranged from 20/20 to 40/200 by the Snellen chart. CONCLUSIONS:
		Early extensive surgical intervention and antifungal agent administration may
		result in favorable visual outcomes in patients with fungal endophthalmitis
		following cataract surgery.

TI	-	Candidemia and the susceptibility pattern of Candida isolates in blood.
PG	-	1060-3
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: Candida species has become one of the most common blood isolates as
		well as one of the leading causes of nosocomial bloodstream infections. The
		purpose of our study was to determine the prevalence of Candida species among our
		bloodstream infecting organisms and the susceptibility pattern of the Candida
		isolates to antifungal agents. METHODS: A prospective study was carried out in
		"the Division of Microbiology, King Khalid National Guard Hospital, Jeddah,"
		Kingdom of Saudi Arabia of all positive blood cultures for Candida species. The
		study took place from 1st January 1998 to March 2002. Identification and
		susceptibility pattern of isolates were determined by the Candifast technique to
		"amphotericin B, fluconazole, nystatin, Flucytosine, econazole, ketoconazole and"
		"miconazole. RESULTS: Over a 2-year period, 17,916 blood cultures were performed"
		"in our hospital. There were 2,972 positive cultures, of which 83 (2.8%) patients"
		"had Candida species isolated from their bloodstream. Of these, 38 (46%) were"
		Candida albicans (C.albicans). The remaining 45 strains were made up of Candida
		tropicalis 9 (10.8%); Candida parapsilosis 9 (10.8%); Candida species 9 (10.8%);
		Candida guilliermondi 6 (7.2%); Candida krusei 5 (6%); Candida glabrata 4 (4.8%);
		Candida pseudotropicalis 2 (2.4%) and Trichosporon species 1 (1.2%). All Candida
		"species were susceptible to amphotericin B. However, only 18 (47%) out of 38"
		"C.albicans were susceptible to fluconazole, while only 8 (17.7%) of 45"
		non-C.albicans strains were susceptible to this drug. CONCLUSION: The
		susceptibility of C.albicans to fluconazole in our hospital using the Candifast
		method is very low (47%). These results need to be confirmed by carrying out the
		Etest or the NCCLS M27-A method to confirm the true susceptibilities of Candida
		strains in our locality.

PG	-	276-9
AB	-	Candida parapsilosis is a very common and saprophytic fungus. Its pathogenic role
		has been reported in intensive care units after invasive instrumentations. We
		report a case of dermal candidiasis due to Candida parapsilosis occurring in an
		immunocompromised patient suffering from aplastic anemia treated with
		"corticosteroids. The histopathological aspect was non specific, showing a"
		polymorphous granulomatous reaction in the middermis. Findings of periodic
		acid-Schiff and Grocott-Gomori stains revealed a large number of pseudohyphae and
		spores. Candida parasilosis was cultured from a skin biopsy. The route of skin
		infection is discussed: direct inoculation or septic localization after fungemia.

		caspofungin and voriconazole.
PG	-	73
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Fungal mural endocarditis is a rare entity in which the antemortem
		diagnosis is seldom made. Seven cases of mural endocarditis caused by Candida
		spp. have been collected from literature and six of these patients died after
		treatment with amphotericin B. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of mural
		endocarditis diagnosed by transesophageal echocardiogram and positive blood
		cultures to Candida parapsilosis. Because blood cultures continued to yield C.
		"parapsilosis despite caspofungin monotherapy, treatment with voriconazole was"
		added. CONCLUSION: This is the first description of successful treatment of C.
		parapsilosis mural endocarditis with caspofungin and voriconazole.

		the study of a candidemia cluster in a burn care unit.
PG	-	3278-83
AB	-	We investigated a cluster of cases of Candida septicemia diagnosed in four burn
		patients. Twenty clinical isolates of Candida albicans and two of Candida
		"parapsilosis, plus eight isolates of C. albicans recovered from nurses' clothes,"
		were analyzed by antifungal susceptibility testing and three genotyping methods
		"(restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis with EcoRI and HinfI,"
		"arbitrarily primed PCR, and karyotyping). The high MICs of the azoles for all of"
		the C. albicans isolates tested suggest either a natural resistance of the
		endogenous flora or the transmission of isolates with acquired resistance. The
		"genotyping methods demonstrated the involvement of four different strains,"
		"cross-infections with one C. albicans strain and one C. parapsilosis strain, and"
		identity between some of the strains from the patients and nurses. The origins of
		the strains remain unclear. Our results show that the use of a combination of at
		least two different methods such as those used in the present study is
		recommended for C. albicans typing.

		in a peritoneal dialysis patient: a challenge for nephrologists.
PG	-	461-3
AB	-	In continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD)-related cases of fungal
		"peritonitis, Candida parapsilosis (C. parapsilosis) has become as common as"
		Candida albicans (C. albicans) in fungal isolates. This report describes a
		74-year-old male CAPD patient who received bypass surgery for coronary artery
		"disease, followed by an episode of bacterial peritonitis. The peritonitis was"
		"successfully treated with intraperitoneal antibiotics. However, C. parapsilosis"
		peritonitis with concomitant pancreatitis and infected pseudocysts occurred one
		month later. Despite surgical drainage and intravenous administration of
		"fluconazole, fungal peritonitis persisted. Finally, he died of nosocomial"
		pneumonia. This case demonstrates the poor outcome of C. parapsilosis
		"peritonitis, suggesting a more aggressive treatment in peritoneal dialysis"
		patients.

PG	-	346-9
LID	-	10.1097/ICO.0b013e3181a9d0c0 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) is
		increasingly gaining popularity as an effective alternative to traditional
		"penetrating keratoplasty for the treatment of endothelial diseases. However, new"
		complications such as donor graft dislocation are seen after DSAEK. Surface
		venting incisions have been advocated to reduce rates of graft dislocation. We
		report a case of post-DSAEK fungal endophthalmitis in which the clinical course
		may have been influenced by the presence of surface venting incisions. METHOD: A
		"retrospective case report. RESULTS: A 72-year-old woman, who developed"
		"primary/iatrogenic graft failure after DSAEK, underwent a repeat DSAEK. Corneal"
		venting incisions were reopened at the original sites as her first operation.
		"Early postoperatively, she developed intrastromal opacities, which were thought"
		"to be epithelial downgrowth, but progression and increasing stromal and"
		"intraocular inflammation required anterior chamber and vitreous tap, which"
		"confirmed the presence of Candida parapsilosis, confirming the diagnosis of"
		"fungal endophthalmitis. Penetrating keratoplasty, removal of the posterior"
		"lamellar graft, removal of the posterior chamber intraocular lens implant (PCIOL)"
		"and capsular bag, and anterior vitrectomy were performed after failure of"

		nutrition.
PG	-	535-7
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Intravascular catheter placement carries the risk of a
		"life-threatening systemic fungal infection. In addition to antifungal therapy,"
		removal of the catheter is often considered to be an important part of
		management. CASE: A 33-year-old multipara with hyperemesis underwent placement of
		a peripherally inserted central catheter for parenteral nutrition. She
		subsequently developed candidemia with both blood and the peripherally inserted
		central catheter tip cultures positive for Candida parapsilosis. The catheter was
		"removed, the patient was started on intravenous amphotericin B, and due to side"
		"effects, she was switched to intravenous fluconazole. She recovered fully, was"
		"discharged home on oral fluconazole, and delivered a healthy infant at term."
		CONCLUSION: Peripherally inserted central catheter placement may be complicated
		by candidemia. Intravenous fluconazole and removal of the contaminated catheter
		successfully eradicated systemic infection with C parapsilosis.

		"best of our knowledge, a case has not been described previously in Japan in the"
		English literature. A battery of 8 peroxidase-labeled lectins was tested on
		sections of paraffin-embedded tissue to determine which lectin could be used in
		"the microscopic diagnosis of C. parapsilosis. One lectin, from Archis hypoaea"
		"(PNA) was found to react with C. parapsilosis. On the other hand, C. albicans,"
		"Aspergillus, Mucor, and Cryptococcus did not react with A. hypoaea (PNA). On"
		"fluorescence microscopic study, C. parapsilosis was not fluorescent, but other"
		"fungi were fluorescent when exposed to ultraviolet illumination. Therefore, we"
		propose new procedures for identification of C. parapsilosis in tissue sections
		using lectin histochemistry and fluorescence microscopy.

PG	-	890-6
AB	-	PURPOSE: To report the spectrum of fungal keratitis at the Centre Hospitalier
		"National d'Ophtalmologie XV-XX, Paris. METHODS: We reviewed 19 cases of fungal"
		keratitis from January 1993 to January 2001. We evaluated the different risk
		"factors, fungal identification, topical and systemic antifungal therapy, surgical"
		"treatment and outcome. RESULTS: Nineteen patients were included, 7 women and 12"
		"men, with visual acuity ranging from 9/10 to no perception of light. The mean age"
		was 56.2 years. Patients were hospitalized for an average stay of 16.3 days and
		all received a diagnostic and therapeutic scraping and 16 received a local
		antifungal treatment. The most common risk factors were topical steroid treatment
		"(42.1%), corneal graft (31.6%), trauma or foreign body (31.6%). The mean delay"
		between the first signs and fungal keratitis diagnosis was 14 days. Yeast as
		"Candida parapsilosis and albicans were the most frequently isolated fungi (58%),"
		followed by Aspergillus sp. (21%) and Fusarium sp. (21%). The most commonly used
		"topical treatment was amphotericin B, and itraconazole was used as systemic"
		"treatment. Five patients had evisceration, 6 had penetrating keratoplasty and 5"
		retained leukoma. CONCLUSION: Candida was the most frequently isolated fungi and
		topical steroid treatment the main risk factor. The prognosis is relatively poor
		(26% of lost vision) because of a delay in diagnosis and other previous ocular
		pathology or surgery.

TI	-	Fungal infection of ventriculoperitoneal shunts in children.
PG	-	1049-53
AB	-	Infection is still the most common complication of shunt procedures in children.
		"However, fungal infection is still considered to be rare. We found that fungi"
		accounted for 17% of shunt infections (8 of 48) in a retrospective study. All of
		the patients were premature babies and had received a ventriculoperitoneal shunt
		because of hydrocephalus. The clinical manifestations were subtle and insidious.
		The time of onset of infection ranged from 1 month to 1 year after the insertion
		of the shunt. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid of infected patients showed
		mild pleocytosis with an elevated protein concentration. Candida species
		"(including Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis, and Candida tropicalis) or"
		"Torulopsis glabrata were isolated. In all but one case, shunts were removed and"
		systemic therapy with amphotericin B was administered. Amphotericin B was given
		"intrathecally to two patients, who did not respond to systemic therapy. Treatment"
		with fluconazole failed for one patient. We suggest performing fungal cultures in
		"cases of shunt infection, especially those involving premature infants."
		"Extraventricular drainage, systemic therapy with amphotericin B, and insertion of"
		a new shunt remain the principal components of the treatment regimen for fungal
		shunt infections in children.

PG	-	23-8
AB	-	Results from a cross-sectional observational study on candidemia conducted at
		"Hospital de Clínicas, Federal University of Paraná, are presented. From January"
		"2001 to December 2004, one hundred candidemia cases were evaluated. The incidence"
		"was 1.27 episodes per 1,000 hospitalizations and Candida was the eighth most"
		frequently isolated agent from bloodstream infections. The patients ages ranged
		"from five days to 89 years, with a mean of 32 years. Sixty percent of the cases"
		occurred in adults (66% > 50 years old) and 40% in children (52% < one year old).
		Fifty-nine percent had been admitted to medical wards and 41% to the intensive
		care unit. Candida albicans was the most (59%) frequent species followed by
		Candida tropicalis (15%) and Candida parapsilosis (9%). The most (97%) prevalent
		"coexisting conditions were the use of antibacterial drugs, central venous"
		"catheter (77%), H2 blockers (57%), total parenteral nutrition (49%) and admission"
		"to the intensive care unit (41%). Out of the 51 isolates tested, three of Candida"
		glabrata presented dose-dependent susceptibility to fluconazole and resistance to
		itraconazole. One sample of Candida krusei presented dose-dependent
		susceptibility to fluconazole and one of Candida pelliculosa presented
		"dose-dependent susceptibility to itraconazole. Among the study population, 68%"
		"received antifungal therapy, but the mortality was 56%."

TI	-	The combined use of VIGI@ct (bioMérieux) and fluorescent amplified length
		fragment polymorphisms in the investigation of potential outbreaks.
PG	-	262-8
AB	-	"Even with good surveillance programmes, hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) are"
		not always recognized and this may lead to an outbreak. In order to reduce this
		"risk, we propose a model for prompt detection of HAIs, based on the use of a"
		"real-time epidemiological information system called VIGI@ct (bioMèrieux, Las"
		"Balmas, France) and on the rapid confirmation or exclusion of the genetic"
		relationship among pathogens using fluorescent amplified length fragment
		polymorphism (f-AFLP) microbial fingerprinting. We present the results of one
		"year's experience with the system, which identified a total of 306 suspicious"
		"HAIs. Of these, 281 (92%) were 'confirmed' by clinical evidence, 16 (5%) were"
		considered to be simple colonization and the latter nine (3%) were archived as
		'not answered' because of the absence of the physician's cooperation. There were
		"seven suspected outbreaks; of these, f-AFLP analysis confirmed the clonal"
		relationship among the isolates in four cases: outbreak 1 (four isolates of
		"Pseudomonas aeruginosa), outbreak 2 (three Escherichia coli isolates), outbreak 6"
		(two Candida parapsilosis isolates) and outbreak 7 (30 ESbetaL-producing
		"Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae). Based on our results, we conclude that"
		the combination of VIGI@ct and f-AFLP is useful in the rapid assessment of an
		outbreak due to Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria and yeasts.

PG	-	47-51
AB	-	Retrospective evaluation of candidaemia patients was performed in an Indian
		teaching hospital over a 10-year period. The incidence of patients with
		candidaemia increased eleven-fold in the second half of the study period (55
		patients) compared with the first half (5 patients). Haematological malignancies
		"(11 patients), neonatal septicaemia (9), cardiac abnormalities and cardiac"
		surgery (9) were the commonest underlying diseases in these patients. Candida
		"albicans (50%), C. guilliermondii (17%), C. tropicalis (15%) and C. parapsilosis"
		(8%) were the most common fungal pathogens isolated from blood culture. Therapy
		"with two or more antibiotics (92%), corticosteroid administration (25%),"
		intravascular catheter use for over 24 h (78%) and neutropenia (48%) were the
		accountable predisposing factors. Prolonged hospitalization (mean average 22.2
		days as compared with 11.2 days in other patients) was an added risk factor in
		these patients.

TI	-	Clustering of Candida infections in the neonatal intensive care unit: concurrent
		emergence of multiple strains simulating intermittent outbreaks.
PG	-	130-4
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Clusters of Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis infections were
		noted intermittently in our neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). We attempted to
		determine whether these clusters represented single strain outbreaks or
		coincidental emergence of unrelated strains. METHODS: A retrospective examination
		"of the frequency of candidemia during a 9-year period, two point prevalence"
		studies of colonization and assessment of strain relatedness of individual infant
		isolates during and in between clusters during a 2-year period with karyotyping
		and restriction endonuclease analysis of genomic DNA (REAG). RESULTS: C. albicans
		and C. parapsilosis infections emerged in a scattered pattern (1 to 2 cases every
		few months) with intermittent clustering of 3 cases/month. The colonization rate
		"was 50% 5 weeks after an apparent cluster, equally distributed between C."
		"albicans and C. parapsilosis, and 17.6% (exclusively with C. parapsilosis) 4"
		months after absence of invasive disease. Utilizing REAG or karyotyping singly we
		"noted 12 and 16 DNA banding patterns, respectively, among 23 infant isolates. Few"
		"patterns were observed repeatedly over 2- to 20-month periods, implying recurrent"
		emergence of the same strains. Combining karyotyping with REAG revealed a
		different epidemiologic pattern. It identified 20 distinct composites with
		identical composites in 3 infant pairs. All infants with identical composites
		were in the NICU concurrently. The frequency of strain relatedness was comparable
		"among clustered cases (16.7%), scattered cases (7.7%) and simultaneously"
		colonized infants (16.7%). CONCLUSIONS: These findings illustrate that Candida
		infections clustered periodically in our NICU but that these clusters were often
		caused by unrelated strains with infrequent cross-infection during and between
		clusters. With suboptimal typing this pattern of emergence can be mistaken for
		same strain outbreaks.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive fungal diseases have increased in recent years. Candida
		"species are the most common aetiology. Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis,"
		"Candida tropicalis, Candida glabrata and Candida krusei are the cause of most of"
		them. The aim of this work is to describe the first isolation of Candida fabianii
		in the blood of a non-neonatal paediatric patient. CASE REPORT: A 2 year-old male
		"with short bowel syndrome, severe malnutrition, and hypophosphataemic rickets"
		deficiency was admitted to paediatric intensive care due to a respiratory tract
		infection and suspicion of an intestinal pseudo-obstruction. He received several
		cycles of broad-spectrum antibiotics for several infections due to Pseudomonas
		aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. After the surgical correction of the intestinal
		disorder he suffered a new episode of sepsis where yeasts were isolated by
		culture. The species identification was performed by means of mass spectrometry
		"(MALDI-TOF system, Bruker Daltonic). The identity of the isolate was C.fabianii"
		(anamorph)/Pichia fabianii (teleomorph) with a score of 2.149. Antifungal
		"treatment with caspofungin was prescribed, with good progress of the patient."
		CONCLUSIONS: Molecular techniques are important for the identification of these
		"species, although mass spectrometry offered a reliable and rapid diagnosis."
		Treatment with caspofungin was effective.

TI	-	Detection and identification of the Candida species by 25S ribosomal DNA analysis
		in the urine of candidal cystitis.
PG	-	115-7
AB	-	Candida species in clinical urine samples were identified directly by the newly
		developed method of PCR analysis on 25S ribosomal DNA (rDNA). Two dogs were
		"referred to the Animal Medical Center, Nihon University School of Veterinary"
		"Medicine, Fujisawa, Kanagawa, Japan for the examination of chronic cystitis."
		Microscopic examination of urine samples from these dogs revealed yeast cells.
		Urine culture on Sabouraud's dextrose agar at 27 degrees C for 5 days produced
		white to cream colored colonies. The isolates were identifical to Candida
		"albicans and C. parapsilosis by mycological examination, respectively. The"
		nucleotide sequences of 25S ribosomal DNA from these urine isolates showed 99%
		similarity to those of a reference strain of Candida albicans or C. parapsilosis.
		The nucleotide sequences of 25S rDNA obtained directly from urine samples were
		"also identical to C. albicans and C. parapsilosis, respectively. Confirming the"
		results on the isolates cultured from the same urine samples. This PCR analysis
		method could be available for the direct identification of Candida species in
		urine samples within 2 days.

AB	-	Infections occur in approximately 2-5% percent of women undergoing breast
		reconstruction by tissue expansion depending on patient characteristics and
		"timing of reconstruction. Bacteria, specifically Staphylococci, are the most"
		common pathogens. Treatment varies depending on the surgeon and the
		aggressiveness of the infection. We report a case of unilateral tissue expander
		infection with Candida parapsilosis in an otherwise healthy female undergoing
		immediate tissue expander placement after bilateral nipple-sparing mastectomies.
		"The patient was treated with a one-stage irrigation, debridement, and tissue"
		expander exchange as well as a 21-day course of oral antifungal therapy. Her
		infection resolved and she was able to complete her implant-based reconstruction.
		C. parapsilosis is usually responsible for infections in critically ill patients
		"found in association with central lines, peritoneal dialysis catheters and"
		prosthetic heart valves. The affinity of C. parapsilosis for foreign material
		makes it a causative agent worth considering in difficult to treat tissue
		expander infections.

AB	-	We describe two patients with fungal keratitis refractory to standard antifungal
		therapy whose conditions were managed with voriconazole. The first case is a
		patient with endophthalmitis and corneal ulcer due to Candida parapsilosis after
		receiving a corneal transplant. The patient was treated with amphotericin but
		"showed no signs of improvement. Topical voriconazole, oral voriconazole, and"
		intravitreal voriconazole yielded signs of improvement. The second case is a
		63-year-old male who underwent a month of empiric treatment with 0.2% topical
		amphotericin for fungal keratitis but showed no signs of improvement. Treatment
		was then provided with 1% voriconazole. Both cases showed effective treatment
		with voriconazole. Voriconazole may be considered as a new method to treat fungal
		keratitis refractory to standard antifungal therapy.

LID	-	10.1097/MD.0000000000014327 [doi]
LID	-	e14327
AB	-	RATIONAL: Knee joint infection caused by isolated primary Candida is extremely
		"rare, with only a few cases reported. It occurs most often in patients with"
		"predisposing factors (e.g., immunosuppression, malignancy, drug abuse) or fungal"
		"invasion during traumatic procedures, including surgery. We report an unusual"
		case of Candida parapsilosis infection in the knee joint with no predisposing
		factors. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 65-year-old man entered our hospital complaining of
		persistent pain and mild swelling of the right knee that seriously affected
		normal walking. There was no obvious cause for his distress. DIAGNOSIS: The case
		was eventually diagnosed as a primary Candida parapsilosis infection which had
		many diagnostic particularities and difficulties. INTERVENTIONS: Total knee
		arthroplasty (TKA) was ultimately performed followed by fluconazole coverage.
		OUTCOMES: The patient showed good clinical performance at the 3- and 6-month
		follow-up visits and was very satisfied with the therapeutic effect. LESSONS: If
		"there were suspected symptoms of primary Candida infection cases, imaging and"
		"microscopic examinations, tissue cultures, and pathological examination of the"
		puncture knee joint fluid were required.

AB	-	"Candida species, predominantly Candida albicans strains, are part of the normal"
		"flora of gastrointestinal tract, but some authors suggest that faecal candida may"
		cause diarrhoea. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of faecal
		"Candida spp. isolates in 345 children with diarrhoea and 161 with other diseases,"
		hospitalized in 2003. Overall 506 faecal specimens obtained before treatment and
		98 after treatment of children for yeasts using routine culture method were
		examined. A total of 131 (101 before and 30 after treatment) strains isolated
		were identified as Candida albicans. Only 2 strains belonged to other species of
		Candida (C. parapsilosis and C. krusei). The sensitivity of Candida spp. strains
		to chemotherapeutic was also estimated. All strains of C. albicans were sensitive
		to nystatin. Incidence of faecal strains of C. albicans in children with acute
		"diarrhoea (19,4%) and children with other disease (21,1%) was comparable"
		"(p>0,05). Candida albicans yeasts caused diarrhoea in small percent of studied"
		"children. Only in 2 (0,6%) children C. albicans as aetiological agent of"
		"diarrhoea was found. In 16 (16,3%) cases secondary fungal infections were"
		acquired during hospitalization children (4 children with fungal diarrhoea).
		Resolution of diarrhoea caused by C. albicans in 6 children after treatment with
		nystatin was observed.

TI	-	Cluster of Candida parapsilosis primary bloodstream infection in a neonatal
		intensive care unit.
PG	-	32-6
AB	-	Candida parapsilosis is an increasingly important bloodstream pathogen in
		neonatal intensive care units (NICU). We investigated a cluster of bloodstream
		infections in a NICU to determine whether nosocomial transmission occurred.
		"During a 3-day period, 3 premature infants hospitalized in the same unit"
		presented with sepsis caused by C. parapsilosis. Electrophoretic karyotype of the
		organisms was performed by using pulsed field gel electrophoresis in a
		countour-clamped homogeneous electric field system. The isolate from 1 newborn
		"could not be typed, and the isolates from the remaining 2 infants had identical"
		patterns. All 3 cases are described. We conclude that nosocomial transmission of
		C. parapsilosis occurred and that neonates under intensive care may represent a
		risk group for this pathogen.

PG	-	29-38
AB	-	"During the past decades, several studies have reported an increase in the"
		"incidence of nosocomial candidosis. In a prospective study, performed at the"
		"Departamento de Micología, INEI, ANLIS Dr. C. G. Malbrán and the Servicio de"
		"Neonatología and Microbiología, Hospital de Niños Sor María Ludovica, from"
		"October 1995 to December 1996, 167 patients with candidosis were detected."
		"Candida species isolated were C. albicans (53.1%), C. parapsilosis (26.5%) and C."
		tropicalis (14.8%). The aim of this work was to characterize the clinical C.
		parapsilosis isolates from pediatric patients hospitalized in two neonatal
		intensive care units from the same hospital and to evaluate the usefulness of
		electrophoretic karyotype (EK) and restriction endonuclease analysis of genomic
		DNA (REAG) using a low frequency digestion enzyme. EK of all isolates disclosed
		12 banding patterns and REAG with endonuclease Sfi I showed only 5 groups.
		"However, isolates from the control group could not be separated from the clinical"
		isolates. The isolates within each dendogram group for EK or REAG were apparently
		"unrelated. Our results show that EK yields better results than REAG, but that it"
		"falls short of the desired discrimination, which suggests that these techniques"
		do not seem to be useful for studying nosocomial C. parapsilosis outbreaks.

AB	-	Candiduria may be a marker of serious fungal infections such as pyelonephritis.
		"With the exception of fluconazole and flucytosine, antifungals drugs are not"
		"excreted into the urine as active drugs, making the management of infection due"
		to fluconazole-resistant Candida difficult. We report a case of recurrent Candida
		parapsilosis candiduria in a kidney transplant recipient suffering from chronic
		ureteral obstruction requiring permanent ureteral catheterization (double-J
		stent). Attempts to remove the stent led to pyelonephritis episodes during which
		only Candida was isolated from the urine. Following several courses of
		"azole-based therapy, the causative agent became resistant to fluconazole."
		Clinical and mycological cure were obtained combining irrigations of caspofungin
		through a percutaneous calicostomy catheter and oral flucytosine. This strategy
		may represent an interesting therapeutic alternative in case of
		fluconazole-resistant symptomatic candiduria.

		cases.
PG	-	749-51
AB	-	The objective of this study was to assess risk factors and the outcome of
		breakthrough fungaemias (BFs) occurring during fluconazole (FLU) therapy in
		non-cancer and non-HIV individuals. Thirty-three fungaemias occurring during
		therapy with FLU among a total of 310 fungaemias observed within a 10-y national
		survey were analysed. The agar disk diffusion method was used for antifungal
		susceptibility testing and the Vitek system for species identification.
		Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed to determine risk factors for
		BF. All BFs were due to species known to be susceptible to FLU: Candida albicans
		"(25/33), C. parapsilosis (6/33) and C. guillermondii (2/33). The mean number of"
		positive blood cultures per episode was 2.4. The MIC of Candida spp. to FLU was
		"0.5-8 mg/ml (all strains were susceptible in vitro). Neonatal age (< 4 weeks),"
		"very low birth weight, prior surgery, central venous catheter placement,"
		"artificial ventilation, total parenteral nutrition and C. parapsilosis were"
		"significantly related to BF in univariate analysis, but only central venous"
		"catheter placement was significantly related in multivariate analysis. However,"
		the outcome of BFs and non-BFs was similar. All BFs occurred in non-HIV patients
		"who were not previously treated with azoles, and were caused by in vitro"
		FLU-susceptible species (C. albicans and C. tropicalis). Thus factors other than
		in vitro susceptibility play a role in BFs.

PG	-	431-4
LID	-	10.1007/s00059-012-3715-9 [doi]
AB	-	"INTRODUCTION: In October 2011, a 72-year-old man was referred from a peripheral"
		hospital with subsequent diagnosis: fungal sepsis with suspicion for endocarditis
		"of a bioprosthetic aortic heart valve. In May 2010, a bioprosthetic aortic valve"
		implantation (Edwards Magna) and CABG (LIMA graft on LAD) were performed. CASE:
		"At the time of admission, the patient was in good general condition; the physical"
		examination was unremarkable. Hemoculture detected Streptococci thermophilus and
		Candida parapsilosis. Neither an oscillating intracardiac mass on the valve nor
		an abscess could be detected in several transesophageal echocardiographies
		(TEEs). The F(18)-FDG PET-CT showed an increased tracer uptake in the area of the
		prosthetic aortic valve. The findings argued for a fungal endocarditis of the
		prosthetic aortic valve. Heart surgeons refrained from implantation of a new
		"prosthetic aortic valve because of the unfavorable prognosis. Therefore,"
		high-dose i.v. therapy with liposomale amphotericin B (5 mg/kg BW) and
		voriconazol (4 mg/kg BW twice a day) was started. A new F(18)-FDG PET-CT after 2
		weeks showed no tracer uptake in the area of the prosthetic aortic valve. The
		hemoculture was also negative. The patient recovered; CRP values were within
		normal limits. Life-long antifungal therapy with fluconazol (400 mg/day) was
		recommended. CONCLUSION: There are no definitive treatment recommendations for
		fungal endocarditis. Surgical therapy is the first choice in prosthetic valve
		"endocarditis, which however cannot be performed in all patients. In these cases"
		high dose and life-long medical therapy is necessary to prevent re-infection of
		"the valve, even if (transient) deterioration of renal and liver function occurs."

PG	-	330-3
AB	-	A successfully treated case of fungal endocarditis for native aortic and mitral
		"valves was reported. A 56-year-old male was admitted with high fever, dyspnea on"
		"exertion and oliguria. Infective endocarditis, urinary tract infection and acute"
		renal failure were most suspected by findings of physical examination and
		"urinalysis, but repeated blood cultures were sterile. In the course of treatment"
		"for urinary tract infection, high fever and leucocytosis recurred and then blood"
		cultures were positive for Candida parapsilosis. Despite intensive antifungal
		"therapy, blood cultures were consistently positive for Candida parapsilosis."
		Echocardiogram showed vegetation on the aortic and mitral valve. Aortic and
		"mitral valve replacements with prosthetic heart valves were carried out on April,"
		1986. Cultures of the vegetation on the mitral valve revealed Candida
		parapsilosis. Intensive administration of antifungal drug was done
		postoperatively. Postoperative course was uneventful and he was discharged in
		excellent condition on the 84th postoperative day. During follow-up period of 1
		"year, the patient has been doing very well and there were no sign of recurrence"
		of fungal infections.

		Italian region (Lombardy; population: 8 924 870) by the National Society of
		"Medical Mycology (FIMUA) from September 1997 to December 1999. In total, 569"
		"episodes were reported with an overall rate of 0.38/1000 admissions, 4.4/100000"
		patient days. Predisposing factors included presence of an intravascular catheter
		"(89%), antibiotic treatment (88%), surgery (56%), intensive care (45%), solid"
		"tumour (28%), steroid treatment (15%), haematological malignancy (7%), HIV"
		"infection (6%), fetal immaturity (4%). Mucous membrane colonization preceded"
		"candidaemia in 83% of patients. Candida albicans was identified in 58% of cases,"
		"followed by Candida parapsilosis (15%), Candida glabrata (13%), Candida"
		"tropicalis (6%). Septic shock occurred in 95 patients. Crude mortality was 35%,"
		"the highest in C. tropicalis fungaemia (44%), the elderly (64%) and solid tumour"
		cancer patients (43%). Intravascular catheter removal was associated with higher
		survival rate (71 vs. 47%). This survey underscores the importance of candidaemia
		in hospital settings.

TI	-	Use of electrophoretic karyotyping in the evaluation of Candida infections in a
		neonatal intensive-care unit.
PG	-	32-7
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a possible common-source outbreak of Candida infections in
		the neonatal intensive-care unit. Systemic Candida infections increased from 6 to
		"11 cases (0.71 to 1.34 per 1,000 patient-days). In addition, Candida parapsilosis"
		infections increased from 1 in 1992 to 10 in 1993. DESIGN AND SETTING:
		"Tertiary-care, teaching, pediatric institution with a 40-bed neonatal"
		"intensive-care unit (NICU). Clinical characteristics, associated conditions, and"
		antimicrobial therapy were obtained from the medical records of all NICU patients
		with positive blood cultures for Candida during 1992 and 1993. Nineteen Candida
		isolates from 15 infants were studied retrospectively using contour-clamped
		homogeneous electric-field (CHEF) electrophoresis. RESULTS: CHEF revealed eight
		karyotypes of C parapsilosis. Five isolates recovered from four patients shared
		one karyotype. The remaining isolates from seven infants all had distinctly
		different karyotypes. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence was insufficient to implicate a
		"single source of infection, even though four patients in the same unit had"
		"identical strain types. However, identical strains of C parapsilosis were"
		"associated geographically, suggesting that nosocomial acquisition of C"
		parapsilosis through indirect patient contact in the NICU was possible. The CHEF
		technique yields unique patterns that may be used to delineate clinical isolates
		and to study the molecular epidemiology of candidal infections.

AB	-	A 70-year-old man with a medical history of diabetes mellitus presented to a
		local clinic with seven days history of right flank pain and fever. Because there
		"was no symptomatic improvement after one-week antibiotic administration,"
		abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomographic scans were performed to show
		"mass lesions in the right hydropelvis, and he was transferred to our hospital."
		Retrograde pyelography revealed a retrocaval ureter and a ureteral stent was
		"indwelt. After the symptoms improved, the lesions were removed by percutaneous"
		nephrostomy and fungal balls were diagnosed as Candida parapsilosis after
		culture. After intermittent one-week irrigation of the renal pelvis with normal
		"saline, the nephrostomy tube was removed. In six-month follow-up, mild"
		"hydronephrosis remains without fungal ball recurrence. To the best our knowledge,"
		there has been no case report of Candida parapsilosis fungal balls in the urinary
		tract.

TI	-	Molecular identification of Candida parapsilosis from crop mucosa in a cockatiel.
PG	-	437-9
AB	-	"A 2-month-old cockatiel was evaluated for diarrhea, dyspnea, and death."
		Histologic examination of lesions in the crop mucosa revealed hyperkeratosis and
		the presence of blastoconidia and hyphae. Positive immunohistochemical staining
		of the organisms was achieved with an antibody directed against Candida spp.
		Polymerase chain reaction amplification of DNA from crop lesion material with
		internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) primers yielded fragments of approximately
		"300 bp, which demonstrated 95% DNA homology with the corresponding sequence from"
		a strain of Candida parapsilosis deposited in the GenBank data base. The Candida
		species in the lesion of the crop mucosa was therefore identified by DNA sequence
		analysis as C. parapsilosis.

TI	-	Staged reimplantation of total knee arthroplasty after Candida infection.
PG	-	529-32
AB	-	Prosthetic joint infection with Candida is uncommon. Only 28 cases have been
		reported in the English literature. Successful reimplantation after eradication
		of Candida infection has been reported in 3 hip joints and only 1 knee. We
		present the case of a 68-year-old woman with chronic Candida parapsilosis
		"infection of a prosthetic knee joint. Removal of the prosthesis, thorough"
		"débridement, and antifungal therapy treated the infection successfully."
		Antifungal therapy included 6 weeks of parenteral administration of fluconazole
		followed by 4 weeks of oral fluconazole. The involved knee joint was reimplanted
		3 months after initial treatment. The prosthetic joint was pain free and
		functioned satisfactorily during the ensuing 4 years. No recurrence of infection
		was noted. The principle in treating Candida prosthetic infection generally has
		"been the same as that of bacterial prosthetic infection. In chronic cases,"
		"removal of implants, thorough débridement, and effective antifungal therapy are"
		mandatory for the eradication of infection. Reimplantation of the prosthesis can
		be performed successfully in a staged surgical procedure with the interval
		between the 2 stages shortened to 3 months.

TI	-	[Oral itraconazole for treatment of a candida parapsilosis endophthalmitis case].
PG	-	181-4
AB	-	CLINICAL CASE: A case of exogenous Candida parapsilosis endophthalmitis was
		treated first with oral fluconazol and later with intravenous Anfotericin without
		success. A subsequent therapy using topical fluconazole and oral itraconazole
		appeared to be effective in controlled the infection. DISCUSSION: Current
		elective treatment for fungal endophthalmitis is Anfotericine B i.v. An
		"alternative therapy are the azoles. In the reported case itraconazole was used,"
		although its intraocular penetration and effectiveness have not yet been
		satisfactorily demonstrated. The clinical response in this case leads to the
		possibility that intraocular oral itraconazole penetration can be sufficient to
		control infection in cases where the causal fungi is sensitive.

		"CAPD was necessary, and acceptable flucytosine levels were obtained in the serum"
		and dialysate. This case and information available in the literature suggest that
		Candida peritonitis can be treated effectively with antimicrobial agents that are
		"well tolerated by the patient, and removal of the dialysis catheter is not always"
		necessary for cure.

PG	-	99-102
LID	-	10.1111/1756-185X.12546 [doi]
AB	-	The presence of the lupus erythematosus (LE) phenomenon has been generally
		conceptualized as an in vitro occurrence where numerous damaged cells are present
		and substantial nucleo-phagocytosis has occurred. In systemic lupus erythematosus
		"(SLE), the positive LE cell phenomenon has been shown to indicate active disease"
		with major organ involvement which potentially warrants prompt and heavy
		immunosuppressive therapy. We report a 36-year-old woman with a known history of
		"SLE who presented with fever, left knee effusion, polyserositis, pancytopenia,"
		low complement and high anti-dsDNA antibody levels whose immunosuppressive
		"treatment was escalated in view of the clinically and serologically active SLE,"
		accompanied by the presence of LE cells in her inflammatory yet sterile left knee
		"synovial fluid. Within 3 days of immunosuppressant escalation, her ascites"
		worsened. While microscopic examination of the ascitic fluid also revealed LE
		"cells, culture of the ascitic fluid later grew Candida parapsilosis. The patient"
		subsequently responded to the addition of anti-fungal therapy into her augmented
		immunosuppressive regime. Coexistence of the LE cell phenomenon and infection in
		SLE patients has hitherto not been described. This case illustrates that
		infection remains to be meticulously excluded despite the presence of the LE
		phenomenon in the context of clinically and serologically active SLE.

		case report.
PG	-	701-3
AB	-	A patient with acute cholecystitis due to Candida albicans and Candida
		parapsilosis was treated with a percutaneous cholecystostomy and daily
		intravenous fluconazole. Fluconazole levels in serum and bile were measured by
		gas chromatography. Fluconazole levels in the bile were equal to those in the
		blood for the first 8 hours after a dose and were slightly higher than serum
		levels after that. Bile levels after an oral dose of fluconazole were 15% higher
		than levels achieved after intravenous administration of the drug. The infection
		was cured after 2 weeks of treatment. This experience suggests that sufficient
		fluconazole is excreted in the bile to be effective for treatment of biliary
		infections due to susceptible yeasts.

PG	-	81-2
AB	-	A patient with recurrent fungal endocarditis on prosthetic mitral valve is
		presented. Candida parapsilosis was the causative agent. The patient was treated
		medically with conventional amphotericin during the first episode. When the
		"disease recurred conventional amphotericin B was used again, but had to be"
		stopped because of severe side effects. Treatment was continued with amphotericin
		"B colloidal dispersion, followed by fluconazole for 8 months. The patient is"
		healthy 16 months after discontinuation of fluconazole. Medical treatment of
		fungal endocarditis on prosthetic valves can be successful in selected cases.

TI	-	Candida parapsilosis endocarditis that emerged 2 years after abdominal surgery.
PG	-	149-52
AB	-	A 22-year-old man was hospitalized after 3 months of persistent fever and
		malaise. He had undergone abdominal surgery 24 months before admission.
		Echocardiography demonstrated two mobile pedunculated masses in the right
		ventricle. Multiple blood cultures were positive for Candida parapsilosis. After
		"4 weeks of miconazole treatment, the two masses were excised via a right"
		atriotomy incision and the transtricuspid value approach. Histological
		examination revealed that they were fungal vegetation. Antifungal agents were
		continued for 1 year after surgery. The patient has remained well with no further
		symptoms for 3 years. This case suggests the necessity for careful evaluation of
		past history to avoid diagnostic delay in fungal endocarditis.

AB	-	Pancreatic necrosis infection is the most common complication affecting mortality
		of severe acute pancreatitis (death rate 80%). Bacterial infections particularly
		with coliforms or anaerobes account for the majority of cases of infected
		necrosis. Fungal pancreatic infections with Candida species are rare and often
		nosocomial. We report herein the first case of pancreatic necrosis infection with
		Candida parapsilosis associated with fungemia confirmed by molecular typing.

AB	-	Infective endocarditis is still a very serious disease whose prognosis has
		"improved in recent years, even though advanced technologies have brought a"
		greater number of cases attributable to increased growth of fungi in more
		virulent forms. We describe a case of endocarditis caused by Candida parapsilosis
		on a previously healthy aortic valve in a man who had received prolonged
		intravenous antibiotic treatment a few months earlier. The initial presentation
		included acute arterial ischaemia of the lower limbs. The diagnosis of
		endocarditis was then confirmed by echocardiography and microbiology. Specific
		"antifungal therapy was started, and embolectomy and valve replacement were"
		"performed; however, the infection could not be controlled and the patient died a"
		few days later.

		bone marrow transplantation-related fungemia.
PG	-	333-4
AB	-	A case of Candida parapsilosis endocarditis observed 16 months after BMT is
		"reported. The patient, a 35-year-old female with CML, suffered from Candida"
		parapsilosis fungemia on day +22 after BMT. In spite of treatment with
		"amphotericin B, fluconazole and catheter withdrawal, the same yeast was isolated"
		> 1 year later from a vegetation on an old rheumatic mitral valve. Although the
		"patient remained in complete cytogenetical and hematological remission, in vitro"
		tests showed reduced phagocytic and chemotactic capacity of neutrophils and
		monocytes. This case stresses the need of prolonged therapy for patients with
		candidemia after BMT.

		malignancies.
PG	-	249-51
AB	-	"From March, 1990 to February, 1992, we administered fluconazole as antifungal"
		prophylaxis at doses of 3-5 mg/kg/day to 40 patients with prolonged and severe
		neutropenia following intensive chemotherapy. Fungemia was observed in 3 out 40
		"patients, and all three of them were due to Candida non-albicans strains: two"
		Candida parapsilosis and one Candida guilliermondi. In vitro sensitivity tests
		showed that all three isolated strains were susceptible to amphotericin. In one
		"case, Candida guilliermondi was tested for sensitivity to fluconazole and found"
		to be resistant. We conclude that fluconazole prophylaxis proved effective in
		"preventing Candida albicans infections, but it could also contribute to the"
		emergence of Candida non-albicans strains. It might be possible that fluconazole
		at higher doses could prevent the selection of less susceptible Candida strains.

PG	-	366-9
AB	-	We present the case of a 58-year-old diabetic renal transplant patient who
		"developed a left jugular foramen syndrome, secondary to an ipsilateral"
		staphylococcal malignant (necrotizing) otitis externa. This followed a protracted
		episode of uncomplicated otitis externa with no evidence of bone involvement on
		computed tomography (CT) scanning. Cyclosporin-induced hypertrichosis (excess
		hair growth) in his external auditory canal contributed greatly to the initial
		difficulty in managing his otitis externa. Following an initial successful
		treatment with prolonged intravenous antibiotics the patient relapsed with a
		secondary infection in the same anatomical site due to Candida parapsilosis.
		"Despite further intensive treatment including antimicrobials, a subtotal"
		petrosectomy and hyperbaric oxygen therapy he eventually succumbed to his
		disease.

PG	-	543-5
AB	-	"Infectious crystalline keratopathy is a chronic infection of the cornea,"
		characterized by branching intrastromal opacities without inflammation. These
		"changes are usually due to accumulations of bacterial colonies, most commonly"
		"viridans streptococci, but this entity has previously been reported in"
		association with Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis. We present the case of
		a 66-year-old man who had previously undergone penetrating keratoplasty and
		developed infectious crystalline keratopathy due to Candida parapsilosis.
		Histopathology showed interlamellar accumulations of viable yeasts with no
		inflammation. Chronic topical corticosteroid use in this patient produced
		"relative immunosuppression, allowing for the infection by Candida parapsilosis"
		and the lack of inflammation in the cornea. The spectrum of causative organisms
		"in infectious crystalline keratopathy continues to grow, emphasizing the need for"
		laboratory evaluation in the management of this disorder.

AB	-	Episodes of candida infection at a teaching hospital were investigated. During a
		"3-year period from 1998 to 2000, there were 53 cases of candidaemia. Candida"
		"albicans (64.2 %) was the most common causative species, followed by Candida"
		glabrata (17.0 %) and Candida parapsilosis (15.1 %). Molecular analysis of a
		cluster of eight infections from a single unit was performed using Southern
		blotting with Ca3 probe hybridization. This showed that the patients were each
		"infected by unrelated strains of C. albicans. On occasion, isolates were found to"
		"be closely related within individual patients. Following Southern blot analysis,"
		it was concluded that the infections were not part of an outbreak caused by a
		"single, epidemic strain."

PG	-	1231-4
AB	-	This paper describes a case of Candida Parapsilosis endocarditis in a patient
		with a mitral valve prosthesis implanted two years previously. This history
		started with a cerebrovascular accident associated with pyrexia. A complex
		medico-surgical therapeutic approach controlled the infection. This consisted of
		"systemic and local (immersion of the prosthesis) antifungal therapy, bathing the"
		left heart chambers in 5 p. 100 iodine solution and two valve replacements at 8
		months intervals. The second surgery was not related to recurrence of the candida
		infection but to a perivalvular leak attributed to the insertion of the
		prosthesis into tissues inflamed by recent infection. Despite the improvement in
		"the prognosis of fungal infection due to an early surgical approach, it is still"
		"essential to try and prevent the disease, the mortality rate still being over 80"
		p. 100. It is essential to be very careful when using intravenous catheters and
		aerosols; the indications of antibiotherapy must also be respected.

PG	-	335-8
AB	-	Most of the increasing numbers of cases of Candida endocarditis have developed
		after cardiac surgery. We report a case of Candida parapsilosis endocarditis
		after mitral valve replacement in a patient with no predisposing factors. In this
		report we mainly examined the pathological findings in this patient with
		"postmortem examination. A woman, age 55, underwent valve replacement with a"
		Björk-Shiley prosthesis for mitral stenosis. The spike fever occurred on the 22nd
		postoperative day and Candida parapsilosis was cultured from the blood. On the
		"76th day, a conscious disturbance with the right side hemiplegia was experienced."
		A CT scan revealed massive hemorrhagic infarction. Despite the intensive care the
		patient died of cerebral damage. Pathologic findings showed that the vegetation
		in the major orifice of the Björk-Shiley valve was composed of both necrotic
		"debris and tissue, with Candida organisms being scattered throughout the"
		interstices. Additionally there were also multiple myocardial abscesses with
		necrotic tissue.

PG	-	74-7
AB	-	A 42 years old female was admitted for evaluation of unrelenting fever and
		"dyspnea on exertion in March, 1991. The patient had a VSD closure in 1968. After"
		"admission, serial blood cultures were found to be positive for Candida"
		Parapsilosis and a massive vegetation on the pulmonary valve was demonstrated by
		echocardiography. Chest X-ray disclosed a wedge-shaped density in the right
		middle lung lobe that was a compatible finding with pulmonary infarction. At
		"surgery, performed 3 days later the admission, pulmonary valve was entirely"
		resected without replacing it with prosthesis. Antifungal treatment was
		intensively given afterwards. Her postoperative course was without event and she
		was sent home on the 51st postoperative day. Right heart catheterization done two
		"years surgery, revealed the pulmonary vascular resistance was 216 dynes sec cm-5."
		We anticipate that this degree of pulmonary vascular resistance will allow the
		patient enough to do well without needing valve prosthesis in the near future.

AB	-	Chromobacterium violaceum sepsis is extremely rare and usually fatal. A very few
		"cases of C. violaceum infection have been reported from Africa, but never from"
		"South Africa. As far as could be ascertained, this infection has never been"
		reported in a patient with leukaemia. We describe what we believe to be the first
		"such case of C. violaceum sepsis, in a 16-year-old female patient with acute"
		"biphenotypic leukaemia, which developed during the neutropenic phase after"
		intensive chemotherapy. The infection was due to a non-pigmented strain of C.
		violaceum and was associated with a co-infection with Candida parapsilosis; both
		"were successfully treated using broad-spectrum antibiotics, antifungals and"
		removal of a Hickman line.

PG	-	1158-62
LID	-	10.1007/s12098-014-1343-5 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk factors for developing candida infections in
		pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). METHODS: The present study was conducted as
		a case-control study and included the population of patients who were admitted to
		PICU during the period of March 2010-March 2011. RESULTS: During the study
		"period, a total of 57 patients in PICU had candidemia, 4 cases were excluded due"
		to their PICU stay less than 48 h and one due to the insufficient data. The most
		"commonly isolated Candida species was C. albicans, followed by C. parapsilosis."
		The median duration of hospitalization in PICU was higher (22.0 d) in candidemia
		patients compared to control group (13.5 d) (p = 0.037). The patients with
		"candidemia had higher rates of presence of mechanical ventilation, presence of"
		"central venous catheter, and being under total parenteral nutrition; compared to"
		"the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The longer PICU durations, mechanical"
		"ventilation, central venous catheter, total parenteral nutrition were the"
		associated factors. Although trials for predicitive models or scoring systems for
		development of candidemia have been performed; more future studies were required
		for practical usage in clinics settings in order to prevent candidemia.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Neonatal sepsis is one of the leading causes of death in this
		population and is related to gestational and perinatal factors as well as factors
		"inherent in the newborn. OBJECTIVE: To associate perinatal, neonatal, and"
		microbiological factors to sepsis mortality. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Retrospective
		ca se-control study of hospitalized newborns with confirmed neonatal sepsis
		"through blood cultures, from 2013 to 2019. Cases were defined as those patients"
		with confirmed sepsis that presented a fa tal outcome and controls as those
		newborns with confirmed sepsis without a fatal outcome. Cases and controls were
		"compared regarding maternal, perinatal, neonatal, and microbiological factors for"
		quantitative variables in order to identify the trend and concentration of the
		variables studied. RESULTS: Eleven cases were identified and three controls were
		"randomly assigned to each case, stra tified by gestational age groups. The median"
		"birth weight and gestational age were 1,004 grams and 28 weeks, respectively."
		"Escherichia coli was identified in 21% of the patients, Candida parapsilosis in"
		"16%, and Staphylococcus aureus in 14%. There was a statistically significant"
		"association between sepsis lethality and vaginal delivery (P = 0.023), infection"
		"before 7 days of life (P = 0.025), and Can dida parapsilosis infection (P ="
		0.049). The multivariate analysis determined a statistically significant
		association between neonatal sepsis lethality and vaginal delivery and
		microbiological identification of Candida parapsilosis. CONCLUSION: Neonatal
		"sepsis lethality was more frequent in the group of extremely preterm infants,"
		"newborns withhistory of vaginal delivery, early microbiological isolation, and t"
		infection with Candida parapsilosis.

AB	-	"Rates of invasive fungal infection are highest among neonates, especially those"
		of low birthweight. This study aimed to describe the current epidemiology of
		invasive neonatal fungal infections in a UK neonatal infection surveillance
		network. From 2004 to 2010 prospective multicentre surveillance was conducted by
		14 neonatal units using a web-based database. Clinicians then completed a
		standardized pro forma for each positive fungal blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid
		culture. The overall incidence was 2.4/1000 neonatal unit admissions and was
		"highest among babies <1000 g (extreme low birthweight, 18.8/1000). Only five"
		infants (6%) were >1500 g. The majority of infections were caused by Candida
		albicans (59; 69%) and Candida parapsilosis (17; 20%); 33% of infants had
		received antifungal prophylaxis. Known risk factors (use of central venous
		"catheter, parenteral nutrition, previous antibiotic use) were common among cases."
		The attributable case fatality rate was 21% (18/84). Extreme low birthweight
		infants remain at highest risk of invasive fungal infection and prophylaxis
		should be particularly considered for this group. The number needing to receive
		"prophylaxis to prevent one case varies significantly among units, hence"
		unit-specific decisions are required. Further research is still needed into the
		optimal empiric and therapeutic strategies.

AB	-	The frequency of breakthrough invasive fungal diseases (IFDs) during echinocandin
		therapy is unclear. We retrospectively analyzed 534 hematologic patients treated
		"with echinocandin (caspofungin, N = 55; micafungin, N = 306; anidulafungin,"
		"N = 173). Four proven IFDs were found, caused by Candida parapsilosis (N = 2), C."
		"parapsilosis and Candida glabrata (N = 1), and Fusarium species (N = 1). Four"
		"cases of possible IFDs were observed, all showing pulmonary infection. One case"
		showed features suggestive of hepatosplenic candidiasis. Six of these eight cases
		had previously received the purine analog clofarabine. Breakthrough IFD during
		"echinocandin treatment occurred infrequently (1.5 %), caused predominantly by"
		Candida species. Clofarabine usage was an important risk factor.

AB	-	"OBJECTIVE: A one-year prospective, observational study was conducted in the west"
		"of France, to evaluate the epidemiology of candidemia. METHOD: During the year"
		"2004, each patient with at least one blood culture yielding Candida sp. was"
		"included. For each episode of candidemia, mycological, demographical, clinical,"
		"and therapeutic data, as well as outcome, were collected. RESULTS: One hundred"
		"and ninety-three strains of Candida sp. were isolated in 186 patients, Candida"
		"albicans accounting for 54.9%, Candida glabrata for 18.7%, Candida parapsilosis"
		"for 12.9%, Candida tropicalis for 4.7% and Candida krusei for 4.1% of these"
		isolates. A percentage of 84% of the Candida isolates were fully susceptible to
		fluconazole in vitro. Dose-dependent susceptibility or resistance to fluconazole
		"was detected in more than one third of the Candida glabrata strains, of which 36%"
		"were also resistant to voriconazole. Two-thirds of the patients were males, and"
		the mean age was 61.5 years. A percentage of 37% of patients were hospitalized in
		intensive care units. The main predisposing factors for candidemia were
		"broad-spectrum antibiotics (75.8%), central venous catheter (72.6%), cancer or"
		"hematologic malignancy (47.3%), recent surgery (42.5%), total parenteral"
		nutrition (37.6%). One hundred and fifty-four patients were treated with
		"antifungal therapy, two-thirds of whom received fluconazole as first-line agent."
		"Mortality was 49% overall, and was significantly higher in case of septic shock,"
		"advanced age, and absence of catheter removal."

AB	-	BACKGROUND Candida albicans is the principal human fungal opportunistic organism
		commonly detected in the gastrointestinal and genitourinary systems. Five species
		"of candida (Glabrata, Tropicalis, Albicans, Parapsilosis, and Kruzei) are"
		"responsible for most cases of invasive candidiasis or candidemia, which is a"
		"growing public health concern due to the increasing complexity of patients,"
		leading to a high fatality rate. CASE REPORT We report an extremely rare case of
		"candida pericarditis due to esophagopericardial fistula in a young, heavy,"
		"alcoholic adult diagnosed by culture of the drained pericardial fluid, which"
		showed a growth of Candida albicans. CONCLUSIONS We highlight the first case of
		candida pericarditis in immunocompetent adult successfully treated by
		pericardiocentesis and oral fluconazole.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive candidiasis (IC) is the most common cause of invasive fungal
		infections. Identification of risk factors for such infection may help in the
		empirical therapeutic decision-making process. We conducted this study to
		characterize the clinical epidemiology of such infection and to differentiate
		risk factors between Candida albicans and Candida non-albicans species. METHODS:
		"We retrospectively evaluated patients with IC from 2011 to 2013. Clinical data,"
		"antibiotic therapy, underlying condition, and invasive procedures were analyzed"
		and compared between C. albicans and C. non-albicans species. RESULTS: C.
		albicans was the most frequently isolated Candida species (48.6% of all IC
		"patients), although C. non-albicans spp. were more commonly isolated overall. C."
		"albicans, Candida tropicalis, and Candida parapsilosis have a high susceptibility"
		"rate to all antifungal agents (>90%), whereas Candida glabrata showed decreased"
		susceptibility to fluconazole and itraconazole. Amphotericin B demonstrated
		excellent antifungal activity against all Candida species. Univariate analyses
		showed that IC patients with C. albicans had a higher ratio of older age
		"(p = 0.008), solid tumor (p = 0.029), and hypoproteinemia (p = 0.019), whereas"
		those with C. non-albicans spp. had a higher ratio of hospital length of stay
		"(p = 0.005), usage of corticosteroids (p = 0.011), duration on corticosteroids"
		"(p = 0.005), chemotherapy (p = 0.022), hematologic malignancy (p = 0.039),"
		"neutropenia (p = 0.030), and usage of glycopeptides (p = 0.002). Multivariate"
		analyses showed that a significant predictor of IC due to C. albicans was
		"hypoproteinemia [odds ratio (95% confidence interval) = 2.133 (1.164-3.908),"
		p = 0.014]. CONCLUSION: C. albicans was the most frequently isolated Candida
		species. The risk factors between C. albicans and C. non-albicans species are
		different.

AB	-	"This study was planned to determine the risk factors of candidemia, and the most"
		common Candida species causing bloodstream infections. A case-control study which
		included adult patients was conducted over a 1-year period at tertiary-care
		educational hospitals in Turkey. A total of 83 candidemia episodes were
		identified during the study period. Candida albicans was the most common species
		recovered (45.8%) followed by Candida tropicalis (24.1%) Candida parapsilosis
		(14.5%) and Candida glabrata which was isolated from only four (4.8%) patients.
		Presence of a urethral catheter (odds ratio [OR] 2.38; 95% confidence interval
		"[CI] 1.09-5.19; P = 0.02), previous use of antibiotics (OR 2.61; 95% CI"
		"1.05-6.46; P = 0.03), RBC transfusions (OR 2.14; 95% CI 1.16-3.94; P = 0.01) and"
		parenteral nutrition (OR 4.44; 95% CI 2.43-8.11; P < 0.01) were found as
		independent risk factors for candidemia. TPN (Total Parenteral Nutrition) was an
		independent risk factor for both C. albicans and non-Candida albicans Candida
		species (P < 0.001). Most of the risk factors were invasive procedures and former
		medications. We conclude that a great number of candidemia cases are preventable
		by means of reduction of unnecessary invasive procedures and the use of
		antimicrobials.

		literature review.
PG	-	748-53
AB	-	"PURPOSE: To report the efficacy of topical application of a new antifungal agent,"
		"micafungin (MCFG), in the treatment of yeast-related corneal ulcers. DESIGN:"
		Noncomparative interventional case reports. PARTICIPANTS: Three patients with
		yeast-related corneal ulcer after keratoplasty recalcitrant to conventional
		antifungal treatment for 4 weeks were recruited in this study. METHODS: Topical
		0.1% antifungal MCFG eye drops were applied in 3 patients with yeast-related
		corneal ulcer every hour while awake until epithelialization. After
		"epithelialization, the frequency of eye drops was reduced to 5 times a day. MCFG"
		eye drops were discontinued 1 month after the disappearance of stromal
		infiltration in each case. The patients underwent best corrected visual acuity
		"(BCVA) measurements, slit-lamp examination, fluorescein-dye staining, and"
		anterior segment photography. Corneal scrapings and cultures of surgical
		"materials were also performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in ulcer size,"
		"stromal infiltration, fluorescein dye staining, and BCVA were looked for."
		RESULTS: All corneal ulcers epithelialized within 14 days after commencement of
		application of 0.1% MCFG eye drops. Yeasts were detected from corneal smears in
		all eyes. Two cases revealed positive culture isolates for Candida albicans and
		Candida parapsilosis. No recurrence of fungal keratitis was observed in any of
		the cases throughout the follow-up periods. CONCLUSION: Topical 0.1% MCFG eye
		drops seem to be an effective and a promising option in the treatment of
		refractory yeast-related corneal ulcers.

		the lower limbs in 33%-75% of cases. Although the prognosis of patients with
		"fungal endocarditis has improved somewhat over recent years, it remains poor,"
		especially when the disease is associated with peripheral arterial embolization.
		We report herein our experience of treating a patient in whom occlusion of the

LID	-	10.1055/s-0036-1586102 [doi]
AB	-	Objective This report discusses the role of both congenital and acquired risk
		factors in the pathogenesis of portal vein thrombosis (PVT). Study Design We
		describe the clinical management and treatment of PVT in a preterm newborn with a
		homozygous mutation of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and
		plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) genes and sepsis by Candida
		parapsilosis. Results Although literature data suggest a minor role of genetic
		"factors in thrombophilia in the case of only one mutation, we hypothesize that"
		combined thrombophilic genetic defects may have a cumulative effect and
		significantly increase the thrombotic risk. Conclusion It could be appropriate to
		include more detailed analyses of procoagulant and fibrinolytic factors in the
		"diagnostic workup of neonatal thrombosis, also through the investigation of"
		genetic polymorphisms. The anticoagulant therapy and the removal of concurrent
		risk factors remain basic steps for the adequate management and prevention of
		complications.

AB	-	"OBJECTIVE: In this study, we seek to determine independent risk factors of"
		invasive fungal infection (IFI) in neonatal infants. STUDY DESIGN: The medical
		charts of 5135 neonatal intensive care unit admissions in the past 7 years
		between January 2004 and December 2010 were reviewed and 45 neonates were found
		"with IFI. Two controls, matched by gestational age, birth weight category,"
		"admission date, ward, hospital stay, and admission age, were selected for each"
		case. RESULTS: Candida parapsilosis was the leading causative pathogen of IFI and
		was isolated in 33.3% of the patients. The mortality rate of the case group was
		8.9% versus 1.1% in controls (p < 0.05). Multivariable logistic regression
		"modeling defined intubation > 6 days (71.1%), use of peripherally inserted"
		"central venous catheter (68.8%), use of third-generation cephalosporin (53.3%),"
		"any prior abdominal surgeries (20.0%), and neutropenia during first week of life"
		< 1.5 · 109/L (20.0%) as exposures significantly associated with case status.
		CONCLUSIONS: The predominant factors identified with IFI were third-generation
		"cephalosporin use, peripherally inserted central venous catheter use, intubation"
		"> 6 days, any prior abdominal surgery, and neutropenia during first week of life"
		< 1.5 · 109/L.

TI	-	Epidemiology of candidemia in neonatal intensive care units: a persistent public
		health problem.
PG	-	282-7
LID	-	10.7416/ai.2016.2107 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candidemia has become an increasingly important problem in infants
		hospitalized in the Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs). Candida species are
		the third most common agents of late-onset infections in critically ill neonates
		and they are associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. In this study we
		evaluated the epidemiology of Candida bloodstream infections in the NICU of an
		Italian university hospital during a 15-year period. Our specific aims were to
		analyze the change in species distribution and the vitro susceptibility of these
		yeasts to fluconazole (FCZ) and amphotericin B (AmB). METHODS: A retrospective
		"study of candidemia in the NICU of a university hospital in southern Italy,"
		covering the years 2000-2014 was carried out. The isolates were identified using
		the VITEK2 yeast identification system and antifungal susceptibility was
		determined using the E-test method. RESULTS: Among the 57 patients with confirmed
		"candidemia, 60% were males (n = 34 cases) and 82% (n = 47) had a gestational age"
		of 24-32 weeks. Twenty-seven neonates (47%) had a very low birth weight (<1500
		"g), 20 (35%) an extremely low birth weight (<1000 g), and 10 (18%) a low birth"
		weight (<2500 g). The most important potential risk factors were the placement of
		"a central venous catheter, total parenteral nutrition, and endotracheal"
		"intubation (100%, each). Candida albicans was the most frequent yeast (47%),"
		followed by Candida parapsilosis (44%). The proportion of Candida non-albicans
		"increased slightly, from 46% in 2000-2004 to 71% in 2010-2014 (χ2 test for trend,"
		p = 0.030). All isolates were susceptible to FCZ and AmB. CONCLUSIONS: The
		detection in this epidemiologic study of an increase in Candida non-albicans
		highlights the importance of correct species-level identification in the rapid
		diagnosis for an efficient treatment of candidemia. Knowledge of the local
		epidemiological trends in Candida species isolated in blood cultures will
		facilitate therapeutic decision-making.

		(2003-2007).
PG	-	1100-9
LID	-	10.1002/lt.23467 [doi]
AB	-	Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are associated with a high mortality rate for
		liver transplantation (LT) recipients. To study the incidence of and risk factors
		"for IFIs in LT recipients and the associated mortality rates, we retrospectively"
		reviewed the records of first-time deceased donor LT recipients (January 2003 to
		December 2007). The incidence of IFIs was 12%. Non-albicans Candida species
		accounted for 55% of IFIs; 50% of these IFIs were Candida parapsilosis. Only 43%
		of Candida isolates were fluconazole-susceptible (minimum inhibitory
		"concentration ≤ 8 μ/mL). All C. parapsilosis isolates were fluconazole-resistant,"
		and this coincided with a surge of these isolates during a peak period of LT.
		Factors associated with IFIs included a creatinine level > 2 mg/mL [hazard ratio
		"(OR) = 2.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.2-5.0, P = 0.01], a Model for"
		"End-Stage Liver Disease score > 25 (OR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.2-4.9, P = 0.02),"
		"pretransplant fungal colonization (OR = 7.0, 95% CI = 3.2-15.3, P < 0.001), and a"
		"daily prophylactic fluconazole dosage < 200 mg (OR = 2.8, 95% CI = 1.1-7.4, P ="
		"0.03). According to a multivariate analysis, only pretransplant fungal"
		"colonization was associated with IFIs (OR = 7.8, 95% CI = 3.9-16.2, P < 0.001)."
		"The 1-year patient survival rates with and without IFIs were 41% and 80%,"
		"respectively, and the survival rates with C. parapsilosis, other non-albicans"
		"Candida, and Candida albicans IFIs were 28%, 50%, and 75%, respectively. In"
		"conclusion, IFIs after LT (especially non-albicans Candida species and"
		fluconazole-resistant C. parapsilosis) were associated with reduced survival. The
		risk factors highlight the importance of pretransplant risk assessments. The
		identification of pretransplant fungal colonization may allow for risk
		"modifications before or at the time of LT. Additionally, the number of LT"
		procedures and prophylactic strategies may affect institutional outbreaks of
		resistant Candida strains.

AB	-	The epidemiology of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) after liver transplantation
		(LT) is continuing to evolve in the current era of antifungal prophylactic
		therapy. This multicenter retrospective cohort study aimed to evaluate the
		"epidemiology, risk factors, and outcomes of IFIs among LT recipients in the"
		current era.We analyzed a total of 482 LT recipients aged 18 years and older who
		were admitted to 3 tertiary hospitals in Korea between January 2009 and February
		2012.Twenty-four episodes of IFIs occurred in 23 patients (4.77%; 23/482). Of
		"these episodes, 20 were proven cases and 4 were probable cases according to"
		"EORTC/MSG criteria. Among these cases, IFI developed within 30 days of"
		"transplantation in 47.8% of recipients, from 31 to 180 days in 34.8% of"
		"recipients, and from 181 to 365 days in 17.4% of recipients. The most common"
		"isolates were Candida species (n = 12, 52.2%; Candida albicans, 6 cases; Candida"
		"tropicalis, 1 case; Candida glabrata, 1 case; Candida parapsilosis, 1 case; and"
		"unspecified Candida species, 1 case) and Aspergillus species (n = 7, 30.4%). The"
		mortality in patients with IFIs was significantly higher than that in patients
		"without IFIs (47.83% [11/23] vs 7.18% [33/459], P < .001). The incidence of"
		"late-onset IFIs is increasing in the antifungal prophylactic era, and"
		fluconazole-resistant non-albicans Candida species have not yet emerged in Korea.

		"candidemia group, median (1→3)-β-D-glucan, mannan antigen, and anti-mannan"
		"antibody levels were 427 pg/ml, 190 pg/ml, and 18.6 antibody units (AU)/ml,"
		respectively. All three parameters were significantly elevated in patients with

		Cand-Tec Candida antigen. The low mannan antigen sensitivity was in part caused
		"by Candida parapsilosis and Candida guilliermondii fungemias, which were not"
		detected by the Platelia Candida Ag Plus assay. When the cutoff was lowered from
		"125 pg/ml to 50 pg/ml, mannan antigen sensitivity increased to 69.6% without"
		"severely affecting the specificity (93.5%). Contrary to recently published data,"
		"superficial candidiasis was not associated with elevated mannan antigen levels,"
		not even after the cutoff was lowered. Combining procalcitonin (PCT) with
		(1→3)-β-D-glucan to increase specificity provided a limited advantage because the
		benefit of the combination did not outweigh the loss of sensitivity. Our results
		demonstrate that the Cand-Tec Candida antigen and the mannan antigen plus
		anti-mannan antibody measurements have unacceptably low sensitivity or
		"specificity. Of the four tests compared, (1→3)-β-D-glucan and mannan antigen are"
		"the superior biomarkers, depending on whether a sensitivity-driven or"
		specificity-driven approach is used.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Treatment of psoriatic nail disease is challenging, and dystrophic"
		"psoriatic nails can get secondarily infected with fungi. METHODS: This 2-year,"
		matched case-control study was conducted at three tertiary care centers of
		"Karachi, Pakistan. Data were collected from patients with nail psoriasis as cases"
		with age- and gender-matched controls. A detailed questionnaire was filled for
		all study participants. Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) scoring tool was
		used to assess dystrophy. Fungal infection was inferred by nail clippings for
		"fungal hyphae and culture. RESULTS: Among 477 participants, 159 cases and 318"
		"controls completed the study. Their mean age was 44 years, and one-third were"
		female. Fungal culture positivity was statistically significant in cases as
		compared to the control group (P < 0.001). The most frequent species identified
		"was Candida parapsilosis in both cases and controls. Body mass index, NAPSI"
		"scoring, socioeconomic status, elevated diastolic blood pressure, smoking status"
		"psoriasis among first-degree relatives, and longstanding disease of more than"
		10 years were significant factors in univariable analysis. Multivariable logistic
		regression identified independent factors like low to middle socioeconomic
		"status, history of psoriasis in first-degree relative, current smoker, and"
		obesity. CONCLUSION: We found nearly one-third of the psoriatic patients with
		nail involvement having concomitant fungal infection. We emphasize that nail
		clipping for fungal smear and culture should be advised to those patients with
		coexisting factors found significant in our study results. This opinion can be
		incorporated in psoriasis management guidelines for improving treatment of
		psoriatic nails.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Candidaemia is an important nosocomial infection, seen frequently in"
		immunocompromised and critically ill patients and increasingly recognised in
		cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with totally implantable venous access devices
		(TIVADs). This study aims to investigate the incidence and risk factors for the
		development of TIVAD-associated candidaemia and to assess the rate of
		TIVAD-related complications in CF patients. METHODS: A 10-year retrospective
		study was carried out on adult CF patients attending a single centre.
		Complications were recorded including the incidence of candidaemia and correlated
		to clinical parameters. Complication rates were calculated based on incidence per
		1000 catheter days. Statistical analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney U test
		and Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: Fourteen cases of candidaemia were observed in
		"the CF cohort, primarily caused by Candida parapsilosis and Candida albicans."
		Candidaemia was associated with lower FEV1 (p = 0.0117) and higher frequency of
		pulmonary exacerbation (p < 0.0001). A TIVAD complication rate of 0.337/1000
		catheter days was observed in the CF cohort. Complications included venous
		"thrombosis, stenosis, and port extrusion; complications were independently"
		associated with more frequent pulmonary exacerbations (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS:
		TIVAD complications are observed more commonly in those with lower FEV1 and
		"frequent pulmonary exacerbations, suggesting that candidaemia may be related to"
		antibiotic use and furthermore can occur following invasive procedures causing
		translocation of fungal species allowing transformation from colonisation to
		pathogenic infection.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: While fungaemia caused by two or more different species of yeasts
		"(mixed fungaemia, MF) is infrequent, it might be underestimated. AIMS: This study"
		"aimed to determine the incidence of MF, clinical characteristics of the patients,"
		and antifungal susceptibility profiles of the isolates with a systematic review
		of the literature. SOURCES: Data sources were PubMed and Scopus. STUDY
		ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Studies reporting ten or more mixed fungaemia episodes.
		CONTENT: Study included MF episodes in adults between January 2000 and August
		"2018 in Hacettepe University Hospitals, Turkey. The isolation, identification and"
		antifungal susceptibility testing (AFST) of the isolates were by standard
		mycological methods. Patient data were obtained retrospectively. Literature
		search was performed using relevant keywords according to PRISMA systematic
		review guidelines. A total of 32 patients with 33 MF episodes were identified.
		"Among all fungaemia episodes, MF incidence was 3.7% (33/883). All patients had"
		"one or more underlying disorders among which solid-organ cancer (50.0%, 16/32)"
		was the most common. Overall mortality was 51.5% (17/33). The most preferred
		"antifungal agents for initial treatment were fluconazole (48.5%, 16/33) and"
		"echinocandins (39.4%, 13/33). Fluconazole susceptible-dose-dependent (S-DD) or"
		"-resistant Candida species were detected in 15 episodes, and an isolate of"
		C. parapsilosis was classified as S-DD by AFST. All Candida isolates were
		susceptible to echinocandins. Non-candida yeasts with intrinsic
		resistance/reduced susceptibility to both echinocandins and fluconazole were
		detected in two episodes. Systematic review of the literature revealed 24 studies
		that reported more than ten MF episodes. Methodology was variable. Improvement of
		detection rates was reported when chromogenic agars were used. Most studies
		underlined detection of isolates with reduced susceptibility. IMPLICATIONS:
		"Although rare, the MF rate is affected by the detection methods, which have"
		improved in recent years. Fluconazole and echinocandins were used for initial
		"treatment in accordance with the current guideline recommendations; however,"
		isolates non-susceptible to both were detected. Detection of a mixed infection
		offers an opportunity for optimum treatment.

LID	-	10.5578/mb.69837 [doi]
AB	-	Bloodstream infections due to yeast species especially Candida spp. have been
		reported to be important healthcare associated infections with high mortality and
		morbidity rates. Candidemia causes prolonged hospital stays as well as increased
		cost. In order to prevent or treat these life-threatening bloodstream infections
		"successfully, nationwide epidemiological data should be available about the"
		etiological agents of these infections. Multi-centre national epidemiological
		data on yeast bloodstream infections in Turkey is lacking. A retrospective study
		was designed and data from six different centres in Turkey between 2011 and 2016
		years were gathered and analysed for the distribution and frequency of yeast
		species in order to assist clinicians in their choice of early and appropriate
		antifungal therapy. All laboratories used automated blood culture systems for the
		isolation of blood strains. All the participating centres performed the
		identification of their own isolates by conventional methods using germ tube
		"test, morphology on corn meal agar with tween 80 and chromogenic media and the"
		"identification was confirmed by API 20C AUX, API ID 32C or matrix-assisted laser"
		desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrophotometry (MALDI-TOF MS)
		systems. The analysis of the results was performed on the basis of intensive care
		"units (ICUs), other inpatient clinics (OICs) and totally all clinics (ACs)."
		Totally 2547 yeast isolates were determined from six participating centres during
		"six years. According to the total ACs results, Candida albicans was the most"
		"prevalent species (43.1%), followed by Candida parapsilosis complex (29.1%),"
		"Candida glabrata (10.1%), Candida tropicalis (7.5%), Candida krusei (2.4%) and"
		Candida kefyr (1.6%) and the remaining (6.2%) of them consisted of other yeast
		species. The distribution of the Candida species did not show statistically
		"significant difference between the years, however the increase of C.parapsilosis"
		"complex in 2016 was statistically significant, (p= 0.02). During the study"
		"period, totally 1054 yeast isolates were obtained from the ICUs of the centres."
		C.albicans predominated with 476 (45.2%) isolates and C.parapsilosis complex
		"(28.7%), C.glabrata (10.7%) and C.tropicalis (7.3%) were the other leading"
		species in ICUs. Among 1493 isolates of the OICs of six centres participated in
		"the study, C.albicans was the most prevalent species with 622 (41.7%) isolates."
		"The other frequent species of OICs were C.parapsilosis complex (29.5%),"
		C.glabrata (9.6%) and C.tropicalis (7.6%) resembling ICU results. It can be
		concluded that C.albicans is still the leading cause of bloodstream infections in
		the six different centres located in various geographical areas of Turkey.

TI	-	Bacteraemia in a paediatric oncology unit in South Africa.
PG	-	525-31
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To identify the morbidity and mortality due to infections in a South
		"African paediatric oncology unit, and to identify risk factors associated with"
		first bacteraemic episodes in this unit. PROCEDURE: A retrospective cohort study
		"was done in a large regional referral paediatric cancer centre from 1991-1995, of"
		all consecutive patients with culture proven bacteraemia. Eighty-three oncology
		patients were studied (median age 4.0 years) in whom a total of 200 episodes of
		"bacteraemia were recorded, of which 83 first bacteraemic episodes. RESULTS: Of"
		"the 200 episodes 70% were caused by Gram-positive organisms, 20% by Gram-"
		negative organisms and 10% by fungal organisms. Organisms associated with high
		"mortality were Gram-negative organisms (Acinetobacter spp., Pseudomonas"
		"aeruginosa, Klebsiella species), and fungal organisms, (Candida parapsilosis)."
		Seventeen out of 200 episodes ended in death of the patient. In 59% of patients
		Hickman catheters were in situ. The mean incidence of catheter related
		bacteraemia's was 3.3 episodes per 1000 catheter days. Seventy percent of first
		bacteraemic episodes occurred within 50 days after placement of the catheter. The
		generalized estimation equations model revealed that more Gram-negative
		"infections occurred in the presence of a Hickman catheter (odds ratio 2.2, 95% CI"
		1.0-5.0). The presence of neutropenia and the use of parenteral nutrition were
		not associated with specific bacteraemic patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Including all
		bacteraemic episodes in this cohort study a high incidence of fungal infections
		occurred of which 64% occurred with a Hickman catheter in situ. Candida
		parapsilosis had a higher incidence than reported in other centres. Secondly
		looking at first bacteraemic episodes a high incidence of Gram-negative
		infections was observed especially in the presence of a Hickman catheter.

AB	-	"A prospective, observational study was conducted at the biggest Portuguese"
		"hospital, aiming to evaluate the epidemiology of bloodstream fungal infection."
		"During a period of 12 months (2004), all yeasts isolated from the blood cultures"
		of patients with fungaemia admitted at a university hospital of Porto were
		"collected. Demographic and clinical data, as well as haematological and"
		"biochemical profiles, were registered. Antifungal susceptibility was evaluated."
		"The incidence of fungaemia and nosocomial fungaemia were 2.7 and 2 per 1,000"
		"hospital admissions, respectively. Blood strains from 117 patients were"
		"identified. Thirty-five percent of yeast isolates were Candida albicans, followed"
		by C. parapsilosis (25.6%). The mortality rate associated with fungaemia was
		39.3%; the highest values were found in patients with C. glabrata and C.
		tropicalis infection. Seventy-five percent of the fungaemia episodes were
		"nosocomial, with 48% mortality; the main predisposing factors were parenteral"
		"nutrition, gastric protection with omeprazole, surgical drainage and the presence"
		"of central venous catheters (CVCs). Thrombocytopaenia, urinary catheter,"
		gastrointestinal pathology and nosocomial fungaemia were independently associated
		with a poor outcome. Antifungal susceptibility testing showed high fluconazole
		"resistance (15%), mostly in C. tropicalis. We observed a high incidence of"
		nosocomial fungaemia with high mortality rates. Important predisposing factors
		"were identified, deserving further investigation. Local surveillance is warranted"
		to monitor the incidence of in vitro antifungal resistance.

		"molecular identification, biofilm production and antifungal susceptibility of the"
		agents.
PG	-	725-732
LID	-	10.1093/mmy/myw030 [doi]
AB	-	This paper presents data on fungal peritonitis (FP) in patients undergoing
		"peritoneal dialysis (PD) at the University Hospital of Botucatu Medical School,"
		"São Paulo, Brazil. In a total of 422 patients, 30 developed FP, from which the"
		medical records and the fungal isolates of 23 patient cases were studied. All
		"patients presented abdominal pain, cloudy peritoneal effluent, needed"
		"hospitalization, had the catheter removed and were treated with fluconazole or"
		fluconazole plus 5-flucitosine; six of them died due to FP. Concerning the
		"agents, it was observed that Candida parapsilosis was the leading species (9/23),"
		"followed by Candida albicans (5/23), Candida orthopsilosis (4/23), Candida"
		"tropicalis (3/23), Candida guilliermondii (1/23), and Kodamaea ohmeri (1/23). All"
		"the isolates were susceptible to amphotericin B, voriconazole and caspofungin"
		whereas C. albicans isolates were susceptible to all antifungals tested.
		"Resistance to fluconazole was observed in three isolates of C. orthopsilosis, and"
		dose-dependent susceptibility to this antifungal was observed in two isolates of
		C. parapsilosis and in the K. ohmeri isolate. Biofilm production estimates were
		"high or moderate in most isolates, especially in C. albicans species, and low in"
		"C. parapsilosis species, with a marked variation among the isolates. This"
		"Brazilian study reinforces that FP in PD is caused by a diverse group of yeasts,"
		"most prevalently C. parapsilosis sensu stricto species. In addition, they present"
		"significant variation in susceptibility to antifungals and biofilm production,"
		thus contributing to the complexity and severity of the clinical features.

TI	-	Nosocomial breakthrough fungaemia during antifungal prophylaxis or empirical
		antifungal therapy in 41 cancer patients receiving antineoplastic chemotherapy:
		analysis of aetiology risk factors and outcome.
PG	-	373-80
AB	-	Forty-one episodes of breakthrough fungaemia occurring over a 7.5 year period in
		"the National and St Elizabeth's Cancer Institutes in Bratislava, Slovakia, were"
		analysed. Five of them occurred during prophylaxis with fluconazole (one
		"Torulopsis glabrata, one Hansenula anomala, two Candida krusei and one Candida"
		"parapsilosis), ten with itraconazole (three Trichosporon pullulans, one"
		"Trichosporon beigelii, one Cryptococcus laurentii, three Candida albicans and two"
		"T. glabrata), 11 during prophylaxis with ketoconazole (one Candida norvegenesis,"
		"one C. parapsilosis, one C. krusei, one Candida tropicalis, five C. albicans, one"
		Candida stellatoidea and one C. laurentii and 15 during empirical therapy with
		"amphotericin B (ten C. albicans, two T. beigelii and three Candida lusitaniae)."
		"The most frequent risk factors for breakthrough fungaemia were neutropenia,"
		previous therapy with multiple antibiotics and recent catheter insertion.
		Comparing these episodes with 38 non-breakthrough fungaemias (appearing at the
		same institute in the same period) differences in certain risk factors were
		noted: breakthrough fungaemias were more frequently observed in patients with
		"acute leukaemia (39.0% vs 5.2%, P < 0.001), mucositis (34.2% vs 13.1%, P < 0.05),"
		"prophylaxis with quinolones (58.5% vs 15.8%, P < 0.0001) and catheter-associated"
		"infections (29.3% vs 2.6%, P < 0.003). In this subgroup overall mortality (36.6%"
		vs 28.8%) or early attributable mortality (22.0% vs 23.6%) were not significantly
		different.

TI	-	Fungal surveillance of an open haematology ward.
PG	-	288-92
AB	-	Air sampling and surveillance cultures for fungi were performed in a Scottish
		general haematology ward over a five-month period in 1997. The mean total fungal
		count from the air sampling appeared to be correlated with the number of patients
		colonized by Aspergillus. The most commonly isolated species were Aspergillus
		"versicolor, A. fumigatus and A. niger. Rooms with portable air filtration units"
		had significantly lower total fungal counts than the others. Swabs were taken
		from 70 patients (mean age 62 years); 114 of the 563 cultures (20.2%) were
		"positive. The most commonly isolated species were A. fumigatus, Candida albicans,"
		C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis. Samples taken from the tongue and perineum
		showed colonization more often than those taken from the nostrils. Almost half
		"the patients (48.6%) were colonized on, or within seven days of, admission; 11.4%"
		became colonized whilst on the unit. One patient developed fatal aspergillosis.
		We conclude that colonization or high air-borne spore concentrations are not
		necessarily predictive of fungal infection but may prompt early treatment or more
		aggressive prophylaxis of potentially fatal invasive infections.

TI	-	[Multicenter Prospective Observational Study of Fungal Keratitis--Identification
		and Susceptibility Test of Fungi].
PG	-	17-27
AB	-	PURPOSE: To investigate the causative fungi of fungal keratitis in Japan and
		their drug susceptibility. METHODS: Identification and antifungal susceptibility
		"test for 8 drugs (micafungin, amphotericin B, flucytosine, fluconazole,"
		"itraconazole, voriconazole, miconazole and pimaricin) were performed using"
		isolated fungi from patients with fungal keratitis treated at 27 facilities in
		"Japan between November 1, 2011 and October 31, 2013. RESULTS: Fungal strains were"
		detected in 72 (50.7%) out of 142 samples. The major isolates were Fusarium spp.
		"(18), Candida parapsilosis (12), C. albicans (11) and Alternaria spp. (6), in"
		"all, fungi of 31 species were identified by gene analysis. In the yeast-like"
		"fungi, susceptibility rates were evident for more than 80% in voriconazole,"
		"pimaricin, flucytosine, micafungin, amphotericin B and fluconazole. In"
		"filamentous fungi, the susceptibility rate was less than 50% except for PMR"
		"(90%). Fusarium spp., which were susceptible to amphotericin B and pimaricin,"
		showed lower susceptibility rates compared with other genera. CONCLUSIONS:
		"Although various genera and species of fungi cause fungal keratitis, the obtained"
		drug susceptibility data in this study demonstrates the different susceptibility
		"patterns among the major isolates (Fusarium spp., C. parapsilosis, C. albicans"
		and other groups). This is important evidence useful for fungal keratitis
		treatment.

LID	-	10.4103/0378-6323.120724 [doi]
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Onychomycosis is a world-wide public health concern in children,"
		requiring epidemiological data for different regions for control and prevention.
		AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the predominant pathogens and risk
		"factors for onychomycosis in school children living in Kayseri, Turkey. METHODS:"
		"This study included 8122 school children, aged 5-16 years, living in the rural"
		and urban areas around Kayseri. Onychomycosis was clinically classified as distal
		"and lateral subungual (DLSO), proximal subungual, superficial white, endonyx and"
		totally dystrophic onychomycosis. Nail samples from children with clinically
		"diagnosed onychomycosis were collected, examined by direct microscopy and"
		inoculated for culture study. The demographic features and possible risk factors
		were recorded and assessed by logistic regression models. RESULTS: We clinically
		"diagnosed onychomycosis in 152 out of 8,122 (0.18%) school children. DLSO was the"
		"most frequent clinical diagnosis (120/152, 78.9%). Culture-positive onychomycosis"
		was detected in 27/152 (17.7%) children. The prevalence of culture-positive
		onychomycosis was determined as 0.33%. All culture-positive samples were only
		from toenails. The onychomycosis causative agents were dermatophytes in 17/27
		"cases (62.9%), including Trichophyton rubrum 12 (44.4%), Trichophyton"
		"mentagrophytes 1 (3.7%), Trichophyton tonsurans 1 (3.7%) and Trichophyton spp. 3"
		"(11.1%) and yeasts in 10/27 cases (37.1%), including Candida glabrata 4 (14.8%),"
		"Candida parapsilosis 1 (3.7%), Trichosporon 2 (7.4%) and Rhodotorula 3 (11.1%)."
		"Age, father's occupation, number of siblings and rooms were statistically"
		associated with the frequency of onychomycosis. CONCLUSIONS: Although to be
		prevalence of onychomycosis in school children in central Anatolia of Turkey
		"seems very low degree, pediatric onychomycosis is a growing public health concern"
		all over the world. Children having more siblings or unemployed fathers and
		children living in small house as well as older children should be examined
		carefully for onychomycosis.

PG	-	88-95
LID	-	10.1016/S1875-9572(09)60042-5 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis is the most serious problem in neonatal intensive
		"care, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. We evaluated the"
		"causative pathogen, drug sensitivity, hematological parameters, clinical course"
		and mortality rate of neonatal sepsis in a Taiwanese medical center and compared
		our results to those of previous studies conducted in Taiwan. METHODS: Neonates
		admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at National Taiwan University
		Hospital (NTUH) between January 2001 and December 2006 were included in this
		study. Patients were divided into early-onset sepsis and late-onset sepsis groups
		"if their culture tested positive within the first 7 days of life or later,"
		respectively. RESULTS: A total of 109 episodes of sepsis were identified in 100
		neonates. The incidence of sepsis was 4.06% among all NICU admissions. Most
		"neonates with early-onset sepsis were term infants, while very low birth weight"
		(VLBW) and preterm infants accounted for the majority of cases of late-onset
		"sepsis. In early-onset sepsis, the most common pathogens responsible included"
		group B streptococci (GBS) (36%) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) (26%). GBS was
		associated with more meningitis involvement but lower incidence of mortality
		compared with E. coli. The most common causative microorganisms in late-onset
		sepsis were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CONS) (40%) and Candida (15%). The
		sepsis-related mortality rates were higher in early-onset sepsis (10%) than in
		"late-onset sepsis (7%). CONCLUSION: Unlike previous reports from Taiwan, in the"
		"present study, GBS was found to be the leading pathogen in early-onset sepsis."
		GBS screening and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines should be used in
		Taiwan to prevent early neonatal sepsis. The most common causative microorganisms
		of late-onset sepsis were CONS and Candida species. Candida parapsilosis was
		associated with a high mortality rate.

TI	-	Fungal colonization and infection in Boston keratoprosthesis.
PG	-	15-Sep
AB	-	PURPOSE: To determine the incidence of and risk factors for fungal keratitis and
		endophthalmitis in patients with a Boston keratoprosthesis (KPro) and to
		determine whether surveillance cultures were helpful in predicting fungal
		infection. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed of 182 patients
		(202 eyes) who received a type 1 (through cornea) or type 2 (through cornea and
		"lid) KPro between March 1, 1990, and December 31, 2004, and who were followed for"
		"at least 1 month (range, 1 month to 13 years; mean, 2.84 years). There were 148"
		"eyes with type 1 and 54 eyes with type 2. Beginning in late 1999, many eyes were"
		"given a prophylactic topical regimen containing vancomycin, and many eyes with"
		type 1 KPro were given therapeutic contact lenses. Cases of fungal keratitis or
		"endophthalmitis were analyzed. To determine the fungal colonization rate, 70"
		surveillance cultures of the ocular or lid surface around the KPro optic were
		obtained of 36 uninfected KPro eyes (35 patients) at random time-points over 1
		year (August 2002 to July 2003). RESULTS: There were 4 definite and 1 probable
		"fungal infections in 6893 patient-months of follow-up, or 0.009 fungal infections"
		per patient-year. These included 3 cases of definite or probable Candida
		"endophthalmitis (C. parapsilosis, C. glabrata, and C. albicans) and 2 cases of"
		"mold keratitis (Alternaria, Fusarium). The rate was higher in eyes receiving a"
		vancomycin-containing topical prophylactic regimen than those with on a
		non-vancomycin regimen (5 cases/2774 person-months vs. 0 cases/4119
		"person-months; P = 0.011). In eyes with type 1 KPro, the rate was higher with"
		therapeutic contact lens wear than without (4/1682 vs. 0/3115 person-months; P =
		"0.015). Surveillance cultures did not predict fungal infection, and none of the 6"
		surveillance eyes colonized with fungi (all Candida) developed a fungal
		infection. The prevalence of fungal colonization in KPro eyes had not changed
		"since our 1996 surveillance study (11% vs. 10%, P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Fungal"
		infections in KPro eyes have appeared since we introduced broad-spectrum
		"antibiotic prophylaxis and therapeutic contact lenses 5 years ago, but the"
		infection rate remains very low in our mostly New England-based patient
		population. Cleaning or replacing the contact lens on a regular basis and
		prescribing a short course of topical amphotericin at the first visible signs of
		fungal colonization may prevent these infections.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: The correct identification of the species within the Candida
		parapsilosis complex has become relevant due to the resistance of Candida
		metapsilosis to antifungals. We describe the characteristics of the Candida
		"parapsilosis complex isolates, with respect to antifungal resistance and biofilm"
		"formation. METHODS: We perform a descriptive cross-sectional study in 30 strains,"
		"collected in a tertiary hospital. All strains, were identified by Vitek2,"
		Vitek-MS™ systems and by ITS sequencing. The antifungal susceptibility profile
		"was obtained with Sensititre™ panels, while biomass production and metabolic"
		"activity were quantified by means of crystal violet and XTT reduction assay,"
		respectively. RESULTS: There was a 100% correlation between Vitek-MS™ and ITS
		sequencing. All isolates were susceptible to the nine antifungals tested. The
		metabolic activity and biomass production tests did not show any difference among
		the subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: The Vitek-MS™ system provides acceptable
		identification. We did not find significant differences neither in azole
		resistance nor in biofilm formation.

AB	-	"Fungal endocarditis is a rare disease, and it is associated with severe"

		treatment. Although Candida albicans (C. albicans) is the most common etiological
		"agent of this severe form of endocarditis, Candida parapsilosis (C. parapsilosis)"
		is the most common non-albicans causative species. It occurs mostly in patients
		"with predisposing risk factors, and the rarity of this disease demands a high"
		index of suspicion; the diagnosis must be vigilantly pursued by echocardiography
		and multiple blood cultures. The past few decades have witnessed a rise in the

		We report the case of a 63-year-old man with no previous medical history of
		cardiac disease and no risk factors who was diagnosed with fungal endocarditis
		due to C. parapsilosis without fungemia. This report illustrates a rare case of
		fungal endocarditis in a patient with no risk factors and highlights the
		"challenges encountered in the diagnosis, along with complications and predictors"
		of poor prognosis.

TI	-	Adolescent eating disorder with catheter-related bloodstream infection.
PG	-	678-684
LID	-	10.1111/ped.14511 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Treatment of adolescent eating disorder requires early improvement of
		nutritional status. Central venous hyperalimentation is used but catheter-related
		bloodstream infection (CRBSI) is a complication. There have been no reports
		examining risk factors for CRSBI in eating disorders. METHODS: The subjects were
		51 patients who received nutritional therapy with the use of a peripherally
		inserted central catheter (PICC) from January 2012 to December 2019. The courses
		of weight and white blood cell (WBC) count were examined retrospectively during
		nutritional therapy. Onset factors for CRBSI were determined and a case series of
		CRBSI caused by Candida parapsilosis is presented. RESULTS: The day of minimum
		"weight occurred on or before day 7 in 37 of the 51 patients, and this day was"
		preceded by the day with the lowest WBC at a significant rate. The minimum weight
		day was significantly delayed in CRSBI cases compared with non-CRBSI cases (P =
		"0.02). In the case series of CRBSI caused by C. parapsilosis, the median WBC"
		"count before CRBSI decreased to 2,570 (1,680-3,270)/μL at a median of day (12-90)"
		36. Catheter-related bloodstream infection developed at a median of day (26-133)
		"38. The PICC was immediately removed and an antifungal drug was started, leading"
		to cure with no after effects in all subjects. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with an
		"eating disorder treated with nutritional therapy using a PICC, prolonged"
		resistance to weight gain became a risk factor for developing CRBSI. White blood
		"cell counts recover after weight gain, which suggests that there is a risk of"
		"developing CRBSI, even with improved appetite and weight gain."

AB	-	Micafungin has been approved for the prophylaxis of Candida infections in
		patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
		"(allo-HSCT). Here, we report a single-center experience of three different dose"
		"levels regarding efficacy, toxicity, and colonization with Candida ssp. in"
		"clinical practice. In total, 150 consecutive adult patients who underwent"
		"allo-HSCT received micafungin at a dosage of 50, 100, or 150 mg once daily for"
		primary antifungal prophylaxis. Of those patients receiving more than six d of
		"micafungin prophylaxis, 12/46 (26%), 6/44 (14%), and 9/46 (20%) were switched to"
		empiric antifungal treatment. The frequency of invasive fungal infections (IFIs)
		according to EORTC criteria did not differ significantly (7/46; 15% vs. 5/44; 11%
		"vs. 5/46; 11%) across the different dosage groups. In the 50-mg group, there was"
		one case of candidemia with C. parapsilosis after 12 d of micafungin prophylaxis.
		"In all three groups, micafungin prophylaxis was well tolerated without any case"
		of toxicity-related treatment discontinuation. Renal function was not
		"significantly altered, while increase of bilirubin was mainly due to concomitant"
		ATG application. The incidence of IFIs is similar irrespective of the micafungin
		dosage while there was a trend toward more frequent change to empiric antifungal
		treatment as well as oropharyngeal colonization with candida in the lowest dosage
		group.

		piedra case.
PG	-	87-92
AB	-	"White piedra is a rare fungal infection of the hair shaft characterized by small,"
		"firm, irregular white-brown nodules. The infection is caused by basidiomycetous"
		yeasts in the genus Trichosporon. We report a case of a 28-year-old female
		"patient who acquired the infection in Qatar. In this case, the scalp was the only"
		"site affected, but infection at that site was extensive. The hair had a"
		"Saccharomyces-like yeast odor and appeared to be beaded, with light-brown nodules"
		of varying sizes up to 2 mm long. Trichosporon sp. accompanied by Candida
		parapsilosis grew out along hair shafts planted in primary isolation media.
		Molecular identification of the Trichosporon carried out by analyzing the 26S
		"ribosomal gene gave a 100% match with Trichosporon inkin, a major cause of pubic"
		white piedra. The patient was treated with daily applications of ketoconazole
		"shampoo followed by econazole shampoo and cream, and was considered clinically"
		and mycologically cured after 2 months. Novel findings in the present case are
		"the first identification of T. inkin as an agent of scalp white piedra, and the"
		"heavy outgrowth of C. parapsilosis from the concretions, although in the latter"
		case it is not clear if the co-occurring yeast was etiologically contributory to
		the pathogenesis of the white piedra.

LID	-	10.1136/bcr-2021-245441 [doi]
LID	-	e245441
AB	-	We present the first reported case of Candida parapsilosis pulmonary infection
		presenting as lung nodules. The patient is a 31-year-old man with cystic fibrosis
		(CF) colonised with multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli and increased frequency
		of pulmonary exacerbations in the preceding months. While on intravenous
		"antibiotics for a pulmonary exacerbation, he developed bilateral pulmonary"
		nodules. Bronchoalveolar lavage cultures grew C. parapsilosis He was initially
		"treated with dual antifungal therapy, voriconazole and micafungin."
		Discontinuation of voriconazole due to transaminitis resulted in the development
		"of new nodules, and isavuconazonium was added. Repeat imaging revealed no"
		progression of disease. Micafungin was eventually discontinued. Monotherapy with
		"isavuconazonium is planned for 1 year post lung transplant. In the CF population,"
		C. parapsilosis may be an opportunistic pathogen. The case highlights that
		frequent CF exacerbations and antibiotic exposure increase the risk for
		opportunistic infections including Candida species and the implications for lung
		transplantation in this setting.

TI	-	Neonatal sepsis in a tertiary unit in South Africa.
PG	-	225
LID	-	10.1186/s12879-021-05869-3 [doi]
LID	-	225
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has emerged as a global threat to
		healthcare resulting in an increase in morbidity and mortality. Neonatal sepsis
		"is ranked as the third highest cause of neonatal demise globally, in which AMR"
		accounted for 31.0% of deaths. AMR in neonates has been poorly characterised in
		"Durban, South Africa. Thus, the resultant effect of AMR on empiric regimens for"
		"neonatal sepsis is uncertain in this setting. Therefore, this study analysed the"
		aetiology and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of bloodstream infections
		"within the neonatal intensive care unit at a tertiary hospital in Durban, with"
		the aim of establishing an effective empiric regimen for the unit. METHODS: A
		retrospective data review on positive blood cultures from the neonatal intensive
		care unit at Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital was conducted. Three time
		"periods were analysed: 2014, 2016 and 2018. Culture data from neonates aged"
		0-30 days were included and repeat cultures were de-duplicated. The frequency of
		common organisms and their antimicrobial susceptibilities were analysed.
		Fischer's exact test was used for subgroup analysis. Poisson and logistic
		regressions were used to assess significant trends in organisms and antimicrobial
		susceptibilities over time. RESULTS: Late-onset sepsis (86.8%) predominated over
		early-onset sepsis (13.2%). A preponderance of gram-positive organisms (68.7%)
		over gram-negatives (26.8%) and fungi (4.5%) was detected. Common pathogens
		"included coagulase-negative staphylococci (53.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.6%),"
		"enterococci (9.3%), and Acinetobacter baumannii (7.7%). Despite the small"
		"contribution of fungi to the microbial profile, fluconazole-resistant Candida"
		parapsilosis predominated within that group. High rates of resistance to first-
		and second-line antibiotics were also noted among gram-positive and gram-negative
		organisms. Multidrug resistant organisms included extended-spectrum
		beta-lactamase (ESBL) K. pneumoniae (7.6%) and extensively-drug resistant A.
		"baumannii (7.0%). However, a statistically significant decrease in ESBL-producing"
		organisms was documented during the entire study period (p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS:
		"It was determined that first-line antimicrobials, advocated by the World Health"
		"Organization for treatment of neonatal sepsis, proved ineffective in this unit"
		"due to high levels of AMR. Therefore, this study advises that meropenem with or"
		without vancomycin provides optimal empiric cover. Amphotericin B is advocated
		for empiric antifungal therapy. Ongoing surveillance is necessary.

PG	-	89-98
LID	-	10.1007/5584_2016_196 [doi]
AB	-	Biofilm forming capacity of yeasts colonizing the intravenous devices is
		considered a key factor involved in the pathogenesis of Candida catheter-related
		bloodstream infections (CCRBSI). The biofilm production of strains of Candida
		spp. isolated both from the CVC and from the blood of patients with CCRBSI was
		"compared to that of strains isolated from patients not having CCRBSI. Results,"
		"expressed in terms of Biofilm Index (BI), revealed that biofilm-producing strains"
		were isolated in the CCRBSI group with a frequency significantly higher than in
		"the non-CCRBSI group (χ(2) = 4.25, p = 0.03). The species more frequently"
		"cultured was C. parapsilosis complex (including C. parapsilosis sensu stricto, C."
		orthopsilosis and C. metapsilosis). When this species was isolated from the CVC
		tip cultures of the CCRBSI group it showed BIs significantly (p = 0.05) higher
		than those found in the non-CCRBSI group. All the strains of C. tropicalis
		isolated from the CCRBSI group produced biofilm. Instead most of the isolates of
		C. glabrata were non-producers. The cumulative BI of non-albicans Candida strains
		isolated from CCRBSI patients was significantly higher than that of non-albicans
		strains cultured from patients non-CCRBSI (χ(2) = 6.91; p = 0.008). C. albicans
		was a biofilm producer both in the CCRBSI and in the non-CCRBSI group. When
		isolated from the blood it showed enhanced biofilm production in the CCRBSI group
		"only, while when colonizing the CVC it displayed high BIs both in the CCRBSI"
		group and in non-CCRBSI group. Our data seem to indicate that the biofilm
		production capacity should be considered in the clinical management of CCRBSI.

PG	-	780-785
AB	-	A retrospective analysis of fungal infections was carried out in a health-care
		burn center between 2011 and 2014 using the patients' medical records (n = 36).
		"Patients ranged from 18 to 87 years of age, with 23 (63.9%) being women. The most"
		prevalent widespread total body surface area affected (TBSA) was 30-50% (p =
		"0.03), and 71-100% in younger patients, mainly associated with femicide. Fourth"
		"degree burns were revealed in 69.4% of the patients while in 50%, inhalation"
		injuries were observed to represent a higher mortality rate (p = 0.04). The
		Candida score was 3 in 77.7% of cases respectively. Central venous catheter and
		mechanical ventilation were used. All patients received antibiotic treatment and
		91.7% antifungal treatment. Surgical excision of the burn was performed in 33
		"(91.7%) patients, and skin autografting in 29 (80.6%). The median of the fungal"
		infection developed was 21.4 days after admission to the ICU. The specimens
		analyzed involved 52 yeast samples isolated from different cultures: urine
		"(42.3%), blood (26.9%), skin biopsy (9.6%), catheter tip (15.4%) and tracheal"
		aspirate (5.8%). The use of microbiological culture and molecular methods allowed

TI	-	Fungal peritonitis in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal
		dialysis in Qatar.
PG	-	646-51
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: This study was conducted at Hamad General Hospital to determine the
		incidence of fungal peritonitis and to describe its clinical and microbiological
		findings in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis in
		Qatar. METHODOLOGY: The medical records of these patients between 1 January 2005
		and 31 December 2008 were retrospectively reviewed and the collected data were
		"analysed. RESULTS: During the study period, 141 episodes of peritonitis were"
		"observed among 294 patients. In 14 of these episodes (9.9%), fungal peritonitis"
		"was reported in 14 patients with a rate of 0.05 episodes per patient year, while"
		the bacterial peritonitis rate was 0.63 per patient year. Thirteen (93%) patients
		had one or more previous episodes of bacterial peritonitis that was treated with
		"multiple broad-spectrum antibiotics, 11 (85%) had received broad-spectrum"
		"antibiotics within the preceding month, 12 (92%) within three months, and 8 (62%)"
		within six months. Candida species were the only fungal species isolated from the
		dialysate with predominance of non-albicans Candida species (especially Candida
		"parapsilosis). Therapeutic approach was immediate catheter removal, followed by"
		systemic antifungal therapy and temporary haemodialysis. Nine patients (64.3%)
		"were continued on haemodialysis, whereas five patients (35.7%) died. CONCLUSIONS:"
		Prior antibiotic use was an important risk factor predisposing patients to the
		development of fungal peritonitis. Early detection of fungal peritonitis would
		lead to early institution of appropriate therapy and prevention of complications.

TI	-	Relationship between salivary flow rates and Candida counts in subjects with
		xerostomia.
PG	-	149-54
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the relationship between salivary flow and
		Candida colony counts in the saliva of patients with xerostomia. STUDY DESIGN:
		Sialometry and Candida colony-forming unit (CFU) counts were taken from 112
		subjects who reported xerostomia in a questionnaire. Chewing-stimulated whole
		saliva was collected and streaked in Candida plates and counted in 72 hours.
		Species identification was accomplished under standard methods. RESULTS: There
		was a significant inverse relationship between salivary flow and Candida CFU
		counts (P =.007) when subjects with high colony counts were analyzed (cutoff
		"point of 400 or greater CFU/mL). In addition, the median sialometry of men was"
		"significantly greater than that of women (P =.003), even after controlling for"
		confounding variables like underlying disease and medications. Sjögren's syndrome
		was associated with low salivary flow rate (P =.007). There was no relationship
		between the median Candida CFU counts and gender or age. There was a high
		frequency (28%) of mixed colonization. Candida albicans was the most frequent
		"species, followed by C parapsilosis, C tropicalis, and C krusei. CONCLUSIONS: In"
		subjects with high Candida CFU counts there was an inverse relationship between
		salivary flow and Candida CFU counts.

LID	-	e25712
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass
		spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) for yeast identification is limited by the
		requirement for protein extraction and for robust reference spectra across yeast
		species in databases. We evaluated its ability to identify a range of yeasts in
		comparison with phenotypic methods. METHODS: MALDI-TOF MS was performed on 30
		reference and 167 clinical isolates followed by prospective examination of 67
		clinical strains in parallel with biochemical testing (total n = 264).
		Discordant/unreliable identifications were resolved by sequencing of the internal
		transcribed spacer region of the rRNA gene cluster. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Twenty
		"(67%; 16 species), and 24 (80%) of 30 reference strains were identified to"
		"species, (spectral score ≥2.0) and genus (score ≥1.70)-level, respectively. Of"
		"clinical isolates, 140/167 (84%) strains were correctly identified with scores of"
		"≥2.0 and 160/167 (96%) with scores of ≥1.70; amongst Candida spp. (n = 148),"
		"correct species assignment at scores of ≥2.0, and ≥1.70 was obtained for 86% and"
		"96% isolates, respectively (vs. 76.4% by biochemical methods). Prospectively,"
		"species-level identification was achieved for 79% of isolates, whilst 91% and 94%"
		"of strains yielded scores of ≥1.90 and ≥1.70, respectively (100% isolates"
		identified by biochemical methods). All test scores of 1.70-1.90 provided correct
		"species assignment despite being identified to ""genus-level"". MALDI-TOF MS"
		"identified uncommon Candida spp., differentiated Candida parapsilosis from C."
		"orthopsilosis and C. metapsilosis and distinguished between C. glabrata, C."
		nivariensis and C. bracarensis. Yeasts with scores of <1.70 were rare species
		such as C. nivariensis (3/10 strains) and C. bracarensis (n = 1) but included
		4/12 Cryptococcus neoformans. There were no misidentifications. Four novel
		species-specific spectra were obtained. Protein extraction was essential for
		"reliable results. CONCLUSIONS: MALDI-TOF MS enabled rapid, reliable"
		identification of clinically-important yeasts. The addition of spectra to
		databases and reduction in identification scores required for species-level
		identification may improve its utility.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: The prevalence of fungal disease in cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-CF
		bronchiectasis is increasing and the clinical spectrum is widening. Poor
		sensitivity and a lack of standard diagnostic criteria renders interpretation of
		"culture results challenging. In order to develop effective management strategies,"
		a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the airways fungal microbiome
		is required. The study aimed to use DNA sequences from sputum to assess the load
		and diversity of fungi in adults with CF and non-CF bronchiectasis. METHODS: Next
		generation sequencing of the ITS2 region was used to examine fungal community
		composition (n = 176) by disease and underlying clinical subgroups including
		"allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, chronic necrotizing pulmonary"
		"aspergillosis, non-tuberculous mycobacteria, and fungal bronchitis. Patients with"
		no known active fungal disease were included as disease controls. RESULTS: ITS2
		sequencing greatly increased the detection of fungi from sputum. In patients with
		"CF fungal diversity was lower, while burden was higher than those with non-CF"
		bronchiectasis. The most common operational taxonomic unit (OTU) in patients with
		"CF was Candida parapsilosis (20.4%), whereas in non-CF bronchiectasis sputum"
		Candida albicans (21.8%) was most common. CF patients with overt fungal
		"bronchitis were dominated by Aspergillus spp., Exophiala spp., Candida"
		parapsilosis or Scedosporium spp. CONCLUSION: This study provides a framework to
		more accurately characterize the extended spectrum of fungal airways diseases in
		adult suppurative lung diseases.

		"microscopic and/or cultural detection of fungi (dermatophytes, yeasts and moulds)"
		were successful in 54% of samples. Causative fungal agents were: 68%
		"dermatophytes, 29% yeast, and 3% moulds. The most frequently detected"
		"dermatophyte species were T. rubrum (91%), and T. mentagrophytes (7.7%). Among"

		"T. mentagrophytes, are the most frequently isolated causative agents in"
		"onychomycosis. In addition, yeasts may be isolated relatively frequently, while"
		moulds are uncommon.

AB	-	"A 73-year-old male patient presented with ocular pain, redness, and blurred"
		"vision in the left eye, which had been ongoing for more than 2 months. An"
		oval-shaped paracentral corneal ulcer with stromal infiltration and a mild
		"anterior chamber reaction were found. Despite treatment with empiric antibiotics,"
		the lesion progressed and corneal thinning in the middle area was noted. The
		culture yielded Candida parapsilosis. We therefore prescribed topical 0.2%
		"fluconazole (FCZ) in combination with oral FCZ as an antifungal treatment,"
		following which the stromal infiltration gradually subsided. Complete
		epithelial-ization was noted on the 8(th) day after initiating FCZ therapy. There
		was no recurrent disease in the subsequent 2 years. Our case demonstrates that
		topical FCZ 0.2% in combination with oral FCZ can successfully treat C.
		parapsilosis keratitis and result in a good visual outcome.

		"(91.5%), while 74 isolates (6.1%) were misidentified. Molecular identification"

		correctly identified the last one. Concordance between the two techniques was
		"excellent for the medically-important species (98-100%), including the"
		identification of closely-related species (Candida albicans/C. dubliniensis; C.
		inconspicua/C. norvegensis; C. parapsilosis/C. metapsilosis/C. orthopsilosis).
		"Only 2.3% of isolates belonging to C. famata, C. lambica and C. magnoliae or to"
		Geotrichum spp. and Trichosporon spp. were not identified by MT-MS. This

PG	-	S16-23
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candida infections have increased in the last few decades. Previous
		colonization is the most important risk factor for the development of fungemia.
		Understanding local epidemiology is necessary in order to select the optimal
		anti-fungal treatment. The purpose of this study was to establish colonization by
		"Candida in patients, staff and medical devices in a neonatal intensive care unit."
		METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted. Cultures were obtained from
		"different anatomic sites, from medical devices and from the hands of healthcare"
		staff at admission and every 7 days until discharge of the unit. Identification
		"and susceptibility tests to amphotericin B, fluconazole, itraconazole,"
		"voriconazole and caspofungin were performed. RESULTS: Out of 98 patients, 24 %"
		"were already colonized at admission, 15 % became colonized during their stay at"
		"the hospital. Out of 738 samples obtained from devices, 2 % were positive. Out of"
		"89 cultures obtained from hands, 55 % were positive. A total of 124 Candida"
		"strains were retrieved; Candida parapsilosis was the most common species (59 %),"

AB	-	A specific treatment protocol for managing fungal infections after total elbow
		arthroplasty (TEA) does not currently exist. The purpose of this report is to
		describe our experience and outline our treatment algorithm for a rare case of
		prosthetic joint infection (PJI) following a TEA. We present a case of a PJI due
		to Candida parapsilosis after TEA in a 57 year-old Caucasian woman with a history
		"of hypertension, depression, and three previous surgical procedures to the"
		affected limb. A fungal PJI by the organism C. parapsilosis following TEA has not
		been previously reported. Successful eradication of the fungal infection was
		"achieved utilizing resection arthroplasty; placement of an amphotericin,"
		"vancomycin, and tobramycin-impregnated cement spacer; and 6 months of"
		organism-specific antifungal medication. Although the patient was clinically
		"ready for reimplantation, she passed away due to unrelated issues before"
		reimplantation could be performed. While PJI is a devastating complication
		"following TEA, a fungal infection is a rare complication that imposes difficult"
		"challenges to the treating surgeon. With our case report, we hope to contribute"
		to the overall knowledge of fungal infections associated with TEA and describe
		our successful treatment of this complex case.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) generally presents with a single or
		several localised cutaneous ulcers without involvement of mucous membranes.
		Ulcerated lesions are susceptible to secondary contamination that may slow the
		healing process. OBJECTIVE: This study verified the influence of non-parasitic
		wound infection on wound closure (epithelialisation) and total healing. METHODS:
		Twenty-five patients with a confirmed diagnosis of CL and ulcerated lesions
		underwent biopsy of ulcer borders. One direct microbial parameter (germ
		"identification in cultures) and four indirect clinical parameters (secretion,"
		"pain, burning sensation, pruritus) were analysed. FINDINGS Biopsies of ten"
		lesions showed secondary infection by one or two microorganisms (Staphylococcus
		"aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes and"
		"Candida parapsilosis). ""Secretion"" and ""burning sensation"" influenced"
		epithelialisation time but not total healing time. Positive detection of germs in
		"the ulcer border and ""pain"" and ""pruritus"" revealed no influence on wound"
		closure. CONCLUSIONS: Our borderline proof of clinical CL ulcer infection
		inhibiting CL wound healing supports the need to follow antimicrobial stewardship
		"in CL ulcer management, which was recently proposed for all chronic wounds."

AB	-	"This case report describes the clinical and histopathologic features, including"
		"molecular confirmation, of fungal keratitis after intrastromal corneal ring"
		segments placement for keratoconus. A 52-year-old woman underwent insertion of
		Intacs(®) corneal implants for treatment of keratoconus. Extrusion of the
		"implants was noted 5 months post insertion and replaced. Three months later,"
		monocular infiltrates and an epithelial defect were observed. The Intacs were
		removed and the infiltrates were treated with ofloxacin and prednisolone acetate.
		Microbial cultures and stains were negative. The patient demonstrated flares and
		exacerbation one month later. Mycoplasma and/or fungus were suspected and treated
		without improvement. Therapeutic keratoplasty was performed 10 months following
		initial placement of the corneal ring implants. The keratectomy specimen was
		analyzed by light microscopy and a panfungal polymerase chain reaction assay. A
		histopathologic diagnosis of Candida parapsilosis keratitis was made and
		"confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. One year postoperatively, a systemic"
		workup of the patient was done with no signs of recurrence. This rare report of
		fungal keratitis following Intacs insertion is the first reported case of C.
		parapsilosis complicating Intacs implantation.

AB	-	"Many rare yeasts are emerging as pathogens, causing invasive infections in"
		"susceptible hosts that are associated with poor clinical outcome. Here, we"
		describe the first and fatal case of Lodderomyces elongisporus fungemia in a
		"premature, extremely low-birth-weight neonate after spontaneous vaginal delivery."
		The bloodstream isolate was identified as C. parapsilosis by the VITEK 2 yeast
		identification system and as L. elongisporus by PCR-sequencing of the internal
		transcribed spacer (ITS) region of ribosomal DNA. Antifungal susceptibility
		"testing data for the isolate, performed by the broth microdilution-based"
		"MICRONAUT-AM assay, showed susceptibility to all nine antifungal drugs tested."
		"Despite the initiation of treatment with liposomal amphotericin B, the patient"
		died on the same day that the blood culture yielded yeast growth. This is the
		first report of L. elongisporus bloodstream infection in a neonate as the
		previous nine cases reported in the literature occurred in adult patients. The
		"crude mortality rate for invasive L. elongisporus infection is 50%, as only 5 of"
		10 patients survived.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Fungal prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) is rare but serious
		"complication of valve replacement surgery. Candida species, particularly Candida"
		albicans is the most common isolated pathogen in fungal PVE (1-6%of cases). CASE
		PRESENTATION: We describe a 35-year-old woman who underwent mechanical mitral
		valve replacement about 3 years ago. She was admitted with neurological symptoms
		and later with dyspnea and hypotension. Transesophageal echocardiography showed
		large and mobile prosthetic valve vegetation. She underwent mitral valve surgery.
		The explanted valve and vegetation revealed lots of budding yeasts and the
		isolated yeast was identified as C. parapsilosis. Amphotericin B and broad
		"spectrum antibiotic were started immediately. Unfortunately, the patient died two"
		"days after surgery, due to sepsis probably related to the candidemia."
		"CONCLUSIONS: Fungal endocarditis is uncommon infection, but it is a serious"
		problem in patients with prosthetic valve. Fungal PVE can occur years after the
		"surgery, thus long-term follow-up is essential."

		pulmonary diseases].
PG	-	44-8
AB	-	The sputum specimens from 1363 patients at the age of 16 to 65 years with
		nonspecific pulmonary diseases and the pleural exudate specimens from 325
		patients were tested for fungi in 1989-1994. The etiological significance of
		Candida was stated at a concentration of > 10(5) GFU per 1 ml of the sputum. The
		identification was performed by the routine methods. An increase in the rate of
		the fungi isolation was studied in the time course of the observation: 15.3 +/-
		1.9 per cent in 1989 and 31.6 +/- 3.4 per cent in 1994. The fungi were more
		frequently isolated from the patients with lung abscesses (38.0 +/- 4.1 per cent
		of the cases). In the patients with pyothorax the fungi were isolated from the
		pleural exudate specimens only in 6.8 +/- 1.4 per cent of the cases. The groups
		of risk of the susceptibility to Candida were revealed. They included patients at
		the age of 21 to 30 years and above 60. Out of 484 Candida isolates 80.7 per cent
		"belonged to C. albicans, 4.2 per cent to C. tropicalis, 2.1 per cent to C. kefyr"
		"and 1.8 per cent to C. krusei. The isolates of C. parapsilosis, C. guillermoudii,"
		C. utilis and C. brumptii were rate. The isolates were highly susceptible to
		"nystatin (91,8 per cent) and lowly susceptible to levorin (35.4 per cent),"
		amphoglucamine (24.7 per cent) and ketokonazol (16.8 per cent).

AB	-	The superficial mycoses are very common infectious diseases and therefore are a
		frequent reason for medical consultation. The aim of this study was to determine
		the diagnostic frequency of superficial mycoses in the Mycology Department of the
		"Instituto Nacional de Higiene ""Rafael Rangel"" during 14 years (2001-2014). A"
		retrospective cross-sectional study was performed to review the mycological
		"records of patients with presumptive diagnosis of superficial mycosis. Nails,"
		hairs and epidermal scales were the processed samples. The identification of
		fungi was performed by macro and microscopic observation of colonies and
		"biochemical and physiological tests, as required of the isolated agent. For the"
		investigation of Malassezia spp. only direct examination was performed. Of the 3
		"228 samples processed, 1 098 (34%) were positive and their distribution according"
		to the etiological agent was: dermatophytes 79.5%; 10.9% yeasts;
		non-dermatophytes fungi 5.1% and 4.5% Malassezia spp. The most frequently
		"isolated dermatophyte was Trichophyton rubrum Complex (70.1%), followed by T"
		"mentagrophytes complex (15.1%), Microsporum canis (9.4%) and Epidermophyton"
		"floccosum (4%). The most frequent ringworms Were: Tinea unguium (66.8%), followed"
		by Tineapedis (16.4%) and Tinea capitis (8.1%). Candida parapsilosis complex
		(37.5%) was the most frequently isolated yeast and Fusarium spp. (53.6%) was the
		"most isolated among non-dermatophyte fungi, followed by Aspergillus spp. (19.6%)"
		and Acremonium spp. (10.7%). The identification of the etiological agent is
		essential to guide appropriate treatment. This study constitutes an important
		contribution to the knowledge of the epidemiology of superficial mycoses in our
		country.

AB	-	"OBJECTIVES: Candida, an opportunistic fungal pathogen, has been implicated in"
		oral and oesophageal cancers. This study aimed to examine oral Candida carriage
		"in 52 oral cancer patients and 104 age-, gender- and denture status-matched oral"
		"cancer-free subjects. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We assessed general health, smoking"
		"and alcohol drinking habits, use of alcohol-containing mouthwash and periodontal"
		status (community periodontal index of treatment needs). Yeasts were isolated
		using oral rinse technique and genetically identified via Real-Time PCR-High
		resolution melting curve analysis of conserved ribosomal DNA. Conditional and
		binary logistic regressions were used to identify explanatory variables that are
		risk factors for oral cancer. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The frequencies of oral
		yeasts' presence and high oral colonization were significantly higher in oral
		"cancer than non-oral cancer patients (p=001; p=0.033, respectively). No"
		significant difference in the isolation profile of Candida species was found
		"between the two groups, except C. parapsilosis was more frequent in non-oral"
		cancer group. Differences were noticed in the incidence of C. albicans strains
		where significantly more C. albicans genotype-A was isolated from cancer patients
		and significantly more C. albicans genotype-B isolated from non-cancer patients.
		Multiple regression analyses showed significant association with cancer observed
		"for alcohol drinking (OR=4.253; 95% CI=1.351, 13.386), Candida presence"
		"(OR=3.242; 95% CI=1.505, 6.984) and high oral colonization (OR=3.587; 95%"
		"CI=1.153, 11.162). These results indicate that there is a significant association"
		between oral cancer occurrence and Candida oral colonization and that the
		observed genotypic diversity of C. albicans strains may play a role in oral
		carcinogenesis.

AB	-	Fungal osteomyelitis (OM) is relatively rare. There is scarce literature
		discussing fungal OM in diabetic foot infections (DFIs). This case series
		explores the clinical characteristics of patients treated at a large tertiary
		academic center for DFI and found to have a causative agent of fungal origin in
		"their bone on surgical intervention. Between July 2017 and March 2018, a"
		prospective longitudinal analysis was performed of patients with diabetes
		admitted to our institution who underwent operative management of OM.
		"Demographic, clinical, radiographic, and laboratory data were collected for all"
		patients. Data between bacterial and fungal OM cohorts was analyzed for
		differences and similarities in patient characteristics and outcomes. All
		patients were followed 20 weeks postoperatively. Five patients with fungal OM
		were identified from the 35 cases where OM was confirmed through podiatric
		"surgical intervention. In each fungal case, a Candida species was isolated from"
		"operative bone culture which included subspecies Candida albicans, C"
		"parapsilosis, and C glabrata. A P value ⩾.05 was found in clinical"
		characteristics between our cohorts. Wound healing was achieved in 40% of
		"patients with fungal OM, and oral fluconazole successfully treated Candida OM in"
		the cases that achieved healing. Diabetes can increase the risk of Candida OM. In
		"DFIs, fungus can impede wound healing if not recognized and treated. Because"
		"Candida OM is typically indolent in nature, bone biopsy and mycological culture"
		is recommended for definitive diagnosis and treatment.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Retropubic midurethral slings are a minimally invasive surgical
		procedure used in the treatment of stress urinary incontinence and are typically
		associated with high cure rates and low complication rates. Bladder perforation
		"is a known intraoperative complication that, if left unrecognized, can have"
		significant morbidity. CASE: A 47-year-old underwent a retropubic midurethral
		"sling, anterior colporrhaphy, and cystoscopy. She developed a suprapubic wound"
		cellulitis that progressed to involve the right trunk and flank as well as
		persistent fever for more than 48 hours despite broad-spectrum antibiotics. Upon
		"return to the operating room, the patient was found to have an unrecognized"
		bladder perforation with mesh in the bladder. Wound culture was remarkable for
		Candida parapsilosis and Escherichia coli. CONCLUSION: Unrecognized bladder
		perforation and nonbacterial causes of infection should be considered in patients
		with severe progressing cellulitis despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage
		after retropubic midurethral sling placement.

AB	-	The invasion of pathogenic fungi poses nonnegligible threats to the human health
		and agricultural industry. This work exploited a family of hydroxyethyl
		naphthalimides as novel antifungal species with synergistic potential of chemical
		and dynamic treatment to combat the fungal resistance. These prepared
		naphthalimides showed better antifungal potency than fluconazole towards some
		"tested fungi including Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida tropicalis and Candida"
		"parapsilosis 22019. Especially, thioether benzimidazole derivative 7f with"
		excellent anti-Candida tropicalis efficacy (MIC = 4 μg/mL) possessed low
		"cytotoxicity, safe hemolysis level and less susceptibility to induce resistance."
		Biochemical interactions displayed that 7f could form a supramolecular complex
		"with DNA to block DNA replication, and constitute a biosupermolecule with"
		cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) from Candida tropicalis to hinder CPR biological
		"function. Additionally, 7f presented strong lipase affinity, which facilitated"
		"its permeation into cell membrane. Moreover, 7f with dynamic antifungal potency"
		promoted the production and accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in
		"cells, which destroyed the antioxidant defence system, led to oxidative stress"
		"with lipid peroxidation, loss of glutathione, membrane dysfunction and metabolic"
		"inactivation, and eventually caused cell death. The chemical and dynamic"
		antifungal synergistic effect initiated by hydroxyethyl naphthalimides was a
		reasonable treatment window for prospective development.

		"from approximately 100 fungi, representing about 50 species of pathogens and"
		"commonly encountered saprophytes, was sequenced to develop universal PCR primers"
		and species-specific oligonucleotide probes. Each step in the process of
		detection and identification was standardized to a common set of conditions
		applicable without modification to all fungi of interest and all types of
		clinical specimens. These steps consist of DNA extraction by boiling specimens in
		"an alkaline guanidine-phenol-Tris reagent, amplification of a variable region of"
		"the 28S rRNA gene with universal primers, and amplicon identification by probe"
		hybridization or DNA sequencing performed under conditions identical for all
		fungi. The results obtained by testing a panel of fungal isolates and a variety

AB	-	"Objective: To retrospectively analyze the diagnosis time, pathogen distribution,"
		and drug resistance of fungal bloodstream infection in severe burn patients.
		Methods: Blood samples were collected from 55 severe burn patients with fungal
		"bloodstream infection (including 46 males and 9 females, aged 42 (1, 78) years)"
		admitted to the intensive care unit of the Institute of Burn Research of the
		First Affiliated Hospital of Army Medical University (the Third Military Medical
		University) from July 2011 to May 2019 for retrospective analysis. Microbial
		"monitoring system was used to cultivate pathogens, API yeast identification kit"
		"and Candida chromogenic medium were used to identify pathogens, and Kirby-Bauer"
		paper disk diffusion method was used to detect drug resistance of fungi to
		"fluconazole, amphotericin B, itraconazole, ketoconazole, and voriconazole. The"
		"positive rate of blood fungal culture, mortality rate, distribution of local"
		"fungal proliferation sites, the diagnosis time distribution of fungal bloodstream"
		"infection, the distribution of fungal species, resistance to commonly-used"
		"antifungal drugs, and the use of antibiotics were assessed. The WHONET 5.6"
		software was applied to analyze the distribution and drug resistance of fungi.
		"Results: (1) Totally 4 839 blood samples were collected during the 9 years, and"
		"122 strains of fungi were isolated, with positive rate of 2.52%. The mortality"
		rate was 14.55% (8 patients) in 55 patients. Catheter fungal proliferation ranked
		the first among 30 cases of local fungal proliferation. (2) The diagnosis time of
		fungal bloodstream infection mainly distributed in ≤1 week of hospitalization
		"[32.73% (18/55)]. (3) Among the 55 strains of fungi detected, the detection rate"
		"of Candida parapsilosis ranked the first (21.82%, 12 strains), Candida glabrata"
		"was the second (18.18%, 10 strains), and Candida tropicalis was tied with Candida"
		"albicans in the third place (14.55%, 8 strains). All the detected fungi were"
		"sensitive to amphotericin B, and the resistance rates to voriconazole,"
		"fluconazole, itraconazole, and ketoconazole were between 4.5% and 9.1%. (4)"
		"Droad-spectrum antibiotics were used in all the 55 patients, ≥3 kinds of"
		"antibiotics were used in 44 patients, and 37 patients used antibacterial drugs ≥7"
		days. Conclusions: The diagnosis time of fungal bloodstream infection in the 55
		severe burn patients was mainly within 1 week of hospitalization. Candida
		parapsilosis is the most commonly detected fungal species. Catheter fungal
		proliferation occurs most commonly among the 30 patients with local fungal
		"proliferation. All the detected fungi were sensitive to amphotericin B, with low"
		"drug resistance to voriconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, and ketoconazole."
		Broad-spectrum antibiotics were overused in the severe burn patients with fungal
		bloodstream infection.

AB	-	"Although Candida species are common pathogens for nosocomial infections, Candida"
		"endocarditis is still considered a rare entity. Here, we report two cases of"
		"Candida parapsilosis endovascular infections in patients with prosthetic valves,"
		both of which responded to combination antifungal therapy without surgical
		"intervention. Additionally, T2 magnetic resonance (T2MR) was used to assess for"
		resolution of invasive candidiasis. The first case is of an elderly man with
		Candida parapsilosis endovascular infection who responded to combination
		antifungal therapy with micafungin and fluconazole followed by suppressive
		"therapy, without surgical intervention. The second case is of a middle-aged man"
		with Candida parapsilosis prosthetic valve endocarditis who also responded to
		"combination antifungal therapy with micafungin, flucytosine and fluconazole,"
		without surgical intervention.

PG	-	57-62
LID	-	10.1016/j.jiph.2011.10.004 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Red cell exchange/transfusion is frequently used in the management of
		patients with medical complications related to acute severe sickle cell disease
		"(SCD). However, peripheral venous access is often difficult without central"
		venous catheters (CVCs) in adult patients with moderate or severe SCD. AIMS: To
		review our experience with the use of the PORT-A-CATH(®) device in sixteen
		patients with SCD undergoing exchange or simple transfusions. METHODS: Among a
		"cohort of 550 patients who frequently visited the inpatient service, sixteen SCD"
		patients required the insertion of a PORT-A-CATH(®) device. These patients
		"included 3 males and 13 females, aged 25-44 years [31.1 ± 2.3; mean ± SD]. A"
		total of 24 PORT-A-CATH(®) devices were implanted in these 16 patients during the
		"study period. Eleven patients had 1 device implanted, three patients had 2"
		"devices, one patient had 3 devices, and one patient had 4 devices implanted."
		"RESULTS: Out of the 24 devices implanted, 17 required removal, due to either"
		infection associated with sepsis and/or thrombosis. The organisms involved were
		"Candida spp. (3), C. Parapsilosis (2), C. albicans (1), C. famata (1), C."
		"lusitanice (1), Staphylococcus spp. (6), and S. aureus (3), as well as the"
		"coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (2), alpha hemolytic Streptococcus (1),"
		"Diphtheroid bacilli (2), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2), Ps. Spp. (3), Escherichia"
		"coli (3), Klebsiella oxytoca (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), Klebsiella spp. (1),"
		"Serratia liquefaciens (1), Serratia fanticola (1), Achromobacter spp. (2)"
		"Chromobacterium violaceum (1), Delftia acidovirans (1), Stenotrophomonas"
		"maltophile (1), Alcaligenes faecalis (1), and Enterobacter cloacae (1). Two"
		episodes of documented thrombosis were observed. One case presented with right
		atrial thrombosis/SVC syndrome and the other case presented with left upper arm
		"thrombosis. Two patients died with ports in situ, while five patients had ports"
		in place at the time of this study. The median working life of the ports was
		688.5 days (range: 39-3925). The rate of infective complications was 2.63
		"infections per 1000 catheter days, and the number of infections was significantly"
		correlated with the number of ports [Pearson's r=0.66; p<0.01]. DISCUSSION: Our
		results suggest that patients with SCD suffer infective complications associated
		"with the PORT-A-CATH(®), which often necessitate its removal. Although these"
		"devices are extremely useful, their optimal beneficial potential is only realized"
		if the patients receive proper care at special centers well-versed in the
		maintenance of such devices by experienced staff.

AB	-	PURPOSE: To identify etiology of toxic anterior segment syndrome (TASS) after
		"uneventful phacoemulsification. SETTING: EyeMD Laser and Surgery Center, Oakland,"
		California. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. METHODS: Patient charts with TASS
		were reviewed. Reservoirs of 2 autoclaves associated with these cases were
		cultured for bacterial contamination. Cultures were performed on 23 other
		autoclave reservoirs at surgery centers in the local area. The main outcome
		measures were the incidence of TASS and prevalence of bacterial biofilm
		"contamination of autoclave reservoirs. RESULTS: From 2010 to 2013, 11 935"
		consecutive cataract surgeries were performed at 1 center by multiple surgeons
		"with no reported TASS. Between January 1, 2014, and January 15, 2015, 10 cases of"
		TASS occurred out of 3003 cataract surgeries; these patients' charts were
		"reviewed. Cultures of 2 Statim autoclave reservoir walls grew Bacillus species,"
		"Williamsia species, Mycobacterium mucogenicum, and Candida parapsilosis. Scanning"
		electron microscopy of reservoir wall sections showed prominent biofilm. The 2
		"autoclaves were replaced in January 2015. Subsequently, 2875 cataract surgeries"
		"were performed with no reported TASS (P < .001, χ(2) test). Eighteen of 23"
		additional regional autoclaves were also contaminated with bacterial biofilms.
		CONCLUSIONS: Toxic anterior segment syndrome was strongly associated with
		bacterial biofilm contamination of autoclave reservoirs. An etiological mechanism
		might involve transport of heat-stable bacterial cell antigens in the steam with
		deposition on surgical instrumentation. Data suggest widespread prevalence of
		"bacterial biofilms on fluid-reservoir walls, despite adherence to manufacturer"
		guidelines for cleaning and maintenance. Prevention or elimination of autoclave
		fluid-reservoir biofilms might reduce the risk for postoperative TASS. FINANCIAL

PG	-	254-259
LID	-	10.18683/germs.2020.1214 [doi]
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Infective endocarditis (IE) due to Candida species is a rare
		disease representing about 1-2% of all IE cases and carries a high mortality
		"rate. Given the rarity of the disease, there are no clear guidelines on the type"
		"and duration of antifungal therapy. Thus, long-term or even life-long antifungal"
		treatment is commonly used. CASE REPORT: We report two patients with prosthetic
		valve C. parapsilosis IE and persistent candidemia that failed conservative
		treatment and ultimately developed heart failure. They underwent prosthetic valve
		replacement and prolonged antifungal treatment with favorable outcome.
		"DISCUSSION: Candida IE commonly occurs in the setting of underlying malignancy,"
		"chronic liver disease, previous endocarditis, previous antimicrobial exposure,"
		"previous abdominal surgery, intravenous drug use, presence of a central venous"
		"catheter, and previous cardiac surgery. Both present patients had undergone a"
		"cardiac surgery and had a prosthetic heart valve, while one patient had an"
		underlying autoimmune disease that could be associated with higher risk of IE. In
		"both patients transthoracic ultrasound failed to diagnose IE. In our patients,"
		"conservative treatment alone was not enough to control the infection, thus, both"
		patients underwent valve replacement and were subsequently treated with
		"antifungals for 6 weeks. Furthermore, both patients were put on long-term"
		antifungal suppression treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Given the absence of controlled
		"randomized trials, the treatment of Candida endocarditis mostly relies on"
		"experts' opinion, and, thus, future studies focusing on the type and duration of"
		antifungal treatment are required.

		syndrome.
PG	-	1367-1378
LID	-	10.1111/odi.12896 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to investigate the pattern of oral yeast colonization
		"of Sjögren's syndrome patients and its correlation to salivary flow rates, age,"
		and time of the disease progression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Saliva and swab
		specimens were obtained from 45 patients (primary Sjögren's syndrome = 15/
		secondary Sjögren's syndrome = 15/ healthy controls = 15). Yeast species were
		identified using culture method through chromogenic medium followed by polymerase
		chain reaction and Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: Eleven species from six different
		genera were detected. The most prevalent species found was Candida albicans
		"followed by Candida tropicalis, Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis, and"
		Candida krusei. Both groups of Sjögren's syndrome showed higher counts of
		"C. albicans (Total and CFU counts) when compared to control group. In contrast, a"
		greater variety of yeast species was identified on samples of the control group.
		"CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that C. albicans is the most prevalent yeast, but"
		also that a variety of other yeast species can colonize the oral cavity of
		Sjogren's syndrome patients. The identification of most of the colonies was not
		obtained by culturing-PCR methods combined.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Fungal periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a disruptive and
		complex complication of joint arthroplasty. We present a case of a fungal PJI
		with Candida parapsilosis after a total hip arthroplasty (THA). PRESENTATION OF
		CASE: A 73-year-old woman with a history of ovarian cancer with peritoneal
		"metastases, was treated with a THA, due to symptomatic arthritis of the right"
		"hip. One month after surgery, she had difficulties walking. Inflammatory"
		parameters were mildly increased. Aspiration of a subcutaneous abscess diagnosed
		Candida parapsilosis. A two-stage revision arthroplasty without spacer was
		"performed. During a six-week prosthesis-free interval, intravenous fluconazole"
		"400 mg was given. After reimplantation, fluconazole was continued for two weeks"
		intravenously and life-long perorally. Follow-up of the patient after six months
		showed no recurrence of infection. DISCUSSION: This case revealed that when PJI
		"is suspected, a low treshold for joint aspiration is important. Two-stage"
		revision with systematic antifungal therapy is the preferred treatment of fungal
		PJI. Our case demonstrated a good result with a prosthesis-free interval.
		Fluconazole is the preferred antifungal treatment and it should be applied for at
		"least six months or longer. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first case"
		of a fungal PJI with Candida parapsilosis after a THA treated with a two-stage
		revision arthroplasty without spacer and a life-long fluconazole treatment.

AB	-	Candida parapsilosis osteomyelitis is a rare diagnosis. Candidal infection can
		occur via hematogenous or local spread. A localized swelling around a bony
		structure should raise clinical suspicion. Diagnosis is made by a combination of
		imaging modalities and biopsy. Anecdotal case reports have been reported in
		medical literature and treatment guidelines are very limited. Treatment modality
		includes a combination of surgical debridement and antifungal therapy.

		Review and In Vitro Antifungal Activity of Hypochlorous Acid.
PG	-	1599-605
LID	-	10.1097/ICO.0000000000000639 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: To review the current literature describing cases of fungal keratitis
		and endophthalmitis after Boston keratoprosthesis (KPro) implantation and to
		characterize the antifungal activity of 0.01% hypochlorous acid against medically
		relevant fungi. METHODS: A literature review of fungal keratitis or
		"endophthalmitis in KPro patients from January 2001 to April 2015, and an in vitro"
		time kill assay characterizing the fungicidal activity of 0.01% hypochlorous acid
		"against fungi causing ocular infections. RESULTS: Fifteen publications,"
		"predominantly retrospective case series, were identified. Infection rates after"
		KPro implantation ranged from 0.009 to 0.02 fungal infections per patient-year of
		follow-up. The largest single-surgeon series reported an incidence of 2.4% for
		fungal endophthalmitis during a 10-year period. Causative organisms included both
		yeasts and molds. Outcomes were favorable if infections were caught early and
		treated appropriately; less favorable outcomes were reported in developing
		countries where fungal species are endemic and resources are limited. 0.01%
		"hypochlorous acid is rapidly fungicidal, reducing the number of viable yeast"
		cells or mold conidia by at least 99.99% within 60 seconds. The antifungal
		"activity extended to all molds (Acremonium kiliense, Aspergillus flavus,"
		"Aspergillus fumigatus, Fusarium solani, and Mucor indicus) and yeast species"
		(Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis) tested. CONCLUSIONS: Fungal
		infections remain a lifelong concern in patients after KPro implantation. There
		"is a growing need for a standard antifungal prophylaxis regimen, especially in"
		the developing world. The rapid broad-spectrum in vitro fungicidal activity of
		0.01% hypochlorous acid against all fungi tested makes it an attractive candidate
		as an antifungal prophylaxis in KPro patients.

AB	-	We describe the first documented case of meningitis caused by Lodderomyces
		elongisporus. Identification of L. elongisporus was made on the basis of an
		arachnoid biopsy with pathology samples sent for fungal internal transcribed
		spacer sequencing after multiple central nervous system (CNS) fungal culture
		"specimens were negative. After final diagnosis, treatment was transitioned from"
		"amphotericin to fluconazole, which, combined with insertion of lumbar drain"

		"caused by Candida parapsilosis, an organism with which L. elongisporus was"
		previously conflated; and (3) management of fungal meningitis-associated
		hydrocephalus.

AB	-	"Otomycosis, which is otitis externa caused by fungi, is common throughout the"
		"world especially in tropical and subtropical countries. However, the"
		epidemiologic data about the etiologic agents of otomycosis in Turkey is limited.
		The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the agents of otomycosis in
		patients living at Manisa region (located at western Anatolia of Turkey). A total
		"of 2279 cases [1465 male, 813 female; age range 1-87 (mean: 41.7) years] who were"
		"clinically prediagnosed as otomycosis at Celal Bayar University Hospital, between"
		"February 1995 and July 2011, were included in the study. External ear swab"
		samples from patients with suspicion of otomycosis have been evaluated by routine
		mycological methods. Identification of mold-like fungi was based on colony
		"morphology and microscopic examination of fungal structure, whereas germ tube"
		"test, growth characteristics on cornmeal-Tween 80 agar and API 20C AUX"
		"(bio-Mérieux, France) system were used for the identification of yeast-like"
		"fungi. Of the samples, 28% (638/2279) were found positive by direct microscopy"
		and 24% (544/2279) by culture methods. Among culture-positive cases the isolation
		"rates of mold-like and yeast-like fungi were 66% (359/544) and 34% (185/544),"
		respectively. The number of distribution of the molds were as follows;

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candida parapsilosis is a rare opportunistic pathogen that can be
		found in immunosuppressed patients. There are seldom-reported cases of fungal
		osteomyelitis surrounding orthopedic implants. CASE PRESENTATION: This is a case
		of chronic Candida parapsilosis osteomyelitis in an immunocompromised patient
		with a prior open reduction and internal fixation for a closed bimalleolar ankle
		fracture that went on to neglected wound complications. The patient underwent
		"series of treatments including removal of hardware, serial irrigation and"
		"debridements, negative pressure wound therapy, and intravenous antifungal"
		therapy. Our case illustrates the possibility of this rare pathogen involved in
		orthopedic surgery particularly in immunocompromised hosts. CONCLUSION: Fungal
		and atypical pathogens should always be considered in such patients or if another
		diagnosis is not clear. Protracted time to culture specimens should be considered
		for at least four weeks in such situations. This article outlines a review of the
		literature and treatment algorithm to guide physicians when managing patients
		with this rare infection.

AB	-	"OBJECTIVE: Otomycosis is a fungal infection, which leads to a damage of the"
		external auditory meatus. The disease is worldwide in distribution but is said to
		be more common in tropical countries. Though otomycosis presumably occurs
		"frequently in Africa, reports on its incidence and etiology are rare from Côte"
		d'Ivoire. The objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of the
		disease and to identify aetiological agents as well as the risk factors. MATERIAL
		AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out in the Otorhinolaryngology
		Department of the University Teaching Hospital of Yopougon from September 2007 to
		"February 2008. For laboratory investigation, specimens were collected by means of"
		a sterile swab. Samples were inoculated on Sabouraud's Dextrose Agar with and
		without antibiotics and incubated at 30°C for a period of 1 to 2 weeks.
		Identification was performed by direct microscopic examination on Cotton Blue
		Mount preparation and slide culture examination was used for differentiation of
		"morphology. Biotyping was performed using Carbohydrate Fermentation tests,"
		"Carbohydrate Assimilation Tests (galerie Api 20 CAux TM - Sanofi Pasteur), Germ"
		"tube Test, detection of chlamydospore formation on corn meal agar. RESULTS: A"
		total of 110 patients (sex-ratio=1.2) with suspected cases of otomycosis were
		"investigated. Itching, otalgia, and hypoacusis were the symptoms reported by the"
		"patients and the apparent signs were debris in the ear, scabs and inflammation of"
		"the external auditory meatus. Of these, 88 cases (80%) were confirmed"
		specifically of mycotic etiology on the basis of positive culture with
		92 isolates consisting of yeasts (65.2%) and moulds (34.8%). The predominant
		"etiological agents were Aspergillus flavus (28.4%), Candida guilliermondii"
		(19.3%) and Candida parapsilosis (18.2%). The predisposing factors included
		"previous otological pathology (P=0.010), frequent scratching of the external ear"
		canal and use of ear drops (RR=3.47; IC 95%=1.3-9.27). CONCLUSION: This study
		"revealed the great prevalence of otomycosis in Abidjan, some predisposing factors"
		and the aetiological agents. Management of otomycosis must include mycological
		examination for diagnosis and information for changing behaviour patterns leading
		to infection.

AB	-	"Candida osteomyelitis is uncommon, especially after dog bites. We describe a case"
		of a 63-year-old man without significant comorbidities presenting progressing
		swelling of the distal interphalangeal joint (DIJ) of right index finger
		"following a dog bite. Despite empiric antibiotic therapy and local medications,"
		there were no clinical signs of improvement. Clinical examination revealed
		fistula with purulent drainage on the volar region. Even though laboratory data
		"showed inflammatory markers on range, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)"
		demonstrated signs of osteomyelitis. The patient was taken to exploration and
		debridement of the bite wound. Culture of the bone biopsy showed growth of
		"Candida parapsilosis. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with isolated fungal"
		osteomyelitis and was initiated on fluconazole therapy. The treatment was
		effective and all symptoms were resolved in 8 weeks after the surgery. There were
		no signs of recurrence after 20 months of follow-up. The patient had no cosmetic
		abnormalities or sequelae. Concurrently with the description of the case report a
		"review of the literature was provided. According to the authors, there are three"
		main etiopathogenesis for this infection. The first pathogenic mechanism is
		direct inoculation into the deep tissues through the dog bite. The second
		hypothesis is direct translocation of the pathogen from the skin to the deep
		tissue and to the bone. The last mode of transmission is hematogenous
		"dissemination. Fungal osteomyelitis are really rare conditions, especially after"
		"dog bites, but nevertheless it should be considered as a possible diagnosis when"
		there is no response to antibiotics.

TI	-	Bacterial and fungal colonization of burn wounds.
PG	-	535-9
AB	-	A prospective study of fungal and bacterial flora of burn wounds was carried out
		from February 2004 to February 2005 at the Burns Unit of Hospital Regional da Asa
		"Norte, Brasília, Brazil. During the period of the study, 203 patients were"
		treated at the Burns Unit. Wound swab cultures were assessed at weekly intervals
		for four weeks. Three hundred and fifty four sampling procedures (surface swabs)
		were performed from the burn wounds. The study revealed that bacterial
		colonization reached 86.6% within the first week. Although the gram-negative
		"organisms, as a group, were more predominant, Staphylococcus aureus (28.4%) was"
		the most prevalent organism in the first week. It was however surpassed by
		Pseudomonas aeruginosa form third week onwards. For S. aureus and P. aeruginosa
		vancomycin and polymyxin were found to be the most effective drugs. Most of the
		isolates showed high level resistance to antimicrobial agents. Fungi were found
		"to colonize the burn wound late during the second week postburn, with a peak"
		incidence during the third and fourth weeks. Species identification of fungi
		"revealed that Candida tropicalis was the most predominant, followed by Candida"
		parapsilosis. It is crucial for every burn institution to determine the specific
		"pattern of burn wound microbial colonization, the time-related changes in the"
		"dominant flora, and the antimicrobial sensitivity profiles. This would enable"
		early treatment of imminent septic episodes with proper empirical systemic
		"antibiotics, without waiting for culture results, thus improving the overall"
		infection-related morbidity and mortality.

TI	-	Ocular Surface Characteristics and Colonization in a Burn Center: A Prospective
		Cohort Study.
PG	-	43-50
LID	-	10.1093/jbcr/irab040 [doi]
AB	-	We aimed to evaluate the characteristics and colonization by pathogenic
		microorganisms of the ocular surface in patients in a burn center and to
		"determine their association with sedation, mechanical ventilation, and periocular"
		burn. We prospectively evaluated 40 patients during an 8-mo period. Five
		"evaluations where performed, at baseline and weekly on four more occasions or"
		"until hospital discharge or death. On each visit, we assessed periocular burn,"
		"lid position, Bell's phenomenon, Schirmer's test, presence of chemosis,"
		"conjunctival hyperemia, and exposure keratopathy; conjunctival fornix swabs were"
		"taken for microbiology culture. Also, we documented the level of sedation,"
		"mechanical ventilation status, and systemic and ocular treatment. Absent Bell's"
		phenomenon and chemosis were significantly different at baseline in patients
		"under mechanical ventilation, sedation, and in those with a periocular burn. The"
		cumulative incidence of exposure keratopathy was 22.5% and the cumulative
		incidence of ocular surface colonization by pathogenic microorganisms was 32.5%.
		Both outcomes were associated with mechanical ventilation and periocular burn.
		The most frequent pathogenic microorganisms on the ocular surface were Candida
		"parapsilosis, Acinetobacter baumanii, and Pseudomonas aeuroginosa. We did not"
		"observe any case of a persistent epithelial defect, infectious keratitis, corneal"
		perforation or corneal opacity in this cohort. Results from our study may benefit
		future patients by allowing better risk stratification and treatment strategies
		for the ocular surface care in burn units.

		perinephric tissue predominantly caused by uropathogenic bacteria. Fungi have
		"been rarely reported as the etiological agents, isolated from blood and/ or urine"
		culture. We report a case of EPN caused by a rare etiological agent. A 60 year
		old diabetic female with no previous history of hospitalization presented to us
		with a short history of febrile illness associated with abdominal pain.
		"Investigations revealed unilateral EPN ""Wan type 1"". Patient was treated with"
		systemic antifungal therapy as per culture sensitivity and it alone proved to be
		an effective treatment of this clinically difficult condition. Patient was
		discharged in a satisfactory clinical condition. A rare etiology should always be
		kept in mind while evaluating a case of EPN.

AB	-	Candida is a relatively rare cause of spinal infections that commonly affects
		"immunocompromised patients. A 70-year-old woman, who underwent a lumbar"
		"discectomy on L5-S1 two months earlier, was admitted to our department"
		complaining of persistent back and leg pain. Magnetic resonance imaging showed
		"irregular enhancing mass lesion in L5-S1 intervertebral space, suggest of"
		pyogenic discitis with epidural abscess. The surgery was performed via
		retroperitoneal approach and the infected material at L5-S1 intervertebral space
		was removed. The histological examination of the specimen revealed chronic
		"inflammation involving the bone and soft tissue, and a culture of the excised"
		material was positive for Candida parapsilosis. The patient received intravenous
		fluconazole for 4 weeks after surgery and oral fluconazole 400 mg/day for 3
		months after surgery. The patient made a full recovery with no symptoms 6 months
		after surgery. We present a rare case of spondylodiscitis after a lumbar
		discectomy due to Candida parapsilosis and discuss treatment option with a review
		of the literatures.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Persistent Candida from fungal cultures of respiratory secretions are
		often ignored and not treated due to assumptions concerning benign colonization.
		OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical course of patients with chronic sputum and
		"fungi on culture, including response to antifungal treatment. METHODS: All"
		patients seen at a single long term acute care hospital (LTAC) between May 2009
		and September 2010 with at least two months of daily sputum and fungus on more
		"than one sputum culture were identified. LTAC, inpatient, and outpatient records"
		through June 2011 were reviewed to assess clinical features and response to
		"therapy or to cessation of therapy. RESULTS: Eleven patients were identified,"
		"having sputum duration of 5 months to 28 years, and respiratory cultures growing"
		"Candida species. Fungi included C albicans (8 patients), C glabrata (2), C krusei"
		"(2), C tropicalis (1), C parapsilosis (1), Aspergillus fumigatus (1), Aspergillus"
		"terreus (1), and Scedosporium (1), the latter 3 in conjunction with Candida"
		"species. All had abnormal chest CT scans, often with bronchiectasis and sometimes"
		"atelectasis or consolidation, and ten of 11 patients were on chronic steroids"
		"(inhaled and/or systemic). Antifungal therapy, mostly oral voriconazole and"
		"nebulized amphotericin, led to improved respiratory symptoms and sputum within 3"
		weeks in 10 of 10 treated patients. Lack of antifungal therapy or early cessation
		of treatment was associated with progressive or recurrent symptoms and death of
		one patient. CONCLUSIONS: This case series suggests that chronic candidal
		bronchitis is associated with significant morbidity and responds well to
		treatment. Such patients may benefit from extended antifungal therapy. Guidelines
		for the treatment of Candida in pulmonary secretions should be reevaluated.

PG	-	849-854
LID	-	10.1007/s10792-017-0534-2 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: To describe a technique for intracorneal application of voriconazole
		into the supradescemetic space in a case of deep recalcitrant Candida
		parapsilosis keratitis of a penetrating cornea graft. METHODS: A deep
		intracorneal incision reaching the center of the corneal infiltrate was created
		"with a 20-gauge MVR blade. Then, a 27-gauge hydrodissection cannula was inserted"
		"deep into the corneal pocket, and 0.1 ml of voriconazole 0.5 mg/ml was injected"
		until a bullous detachment of Descemet membrane (DM) covered 1/3 of the graft's
		area. DM detachment was documented by anterior segment optical coherence
		tomography (AS-OCT). RESULTS: AS-OCT confirmed the creation of a drug depot in
		"the supradescemetic space, which partially regressed during the following hours;"
		"24 h after the injection, a complete reattachment of DM was documented. After"
		"4 weeks, the stromal infiltrate has cleared completely and no signs of recurrence"
		"were observed 3 months after injection. CONCLUSION: In the present case, the"
		supradescemetic voriconazole injection led to resolution of a deep recalcitrant
		fungal infiltrate. The herein described technique could be tried in similar
		"cases, where an intrastromal injection is indicated, as it may offer a larger"
		intracorneal drug depot.

		Ligament Reconstruction: A Case Report.
LID	-	10.2106/JBJS.CC.21.00096 [doi]
AB	-	CASE: An 18-year-old woman underwent arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament
		"reconstruction (ACLR) but developed recurrent knee effusion. At age 25 years, her"
		"right knee pain worsened, and radiographs revealed extensive bone loss. She was"
		diagnosed with fungal (Candida parapsilosis) osteomyelitis by synovial fluid
		cultures. She underwent 2-stage surgery involving an amphotericin B-loaded cement
		spacer implantation and bone defect grafting. No recurrence of infection has been
		noted for 3 years postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: Fungal osteomyelitis may have few
		signs of local infection and often remains undiagnosed until bone loss occurs.
		Differential diagnosis should include this disease when there is recurrent knee
		effusion after ACLR.

LID	-	e16082
AB	-	Fungal infective endocarditis is a rare and serious form of endocarditis
		associated with severe morbidity and mortality. The greatest propensity for
		"infection can be found in patients with implanted prosthetic valves, implanted"
		"cardiac devices, and intravenous drug use. We present a case of a 45-year-old"
		male with a prior bioprosthetic mitral valve who was diagnosed with Candida
		parapsilosis endocarditis. Computed tomography imaging of the abdomen was
		"significant for splenic infarcts, and transesophageal echocardiography"
		demonstrated a 1.23 cm x 0.55 cm lesion and 1.02 cm x 0.545 cm lesion on the
		bioprosthetic valve. The patient was subsequently treated with Amphotericin B and
		life-long Fluconazole. This case highlights the imaging findings and treatment of
		a rare disease process.

AB	-	Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of vitrectomy and etiological diagnosis in
		the treatment of fungal endophthalmitis. Methods: A retrospective survey was done
		"on the clinical manifestation, etiological diagnosis and treatment efficacy of 15"
		patients (15 eyes) who had been diagnosed with fungal endophthalmitis at the
		inpatient department of Peking Union Medical College Hospital during 2002-2015. A
		"total of 15 eyes of 15 patients, 3 male and 12 female patients, were included in"
		this study. The mean age of the patients was (45.8±15.3) years. Among the 15
		"eyes, 12 (12 patients) were diagnosed with endogenous fungal endophthalmitis and"
		3 (3 patients) were diagnosed with exogenous fungal endophthalmitis. Fourteen
		"eyes have been misdiagnosed with uveitis, systematic or local application of"
		glucocorticoid and/or immunosuppressor have been conducted on the patients which
		"resulted in exacerbation. Baseline visual acuity: light perception in 2 eyes,"
		"hand movement for 12 eyes, and 1 eye of 0.1. Six eyes showed slight inflammatory"
		"reaction in anterior chamber, four eyes showed moderate inflammatory reaction in"
		"anterior chamber, while five eyes showed severe inflammatory reaction with"
		hypopyon in anterior chamber. B-Scan ultrasound examination showed inflammatory
		"vitreous opacity in all 15 eyes, combined proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR)"
		"were found in 11 eyes, retinal detachment were found in 10 eyes, which include 6"
		"cases of tractional retinal detachment, 1 case of exudative retinal detachment,"
		"and 3 cases of retinal and choroid detachment. Forty eyes underwent vitrectomy, 1"
		eye underwent intravitreal injection. Nine eyes were processed with silicone oil
		"tamponade, one eye was processed with C(3)F(8) tamponade. At the beginning of the"
		"operation, vitreous fluids were collected for preparing smears which were later"
		used for fungus culture and drug susceptibility testing. Results: According to
		"the smear results of vitreous fluid, fungal hyphae and spores were found in 10"
		"eyes. The fungus culture indicated positive results in 12 eyes, including candida"
		"albicans in 6 eyes, fusarium, candida parapsilosis, paecilomyces lilacinus,"
		"asoergullus terreus, mulan candida and aspergillus in 1 eye respectively. Based"
		"on etiological diagnosis, 14 eyes received amphotericin B intraocular injection"
		"during operation, and 9 patients received fluconazole (venous transfusion or oral"
		"administration), 2 patients received voriconazole through venous transfusion or"
		"oral administration, one patient received itraconazole through oral"
		administration. All 15 eyes received local application of amphotericin B eyedrop
		or fluconazole eyedrop. The intraocular inflammations in all 15 eyes were
		"mitigated. The visual acuity improved in 6 eyes, remained unchanged in 4 eyes,"
		and reduced in 5 eyes. Postoperative visual acuity achieved 0.1 to 0.15 in 2
		"eyes, 0.01 to 0.04 in 2 eyes, CF in 2 eyes, HM in 4 eyes, LP in 2 eyes, and NLP"
		"in 3 eyes. The retina of 5 eyes remained in position, the retina of 2 eyes"
		"reattached, the retina of 2 eyes failed to reattach. Recurrent retinal detachment"
		"happened in the other 6 eyes, 5 of which received reoperation. Eventually, the"
		"retina of 10 eyes reattached, and the retina of the 5 eyes failed to reattach."
		Conclusions: Vitrectomy is an effective method for treatment of fungal
		endophthalmitis. The positive rates of vitreous smear and fungus culture were
		really high. Application of sensitive anti-fungal drugs based on etiological
		"diagnose can improve therapeutic level. (Chin J Ophthalmol, 2018, 54: 270-276)."

		"fluconazole and itraconazole, etc., and 37 antibacterial drugs including"
		"tigecycline and imipenem, etc. Modified Hodge test was used to further identify"
		imipenem- and meropenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumonia. D test was used to detect
		erythromycin-induced clindamycin resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The WHONET 5.6
		"software was applied to analyze the annual incidence of CRBSI, mortality of"
		"patients with CRBSI, incidence of CRBSI cases, distribution of infection site,"
		"and duration of catheterization, detection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive"
		"bacteria, fungi, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and"
		"methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), and drug resistance of fungi"
		and major Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria to the commonly used
		antibiotics in clinic. Results: (1) The incidence of CRBSI was 7.0% (159/2 264)
		"during the eight years, which was slightly higher in 2014 and 2017 with 13.6%"
		(30/221) and 11.1% (24/217) respectively. The mortality rate of patients with
		CRBSI was 7.5% (12/159). (2) The incidence of CRBSI cases was 14.9% (338/2 264);
		"the main infection site was femoral vein, totally 271 cases (80.2%), and the"
		"duration of catheterization of this site was 9 (2, 25) d. (3) During the eight"
		"years, totally 543 strains of pathogens were isolated, including 353 (65.0%)"
		"strains of Gram-negative bacteria, 140 (25.8%) strains of Gram-positive bacteria,"
		and 50 (9.2%) strains of fungi. The top three isolated pathogens with isolation
		"rate from high to low were Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, and"
		"Pseudomonas aeruginosa, accounting for 23.2% (126/543), 17.1% (93/543), and 15.7%"
		"(85/543), respectively. Fungi were mainly Candida parapsilosis. Among the"
		"Staphylococcus aureus, the detection rate of MRSA was 98.9% (92/93), and that of"
		MSSA was 1.1% (1/93). (4) Except for the low drug resistance rates to polymyxin
		"B, minocycline, and tigecycline, the drug resistance rates of Acinetobacter"
		baumannii to the other antibiotics were considerably high (80.1%-100.0%).
		Pseudomonas aeruginosa was not resistant to polymyxin B but highly resistant to
		"netilmicin (88.7%) and piperacillin (92.6%), with resistance rates to the other"
		antibiotics from 34.5% to 62.7%. Klebsiella pneumoniae was not resistant to
		"tigecycline and lowly resistant to imipenem and meropenem (28.9%, 9 imipenem- and"
		"meropenem-resistant strains were further confirmed by modified Hodge test), with"
		resistance rates to the other antibiotics from 40.9% to 95.2%. The resistance
		rates of MRSA to most antibiotics were higher than those of MSSA. MRSA was not
		"resistant to linezolid, vancomycin, teicoplanin, sulfamethoxazole, or"
		tigecycline. The resistance rates of MRSA to clindamycin and erythromycin were
		"7.9% and 62.0%, respectively, and those to the other antibiotics were higher than"
		"91.5%. Except for the complete resistance to penicillin G and tetracycline, MSSA"
		was not resistant to the other antibiotics. Thirty-three strains of
		Staphylococcus aureus showed resistance to erythromycin-induced clindamycin.
		"Fungi was not resistant to amphotericin B, with drug resistance rates to"
		"voriconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, and fluconazole from 4.2% to 6.2%."
		Conclusions: The incidence of CRBSI and mortality of patients with CRBSI are high
		"in BICU of the author's unit, and the main infection site is femoral vein. There"
		"are various types of pathogens in patients with CRBSI, and most of them are"
		"Gram-negative. The top three isolated pathogens are Acinetobacter baumannii,"
		"Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, accompanying with grim drug"
		resistance phenomenon.

AB	-	Candida endocarditis is a rare infection that is becoming an emerging and growing
		"health concern, especially among risk groups such as the elderly and the"
		immunosuppressed. It is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Dilemmas
		"about Candida endocarditis treatment are still around, particularly about the"
		treatment options and their duration. We report a case of Candida parapsilosis
		prosthetic valve endocarditis with septic embolisms. An elderly male patient with
		a biological prosthetic valve presented with fever and constitutional symptoms.
		Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed an area suggestive of splenic emboli.
		Transesophageal echocardiography showed a vegetation attaching to the prosthetic
		"valve. Due to several comorbidities, he was not considered a candidate for"
		surgical treatment. He was treated with antifungal drugs (liposomal amphotericin
		B and caspofungin) and was discharged with per os fluconazole. Later he presented
		with evidence of lumbar spondylodiscitis due to septic embolization and relapsing
		"fungemia with multidrug-resistant isolates was documented. Unfortunately, the"
		patient outcome was ill-fated and he died in hospital due to sepsis-related to
		"the candidemia and also nosocomial urinary sepsis. Here, we illustrate the"
		complexity of diagnosing and managing fungal endocarditis due to its
		complications and poor prognosis.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of Candida spp.
		and presence of oral lesions in Brazilian leprosy patients under multidrug
		"therapy (MDT). METHODS: Thirty-eight individuals (18 males and 20 females, median"
		age 53 years) clinically and microbiologically diagnosed as leprosy (lepromatous
		"variant), and under MDT for at least 45 days were studied. The control group"
		"constituted by 38 healthy individuals (median age 53.5), matched to the test"
		"group in relation to age, gender and oral conditions. Oral rinses were collected"
		and the Candida identification was performed by phenotypic tests. The existence
		of Candida dubliniensis among the isolates was analyzed using a validated
		multiplex PCR assay. Twenty-nine leprosy patients were examined intra-orally for
		the presence of lesions. Data were analyzed by z- and Mann-Whitney tests (alpha =
		5%). RESULTS: Yeast carriage rate between leprosy patients (65.8%) and controls
		"(47.4%) was similar (P = 0.099), and no significant difference between yeast"
		counts was observed (P = 0.1004). Candida albicans was the most frequently
		"isolated species in both groups. In the leprosy group, Candida tropicalis and"
		"Candida parapsilosis were also identified. In the control group, we additionally"
		"identified Candida tropicalis, Candida glabrata and Candida kefyr. Candida"
		dubliniensis was not detected. No leprosy-related oral lesion was registered.
		"CONCLUSION: Within the limits of the study, we concluded that Brazilian leprosy"
		patients under MDT showed similar levels of carriage and Candida species
		distribution in relation to the controls.

		"parapsilosis are the most common pathogens causing these events; however, a new"
		"emergent pathogen has evolved with time. Herein, we describe two cases of Candida"
		magnoliae infection in neonates with a fatal outcome. This microorganism is
		commonly used in the food industry given its high capacity to produce erythritol
		and mannitol. This report is important to gain more information about this
		pathogen and manage it in a more effective way.

		peritonitis led to diagnosis: a rare case report.
PG	-	208-210
LID	-	10.1007/s13730-018-0328-z [doi]
AB	-	"Intestinal perforation by a peritoneal catheter is an uncommon, but serious,"
		complication that has a high mortality rate. Intestinal perforation in peritoneal
		dialysis (PD) patients is difficult to diagnose using symptoms and radiological
		"findings, which may result in a delay in diagnosis. Moreover, intestinal"
		perforation complicated with fungal peritonitis is reportedly a severe condition
		"with a poor prognosis. Herein, we report the case of a 78-year-old man on PD,"
		whose diagnosis of perforative peritonitis was difficult to diagnose
		preoperatively. He was transferred to our hospital complaining of relapsing
		PD-related peritonitis due to Klebsiella oxytoca infection 2 months after the
		insertion of the PD catheter. He had been treated with various antibiotics in the
		"previous hospital. Over the course of treatment, he complained of diarrhea, which"
		"was diagnosed as acute enteritis. Upon admission to our hospital, he had no"
		abnormal clinical signs except for a cloudy PD effluent. Blood examination showed
		"a high C-reactive protein level (8.41 mg/dL), a white blood cell count in the PD"
		"fluid of 367 cell/µL (neutrophils 55.1%), and the presence of Candida"
		"parapsilosis. We initiated antifungal therapy and, during catheter removal, found"
		"evidence of intestine perforations by the PD catheter, which were successfully"
		"repaired. After catheter removal and intestine repair, he recovered and was"
		"discharged to continue undergoing hemodialysis. Based on our case, we recommend"
		that intestine perforations should be considered as a cause of relapsing
		"PD-related peritonitis with abdominal symptoms, particularly watery diarrhea."
		"Furthermore, catheter removal and antifungal administration should be initiated"
		earlier after the diagnosis of fungal peritonitis.

AB	-	"To describe the clinical features, management and outcomes in patients with"
		"fungal keratitis at the Sydney Eye Hospital, Australia, over a 9-year period to"
		guide appropriate initial therapy. A retrospective case review was conducted.
		Patients diagnosed with fungal keratitis from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2017
		were identified from hospital coding and pathology databases. Data were extracted
		from the medical records. A total of 55 episodes from 51 patients were included.
		"Mean age was 60 ± 20 years (range: 19-91 years), and 33 were male. The fungal"
		species was not identified in two patients. Predisposing factors included ocular
		"surface disease in 17 eyes (32%); corneal disease, 15 (28%); corneal trauma, 12"
		"(23%); and contact lens wear, 13 (24.5%). Fusarium spp. (15, 27%) and Candida"
		"parapsilosis (10, 18%) were the most common isolates. The median visual acuity at"
		presentation was 1.3 logMAR (range: 0 to 3) and after treatment 0.7 logMAR
		"(range: -0.02 to 3) (P = .008). Despite medical therapy, most commonly with"
		"natamycin and topical and oral voriconazole, surgical intervention was required"
		in 21 eyes (40%); including antifungal injections in 9 (16%); corneal
		"transplantation, 16 (30%); evisceration, 2 (4%); and enucleation, 1 (2%). A poor"
		visual outcome was recorded in 27 of 43 (63%) patients. Fungal keratitis remains
		a cause of significant ocular morbidity; the majority of patients face a poor
		"outcome despite intense medical and at times surgical treatment. In our setting,"
		fungal keratitis was more commonly associated with corneal or ocular surface
		disease.

TI	-	Pulmonary manifestations in patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphomas.
PG	-	1550-5
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Lungs are among the most common organs of extranodal involvement by
		"cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCLs), yet the magnitude of lung involvement is not"
		"clear, and only a few case reports have addressed this issue to date. The"
		objective of this study was to present the authors' observations on how to
		recognize lung involvement by CTCL and evaluate the clinical and radiologic
		differences between involvement of the lungs by CTCL and by pneumonia. METHODS: A
		retrospective analysis was conducted of all 710 patients with confirmed CTCL who
		presented to The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center between January
		"1996 and January 2005. Demographics, tumor characteristics, respiratory symptoms,"
		"thoracic imaging, microbiology, and laboratory studies were reviewed. RESULTS:"
		"During the 9-year period that was studied, 122 patients presented with pulmonary"
		"radiologic abnormalities, including 67 patients who also had respiratory"
		symptoms. Pneumonia (n = 27 patients) or lung involvement (n = 6 patients) in
		"patients with CTCL were associated with high mortality rates (hazard ratio, 1.82;"
		"95% confidence interval, 1.08-3.07%; P = .026). The pathogens that were isolated"
		"from lower respiratory cultures were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 4 patients),"
		"Aspergillus fumigatus (n = 2 patients), Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare (n = 2"
		"patients), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1 patient), respiratory syncytial virus (n"
		"= 1 patient), and Candida parapsilosis (n = 1 patient). Most of the radiologic"
		findings in patients with pneumonia were opacities. Six patients had involvement
		"of lung by CTCL, and most common radiologic pulmonary findings were either a"
		solitary nodule or multiple progressing pulmonary nodules. CONCLUSIONS: Pneumonia
		"and lung involvement by CTCL are relatively rare but portend poor survival. Thus,"
		patients with CTCL should be evaluated thoroughly with thoracic imaging when they
		experience respiratory symptoms.

		"with septic shock secondary to bacterial endocarditis with multiple cerebral,"
		"mesenteric, and peripheral embolic phenomena. He underwent emergent porcine"
		"prosthetic valve replacement with aortic annular reconstruction. Subsequently, he"
		developed recalcitrant Candida parapsilosis endocarditis requiring treatment with
		multiple antifungal agents and 4 repeated complex reconstructions of the aortic
		"root and fibrous trigones over 3 years, before the infection was successfully"

AB	-	"Longitudinal melanonychia striata, presenting as a black linear vertical band of"
		"the nail plate, can be caused by pigmented lesions and non-pigmented etiologies."
		"A fungal infection of the nail plate, also referred to as onychomycosis or tinea"
		"unguim, can result from dermatophytes, non-dermatophyte molds, and Candida."
		"Albeit rare, Candida-associated fungal melanonychia can present as a longitudinal"
		black nail plate streak. The case of a 79-year-old man who developed a solitary
		linear black streak on his right fourth fingernail after a prior history of
		recent trauma to the digit's nail folds is described; the fungal culture grew
		"Candida parapsilosis. Including our patient, Candida-associated longitudinal"
		melanonychia striata has been described in four women and two men ranging in age
		"from 40 to 79 years (median, 70 years) at diagnosis. The black streak, present"
		"from one month to one year (median, seven months), affected either a hand digit"
		(five patients) or the great toe (one patient). Fungal organisms were visualized
		"on either a potassium hydroxide preparation (one patient), pathologic evaluation"
		"of a nail plate specimen (three patients), or both (one patient). Culture grew"
		"Candida parapsilosis (two patients), Candida species (two patients), Candida"
		"albicans (one patient), and Candida tropicalis (one patient). All of the patients"
		experienced clinical improvement after treatment. Topical treatment (5%

		paint and 1% clotrimazole cream for one man) or oral itraconazole (either as
		monotherapy for two women or combined with 5% amorolfine hydrochloride nail
		lacquer for one woman) was successfully used. Although the clinical presentation
		of fungal melanonychia can mimic subungual melanoma when it appears as a solitary
		"black linear vertical nail plate streak, investigative studies--such as a"
		"potassium hydroxide preparation, nail plate pathology, nail matrix biopsy, and/or"
		fungal culture--can be used to establish the diagnosis of Candida-associated
		longitudinal melanonychia striata and exclude the diagnosis of a pigmented
		melanocytic tumor.

LID	-	907179
AB	-	Jejunoileal atresia (JIA) is one of the common etiologies of intestinal obtrusion
		"in neonates. However, cases of concomitant ileal atresia and Hirschsprung disease"
		(HD) rarely occur. We report the case of a male infant who had JIA concomitantly
		with HD that was re-anastomosed. The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy
		"to resect the dilated terminal ileum. Subsequently, owing to a significantly"
		"dilated proximal bowel, he underwent a second exploratory laparotomy. However, he"
		continued to have feeding intolerance postoperatively. He had colonic
		aganglionosis and was diagnosed with HD. A third laparotomy was then performed.
		"Additionally, he had recurrent episodes of gram-negative bacteremia, especially"
		"candida parapsilosis fungemia, despite receiving antibiotics and antifungal, and"
		"there were no identifiable underlying genetic or immunological causes. Finally,"
		"the patient had recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia, central hypothyroidism, and"
		multiple organ failure and died at the age of 7 months. The concomitant ileal
		"atresia and HD was thought to be due to a common intrauterine vascular accident,"
		"together with loss of bowel, thereby acting as a barrier for the caudal migration"
		"of neuromeric cells and leading to colonic aganglionosis. In this case, ileal"
		"atresia was associated with colonic aganglionosis, central hypothyroidism, and"
		"persistent bacteremia, which is a unique finding. In cases of JIA, persistent"
		poor bowel function after surgical correction of concomitant HD should be
		considered.

AB	-	"OBJECTIVES: To report a case of Acremonium keratitis treated with voriconazole,"
		"corneal collagen cross-linking, and corneal transplant. MATERIALS AND METHODS:"
		Case report. RESULTS: A 42-year-old woman who wore contact lenses daily was
		referred for refractory keratitis. Her main complaints were gritty sensation and
		"pain. At slit lamp biomicroscopy, an infiltrate on the inferior paracentral"
		cornea and an arcuate conjunctival ulceration were evident. The rest of the
		cornea was clear with no anterior chamber reaction. Scrapings from the corneal
		"ulcer showed Candida parapsilosis and Acremonium species, which were sensitive to"
		"voriconazole. Despite the administration of topical, systemic, and intrastromal"
		"voriconazole for 1 month, repeat corneal scraping was positive for Acremonium,"
		"and clinical appearance and pain did not resolve. Therefore, corneal collagen"
		cross-linking was applied. Although the pain resolved immediately after the
		"procedure, the lesion showed no improvement. After a month of cross-linking,"
		corneal transplant was performed for visual rehabilitation and treatment of the
		refractory lesion. The excised corneal button was negative for any
		microorganisms. CONCLUSIONS: Although corneal collagen cross-linking may be an
		"effective treatment for Acremonium keratitis refractory to medical therapy,"
		corneal transplant was required for visual gain and recovery.

LID	-	10.1111/myc.12719 [doi]
AB	-	Deep trichophytosis is relatively uncommon. The infection of the bearded area is
		also known as sycosis barbae or tinea barbae and can be caused by various fungal
		"species, most often zoophilic fungi. We report on an 80-year-old male patient"
		with severe sycosis barbae who had no animal contact and was treated with
		systemic antibiosis without improvement. Microbial and mycological investigations
		using swabs from oozing lesions revealed Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Candida
		parapsilosis. Histology demonstrated fungal elements in hair follicles.
		Paraffin-embedded material was subjected to further mycological analysis. For
		molecular diagnostics DNA was prepared from paraffin sections for real-time
		"polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). For sequencing, DNA was isolated from"
		paraffin-embedded skin tissue and the ITS region of the rDNA was selected.
		Sequencing of the ITS2 region of rRNA revealed a 100% accordance with
		Trichophyton (T.) verrucosum. Treatment with oral terbinafine achieved a complete
		remission. Sycosis barbae is an important differential diagnosis for infections
		of the bearded area. Nucleic acid amplification techniques (NAAT) are more and
		"more used for direct examination of dermatophytes in clinical samples, eg"
		T. verrucosum. NAAT are also used as culture confirmation tests for
		"identification of rare dermatophytes like T. verrucosum. Today, singleplex and"
		multiplex quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assays for the detection of the
		most common dermatophytes including T. verrucosum in clinical specimens are
		"available. Recently, an ITS2 PCR assay has been successfully used for direct"
		detection of T. verrucosum in paraffin-embedded formalin-fixed skin tissue. The
		PCR is fast and highly specific. The sensitivity of direct molecular detection of
		"the dermatophytes both in native clinical material, and in paraffin-embedded skin"
		tissue can been increased.

		"treatment of select deep-seated Candida infections, including complex"

AB	-	PURPOSE: To report two cases of microbial keratitis and/or endophthalmitis
		involving Granulicatella adiacens. METHODS: Case series. RESULTS: 24-year-old
		female with a history of Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and Candida parapsilosis
		keratitis presented with a geographic epithelial defect and infiltrate in the
		left eye. Cultures were positive for HSV-1 and G. adiacens. Keratitis resolved
		with topical vancomycin and oral valacyclovir. A 65-year-old female with a
		history of type II diabetes and failed therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty
		presented with inferior corneal graft haze and vitreous inflammation of the right
		eye. Therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty and pars plana vitrectomy were
		"performed, and the corneal button returned positive for G. adiacens. The patient"
		was treated with topical and intravitreal vancomycin as well as topical and
		systemic steroids. CONCLUSIONS: These cases expand the literature on G. adiacens
		keratitis and endophthalmitis and corroborate the role of steroid use and prior
		surgery as paramount risk factors.

AB	-	The use of central venous catheters (CVCs) in patients with cystic fibrosis is
		"associated with an increased incidence of right atrial thrombosis. Practically,"
		the management of CVC-related right atrial thrombosis presents a challenge as
		there are no clinical trials or systematic reviews in pediatric patients with
		cystic fibrosis. We describe a case of a 5-year-old child who presented with a
		CVC-related infection due to Candida parapsilosis. Echocardiogram revealed the
		"presence of an incidental thrombus, measuring 1.4 cm × 0.4 cm, at the tip of the"
		"catheter, adherent to the right atrial wall and discrete from the tricuspid valve"
		leaflets. Imaging was performed at monthly intervals and showed spontaneous
		resolution of the thrombus after six months. Follow-up blood cultures were
		"negative, and the course of the patient was uneventful."

		Surgeon's Nightmare.
LID	-	10.3390/diagnostics12071606 [doi]
LID	-	1606
AB	-	"Fungal prosthetic joint infections (PJIs), despite the fact that they are rare,"
		represent a devastating complication. Such infections in revised knee
		arthroplasties pose a unique surgical and medical challenge. A rare case of
		"Candida parapsilosis PJI in revised knee arthroplasty is reported. Furthermore, a"
		thorough review of all published fungal PJIs cases in revised knee arthroplasties
		is provided. A 72-year-old female with total knee replacement surgery due to
		"osteoarthritis 10 years ago, followed by two revision surgeries six and two years"
		"ago due to aseptic loosening, presented with signs and symptoms of septic"
		loosening of the knee components. Resection arthroplasty and cement-spacer
		placement was performed and periprosthetic tissue cultures yielded Candida
		parapsilosis. The patient was commenced on proper antifungal treatment (AFT) for
		six months and then the second stage of the revision surgery was performed
		"successfully. From 2000 to 2022, a total of 46 patients with median age 69 years"
		"[interquartile range (IQR = 10)], suffering fungal PJI occurring in revised knee"
		arthroplasty have been reported. The median time from initial arthroplasty to
		symptoms' onset was 12 months (IQR = 14). Cultures of local material (52.2%) and
		"histology (6.5%) were the reported diagnostic method, while Candida species were"
		"the most commonly isolated fungi. Regarding surgical management, two-stage"
		"revision arthroplasty (TSRA) was performed in most cases (54.3%), with median"
		"time-interval of six months (IQR = 6) between the two stages. Regarding AFT,"
		"fluconazole was the preferred antifungal compound (78.3%), followed by"
		voriconazole and amphotericin B (19.6% each). The median duration of AFT was five
		months (IQR = 4.5). Infection's outcome was successful in 38 cases (82.6%).
		"Fungal PJIs, especially in revised knee arthroplasties, are devastating"
		complications. A combination of AFT and TSRA seems to be the treatment of choice.
		"TSRA in these cases poses a special challenge, since major bone defects may be"
		"present. Therapeutic procedures remain unclear, thus additional research is"
		needed.

AB	-	The blood alcohol concentration (BAC) is the most frequent determination in a
		"Forensic Toxicology Laboratory. Despite its apparent simplicity, the results"
		interpretation can be complex and always have relevant social and legal
		"implications, particularly in postmortem analysis. In the present report we"
		describe the case of a 55-year-old male with an apparent natural death by
		"myocardial infarction, whose initial BAC was 0.18g/L but, in repeated"
		"determinations prompted by discrepancies observed in the first two, it rapidly"
		"increased to 0.85g/L three days later, leading to the suspicion of in vitro"
		ethanol production. A microbiological examination of the sample revealed the
		"presence of the bacteria Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, and yeast"
		"Candida parapsilosis, known for their involvement in ethanol production. Although"
		"this is a case report and it is not meant to be generalizable, we discuss an"
		"existing large body of scientific literature showing the difficulties,"
		limitations and some relevant medico-legal questions regarding BAC determinations
		"in postmortem samples and their interpretation, particularly in the context of"
		plausible in vitro ethanol production. The key conclusion is that evaluating a
		postmortem BAC is a complex and multifactorial process that always deserves a
		thorough analysis and a careful interpretation.

TI	-	Candidal periprosthetic joint infection after primary total knee arthroplasty
		combined with ipsilateral intertrochanteric fracture: A case report.
PG	-	5401-5408
LID	-	10.12998/wjcc.v8.i21.5401 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Candidal periprosthetic joint infection is a rare and difficult to
		diagnose complication of total knee arthroplasty. The treatment of such
		"complications is inconclusive and may include prosthesis removal, debridement,"
		"arthrodesis, and extensive antifungal therapy to control the infection. CASE"
		SUMMARY: A 62-year-old male with a history of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in
		his left knee presented with ipsilateral knee pain and a sinus discharge 20 mo
		"after TKA. The patient was previously evaluated for left knee pain, swelling, and"
		a transient fever one month postoperatively. Prothesis removal and insertion of a
		cement spacer were performed in a local hospital six months prior to the current
		presentation. Medical therapy included rifampicin and amphotericin which were
		administered for 4 wk following prosthesis removal. A second debridement was
		performed in our hospital and Candida parapsilosis was detected in the knee
		"joint. Fourteen weeks following the latter debridement, the patient suffered a"
		left intertrochanteric fracture and received closed reduction and internal
		fixation with proximal femoral nail anterotation. Two weeks after fracture
		"surgery, a knee arthrodesis with autograft was performed using a double-plate"
		fixation. The patient recovered adequately and was subsequently discharged. At
		"the two-year follow-up, the patient has a stable gait with a pain-free, fused"
		knee. CONCLUSION: Fungal periprosthetic joint infection following TKA may be
		"successfully and safely treated with prosthesis removal, exhaustive debridement,"
		and arthrodesis after effective antifungal therapy. Ipsilateral intertrochanteric
		fractures of the affected knee can be safely fixated with internal fixation if
		the existing infection is clinically excluded and aided by the investigation of
		serum inflammatory markers.

TI	-	Candida Spondylitis Considered as Microbial Substitution After Multiple Surgeries
		for Postoperative Lumbar Spine Infection.
PG	-	e14995
LID	-	10.7759/cureus.14995 [doi]
LID	-	e14995
AB	-	Candida spondylitis is a relatively rare disease. The primary risk factor is an
		"immunocompromised status. Here, we report an immunocompetent patient who"
		developed Candida spondylitis. The patient was a 70-year-old male. After multiple
		"surgeries, he developed a fever and was diagnosed with chronic pyogenic"
		"spondylitis of the lumbar spine, which was treated by long-term antimicrobial"
		"therapy. However, his back pain persisted and the inflammatory response was"
		prolonged. We performed posterior thoracolumbar pelvic fixation with a
		percutaneous pedicle screw system to stabilize the infected vertebral bodies and
		simultaneously performed a full-endoscopic intervertebral disc biopsy to identify
		the causative organisms. Candida parapsilosis was identified from a fungal
		culture of the biopsy specimen. The patient was diagnosed with Candida
		spondylitis and started on antifungal treatment with fluconazole. His back pain
		"disappeared quickly after surgery, and up to the time of this writing, the"
		patient has continued to receive fluconazole. We attributed the development of
		Candida spondylitis to the patient's long-term antibiotic treatment of a
		"postoperative infection of the lumbar spine, which was associated with multiple"
		"back surgeries. Fungal spondylitis, including spondylitis caused by Candida spp.,"
		"should be suspected in patients, even immunocompetent patients, with intractable"
		postoperative spinal infections and pyogenic spondylitis due to microbial
		substitution. Long-term antimicrobial therapy without definitive identification
		of the causative organism of a postoperative infection of the lumbar spine that
		is associated with multiple surgeries can be a cause of Candida spondylitis. A
		biopsy is strongly recommended for the definitive diagnosis.

TI	-	Thymic hypoplasia and T-cell deficiency in ectodermal dysplasia: case report and
		review of the literature.
PG	-	44-52
AB	-	Ectodermal dysplasia is a heterogeneous disorder that includes a constellation of
		congenital malformations occasionally associated with mild to moderate immune
		"dysfunction. In this report, we describe a female infant with ectodermal"
		dysplasia who was found to have thymic hypoplasia but no other phenotypic
		features of the DiGeorge anomalad. She experienced Candida parapsilosis sepsis at
		1 week of age and a skin infection with Mycobacterium chelonii at 6 months. The
		numbers of blood B cells were normal and serum immunoglobulins normal to slightly
		"reduced, but serum antibody responses of all immunoglobulin isotypes to protein"
		immunogens were absent. Blood T cells were profoundly reduced and proliferative
		"responses of T cells to mitogens were blunted. In contrast, there was an"
		increased number of natural killer (NK) cells and increased NK activity in the
		"blood. Over the first year of life, some of the immunodeficiencies resolved."
		"Although the numbers of blood T cells (17% of total lymphocytes) remained low,"
		proliferative responses to mitogens normalized and specific antibody responses
		improved. It seems likely that the thymic hypoplasia in this case was due to a
		"paucity of ectodermal elements in the developing thymus, and that the immune"
		"defects were largely secondary to that event. In that respect, this human model"
		of ectodermal dysplasia and thymic hypoplasia resembled the ectodermal/thymic
		defects found in the nude mouse.
