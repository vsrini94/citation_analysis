TI	-	Identification of the first case of Penicillium marneffei infection in Shaanxi
		province by nanopore sequencing.
PG	-	575-579
LID	-	10.3855/jidc.15348 [doi]
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Penicillium marneffei is one of the most common opportunistic
		infectious fungi associated with AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome). It is
		"prevalent in Southeast Asia and southern China (such as Guangdong), but rare in"
		inland provinces of China. Penicillium marneffei infections are often
		"misdiagnosed. CASE REPORT: Here, we report a patient with Penicillium marneffei"
		"infection from Shaanxi Province, China, who was previously repeatedly diagnosed"
		as Kala-azar in two hospitals. The patient received medical treatment due to
		"fever and multiple papules, worked as a tour guide, and had travel history in"
		Southeast Asian countries. We performed nanopore genome sequencing on blood
		"samples of the patient and obtained 84,000 reads in 3.5 hours. The average length"
		of the sequences was 7088.7 bases and the longest sequence was 87471 bases.
		"Through comparison with the pathogenic bacteria database, 13 homologous"
		"Penicillium marneffei sequences were identified. Furthermore, by using specific"
		"quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction of Penicillium marneffei, fungal"
		"ITS (Internal Transcribed Spacer) sequencing, and fungal biphasic culture, we"
		"further confirmed the pathogen as Penicillium marneffei. Meanwhile, the patient"
		"was confirmed to be HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) positive. Thus, the"
		"patient was diagnosed with AIDS combined with Penicillium marneffei infection,"
		"which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first report of Penicillium marneffei"
		"infection in Shaanxi Province, China. CONCLUSIONS: Metagenomic analysis based on"
		nanopore sequencing provides an important reference for the diagnosis of
		Penicillium marneffei infection in this case.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal involvement is not uncommon in patients with
		"disseminated talaromycosis, but successful management of massive gastrointestinal"
		bleeding and hemorrhagic shock secondary to talaromycosis is rarely reported.
		Clinical management strategies for these patients have not been well documented.
		"CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we reported a case of disseminated talaromycosis with"
		recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding and hemorrhagic shock who was successfully
		alleviated solely with medical treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Early diagnosis and
		"treatment for Talaromyces marneffei, intravenous fluid resuscitation, hemostatic"
		therapy and blood transfusion are all essential for talaromycosis complicated
		with gastrointestinal bleeding and hemorrhagic shock. It is also necessary to
		warn about the possibility of bleeding induced or aggravated by endoscopic biopsy
		trauma.

LID	-	10.2174/1573405618666220811120308 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Talaromyces marneffei (T. marneffei) is a heat-dimorphic fungus that
		"commonly causes fatal opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients,"
		such as those with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. In this case
		"report, Case Presentation: we describe a case of intracranial infection of"
		T.marneffei in a 42-year-old AIDS patient. Contrast enhanced MRI showed the left
		"occipital lobe mass with ring enhancement, MRS showed elevated AAs and Lip waves"
		in the mass. Surgical resection of occipital lobe confirmed the lesion to be
		T.marneffei infection and possibly with tuberculosis after pathological
		examination. Patients with Intracranial ring enhancing space-occupying lesions on
		MRI should be considered of intracranial T. marneffei infection.Intracranial
		T.marneffei infection is relatively rare reported and recent studied. CONCLUSION:
		The MRI in this case suggests that ring enhancement mass and elevated AAs and Lip
		waves are helpful in the diagnosis of T.marneffei infection.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Talaromyces marneffei (TM) bloodstream infection is common in
		Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) patients with extreme immunodeficiency
		"in Southeast Asia and South China, however, clinical case study on TM bloodstream"
		infection is scarce. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics of
		TM bloodstream infection in hospitalized AIDS patients and determined the
		outcomes of hospitalization after diagnosis in our hospital over the past
		"5 years. METHODS: From January 2015 to July 2020, 87 cases of TM detected by"
		blood culture in patients admitted to our center were collected. The admission
		"complaints, blood cells, biochemistry, CD4 and CD8 cell counts and 1,3-β-D-glucan"
		"(BDG), procalcitonin (PCT), CRP level on the day of blood culture test, and"
		outcomes during hospitalization were analyzed. Logistic regression analysis was
		performed for the risk factors for poor prognosis (60 cases). Spearman
		correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlation between peripheral blood
		"cells, albumin and the time required for TM turnaround in blood culture. The"
		difference was statistically significant when the P value was < 0.05. RESULTS: A
		"total of 87 patients were collected, with a median age of 34 years, a median"
		hemoglobin of 94 g/L and CD4 count of 7/μl. The rate of TM bloodstream infection
		among all in-hospital patients increased from 0.99% in 2015 to 2.09% in 2020(half
		year). Patients with TM bloodstream infection with CD8 count < 200/μl had a
		12.6-fold higher risk of poor prognosis than those with CD8 count > 200/μl
		"(p = 0.04), and those with BDG < 100 pg/mL had a 34.9-fold higher risk of poor"
		prognosis than those with BDG > 100 pg/mL (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: TM bloodstream
		infection is becoming more common in advanced AIDS patients in endemic areas. For
		those patients with extremely low CD4 and CD8 cell counts below 200/μl is with an
		increased risk of poor prognosis.

LID	-	964
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Talaromyces marneffei (TM) primarily infects patients with
		"co-morbidities that cause immunodeficiency, but non-secretory myeloma (NSMM) is"
		"rare. TSM and NSMM are associated with fever, osteolysis, and swollen lymph"
		"nodes, thereby making it difficult for clinicians to make differential diagnosis."
		"In this case, we describe TM infection coexisting with NSMM. CASE PRESENTATION:"
		We retrospectively reviewed the case of a male (without human immunodeficiency
		"virus infection) with fever, thoracalgia, swollen lymph nodes, and subcutaneous"
		nodules who presented to the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical
		University in February 2014. Chest computed tomography revealed patchy
		infiltration and positron emission tomography/computed tomography showed
		"increased metabolic activity in the lower-right lung, lymph nodes, left ninth"
		"rib, and right ilium. Pathological examination of the lung, lymph nodes,"
		"subcutaneous nodules, and bone marrow showed no malignancy, he was diagnosed with"
		community-acquired pneumonia. His clinical symptoms did not improve after
		"anti-bacterial, anti-Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and anti-non-M. tuberculosis"
		"treatment. Later, etiological culture and pathological examination of the"
		"subcutaneous nodule proved TM infection, and the patient was re-diagnosed with"
		"disseminated TSM, which involved the lungs, lymph nodes, skin, bone, and"
		"subcutaneous tissue. After antifungal treatment, the patient showed significant"
		"improvement, except for the pain in his bones. Imaging showed aggravated"
		"osteolysis, and bone marrow biopsy and immunohistochemistry indicated NSMM. Thus,"
		"we conclusively diagnosed the case as NSMM with TSM (involving the lungs, lymph"
		"nodes, skin, and subcutaneous tissue). His condition improved after chemotherapy,"
		and he was symptom-free for 7 years. CONCLUSION: TM infection is rare in
		"individual with NSMM. Since they have clinical manifestation in common, easily"
		"causing misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis, multiple pathological examinations and"

		"opportunistic fungal pathogen Talaromyces marneffei and Kaposi sarcoma, a common"
		"vascular tumor, is a rare but severe medical condition in patients infected with"
		"the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Despite poor outcomes, the clinical"
		characteristics and management strategies for HIV-infected patients with comorbid
		Kaposi sarcoma and talaromycosis have not been well documented. CASE
		PRESENTATION: A 33-year-old HIV-positive male patient presented to the Department
		"of Infectious Diseases at Wenzhou Central Hospital with cough, sputum"
		"expectoration, hemoptysis, rashes on the feet and violaceous plaques in the oral"
		"cavity. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed bilateral nodules, patchy shadows"
		and lymphadenectasis. Skin biopsy and histopathological examination indicated
		Kaposi sarcoma. T. marneffei was isolated from blood cultures and suggested
		talaromycosis. The patient's overall conditions significantly improved following
		initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and chemotherapy for
		Kaposi sarcoma and antifungal treatment for talaromycosis. CONCLUSION: Severe
		medical conditions such as Kaposi sarcoma and talaromycosis may coexist in
		HIV-infected patients and pose an increased risk of mortality. Etiological
		diagnosis and treatment are the keys to the successful management of HIV-infected
		patients with these concurrent conditions.

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: Talaromycosis is an invasive mycosis endemic to Southeast Asia. This
		"study aimed to investigate the epidemiology, clinical features and prognostic"
		"factors of HIV-associated talaromycosis in Guangdong, China. METHODS: We"
		retrospectively evaluated HIV patients hospitalized with histopathology- or
		culture-confirmed talaromycosis between 2011 and 2017. Factors associated with
		"poor prognosis were identified using logistic regression. RESULTS: Overall, 1079"
		patients with HIV-associated talaromycosis were evaluated. Both the number and
		prevalence of talaromycosis among HIV admissions increased from 125 and 15.7% in
		"2011 to 253 and 18.8% in 2017, respectively, reflecting the increase in HIV"
		admissions. Annual admissions peaked during the rainy season between March and
		"August. Common clinical manifestations included fever (85.6%), peripheral"
		"lymphadenopathy (72.3%), respiratory symptoms (60.8%), weight loss (49.8%), skin"
		lesions (44.5%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (44.3%). Common laboratory
		"abnormalities were hypoalbuminaemia (98.6%), anaemia (95.6%), elevated aspartate"
		"aminotransferase level (AST) (76.9%), elevated alkaline phosphatase level (55.8%)"
		and thrombocytopenia (53.7%). The median CD4 count was 9 cells/μL. Talaromyces
		marneffei was isolated from blood and bone marrow cultures of 66.6% and 74.5% of
		"patients, respectively. The rate increased to 86.6% when both cultures were"
		"performed concurrently. At discharge, 14% of patients showed worsening conditions"
		"or died. Leucocytosis, thrombocytopenia, elevated AST, total bilirubin,"
		creatinine and azole monotherapy independently predicted poor prognosis.
		CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of HIV-associated talaromycosis has increased in
		Guangdong with the high HIV burden in China. Skin lesions were seen in less than
		half of patients. Induction therapy with azole alone is associated with higher
		mortality. Findings from this study should help to improve treatment of the
		disease.

PG	-	8437-8447
LID	-	10.21037/apm-20-2056 [doi]
AB	-	This study aimed to report the clinical characteristics of penicilliosis
		marneffei (PSM) in three children negative to HIV. Three children were diagnosed
		"with PSM in the Department of Emergency Medicine, Hunan Children's Hospital"
		"between February 2016 to July 2020. The clinical characteristics, laboratory"
		"findings, and concomitant diseases were recorded, and the related literatures"
		were reviewed. The clinical characteristics and treatment of PSM were reported
		according to our experience and literature review. The initial symptom was right
		lower limb mass in 1 child (first) who developed fever and cough about 1 month
		later and then was misdiagnosed with tuberculosis. The other child (second) had a
		"fever, reductions in red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets,"
		"hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenectasis. The third child had fever, jaundice,"
		"multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), hepatosplenomegaly and"
		lymphadenectasis. The first child (Case 1) had STAT1 gene mutation on genetic
		"examination, and the second child (Case 2) had history of onychomycosis and oral"
		"ulcer, the third child (Case 3) had STAT3 gene mutation on genetic examination,"
		diagnosed with Hyperimmunoglobulin E syndromes (HIES). PSM was confirmed in all
		cases by the culture bone marrow. All three cases were diagnosed through
		medulloculture. Case 1 and Case 2 also had lymph node biopsy. Case 3 had sputum
		culture and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). The first child was
		"intravenously administered with voriconazole and amphotericin B liposomes, and"
		"orally administered with itraconazole for maintenance therapy, which was"
		discontinued 1 year later. The second child was administered with voriconazole
		intravenously and thereafter orally for a total of 7 months. Recurrence was not
		observed. The third child was given amphotericin B for 2 days (discontinued due
		"to liver dysfunction), and intravenous voriconazole for 4 days. The patient gave"
		"up therapy finally. In conclusion, HIV negative children can also develop PSM,"
		and may be related to the STAT1/STAT3 gene mutation. For children having no
		"response to antibiotic or antiviral therapy, bacterial/fungal culture or biopsy"
		"should be performed as soon as possible to confirm the diagnosis, and physicians"
		"should actively identify the underlying diseases of PSM patients, which is"
		"beneficial for the early diagnosis, early treatment and improvement of prognosis."

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: Talaromycosis is a serious regional disease endemic in Southeast Asia.
		"In China, Talaromyces marneffei (T. marneffei) infections is mainly concentrated"
		"in the southern region, especially in Guangxi, and cause considerable in-hospital"
		"mortality in HIV-infected individuals. Currently, the factors that influence"
		in-hospital death of HIV/AIDS patients with T. marneffei infection are not
		completely clear. Existing machine learning techniques can be used to develop a
		predictive model to identify relevant prognostic factors to predict death and
		appears to be essential to reducing in-hospital mortality. METHODS: We
		prospectively enrolled HIV/AIDS patients with talaromycosis in the Fourth
		"People's Hospital of Nanning, Guangxi, from January 2012 to June 2019. Clinical"
		features were selected and used to train four different machine learning models
		"(logistic regression, XGBoost, KNN, and SVM) to predict the treatment outcome of"
		"hospitalized patients, and 30% internal validation was used to evaluate the"
		performance of models. Machine learning model performance was assessed according
		"to a range of learning metrics, including area under the receiver operating"
		characteristic curve (AUC). The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) tool was
		used to explain the model. RESULTS: A total of 1927 HIV/AIDS patients with T.
		marneffei infection were included. The average in-hospital mortality rate was
		13.3% (256/1927) from 2012 to 2019. The most common complications/coinfections
		"were pneumonia (68.9%), followed by oral candida (47.5%), and tuberculosis"
		"(40.6%). Deceased patients showed higher CD4/CD8 ratios, aspartate"
		"aminotransferase (AST) levels, creatinine levels, urea levels, uric acid (UA)"
		"levels, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, total bilirubin levels, creatine"
		"kinase levels, white blood-cell counts (WBC) counts, neutrophil counts,"
		procaicltonin levels and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and lower CD3+ T-cell
		"count, CD8+ T-cell count, and lymphocyte counts, platelet (PLT), high-density"
		"lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), hemoglobin (Hb) levels than those of surviving"
		"patients. The predictive XGBoost model exhibited 0.71 sensitivity, 0.99"
		"specificity, and 0.97 AUC in the training dataset, and our outcome prediction"
		"model provided robust discrimination in the testing dataset, showing an AUC of"
		0.90 with 0.69 sensitivity and 0.96 specificity. The other three models were
		ruled out due to poor performance. Septic shock and respiratory failure were the
		"most important predictive features, followed by uric acid, urea, platelets, and"
		the AST/ALT ratios. CONCLUSION: The XGBoost machine learning model is a good
		predictor in the hospitalization outcome of HIV/AIDS patients with T. marneffei
		infection. The model may have potential application in mortality prediction and
		high-risk factor identification in the talaromycosis population.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Talaromyces marneffei is an opportunistic pathogen that infects
		immunodeficient and immunocompromised patients. We presented a pediatric patient
		with a diagnosis of T. marneffei infection who was followed up in the Guangzhou
		Women and Children's Medical Centre. CASE PRESENTATION: The child was a
		5-year-old girl with persistent cough and gasping over 2 months who was confirmed
		with T. marneffei infection by bronchoalveolar lavage fluid culture and
		high-throughput sequencing technology. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was
		negative according to a serum-specific antibody test. She was treated with
		"amphotericin B and itraconazole as antifungal agents, with good clinical"
		"response. At follow-up, high-resolution computed tomography showed a mosaic sign"
		in the whole lung field with a diagnosis of post-infectious bronchiolitis
		obliterans (PIBO) as the sequela. She has a mutated COPA gene with uncertain
		pathogenic potential on whole-exome sequencing. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should
		consider PIBO as a possible sequela in an HIV-negative paediatric patient with T.
		marneffei infection.

AB	-	Talaromyces marneffei (T. marneffei) is one of the most important opportunistic
		"human pathogens endemic in Southeast Asia. Talaromycosis, which was once regarded"
		as an opportunistic infectious disease in patients with acquired immunodeficiency
		"syndrome, is being increasingly reported in HIV-negative populations. Since T."
		"marneffei infection can be localized or disseminated, patients may present with a"
		"variety of symptoms. However, mediastinal infection attributed to T. marneffei is"
		extremely rare. We report the case of a 32-year-old female who manifested a large
		mediastinal mass and was eventually diagnosed as acute T. marneffei
		mediastinitis. The patient was HIV-negative and had no direct contact with
		intermediate hosts. We successfully managed to treat the patient with inhaled
		amphotericin B deoxycholate and observed lesion absorption in subsequent CT
		"examinations. To our knowledge, this is the first published case of T. marneffei"
		mediastinitis and first use of inhaled antifungal monotherapy on patients with T.
		marneffei infection.

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: The study objective was to assess the lethality rates and the
		predictive factors for death in AIDS patients infected by Penicillium marneffei
		"(Pm) in Hai Phong, Vietnam. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted"
		by reviewing 103 medicals records of confirmed cases from June 2006 to August
		2009. RESULTS: Penicilliosis-related mortality was very high (33%). The majors
		"risk factors of death were: (i) patient lacking complete treatment, a regimen"
		"with both of secondary prophylaxis by itraconazole and HAART (OR=52.2, P<0.001);"
		"(ii) patients having received only secondary prophylaxis (OR=21.2, P<0.001);"
		"(iii) patients coinfected by hepatitis C (OR=2.3, P=0.02) and tuberculosis"
		"(OR=1.97, P=0.04). Penicilliosis occurred in 28 cases after initiation of ART,"
		"probably caused by IRIS, with the same signs and symptoms as ""common"""
		"penicilliosis. However, the diagnosis of IRIS was ruled out because the viral"
		load could not be assessed. CONCLUSIONS: Penicilliosis is very frequent in the
		North of Vietnam. A good compliance to a complete treatment with healing
		antifungal (Amphotericin B) then secondary prophylaxis (Itraconazole) associate
		"with ART, prolongs survival, prevents relapse, and also allows discontinuing a"
		secondary prophylaxis in a half of the cases.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: The incidence of Taralomyces marneffei infection in HIV-infected
		"individuals has been decreasing, whereas its rate is rising among non-HIV"
		"immunodeficient persons, particularly patients with anti-interferon-gamma"
		"autoantibodies. T. marneffei usually causes invasive and disseminated infections,"
		including fungemia. T. marneffei oro-pharyngo-laryngitis is an unusual
		manifestation of talaromycosis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 52-year-old Thai woman had
		"been diagnosed anti-IFNɣ autoantibodies for 4 years. She had a sore throat,"
		"odynophagia, and hoarseness for 3 weeks. She also had febrile symptoms and lost"
		5 kg in weight. Physical examination revealed marked swelling and hyperemia of
		"both sides of the tonsils, the uvula and palatal arches including a swelling of"
		"the epiglottis, and arytenoid. The right tonsillar biopsy exhibited a few"
		intracellular oval and elongated yeast-like organisms with some central
		"transverse septum seen, which subsequently grew a few colonies of T. marneffei on"
		fungal cultures. The patient received amphotericin B deoxycholate 45 mg/dayfor
		"1 weeks, followed by oral itraconazole 400 mg/day for several months. Her"
		symptoms completely resolved without complication. CONCLUSION: In patients with
		"anti-IFN-ɣ autoantibodies, T. marneffei can rarely cause a local infection"
		involving oropharynx and larynx. Fungal culture and pathological examination are
		warranted for diagnosis T. marneffei oro-pharyngo-laryngitis. This condition
		requires a long term antifungal therapy.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Talaromyces Marneffei (Penicillium marneffei, T.marneffei) has been"
		frequently reported in patients with adult acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
		"Still, cases of children with HIV combined with T.marneffei infection are very"
		rare. This report describes the case of a HIV-child who is a girl from China. Her
		special clinical manifestations and laboratory diagnosis results can provide
		clinicians with the basis for diagnosis and treatment of T.marneffei related rare
		diseases. CASE PRESNTATION: We reported a single case of 7-year-old Chinese
		"female patient who presented with fever, abdominal pain, multiple"
		"lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, left lower extremity ecchymosis, and bloody"
		"stool. The patient received anti-inflammatory therapy; however, her symptoms did"
		"not improve. Consequently, she was diagnosed with T.marneffei and HIV infection;"
		it was also confirmed that her mother did not undergo HIV blocking therapy during
		"pregnancy. Yet, the child's family refused all treatment, after which the child"
		was discharged from the hospital. The patient died a few days later. CONCLUSION:
		"This case suggested that children with AIDS suffering from fever, lymphadenopathy"
		"and coagulation dysfunction, penicilliosis should be suspected. Clinicians should"
		"diagnose the disease early through laboratory and imaging results, which can help"
		"reduce the mortality, prolong the survival time and improve the quality of life"
		of children.

AB	-	Talaromycosis is a rare deep fungal infection caused by Talaromyces marneffei.
		"Currently, methamphetamine has become the second-largest drug abuse category in"
		the world after cannabis and has become a serious public health problem.
		Methamphetamine can inhibit human immune system and increase the probability of
		"pathogenic microorganism infection. On 8 October 2016, a 20-year-old man with a"
		fever history of 2 months was admitted to our hospital. He had bloody stools and
		abdominal pain during hospitalization. There was no significant abnormality in
		"physical examination. Because of the misdiagnosis, he underwent improper"
		treatment. Periodic acid-Schiff stain (PAS) staining showed that the mucosa of
		"distal ileum, ascending colon, transverse colon, and sigmoid colon were"
		"infiltrated by a large number of tissue cells, which contained a large number of"
		"blue purple particles. In addition, a large number of histiocytes and"
		"multinucleated giant cells can be seen in the lamina propria of ileum mucosa, and"
		"fungal spores can be seen in histiocytes. Finally, he was diagnosed as"
		"talaromycosis and took itraconazole 0.2 g twice a day. After 5 days, the"
		"temperature dropped to normal and the inflammation disappeared, and he continued"
		to take itraconazole for 6 months. Due to the neglect of the history of drug
		"abuse and the concealment, drug-related talaromycosis is often misdiagnosed."
		Pathological examination is warranted for diagnosis talaromycosis. This condition
		requires a long-term anti-fungal therapy.

		"profiled. In this study, we report the clinical characteristics, molecular"
		"epidemiology, rapid identification and antifungal susceptibilities of"

		cases of talaromycosis were observed since commencement of hospital service in
		"2012. Three patients were local Shenzhen residents, whereas the other four were"
		"immigrants from other parts of China. Two patients were HIV-negative, but with"
		underlying diseases requiring immunosuppressive therapy. Two of the seven
		patients succumbed. All the seven isolates were successfully identified as
		T. marneffei by MALDI-TOF MS using Bruker database expanded with in-house
		generated T. marneffei mass spectra. MLST showed that the seven strains belonged
		"to six different, novel sequences types. Phylogenetic analyses of the"
		concatenated five-locus sequence revealed that the seven strains were scattered
		"amongst other T. marneffei strains. The MICs of itraconazole, isavuconazole,"
		posaconazole and voriconazole against the seven clinical isolates were low but
		MICs of anidulafungin were high. Underlying diseases other than HIV infection are
		increasingly important risk factors of talaromycosis. MALDI-TOF MS is useful for
		rapid identification. Highly diverse T. marneffei sequence types were observed.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Although the widespread use of modern antiretroviral therapy (ART)
		"has reduced the incidence of talaromycosis in people living with HIV, mortality"
		"remains as high as 20% in this population, even after appropriate antifungal"
		treatment. OBJECTIVES: The objective of our study was to develop a risk
		"assessment system for HIV-infected patients with comorbid talaromycosis, in order"
		"to provide these patients with appropriate, effective and potentially life-saving"
		interventions at an early stage of their illness. PATIENTS/METHODS: This was a
		"multicentre, retrospective cohort study conducted in China. We built a predictive"
		"model based on data from 11 hospitals, and a validated model using the data of 1"
		hospital located in an endemic area. RESULTS: Forward stepwise multivariate
		"statistical calculations indicated that age, aspartate aminotransferase/alanine"
		"transaminase ratio and albumin levels, and BUN levels were valid, independent"
		predictors of the risk of death in HIV-infected patients with talaromycosis. Our
		developed and validated risk scoring system is effective for the identification
		of HIV-infected patients with talaromycosis at high risk of death at hospital
		"admission (p < .001; AUC = 0.860). In our study, our risk prediction model"
		provided functional and robust discrimination in the validation cohort (p < .001;
		AUC = 0.793). CONCLUSION: The prognostic scoring system for mortality assessment
		developed in the present study is an easy-to-use clinical tool designed to
		accurately assist clinicians in identifying high-risk patients with
		talaromycosis.

AB	-	Talaromyces marneffei is a thermally dimorphic fungus that affects multiple
		"organs and frequently invades immunocompromised individuals. However, only a few"
		studies have reported the presence of intestinal infection associated with T.
		"marneffei. Herein, we reported a case of intestinal T. marneffei infection in a"
		"man who complained of a 1-month history of intermittent fever, abdominal pain,"
		and diarrhea. The result of the human immunodeficiency virus antibody test was
		positive. Periodic acid-Schiff and Gomorrah's methylamine silver staining of the
		"intestinal biopsy tissue revealed T. marneffei infection. Fortunately, the"
		patient's symptoms rapidly resolved with prompt antifungal treatment. In
		"addition, we summarized and described the clinical characteristics, management,"
		and outcomes of patients with intestinal T. marneffei infection. A total of 29
		"patients were identified, the majority of whom (65.52%) were comorbid with"
		"acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The main clinical features included anemia,"
		"fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy. The transverse"
		"and descending colon, ileocecum, and ascending colon were the most common sites"
		of lesions. A considerable number of patients (31.03%) developed intestinal
		"obstruction, intestinal perforation, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Of the 29"
		"patients, six underwent surgery, 23 survived successfully with antifungal"
		"treatment, five died of T. marneffei infection, and one died of unknown causes."
		T. marneffei intestinal infection should be considered when immunodeficient
		"patients in endemic areas present with non-specific symptoms, such as fever,"
		"abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Appropriate and timely endoscopy avoids delays in"
		diagnosis. Early aggressive antifungal therapy improves the clinical outcomes of
		patients.

PG	-	e8-e19
LID	-	10.1093/cid/cir754 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Penicillium marneffei infection is indigenous to Southeast Asia.
		"Majority of penicilliosis occurs in patients with AIDS, and less commonly with"
		"secondary immunodeficiencies. Penicilliosis is rare in otherwise healthy persons,"
		but information on their immunological status is often lacking. METHODS: From
		"1996 to 2009, we diagnosed penicilliosis in 5 children. Their clinical features,"
		"immunological findings, and genetic studies were analyzed. A systematic review of"
		the English and Chinese literature was performed. Case reports/series on patients
		"<18 years with penicilliosis were included, and patients stated to be human"
		immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive excluded. RESULTS: All of our 5 patients
		"were HIV negative. Presentations included fungemia (n = 2), multifocal"
		"lymphadenopathy (n = 2), and necrotizing pneumonia (n = 1). Four patients had"
		recurrent mucocutaneous candidiasis. Hyperimmunoglobin E syndrome was diagnosed
		"in 1 patient, while another had functional defect in interleukin-12/interferon-γ"
		"axis. Three patients were lymphopenic with low natural killer cell counts, but a"
		specific immune defect was not identified. Systematic review of 509 reports on
		human penicilliosis identified 32 patients aged 3 months to 16 years with no
		"known HIV infection. Twenty-four patients (75%) had disseminated disease, and 55%"
		died of penicilliosis. Eight patients had primary immunodeficiencies or blood
		"disorders, while 4 others had abnormal immune functions. Immune evaluations of"
		the remaining patients were unstated. CONCLUSION: Penicilliosis is a severe
		"disease causing high mortality in children. As an AIDS-defining illness,"
		penicilliosis should be regarded as an indicator for underlying immunodeficiency
		"in HIV-negative individuals. Immunological investigations should be performed,"
		especially in those with recurrent infections. Multicentered collaborative
		studies are needed to collect information on long-term prognosis and define
		immune defects underlying penicilliosis.

		a Non-HIV Case.
PG	-	3619-3625
LID	-	10.2147/IDR.S316881 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Mycobacterium fortuitum is a rapidly growing non-tuberculous
		"mycobacterium (NTM) with weak pathogenicity. Here, we present a rare case of"
		disseminated M. fortuitum and Talaromyces marneffei coinfection in a human
		immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative patient. CASE PRESENTATION: A 28-year-old
		female was admitted to our hospital due to 2 months of swelling of lymph nodes on
		"the right side of her cervix, accompanied by repeated low fever for more than 1"
		month. Biopsy of the right cervical lymph node and endobronchial
		ultrasound-guided transbronchial fine needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) both
		suggested granulomatous inflammation. The bacterial culture and mycobacteria
		examination of the lesion as well as HIV antibody test were all negative.
		Disseminated T. marneffei infection was diagnosed by the quantitative polymerase
		chain reaction (qPCR) results from the blood showing 1798 copies/ul. In the
		"meantime, treatment with amphotericin B combined with cefoxitin was administered"
		"for suspected NTM infection. However, the once-dropped fever recurred and the"
		lymph nodes continued to swell. Metagenomics next-generation sequencing (mNGS)
		detection of the lymph nodes indicated M. fortuitum. After combination treatment
		"with amphotericin B, voriconazole, linazolamide, and imipenem, the patient's body"
		"temperature returned to normal, the lymph node swelling was gradually reduced,"
		and the lung lesion was absorbed. CONCLUSION: We report the first case of an
		HIV-negative patient diagnosed with disseminated M. fortuitum and T. marneffei
		"coinfection with nonspecific clinical manifestation, in order to heighten"
		awareness of these infections.

PG	-	2137-2147
LID	-	10.3201/eid2609.200016 [doi]
AB	-	We conducted a systematic literature review to obtain risk population-based
		fungal disease incidence or prevalence data from China. Data were categorized by
		risk factors and extrapolated by using most recent demographic figures. A total
		"of 71,316,101 cases (5.0% of the population) were attributed to 12 risk factors"
		"and 17 fungal diseases. Excluding recurrent Candida vaginitis (4,057/100,000"
		"women) and onychomycosis (2,600/100,000 persons), aspergillosis (317/100,000"
		persons) was the most common problem; prevalence exceeded that in most other
		"countries. Cryptococcal meningitis, an opportunistic infection, occurs in"
		immunocompetent persons almost twice as often as AIDS. The pattern of fungal
		infections also varies geographically; Talaromyces marneffei is distributed
		"mainly in the Pearl River Basin, and the Yangtze River bears the greatest"
		"histoplasmosis burden. New host populations, new endemic patterns, and high"
		"fungal burdens in China, which caused a huge impact on public health, underscore"
		the urgent need for building diagnostic and therapeutic capacity.

		Standard BACTEC Blood Culture in the Diagnosis of Talaromycosis.
PG	-	e330-e336
LID	-	10.1093/cid/ciaa826 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Talaromycosis is an invasive mycosis endemic in Southeast Asia and
		causes substantial morbidity and mortality in individuals with advanced human
		immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease. Current diagnosis relies on isolating
		"Talaromyces marneffei in cultures, which takes up to 14 days and is detectable"
		"only during late-stage infection, leading to high mortality. METHODS: In this"
		"retrospective case-control study, we assessed the accuracy of a novel Mp1p"
		antigen-detecting enzyme immunoassay (EIA) in stored plasma samples of 372
		patients who had culture-proven talaromycosis from blood or sterile body fluids
		(reference standard) and 517 individuals without talaromycosis (338 healthy
		volunteers; 179 with other infections). All participants were recruited between
		"2011 and 2017 in Vietnam. RESULTS: Of cases and controls, 66.1% and 75.4%,"
		"respectively, were male; the median age was 33 and 37, respectively. All cases"
		were HIV infected; median CD4 count was 10 cells/μL. At an optical density cutoff
		"of 0.5, the specificity was 98.1% (95% CI, 96.3%-99.0%); the sensitivity was"
		"superior to blood culture (86.3% [95% CI, 82.3%-89.5%] vs 72.8% [95% CI,"
		"68.0%-77.2%]) (P < .001, McNemar test). The time to diagnosis was 6 hours vs 6.6"
		± 3.0 days for blood culture. Paired plasma and urine testing in the same
		patients (n = 269) significantly increased sensitivity compared to testing plasma
		"alone or testing urine alone (P < .001 and P = .02, respectively, McNemar test)."
		CONCLUSIONS: The Mp1p EIA is highly specific and is superior in sensitivity and
		time to diagnosis compared to blood culture for the diagnosis of talaromycosis.
		"Paired plasma and urine testing further increases sensitivity, introducing a new"
		"tool for rapid diagnosis, enabling early treatment and potentially reducing"
		mortality.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Penicilliosis marneffei is a rare disease caused by Talaromyces
		"marneffei, which is endemic in Southeast Asian countries, and usually occurs in"
		immunocompromised or immunodeficient hosts. We report an unusual misdiagnosed
		case of penicilliosis marneffei in an immunocompetent patient from a non-endemic
		area of China.Case presentation: A 59-year-old man presented to hospital with a
		"cough and progressive hemoptysis for a 3-month period. Clinical characteristics,"
		"radiological abnormalities, and prognosis were analyzed. Detailed examinations,"
		"chest computed tomography, and bronchoscopy were performed. The patient was"
		misdiagnosed as having lung cancer and provided anti-tumor treatment for 1 month
		in the early stage. Imaging and bronchoscopy showed a neoplasm in the basal
		"segment in the left lung, but a tissue biopsy did not establish a diagnosis. He"
		subsequently underwent lobectomy for the lesion. The final pathological diagnosis
		was penicilliosis marneffei based on immunohistochemical staining. He was then
		prescribed specific anti-fungal treatment of voriconazole 200 mg twice daily for
		12 weeks. CONCLUSION: Timely fungal culture and pathological examination of
		"clinical specimens are critical for the diagnosis of penicilliosis marneffei,"
		especially in non-endemic regions and immunocompetent patients.

AB	-	Talaromyces marneffei is a rare dimorphic pathogenic fungus that can induce
		severe infections in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients.
		"However, such infections have also been reported in non-HIV hosts. This current"
		case report describes a very rare case of a T. marneffei pulmonary infection in
		an HIV-negative patient with a mutation in the tuberous sclerosis complex subunit
		2 (TSC2) gene. A 24-year-old male patient presented with cough and expectoration
		for 6 months. Computed tomography showed multiple ground-glass opacities and
		cystic and cavitated lesions in both lungs. Next generation sequencing (NGS) of
		the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was performed to confirm T. marneffei pulmonary
		infection. The results were further verified using bronchoscopy specimen
		cultures. This was an HIV-negative patient without a travel history to endemic
		zones and his blood exon sequencing results showed a mutation in the TSC2 gene.
		"To date, he has recovered well with voriconazole therapy. In summary, patients"
		with TSC2 mutations that induce bronchopulmonary dysplasia may be potential hosts
		for T. marneffei. Early and timely diagnosis is important for improving
		prognosis. NGS plays a critical role in the diagnosis of T. marneffei pulmonary
		infection.

LID	-	10.1186/s12879-021-07015-5 [doi]
LID	-	98
AB	-	BACKGROUND: High-titer anti-interferon (IFN)-γ autoantibodies are strongly
		associated with intracellular pathogens such as nontuberculous mycobacteria and
		"Talaromyces marneffei, but they are not as commonly associated with Talaromyces"
		"marneffei co-infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. CASE PRESENTATION: Herein,"
		"we report a case of an HIV-negative Chinese man with a severe, disseminated"
		"co-infection of Talaromyces marneffei and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, who had a"
		high-titer of anti IFN-γ autoantibodies and a CFI heterozygous nonsense gene
		mutation. The patient rapidly developed sepsis and died. Through by flow
		cytometry for CD4(+) T cells' intracellular phosphorylated STAT-1 and Th1 cells
		"(CD4(+) IFN-γ(+) cells), we found that the patient's serum can inhibited IFN"
		γ-induced CD4(+) T cells' STAT-1 phosphorylation and Th1 cell differentiation in
		"normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells, but this phenomenon was not observed"
		"in normal control's serum. In addition, the higher serum concentration in the"
		"culture medium, the more obvious inhibition of Th1 cell differentiation."
		"CONCLUSIONS: For HIV-negative individuals with relapsing, refractory, fatal"
		"double or multiple intracellular pathogen infections, especially Talaromyces"
		"marneffei, clinicians should be aware that if they might be dealing with"
		adult-onset immunodeficiency syndrome due to high-titer anti-IFN-γ
		autoantibodies. Systematic genetic and immunological investigations should also
		be performed.

		Talaromycosis Among Han Chinese AIDS Patients in Guangdong.
PG	-	625461
LID	-	10.3389/fcimb.2021.625461 [doi]
LID	-	625461
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Talaromycosis (TM) caused by Talaromyces marneffei (T. marneffei) is
		a growing public health concern. Although Toll-like receptor (TLR) genes play a
		"critical role in the host defense against fungal infection, the influence of"
		polymorphisms in these genes on the susceptibility of acquired immune deficiency
		syndrome (AIDS) patients to TM remains unknown. This study aims to uncover the
		associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TLR genes with TM
		susceptibility among patients with AIDS. METHODS: Altogether 200 AIDS patients
		"complicated with TM, 200 matched AIDS patients without TM, and 76 healthy"
		"controls (HCs) were enrolled in this case-control study. In total, 23 SNPs in the"
		"TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9 genes, which may influence the susceptibility of AIDS"
		"patients to TM, were checked by the time of flight mass spectrometry (TOF/MS)"
		method among these Han Chinese subjects. RESULTS: No significant differences in
		"genotype or allele frequencies of selected SNPs were found among the TM group,"
		"Non-TM group, and HC group. Haplotype analysis also demonstrated no correlation"
		"of these SNPs with TM. However, subgroup analysis showed that the genotype TT and"
		the T allele in TLR2 SNP rs1339 were more frequent in typical TM cases than
		"controls (50.0 vs. 35.8%, 70.5 vs. 59.7%); the frequency of the GT genotype in"
		TLR2 SNP rs7656411 was markedly higher in severe TM cases compared to controls
		(57.8 vs. 34.4%). CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate a genetic connection of
		TLR2 SNPs rs1339 and rs7656411 with an increased susceptibility and severity of
		TM among Han Chinese populations.

AB	-	Talaromyces marneffei infection is an AIDS-defining illness in South and
		Southeast Asia. Travel-related talaromycosis is being increasingly recognized in
		non-endemic areas too. It is a potentially fatal infection with rapid
		"deterioration, if left untreated. Usage of Tzanck cytology smear for rapid"
		"diagnosis of T. marneffei is rarely described. In this case study, we report a"
		"man who presented with altered behaviour, headache, fever and cutaneous lesions."
		"Tzanck smear test, skin biopsy and blood culture showed presence of T. marneffei."
		The cytomorphology findings of T. marneffei in Tzanck cytology smear were
		"described. In conclusion, Tzanck smear is a simple and inexpensive test in"
		establishing a rapid clinical diagnosis of talaromycosis before the culture is
		reported.

TI	-	Clinical Characteristics of Transplant Recipients Infected with Talaromyces
		Marneffei: 2 Case Reports and a Literature Review.
PG	-	2879-2890
LID	-	10.2147/IDR.S363362 [doi]
AB	-	"PURPOSE: To summarize the clinical characteristics, treatment and outcomes of"
		transplant recipients infected with Talaromyces marneffei (TM). MATERIALS AND
		METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on 2 patients with Talaromycosis
		marneffei (TSM) and transplants at the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi
		"Medical University, and a systematic literature review was conducted"
		simultaneously. RESULTS: This article reported two patients after kidney
		"transplantation who developed fever, cough within 3-4 months. Their haemoglobin"
		was decreased. Their chest computed tomography (CT) showed nodules. TM was
		detected in their blood or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples by
		next-generation sequencing (NGS). After antifungal treatment with voriconazole
		"(VOR), one patient worsened, the other patient died. A total of 21 patients with"
		TSM after transplants were reported in the literature review. Fourteen underwent
		"kidney transplantation, 4 underwent liver transplantation, 2 underwent lung"
		"transplantation, and 1 underwent bone marrow transplantation. The median time"
		from initiating the postoperative immunosuppressive therapy to the onset of
		"symptoms or disease changes was 18 (0.5-140) months. Among them, 9 patients"
		"developed fever, 7 patients developed cough or expectoration and 4 patients"
		developed dyspnoea. Haemoglobin was decreased in 10 patients. Pulmonary nodules
		"were found in 7 patients. Among the 21 patients, 7 were diagnosed by positive"
		"culture, 6 by biopsy, 5 by culture and biopsy. Of the 21 patients, 13 patients"
		"improved by antifungal therapy, 8 patients worsened or died. Seven patients who"
		received amphotericin B followed by itraconazole (ITR) therapy all improved.
		"Regarding the use of immunosuppressants in 12 patients, 9 patients had to"
		"discontinue or reduce their medications (6 patients improved, 3 patients worsened"
		or died). CONCLUSION: Patients with TSM after transplant often have disseminated
		"infections, involving the respiratory, hematopoietic and so on. Fever, cough,"
		decreased haemoglobin and pulmonary nodules often occur approximately 18 months
		"after surgery. The combined applications of culture, biopsy, NGS are helpful for"
		an early diagnosis. Antifungal therapy with amphotericin B followed by
		"itraconazole is recommended, and the dosage of the immunosuppressant should be"
		adjusted timely.

AB	-	"INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: In an immunocompromised patient, there has never"
		been a report of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Talaromyces marneffei co-infection.
		Treatment with intravenous ganciclovir for EBV-associated uveitis has only been
		explored in a few cases. CASE PRESENTATION: A 47-year-old HIV-positive female
		presented with scleral nodule and vascularized iris tumor in the left eye. After
		"the ancillary laboratory workup, EBV was detected by polymerase chain reaction on"
		aqueous humor and scleral tissue analysis. The lesion subsided completely with
		"systemic and local ganciclovir therapy. Subsequently, recurrent scleral nodule"
		with iris plaque developed and was pathologically diagnosed as Talaromyces
		"marneffei. The employed treatment, including intravenous amphotericin B and"
		"intracameral amphotericin B injection, was successful in attaining a significant"
		regression of the lesion. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Although EBV treatment is
		"debatable, our combination of systemic and local ganciclovir therapy demonstrated"
		regression of EBV-caused scleral nodule and iris plaque. The organism's
		"identification was complicated by Talaromyces marneffei, but it was easily"
		"treated. CONCLUSIONS: In HIV-infected patients, EBV-associated sclerouveitis can"
		"be successfully treated with systemic and local ganciclovir therapy, and there is"
		a possibility of coinfection with Talaromyces marneffei.

TI	-	Talaromyces Marneffei Infection in an HIV-Negative Child with a CARD9 Mutation in
		China: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.
PG	-	553-561
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-021-00576-8 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Talaromyces marneffei (T. marneffei) is a thermally dimorphic fungus
		causing systemic mycosis. Due to the atypical symptoms and diverse imaging
		"findings, T. marneffei-infected patients may be misdiagnosed thus preventing"
		"timely antifungal therapy. Moreover, HIV-negative patients with T. marneffei"
		infection may be congenitally immunocompromised because of the mutation of
		immune-related genes. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a case of an HIV-negative
		child who developed disseminated T. marneffei infection in a nonendemic area.
		"Chest CT showed similar imaging changes of miliary pulmonary tuberculosis, while"
		"there was no other evidence of tuberculosis infection, and empirical"
		antituberculosis treatment was not effective. Lymphocyte subset analysis showed
		"reduced natural killer cells, and the immunoglobulin profile showed low levels of"
		"IgM, C3 and C4. A bone marrow smear revealed T. marneffei infection, and ascites"
		"culture also proved T. marneffei infection. Despite antifungal treatment, the"
		child died of multiple organ failure. Two gene mutations in caspase recruitment
		"domain-containing protein 9 (CARD9) were detected, which had not been reported"
		previously in T. marneffei-infected patients. CONCLUSIONS: HIV-negative patients
		with CARD9 mutations may be potential hosts of T. marneffei. Abnormalities in the
		immunoglobin profile and lymphocyte subset may provide clues for
		"immunocompromised patients, and further genetic testing is advised to identify"
		gene mutations in HIV-negative patients with T. marneffei infection.

PG	-	129-139
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-018-0255-8 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: The typical manifestations of Penicillium marneffei (nowadays
		Talaromyces marneffei) infection in children without human immunodeficiency virus
		(HIV) remain unclear. The current work presents the case of a child without an
		underlying disease who was infected with P. marneffei comorbid with eosinophilia.
		CASE PRESENTATION: A 2-year-old male was infected with P. marneffei. A physical
		"examination revealed a high-grade fever, ulcerated lesions in the oral mucosa,"
		"anemia, pruritic erythematous papules on the sac and thigh and watery diarrhea. A"
		"chest enhanced computed tomography scan showed multiple small, nodular,"
		"high-density shadows in the lungs, multiple lymphadenectasis in the hilum of the"
		"lungs and mediastinum, and liquid in the right pleural cavity. The patient's"
		plasma was negative for HIV. Routine blood tests initially indicated that the
		"patient had leucopenia; however, later tests indicated that he had leukocytosis."
		This peak was caused by a significant increase in eosinophils. The total IgE and
		specific allergen levels were normal. The stool was negative for parasite eggs.
		"Aspergillus antigen (galactomannan, GM) levels were significantly increased and"
		were present in the serum for a relatively long period. CONCLUSIONS: Eosinophilia
		"can occur during P. marneffei infection, and this finding might provide"
		additional information on the activity of this intracellular parasite. In
		"addition, GM detection might be useful for monitoring the effect of antifungal"
		"treatments; however, this theory requires more data for verification."

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: In recent years, talaromycosis is reportedly on the rise in human"
		"immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-uninfected patients. However, the misdiagnosis and"
		mistreatment of talaromycosis is more likely in HIV-uninfected patients than in
		HIV-infected patients because talaromycosis can be easily mistaken for
		"tuberculosis or any other opportunistic infection. Therefore, we used metagenomic"
		"next-generation sequencing (mNGS), a novel gene detection method, for the"
		diagnosis of talaromycosis in HIV-uninfected patients. CASE PRESENTATION: We
		"report five cases diagnosed as talaromycosis by mNGS in HIV-uninfected patients,"
		which were further confirmed by tissue culture. There were 3 male and 2 female
		patients. Two patients had a history of rat contact. The misdiagnosis duration
		ranged from 88 to 245 days. While the results of tissue culture changed from
		"repeated negative to positive, the mNGS result for Talaromyces marneffei was"
		positive earlier in 4 patients. The reads of Talaromyces marneffei in mNGS ranged
		"from 5 to 414. After antifungal therapy, one of the outcomes was death due to the"
		"longest duration of misdiagnosis, and the other outcomes were clinical"
		improvement. CONCLUSIONS: mNGS is perhaps a rapid and effective diagnosis
		approach for the early confirmation of talaromycosis. Antifungal therapy is
		recommended once Talaromyces marneffei was revealed by mNGS. mNGS might reduce
		"misdiagnosis duration and improve prognosis. Through these findings, we hope to"
		provide some reference for talaromycosis in HIV-uninfected patients diagnosed
		early with the help of mNGS.

		infection in a patient with AIDS and syphilis. CASE REPORT: A 25-year-old man
		presented with gradual vision decrease in the right eye for 2 months. Ocular
		examination revealed best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 0.12 and a
		vascularized and solid tumor at inferotemporal iris base in the right eye. There
		were some papulonecrotic skin lesions. Both serum treponema pallidum particle
		agglutination and human immunodeficiency virus antibody were positive. Non-target
		metagenome next-generation sequencing detected Talaromyces marneffei in the skin
		lesion and aqueous humor. After 8 weeks of oral voriconazole and fluconazole
		"eyedrop treatment, the iris tumor completely subsided, and the BCVA improved to"
		1.0. CONCLUSION: Talaromyces marneffei infection may present as an iris tumor.
		Metagenome next-generation sequencing is helpful in diagnosis. Oral and topical
		anti-fungus therapy was sufficient to regress the disease without intraocular
		injection.

		of pediatric patients with Talaromyces marneffei infection. Methods: In this
		"retrospective study, 7 children diagnosed with Talaromyces marneffei infection in"
		Shenzhen Children's Hospital from July 2017 to October 2021 were recruited. The
		"clinical features, radiology, pathogen detection, immunological evaluation,"
		"treatments, and prognosis were analyzed. Results: In 7 cases, 5 were male, 2 were"
		females. The age was from 0.75 to 8.75 years. The main clinical manifestations
		"were fever in 7 cases, cough in 6 cases, malnutrition in 4 cases, papules in 2"
		cases and medical history of recurrent infection in 3 cases. Physical examination
		"showed that all 7 patients had hepatosplenomegaly, 4 had superficial"
		lymphadenopathy. Laboratory examination showed that 6 cases had decreased
		hemoglobin and 3 cases had decreased platelet. Chest CT showed that 4 cases had
		"patchy shadows, pleural effusion, mediastinal or axillary lymph node enlargement,"
		3 had nodular shadows and 2 had cavities. The positive ratio of Talaromyces
		"marneffei culture was 2/2 with tissue samples, 4/5 with bone marrow. The positive"
		ratio was 3/4 by metagenomic next generation sequencing. The fungus was detected
		in 3 cases by smear microscopy of bone marrow and (or) peripheral blood. All
		patients were negative for human immunodeficiency virus by the immune function
		"assay. However, 5 cases were confirmed as primary immunodeficiency disease,"
		"including 2 cases with high IgM syndrome, 2 with STAT1 gene variation, and the"
		last with severe combined immunodeficiency (IL2RG gene variation). Exclude 1 case
		"which gave up treatment due to acute intracranial infection, and the other"
		"patients received effective treatments along with amphotericin B, voriconazole,"
		and itraconazole alone or in combination. Two cases relapsed after medication
		"withdrawal, but 1 case got complete rehabilitation after hematopoietic stem cell"
		"transplantation. Conclusions: The clinical manifestations involve multisystem,"
		the common charateristics are fever and cough. The chest CT imaging
		"manifestations are diverse, it should be considered in differentiating"
		"tuberculosis. The amphotericin B, voriconazole and itraconazole are effective,"
		but it will easily relapse when withdrawing those antifungal agents.

		Rare Case Report.
PG	-	5005-5013
LID	-	10.2147/IDR.S340694 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Talaromyces marneffei is considered to commonly cause infection in
		"individuals with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. However, the"
		"epidemiology of T. marneffei has changed, and an increasing number of"
		HIV-negative but immunodeficient patients are infected with T. marneffei. The
		mechanisms of T. marneffei infection of HIV-negative hosts are complex and
		diverse. We report 2 cases of HIV-negative lung cancer with T. marneffei
		infection and positive anti-interferon-gamma autoantibodies (AIGAs) to provide
		clinical experience. CASE PRESENTATION: We report lung adenocarcinoma combined
		"with T. marneffei infection in HIV-negative patients, and their AIGAs were"
		measured. Both patients were male with a family history of cancer and presented
		with recurrent fever and cough. The patients were negative for HIV antibodies but
		"positive for AIGAs. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed pulmonary nodules,"
		exudative lesions and solid changes. The patients were diagnosed with lung
		adenocarcinoma and Talaromycosis marneffei (TSM) by pathological examination and
		"tissue culture. Patient 1 received only antifungal treatment, refused antitumor"
		"treatment and died in February 2019, and Patient 2 unfortunately died in April"
		2019 after antifungal and antitumor treatments. CONCLUSION: An increasing number
		of HIV-negative but immunodeficient patients are infected with T. marneffei. The
		"2 patients in this report had lung cancer and positive AIGAs, causing"
		"immunodeficiencies, but the mechanism of T. marneffei infection in such patients"
		"is complex. Clinically, we should consider a comprehensive immunological"
		examination to avoid the omission of other immunodeficiencies. We recommend
		routine testing for AIGA levels in HIV-negative marneffei patients. It is
		difficult to distinguish between lung cancer and disseminated TSM due to similar
		"clinical characteristics and imaging, and multiple biopsies and cultures of"
		diseased tissue are necessary. Early antifungal treatment and standard antitumor
		treatment can achieve satisfactory curative effects when a patient has both
		diseases.

AB	-	Talaromycosis is a fungal infection caused by Talaromyces sp. that is
		predominantly prevalent in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in
		the United States. It is also rarely seen in other individuals who are otherwise
		immunosuppressed. With the advent of immunotherapy and increasing usage of these
		"novel agents in treating several conditions, the prevalence of talaromycosis may"
		"increase, especially in people from endemic regions who might harbor a dormant"
		infection. Clinical presentation is non-specific with respiratory symptoms such
		"as shortness of breath, cough, or even fever that can delay the diagnosis. Little"
		"is known about the exact pathogenesis of the condition, and management is largely"
		based on anecdotal evidence and small-sized studies. We present the case of an
		"individual on nintedanib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks fibroblast"
		"growth factor receptor and used for the treatment of interstitial lung disease,"
		who was diagnosed with talaromycosis.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Talaromycosis is an invasive endemic mycosis caused by the dimorphic
		"fungus Talaromyces marneffei (T. marneffei, TM). It mainly affects"
		"immunodeficient patients, especially HIV-infected individuals, which causes"
		significant morbidity and mortality. Culture-based diagnosis takes a long
		"turnaround time with low sensitivity, leading to treatment delay. In this study,"
		we aimed to evaluate the performance of Metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing
		(mNGS) for the rapid diagnosis of talaromycosis in HIV-infected patients.
		METHODS: Retrospectively analysis was conducted in HIV-infected cases at Changsha
		First Hospital (China) from January 2021 to March 2022. Patients who underwent
		routine microbiological examination and mNGS testing in parallel were enrolled.
		"The clinical final diagnosis was used as a reference standard, and cases were"
		classified into the TM group (60 cases) and the non-TM group (148 cases). The
		clinical performances of mNGS were compared with culture and serum Galactomannan
		(GM). The mixed infections detected by mNGS were analyzed. The impact of mNGS
		detection on treatment was also investigated. RESULTS: The sensitivity of mNGS
		"test reached 98.3% (95% CI, 89.8-99.9), which was significantly higher than"
		"culture (66.7% [95% CI, 53.2-77.9], P < 0.001) and serum GM (83.3% [95% CI,"
		"71.0-91.2], P < 0.05). The specificity of 98.6% (95% CI, 94.7-99.7) was similar"
		"to culture (100.0% [95% CI, 96.8-100.0], P = 0.156), and superior to serum GM"
		"(91.9% [95% CI, 85.9-95.5], P < 0.05). In bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF)"
		"samples, the positive rate of mNGS was 97.6%, which was significantly higher than"
		"culture (28.6%, P <0.001). mNGS has excellent performance in the identification"
		"of mixed infection in TM group patients. Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus and"
		"Pneumocystis jirovecii were the most common concurrent pathogens. In summary,"
		60.0% (36/60) patients were added or adjusted to antimicrobial therapy after mNGS
		test. CONCLUSION: mNGS is a powerful technique with high specificity and
		sensitivity for the rapid diagnosis of talaromycosis. mNGS of BALF samples may be
		a good option for early identification of T. marneffei in HIV-infected
		"individuals with manifestations of infection. Moreover, mNGS shows excellent"
		"performance in mixed infection, which benefits timely treatment and potential"
		mortality reduction.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Talaromyces marneffei (T. marneffei) is an opportunistic pathogen
		that infects immunodeficient children. The aim of the study is to determine the
		clinical features and peripheral immune state of Talaromyces marneffei (T.
		marneffei) infections in children for early detection and diagnosis. METHODS: We
		retrospectively reviewed 21 pediatric patients who were diagnosed with T.
		marneffei infections and were followed up in the Guangzhou Women and Children's
		"Medical Center from January 2010 to January 2020. For each patient, we collected"
		"and analyzed clinical characteristics, peripheral immunological results, genetic"
		"tests, complications and prognosis. RESULTS: Common clinical features of the"
		"patients included fever (20/21, 95.24%), cough (17/21, 80.95%) and hepatomegaly"
		"(17/21, 80.95%). Severe complications included septic shock (12/21, 57.14%),"
		"hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) (11/21, 52.38%), acute respiratory"
		"distress syndrome (ARDS) (10/21, 47.62%), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome"
		"(MODS) (9/21, 42.86%), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (7/21,"
		"33.33%). Eleven children (11/21, 52.38%) eventually died of T. marneffei"
		infections. All patients were HIV negative. Seven cases revealed reduced antibody
		"levels, especially IgG. Higher levels of IgE were detected in 9 cases with an"
		obvious increase in two patients. Ten patients showed decreased complement C3
		"levels, some of whom had low C4 levels. Three patients displayed decreased"
		"absolute T lymphocyte counts, including the CD 4+ and CD 8+ subsets. A reduction"
		in NK cells was present in most patients. No patient had positive nitro blue
		tetrazolium (NBT) test results. Nine patients were screened for common genetic
		"mutations. Of the cases, one case had no disease-specific gene mutation. Four"
		children had confirmed hyperimmunoglobulin M syndrome (HIGM) with CD40LG
		"variation, one case had severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), and one case had"
		hyper-IgE syndrome (HIES). One patient was identified as having a heterozygous
		"mutation in STAT3 gene; however, he showed no typical clinical manifestations of"
		HIES at his age. One patient had a mutated COPA gene with uncertain pathogenic
		potential. Another patient was diagnosed with HIES that depended on her clinical
		features and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) scoring system. CONCLUSIONS:
		T. marneffei infections in HIV-negative children induced severe systemic
		complications and poor prognosis. Children with T. marneffei infections commonly
		"exhibited abnormal immunoglobulin levels in peripheral blood, particularly"
		"decreased IgG or increased IgE levels, further suggesting possible underlying"
		PIDs in these patients.

TI	-	Cutaneous manifestations and dermoscopic findings are important clues to the
		diagnosis of Talaromyces marneffei in HIV patients with immune reconstitution
		inflammatory syndrome: A case report and literature review.
PG	-	168-172
LID	-	10.1111/1346-8138.16197 [doi]
AB	-	Talaromyces (formerly Penicillium) marneffei is a dimorphic fungus that causes
		talaromycosis (formerly penicilliosis). The condition is predominantly found in
		patients with HIV. Important diagnostic clues are a history of living or
		"travelling in endemic areas, and central umbilicated skin lesions. Dermoscopy is"
		"particularly useful for providing rapid bedside information, with a round,"
		"whitish, amorphous structure being the most common finding. Immune reconstitution"
		inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) may occur. Driven by the initiation of
		"antiretroviral therapy, IRIS is an exaggerated response of T cells to pathogens."
		Although mycobacterial and cryptococcal opportunistic infections are common with
		"IRIS, a linkage between T. marneffei and IRIS has rarely been reported. Here, we"
		report on a literature review of patients with HIV who developed IRIS associated
		with talaromycosis. Dermatologists should be aware of the cutaneous and
		dermoscopic findings of talaromycosis as they provide important clues that enable
		its early diagnosis and treatment.

TI	-	Estimating the burden of fungal disease in Vietnam.
PG	-	101-6
LID	-	10.1111/myc.12382 [doi]
AB	-	Data regarding the prevalence of fungal infections in Vietnam are limited yet
		they are likely to occur more frequently as increasingly sophisticated healthcare
		"creates more iatrogenic risk factors. In this study, we sought to estimate"
		baseline incidence and prevalence of selected serious fungal infections for the
		"year 2012. We made estimates with a previously described actuarial method, using"
		reports on the incidence and prevalence of various established risk factors for
		"fungal infections from Vietnam, or similar environments, supplemented by personal"
		communications. Global data were used if local data were unavailable. We
		"estimated 2,352,748 episodes of serious fungal infection occurred in Vietnam in"
		"2012. Frequent conditions included recurrent vaginal candidiasis (3893/100,000"
		"women annually), tinea capitis (457/100,000 annually) and chronic pulmonary"
		"aspergillosis (61/100,000/5 year period). We estimated 140 cases of cryptococcal"
		"meningitis, 206 of penicilliosis and 608 of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia."
		This is the first summary of Vietnamese fungal infections. The majority of severe
		"disease is due to Aspergillus species, driven by the high prevalence of pulmonary"
		"tuberculosis. The AIDS epidemic highlights opportunistic infections, such as"
		"penicilliosis and cryptococcosis, which may complicate immunosuppressive"
		treatments. These estimates provide a useful indication of disease prevalence to
		inform future research and resource allocation but should be verified by further
		epidemiological approaches.

		HIV-positive patient: a case report and literature review.
PG	-	274-280
LID	-	10.1007/s13365-021-01032-5 [doi]
AB	-	Cerebral vasculitis is a long-standing but flourishing and fadeless research
		"topic. Infections are a frequent cause of cerebral vasculitis, vital to diagnose"
		due to involvement of specific anti-infection treatments. A 65-year-old man
		visited the hospital for his neurological symptoms without obvious inducements.
		"After admission, radiological examination and comprehensive conventional"
		microbiological tests (CMTs) revealed suspected intracranial infectious
		vasculitis. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) and reverse
		transcription-polymerase chain reaction further confirmed that his cerebral
		vasculitis was caused by Talaromyces marneffei (T. marneffei) and Aspergillus
		niger (A. niger) co-infection. The patient's final diagnosis changed from initial
		"herpetic encephalitis, due to the past history of cephalosome and facial herpes"
		"and non-significant antiviral therapeutic effects, to fungal cerebral vasculitis."
		The patient was discharged after use of targeted antifungal therapies on day 18
		"of his admission, and his associated symptoms disappeared completely at follow-up"
		3 weeks later. We first illustrated the presence of uncommon cerebral vasculitis
		caused by T. marneffei and A. niger in a human immunodeficiency virus-positive
		"patient. In clinically suspected patients with infectious cerebral vasculitis,"
		mNGS should be performed to detect potential pathogens if CMTs may not provide
		"useful pathogenic clues, highlighting the importance of mNGS in the diagnosis and"
		treatment of infectious diseases.

AB	-	Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a life-threatening immune-mediated
		disease that affects patients with known genetic defects and is increasingly
		found among those with autoimmune diseases and persistent infections. Talaromyces
		marneffei (TM) is a human opportunistic fungus that commonly infects
		immunodeficient or immunosuppressed individuals. Few TM-associated secondary HLH
		cases resulting from autoimmune deficiency have been reported previously. The
		current case study describes a pediatric patient hospitalized with recurrent
		"fever and lymphadenopathy. The child had abnormal blood cell classification, and"
		microscopy revealed mature granulocytes that phagocytized fungal spores. It was
		speculated that the patient was infected with TM. The pathogen was detected
		earlier than the blood culture and confirmed by metagenomic next-generation
		sequencing. Whole-exome sequencing revealed that the patient had complex
		mutations associated with immunodeficiency. This included a mutation in exon 3 of
		"the CD40LG gene, c.346G>A, which may be linked to hyper-IgM syndrome, a primary"
		immunodeficiency disease with immunoglobulin conversion recombination defects
		that could explain the patient's increased susceptibility to serious
		"opportunistic infections. In addition, a heterozygous frameshift variant,"
		"c.820dup (p.Asp274GlyfsTer61), was detected in exon 6 of CARD9, a key gene"
		"associated with fungal immune surveillance. After 4 days of fungal treatment, the"
		"abnormal blood cell clusters disappeared, but other infections occurred in"
		succession for 6 months after rehabilitation. The patient was followed with the
		aim of providing subsequent immunotherapy. This study found that infection can
		"trigger HLH in HIV-negative individuals, highlighting the importance of early"
		definitive identification of the causative agent and investigation of potential
		immunodeficiency.

PG	-	21-24
LID	-	10.1016/j.idcr.2018.02.013 [doi]
AB	-	"INTRODUCTION: Talaromyces marneffei infection is a systemic mycosis, caused by a"
		"dimorphic fungus, an opportunistic pathogen formerly known as Penicillium"
		marneffei. This disease is endemic to Southeast Asia and common in human
		immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients with low CD4 counts. Here we
		present a very rarely reported case of Talaromyces marneffei infection in an
		apparent non-immunosuppressed patient presenting decades later in a non-endemic
		setting (United States). PRESENTATION OF CASE: Our patient was a 75-year-old
		"Caucasian Navy veteran, who served in Vietnam as a part of the Swift Boat service"
		in 1966. He presented to his primary care provider with uncontrolled
		nonproductive cough and abnormal chest computerized tomography. Bronchoscopy
		specimens showed Talaromyces. He was empirically treated with itraconazole and
		then switched to voriconazole after confirmation of diagnosis but he later
		deteriorated was changed to liposomal amphotericin B and isavuconazole. Patient
		did well for the next 90 days on isavuconazole until the therapy was stopped.
		Soon after stopping the medication (isavuconazole) his symptoms recurred and
		ultimately patient expired. DISCUSSION: Talaromycosis generally presents as
		pulmonary infection with manifestations similar with other endemic fungi. It is
		often seen HIV patients with travel to South east Asia. Very rarely this
		infection is seen and reported in non-immunosuppressed and in non-endemic areas.
		"To date there are 4 well-documented cases among non-HIV, non-endemic population."
		CONCLUSION: Talaromyces can cause infection in non-HIV and non-endemic population
		and could be an underrecognized cause of pulmonary infections among veterans with
		even a remote history of exposure to the organism during deployment.

		marneffei Infection: A Case Report.
PG	-	5671-5678
LID	-	10.2147/IDR.S340192 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Talaromyces marneffei (TM) is the only temperature-biphasic pathogen
		among Penicillium spp. that causes talaromycosis marneffei (TSM). Clinical
		"manifestations include fever, cough, expectoration, superficial and deep lymph"
		"node enlargement, hepatosplenomegaly, subcutaneous nodules, and bone and joint"
		infections. Cases of TSM in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) patients are uncommon. The
		"clinical manifestations and imaging findings are similar in TSM and HL, which"
		make it difficult for clinicians to distinguish between TSM and HL. Both diseases
		"can present with symptoms, can involve the blood or the respiratory system and"
		can include other symptoms. We report a rare case of HIV-negative nodular
		sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma (NSHL) combined with T. marneffei infection to
		improve clinical knowledge. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was a 51-year-old man
		"who presented with a 1-month history of cough, expectoration, intermittent fever"
		"in the afternoon and night, cervical lymph node enlargement, diabetes and"
		previous lung surgery. He had markedly elevated serum inflammatory markers and
		moderate diffuse lung dysfunction. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed diffuse
		nodular lesions in both lungs with mediastinal lymph node enlargement. The
		patient did not respond to antibacterial and diagnostic antituberculosis therapy.
		"After lymph node biopsy and lung culture, we obtained a definite diagnosis of"
		NSLH with T. marneffei infection and administered antifungal therapy. His
		"symptoms improved, and he was discharged for further treatment. Unfortunately, he"
		died of Salmonella sepsis 7 months later. CONCLUSION: It is rare for NSLH
		"patients to be infected with T. marneffei. Both diseases can present with fever,"
		"lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly and involve the blood and respiratory"
		"system or can cause other symptoms. Clinically, a misdiagnosis or missed"
		diagnosis may occur. A multisite biopsy or culture should be performed to make a
		definitive diagnosis. Early antifungal therapy combined with standard
		chemotherapy can achieve satisfactory clinical efficacy.

		from 1994 to 2004.
PG	-	103-9
AB	-	"OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical presentation, management, and outcomes of"
		patients with Penicillium marneffei infections in a regional hospital in Hong
		Kong. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: A regional and tertiary human
		immunodeficiency virus-referral hospital in Hong Kong. PATIENTS: Those who had
		penicilliosis during the inclusive period January 1994 to February 2004. RESULTS:
		Forty-seven immunocompromised patients (44 being human immunodeficiency
		"virus-positive) with penicilliosis were retrospectively studied. Fever, malaise,"
		and anaemia were the commonest presentations. Most diagnoses were obtained from
		"blood cultures (83%) and lymph node biopsies (34%). Five (11%) died, death being"
		attributable to penicilliosis; four (9%) of them had received no specific
		antifungal treatment due to late presentation and late diagnosis. The CD4 count
		of human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients upon diagnosis of penicilliosis
		"was low (median, 20.0 cells/mm3). Most (70%) patients received amphotericin B as"
		"an induction treatment, followed by oral itraconazole, although a smaller"
		proportion (21%) received oral itraconazole only. All surviving human
		immunodeficiency virus-infected patients took highly active antiretroviral
		treatment and oral itraconazole as secondary prophylaxis after treatment of
		penicilliosis. The prognosis appeared satisfactory with early diagnosis and
		administration of appropriate antifungal therapy. Relapse ensued in two (4%) of
		the patients only. CONCLUSION: Penicillium marneffei infection in
		immunocompromised patients is a serious disease with significant mortality if not
		diagnosed early and treated with appropriate antifungal drugs. Simple
		investigations like blood culture enable the diagnosis in the majority of cases.
		Immunocompromised patients who have been successfully treated should receive oral
		itraconazole as a maintenance therapy to prevent relapse.

		"carcinoma (LELC) in an HIV-negative patient. CASE PRESENTATION: A 50-year-old,"
		previously healthy female presented with a 1-month history of cough and fever. CT
		"scans showed a mass in the left lower lung, left pleural thickening, pleural"
		"effusion, and multiple swollen lymph nodes throughout the body. Based on the"

TI	-	Recovery from Talaromyces marneffei involving the kidney in a renal transplant
		recipient: A case report and literature review.
LID	-	10.1111/tid.12710 [doi]
AB	-	Talaromyces marneffei is an emerging opportunistic infection among
		immunocompromised patients. We observe the first native case of disseminated
		T. marneffei involving the kidney in a renal transplant recipient in mainland
		"China. We describe the comprehensive clinical course, and ultrasound imaging of"
		"renal transplant biopsy, pathologic images, and electron microscopy observation"
		"of the biopsy specimen, highlighting the relevance of biopsy findings and the"
		blood culture. We also focus on the treatment and good outcome of the patient.
		Then we review the literature and show the additional 10 reported cases of
		"T. marneffei in renal transplant recipients. In addition, we discuss the new"
		"methods of rapid diagnosis of T. marneffei. In brief, timely diagnosis and proper"
		treatment of T. marneffei infection is important in renal transplant recipients.

AB	-	Talaromyces marneffei is one of the endemic mycoses prevalent in South-East Asian
		"region. The infection, which was once considered to be opportunistic infection in"
		"HIV-positive patients, is establishing foothold in transplant and immunocompetent"
		population. We report a case of a 41-year-old post-renal transplant female with a
		travel history to Assam two years back presenting with a subcutaneous lesion on
		right side of scalp associated with pain and blurring of vision in right eye.
		Fine-needle aspiration from the scalp lesion showed yeast cells with transverse
		"septation in cytological examination and culture grew Talaromyces marneffei,"
		which was confirmed by sequencing of ITS region. Patient was successfully managed
		with oral itraconazole 200 mg twice daily for ten months without subsequent
		"recurrence. To our knowledge, this is the first case of subcutaneous infection by"
		T. marneffei in a renal transplant recipient from India.

LID	-	e30958
AB	-	RATIONALE: Talaromyces marneffei causes life-threatening opportunistic fungal
		infections in immunocompromised patients. It often has a poorer prognosis in
		non-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected than in HIV-infected individuals
		because of delayed diagnosis and improper treatment. PATIENT CONCERNS: A
		"51-year-old man presented with complaints of pyrexia, cough, and expectoration"
		that had lasted for 15 day. This patient has been taking anti-rejection
		medication since kidney transplant in 2011. DIAGNOSIS: T marneffei pneumonia;
		post renal transplantation; renal insufficiency; hypertension. INTERVENTIONS:
		Intravenous moxifloxacin was administered on admission. After the etiology was
		"established, moxifloxacin was discontinued and replaced with voriconazole. The"
		tacrolimus dose was adjusted based on the blood concentration of tacrolimus and
		voriconazole. OUTCOMES: The patient was successfully treated and followed-up
		without recurrence for 1 year. LESSONS: A high degree of caution should be
		maintained for the possibility of T marneffei infection in immunodeficient
		non-HIV patients who live in or have traveled to T marneffei endemic areas. Early
		diagnosis and appropriate treatment can prevent progression of T marneffei
		infection and achieve a cure. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) can
		aid the physician in reaching an early pathogenic diagnosis. Close monitoring of
		tacrolimus and voriconazole blood levels during treatment remains a practical
		approach at this time.

AB	-	Penicillium marneffei is an important opportunistic pathogen in Southeast Asia in
		"HIV-positive individuals, but it rarely infects non-HIV ones. Four SLE patients"
		with disseminated penicilliosis had been previously reported out of which 3 died.
		"We describe a 46-year-old Chinese woman who had a 10 years history of SLE,"
		"associated with disseminated Penicillium marneffei infection, which presented as"
		"fever, subcutaneous masses, and fine nodular shadows disseminated over lung"
		fields. She was initially misdiagnosed as miliary tuberculosis and panniculitis
		that did not respond to anti-tubercular drugs and prednisone. The correct
		diagnosis was finally made by histopathology and tissue culture and also culture
		from exudate. She responded well to antifungal therapy in the form of intravenous
		amphotericin B for 2 weeks followed by itraconazole plus fluconazole. The
		cutaneous lesions were cured leaving behind scars by secondary suture after times
		"of epluchage, and the fine nodular shadows over lungs disappeared finally. She"
		had no recurrence on 8 months of follow-up. We also review the literature on this
		topic.

AB	-	Penicillium marneffei is a thermally dimorphic fungus that can cause severe
		"opportunistic infections in endemic regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in"
		"individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus-1, but has rarely been"
		"reported in solid organ transplant recipients. Herein, we report the first case,"
		"to our knowledge, of P. marneffei infection in a lung transplant recipient,"
		"occurring in a 41-year-old woman 28 months post lung transplantation, after"
		recent travel to Vietnam. We have reviewed the literature to derive some
		management principles for this rare infection in this clinical context. The
		"number of P. marneffei infections in transplant recipients may increase, as a"
		result of increasing rates of transplantation and travel to endemic areas.

		HIV-infected child: a case report and review of literature.
PG	-	28
LID	-	10.1186/1471-2334-12-28 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUNDS: Disseminated Penicillium marneffei infection is one of the most
		common HIV-related opportunistic infections in Southeast Asia. Immune
		reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is a complication related to
		antiretroviral therapy (ART)-induced immune restoration. The aim of this report
		is to present a case of HIV-infected child who developed an unmasking type of
		IRIS caused by disseminated P. marneffei infection after ART initiation. CASE
		PRESENTATION: A 14-year-old Thai HIV-infected girl presented with high-grade
		"fever, multiple painful ulcerated oral lesions, generalized non-pruritic"
		"erythrematous skin papules and nodules with central umbilication, and multiple"
		"swollen, warm, and tender joints 8 weeks after ART initiation. At that time, her"
		"CD4+ cell count was 7.2% or 39 cells/mm3. On admission, her repeated CD4+ cell"
		count was 11% or 51 cells/mm3 and her plasma HIV-RNA level was < 50 copies/mL.
		Her skin biopsy showed necrotizing histiocytic granuloma formation with
		neutrophilic infiltration in the upper and reticular dermis. Tissue sections
		"stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), and Grocott"
		"methenamine silver (GMS) stain revealed numerous intracellular and extracellular,"
		"round to oval, elongated, thin-walled yeast cells with central septation. The"
		"hemoculture, bone marrow culture, and skin culture revealed no growth of fungus"
		or bacteria. Our patient responded well to intravenous amphotericin B followed by
		oral itraconazole. She fully recovered after 4-month antifungal treatment without
		evidence of recurrence of disease. CONCLUSIONS: IRIS from P. marneffei in
		HIV-infected people is rare. Appropriate recognition and properly treatment is
		important for a good prognosis.

TI	-	Unusual disseminated Talaromyces marneffei infection mimicking lymphoma in a
		non-immunosuppressed patient in East China: a case report and review of the
		literature.
PG	-	800
LID	-	10.1186/s12879-020-05526-1 [doi]
LID	-	800
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Talaromyces marneffei infection is an important opportunistic
		"infection associated with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). However, it"
		is unusual in patients with non-AIDS and other non-immunosuppressed conditions.
		We report a case of delayed diagnosis of disseminated T. marneffei infection in
		"non-AIDS, non-immunosuppressive and non-endemic conditions. CASE PRESENTATION: We"
		describe a previously healthy 24-year-old man who complained of a 3-month history
		of intermittent diarrhea and a recent week of uncontrollable high fever. The HIV
		antibody test was negative. Enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) and
		integrated (18)F-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose position emission tomography/computed
		"tomography (FDG PET/CT) both suspected malignant lymphoma. However, a large"
		number of yeast-like cells were found in macrophages in cervical lymph node
		samples by hematoxylin and eosin stain and silver hexamine stain. Subsequent
		blood culture suggested T. marneffei infection. Metagenomic Next Generation
		Sequencing (mNGS) results suggested T. marneffei as the dominant pathogen.
		"Unfortunately, the patient continued to develop acute liver failure and died due"
		to adverse events associated with amphotericin B. CONCLUSIONS: Early diagnosis in
		HIV-negative patients who are otherwise not immunosuppressed and endemic poses a
		serious challenge. T. marneffei infection is an FDG-avid nonmalignant condition
		"that may lead to false-positive FDG PET/CT scans. Nevertheless, integrated FDG"
		PET/CT is necessary in patients with fever of unknown origin in the early period
		to perform earlier biopsy for histopathology and culture in highly avid sites and
		to avoid delays in diagnosis and treatment.

AB	-	"Talaromyces marneffei (TM) infection is rarely seen in clinical practice, and its"
		pathogenesis may be related to deficiency in antifungal immune function. Human
		caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 9 (CARD9) is a key molecule in
		fungal immune surveillance. There have been no previous case reports of TM
		"infection in individuals with CARD9 gene mutations. Herein, we report the case of"
		a 7-month-old Chinese boy who was admitted to our hospital with recurring cough
		"and fever with a papular rash. A blood culture produced TM growth, which was"
		confirmed by metagenomic next-generation sequencing. One of the patient's sisters
		had died of TM septicaemia at 9 months of age. Whole exome sequencing revealed
		that the patient had a complex heterozygous CARD9 gene mutation with a c.1118G>C
		p.R373P variation in exon 8 and a c.610C>T p.R204C variation in exon 4. Based on
		"the culture results, voriconazole antifungal therapy was administered. On the"
		"third day of antifungal administration, his temperature dropped to within normal"
		"range, the rash gradually subsided, and the enlargement of his lymph nodes,"
		"liver, and spleen improved. Two months after discharge, he returned to the"
		"hospital for a follow-up examination. His general condition was good, and no"
		specific abnormalities were detected. Oral voriconazole treatment was continued.
		Unexplained TM infection in HIV-negative individuals warrants investigation for
		immune deficiencies.

TI	-	Treatment of Disseminated Talaromyces marneffei with Tracheal Infection: Two Case
		Reports.
PG	-	245-9
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-015-9891-4 [doi]
AB	-	Talaromyces marneffei infection involving the trachea presents as diffuse
		irregular nodules that grow on the tracheal lumen and/or rarely present as
		"concurrent severe eosinophilia. Herein, we report two patients without HIV"
		infection whose main tracheal and/or principal bronchi were involved by T.
		"marneffei infection, which manifested as diffuse proliferative nodules. In case"
		"1, the infection primarily affected the main trachea, resulting in structural"
		"cartilage damage, tracheal stenosis, and tracheal absence. In case 2, there were"
		diffuse proliferative nodules in the trachea and bronchi with marked
		eosinophilia. The final diagnosis was made based on a positive culture from
		"bronchiolar lavage fluid, skin, and tracheal polyps. Case 1 was administered"
		"antifungal treatment combined with surgery, but relapse occurred during a 3-month"
		follow-up period. Case 2 was treated by intravenous liposomal amphotericin B
		"combined with atomized inhaled liposomal amphotericin B, and he later showed"
		improvement; there was no relapse during the 12-month period of antifungal
		"treatment. Importantly, atomized inhaled amphotericin B antifungal treatment for"
		T. marneffei infection has never been previously reported.

TI	-	Case Report: Metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing in Diagnosis of Talaromycosis
		of an Immunocompetent Patient.
PG	-	656194
LID	-	10.3389/fmed.2021.656194 [doi]
LID	-	656194
AB	-	Background: Talaromycosis is a serious fungal infection which is rare in
		"immunocompetent people. Since its clinical manifestations lack specificity, it is"
		easy to escape diagnosis or be misdiagnosed leading to high mortality and poor
		prognosis. It is necessary to be alert to the disease when broad-spectrum
		antibiotics do not work well in immunocompetent patients. Case Presentation: A
		79-year-old man was admitted to our Infectious Diseases Department for recurrent
		fever and cough. Before admission he has been treated with
		"piperacillin-tazobactam, moxifloxacin followed by antituberculous agents in other"
		hospitals while his symptoms were not thoroughly eased. During the first
		"hospitalization in another hospital, he has been ordered a series of examination"
		"including radionuclide whole body bone imaging, transbronchial needle aspiration"
		"for subcarinal nodes. However, the results were negative showing no neoplasm."
		"After being admitted to our hospital, he underwent various routine examinations."
		"The initial diagnosis was bacterial pneumonia, and he was given meropenem"
		"injection and tigecycline injection successively, but there were no improvement"
		"of symptoms and inflammatory indicators. In the end, the main pathogen"
		Talaromyces marneffei was confirmed using Metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing
		"(mNGS), and his clinical symptoms gradually relieved after targeted antifungal"
		treatment using voriconazole. Conclusion: When empirical anti-infective treatment
		"is ineffective, it is necessary to consider the possibility of opportunistic"
		"fungal infections on immunocompetent patients. mNGS, as a new generation of"
		"pathogenic testing methods, can often detect pathogenic bacteria faster than"
		"traditional methods, providing important help for clinical decision-making."

AB	-	"OBJECTIVES: To elucidate the etiology, pathohistology, clinical characteristic"
		"and differential diagnosis, reduce missed diagnosis and improve the early"
		"detection and treatment of Penicillium Marneffei infection, by means of this case"
		report and literature review. METHODS: A patient hospitalized Penicillium
		"Marneffei infection were presented here, together with 27 cases in the"
		"literature, among which 10 patients had complications of AIDS and 5 with other"
		"diseases. RESULTS: Penicillium Marneffei is a temperature-sensitive, two-phase"
		"fungus, which can infect healthy and immunocompromised subjects. The common"
		symptoms are lymphadenopathy and infection of the lung. The infection may be
		"local or diffuse, involving the intestinal tract, soft tissue, bone, liver,"
		"spleen and bone marrow etc. The lesion can be classified into the granuloma type,"
		suppurative type and anergy/necrosis type histologically. The yeast-like fungus
		"were mainly found in the cytoplasm of macrophages, which were demonstrated by PAS"
		and Giemsa staining. The wine red color developed on the culture confirms the
		diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of Penicillium Marneffei infection should
		"be considered when tuberculosis is suspected but not confirmed, and if the"
		"patient has a history of having lived or traveled in Southeast Asia, is anemic or"
		resistant to anti-tuberculosis treatment. The major differential diagnosis is
		histoplasmosis. Early administration of anti-fungus drugs is essential for
		recovery.

TI	-	Dermatoscopy for the rapid diagnosis of Talaromyces marneffei infection: a case
		report.
PG	-	707
LID	-	10.1186/s12879-019-4351-2 [doi]
LID	-	707
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Talaromyces marneffei is a thermally dimorphic fungus endemic in
		south-east Asia. It predominantly occurs in both immunocompromised and
		immunosuppressed patients and can be fatal if diagnosis and treatment are
		delayed. The clinical manifestations of T. marneffei infection are nonspecific
		and rapid diagnosis of T. marneffei infection remains challenging. CASE
		PRESENTATION: A 24-year-old man came to our outpatient department with the sign
		of common skin lesions. The lesions were cuticolor follicular papules with or
		"without central umbilication, nodules and acne-like lesions, which are common in"
		"syringoma, steatocystoma multiplex and trichoepithelioma. A dermatoscopy"
		examination was performed to differentiate these skin lesions. The dermatoscopic
		images revealed circular or quasi-circular whitish amorphous structure with a
		"central brownish keratin plug, providing the diagnostic clues of T. marneffei"
		"infection. Therefore, a skin scrapings culture, skin biopsy and serological"
		detection for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were performed. The final
		diagnosis of this patient was T. marneffei and HIV co-infection. CONCLUSION:
		Rapid diagnosis of T. marneffei infection is clinically challenging since
		presenting clinical manifestations are nonspecific with significant overlap with
		other common conditions. This case highlights that dermatoscopy is a promising
		tool for the rapid diagnosis of T. marneffei infection in patients with
		"nonspecific skin lesions, assisting clinicians to avoid delayed diagnosis or"
		misdiagnosis.

AB	-	"The Penicillium genera, encompassing about 225 different species of fungi, are"
		naturally present in the environment. These genera are poorly linked to human
		"disease, except for Penicillium marneffei causing septicemia in immunocompromised"
		"hosts. Thus, Penicillium species recovered from respiratory tract samples are"
		"often considered as inhaled contaminants in the clinical laboratory. However, we"
		report here a case of fungal maxillary sinusitis due to Penicillium roqueforti
		"diagnosed in a 40-year-old female, a teacher, complaining of moderate pain for"
		months in the maxillary sinus and chronic posterior rhinorrhea. CT scanner and
		MRI enabled a preliminary diagnosis of left maxillary fungus ball-type sinusitis
		with calcified material seen on CT and marked very low signal in T2 weighted
		images seen on MRI. Anatomopathological and mycological examination of sinusal
		content showed septate hyphae. Direct sequencing of the sinusal content revealed
		P. roqueforti. P. roqueforti has been traditionally used in France for more than
		"200 years for cheese ripening. However, to our knowledge, this ascomycetous"
		fungus has very rarely been associated in the literature with human disease. P.
		"roqueforti is associated only with cheese worker's lung, a hypersensitivity"
		pneumonitis affecting employees in blue cheese factories. Other species in the
		Penicillium genus are reported to cause various disorders such as invasive
		"infection, superficial infection or allergic diseases. P. roqueforti has never"
		"previously been reported as a cause of human infection. Thus, we report the first"
		case of fungus ball due to P. roqueforti in an immunocompetent patient.

PG	-	184-95
AB	-	Infection caused by Penicillium spp. due to species other than P. marneffei is
		rare. We present three such cases of invasive disease. The first had chronic
		granulomatous disorder (CGD) with pulmonary infection caused by Penicillium spp.
		and he responded to amphotericin B therapy. Cases two and three were not known to
		be immunocompromised and both failed to respond to therapy. Case two had cerebral
		disease from an unknown source caused by P. chrysogenum. Case three probably
		acquired infection caused by P. decumbens peri-operatively and presented with
		paravertebral infection. The pertinent literature on invasive infections of
		"Penicillium spp. other than P. marneffei is reviewed. From 1951 onwards, 31"
		reported cases of invasive disease included 12 cases of pulmonary infection (six
		"in non-immunocompromised patients), four cases of prosthetic valve endocarditis,"
		"six cases of CAPD peritonitis, five cases of endophthalmitis, individual cases of"
		"fungemia and oesophagitis (both in AIDS), upper urinary tract infection and"
		"intracranial infection. Trauma, surgery or prosthetic material is commonly"
		implicated in the non-pulmonary cases. Superficial infection (keratitis and
		"otomycosis) is commonly caused by Penicillium spp. Allergic pulmonary disease,"
		"often occupational (such as various cheeseworkers' diseases), is also common."
		"Optimal therapy for invasive infection is not established, but surgery may be"
		advisable if possible. Amphotericin B may be the most effective antifungal drug.

PG	-	242
LID	-	10.1186/1471-2334-14-242 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Penicillium marneffei is the only dimorphic member of the genus and
		is an emerging pathogenic fungus that can cause fatal systemic mycosis.
		Penicillium marneffei disseminates hematogenously to other locations. Penicillium
		"marneffei infection most commonly involves the skin, lungs, and"
		"reticuloendothelial system, including the bone, bone marrow, joints, lymph nodes,"
		"pericardium, liver, and spleen. Involvement of the mesenteric and central nervous"
		systems has also been reported. Infection involving the trachea has not been
		previously reported. CASE PRESENTATION: We herein report a previously healthy
		28-year-old male farmer from Guangxi Province without HIV who became infected
		"with P. marneffei. The infection primarily affected the trachea, resulting in"
		"structural damage to the cartilage, tracheal stenosis, and tracheal absence. The"
		infection also involved the lungs and lymph nodes. After antifungal treatment and
		"surgery, his symptoms, signs, and lung imaging findings showed significant"
		improvement. This is the first such case report. CONCLUSION: Penicillium
		"marneffei infection in normal hosts is characterized by an insidious onset,"
		"various clinical manifestations, and common misdiagnosis, leading to high"
		mortality rates. Penicillium marneffei hematogenously disseminates throughout the
		whole body. This is the first reported case of P. marneffei infection involving
		"the main trachea with subsequent structural damage to the tracheal cartilage,"
		"severe tracheostenosis, and tracheal absence."

LID	-	e10615
AB	-	Emergent fungal infections are rare conditions that frequently cause death.
		Talaromycosis is a fungal infection caused by Talaromyces sp. that is
		predominantly prevalent in patients with acquired immunodeficiency
		"syndrome caused by human immunodeficiency virus infection, but in recent years we"
		have noticed increasing reports of cases in people with other underlying
		conditions. We report a case of talaromycosis in a Stage IV non-small cell lung
		cancer female patient undergoing whole brain radiation therapy who presented to
		"us with increasing dyspnea, cough and fever. The diagnosis was based on sputum"
		"and blood cultures, and even though our patient received anti-fungal treatment,"
		the outcome was fatal. This case shows that a high index of suspicion could be
		essential for such a highly lethal but potentially treatable fungal infection.

AB	-	The association between opportunistic infection (OI) and anaemia among
		HIV-infected patients remains to be studied. We investigated the prevalence and
		risk factors of anaemia in hospitalised HIV-infected patients to reveal the
		association between OI and anaemia. We conducted a retrospective study of
		HIV-positive hospitalised patients from June 2016 to December 2017 in Mengchao
		Hepatobiliary Hospital of Fujian Medical University. Patients' information on
		socio-demographic and clinical characteristics were carefully collected. The
		comparison of anaemia prevalence between groups was conducted with χ2 test. A
		logistic regression model was carried out to analyse the predictors of anaemia.
		The total prevalence of anaemia in hospitalised HIV-infected patients was 55.15%.
		"The prevalence of mild, moderate and severe anaemia was 41.42%, 11.08% and 2.64%,"
		respectively. Predictors independently associated with anaemia were: CD4 counts
		"&lt;50 cells/μl (odds ratio (OR): 6.376, 95% confidence interval (CI) ="
		"1.916-21.215, P = 0.003), CD4 counts 50-199 cells/μl (OR: 6.303, 95% CI ="
		"1.874-21.203, P = 0.003), co-infection with tuberculosis (TB) (OR: 2.703, 95% CI"
		"= 1.349-5.414, P = 0.005) or Penicillium marneffei (PM) (OR: 7.162, 95% CI ="
		"3.147-15.299, P &lt; 0.001). In Fujian, China, more than half inpatients with HIV"
		"were anaemic, but severe anaemia is infrequent. Lower CD4 counts, co-infection"
		with TB or PM were independent risk factors for anaemia. Chinese HIV patients
		"especially with TB, PM infection and low CD4 level should be routinely detected"
		for anaemia to improve therapy.

TI	-	Disseminated Penicillium marneffei: presenting illness of advanced HIV infection;
		"a clinicopathological review, illustrated by a case report."
PG	-	101-5
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Until recently Penicillium marneffei rarely caused human disease. It
		is now a frequently encountered opportunistic mycosis in HIV positive residents
		"of, and travellers to, south-east Asia. AIMS: To review aspects of clinical"
		"presentation, pathology, treatment, epidemiology and ecology of P. marneffei. To"
		report a case of disseminated P. marneffei occurring in the Northern Territory
		which illustrates many typical clinical and pathological features of this
		infection. CASE PRESENTATION: A Burmese immigrant presented to Royal Darwin
		"Hospital, Australia with a non-specific, subacute, febrile illness and a diffuse"
		"papular rash. The etiological agent was Penicillium marneffei, disseminated in"
		association with advanced HIV infection. The typical travel history and
		umbilicated papular rash were recognized on admission. Fungal stains of skin
		"biopsies and touch smears facilitated rapid diagnosis, and early antifungal"
		therapy resulted in clinical cure. CONCLUSIONS: Early distinction of
		"penicilliosis from other opportunistic mycoses, tuberculosis, Leishmaniasis, and"
		molluscum contagiosum is critical for effective management. The characteristic
		histological and mycological properties of P. marneffei are easily recognizable
		"if the diagnosis is considered. In view of geographic proximity, travel and"
		"immigration from endemic areas, Australia should expect further imported"
		penicilliosis as illustrated by this case report.

		"patients were found positive by using the nested PCR assay, while 23/30 (77%)"
		samples were found positive by using the real-time PCR assay. In order to express
		"accurately the fungal loads, we used a normalized linearized plasmid as an"
		internal control for real-time PCR. The assay results were correlated as the
		initial quantity (copies/μl) with fungal burden. These data indicate that
		combination of nested PCR and real-time PCR assay provides an attractive
		alternative for identification of T. marneffei DNA in whole blood samples of
		HIV-infected patients.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Penicillium marneffei is an important human immunodeficiency virus
		(HIV)-associated opportunistic pathogen in Southeast Asia. The epidemiology and
		the predictors of penicilliosis outcome are poorly understood. METHODS: We
		performed a retrospective study of culture-confirmed incident penicilliosis
		admissions during 1996-2009 at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh
		"City, Viet Nam. Seasonality of penicilliosis was assessed using cosinor models."
		Logistic regression was used to assess predictors of death or worsening disease
		"based on 10 predefined covariates, and Cox regression was performed to model"
		time-to-antifungal initiation. RESULTS: A total of 795 patients were identified;
		hospital charts were obtainable for 513 patients (65%). Cases increased
		"exponentially and peaked in 2007 (156 cases), mirroring the trends in AIDS"
		admissions during the study period. A highly significant seasonality for
		penicilliosis (P<.001) but not for cryptococcosis (P=.63) or AIDS admissions
		"(P=.83) was observed, with a 27% (95% confidence interval, 14%-41%) increase in"
		incidence during rainy months. All patients were HIV infected; the median CD4
		"cell count (62 patients) was 7 cells/μL (interquartile range, 4-24 cells/μL)."
		"Hospital outcome was an improvement in 347 (68%), death in 101 (20%), worsening"
		"in 42 (8%), and nonassessable in 23 (5%) cases. Injection drug use, shorter"
		"history, absence of fever or skin lesions, elevated respiratory rates, higher"
		"lymphocyte count, and lower platelet count independently predicted poor outcome"
		in both complete-case and multiple-imputation analyses. Time-to-treatment
		"initiation was shorter for patients with skin lesions (hazard ratio, 3.78; 95%"
		"confidence interval, 2.96-4.84; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Penicilliosis incidence"
		correlates with the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Viet nam. The number of cases increases
		"during rainy months. Injection drug use, shorter history, absence of fever or"
		"skin lesions, respiratory difficulty, higher lymphocyte count, and lower platelet"
		count predict poor in-hospital outcome.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: X-linked hyper-immunoglobulin M (XHIGM), a primary immunodeficiency"
		"syndrome caused by mutations in the CD40 ligand gene(CD40LG), presents with"
		recurrent respiratory infections in pediatric patients. We aimed to evaluate the
		spectrum of clinical features and respiratory pathogens in pediatric patients
		with XHIGM in China. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed seven pediatric
		patients who were diagnosed with XHIGM and received follow-up treatment at the
		Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center between January 2010 and January
		"2021. We determined their clinical characteristics, causative pathogens, and"
		prognosis by performing peripheral immunological and genetic tests. RESULTS:
		"There were seven boys with age ranging from 4-20 months (median age, 13 months)."
		Four of the seven respiratory infections were caused by Talaromyces marneffei(T.
		marneffei). Two patients had viral infections caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV) and
		human adenovirus respectively. One patient had a mixed infection caused by
		Pneumocystis carinii and CMV. Except for one child who died of respiratory
		"failure, one patient received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and"
		"recovered well, the other five patients survived with regular infusions of"
		intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) during the follow-up period. Six patients had
		"reduced antibody levels, especially IgG, IgA, and IgE levels. Increased serum IgM"
		"levels were detected in four cases, and three cases presented normal IgM levels"
		at onset. All children were diagnosed with XHIGM with CD40LG variation. Three
		novel mutations were identified in the present study. CONCLUSIONS: Our study
		"suggests that respiratory infections usually begin within 2 years old, fungi and"
		viruses are important pathogens causing respiratory infections in children with
		"XHIGM. In endemic areas, T. marneffei is the common pathogen of respiratory tract"
		infection in children with the disease.

TI	-	Diagnosis by metagenomic next-generation sequencing of a Talaromyces marneffei
		bloodstream infection in an HIV-negative child: A case report.
PG	-	903617

LID	-	903617
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Talaromyces marneffei (TM) bloodstream infections are life-
		threatening in immunocompromised individuals. The lack of specific clinical
		features for these infections and poor sensitivity associated with routine
		examination procedures make diagnosis challenging. Untimely diagnosis and delayed
		antifungal treatment threatens the life of such patients. CASE DESCRIPTION: We
		"report a case of a TM bloodstream infection, confirmed by the results of blood"
		"culture, of a child who was HIV negative and possessed a CD40LG gene mutation. A"
		diagnosis of TM was established by blood metagenomic next-generation sequencing
		"(mNGS) of the patient's blood, which was confirmed by microbiological culture of"
		"blood. On admission, this previously healthy male patient was 8-months of age,"
		who presented with recurrent fever and a cough of 6-days in duration. His
		"condition did not improve after antibacterial treatment for 5-days, with"
		significant and recurrent fever and worsening spirit. He was referred to the
		Department of Pediatrics in our tertiary medical institution with a white blood
		"cell count of 21.5(*)10∧9/L, C-reactive protein of 47.98 mg/L, and procalcitonin"
		of 0.28 ng/mL. A bloodstream infection was not excluded and blood was collected
		for microbial culture. The patient received a 1-day treatment of cefoperazone
		sulbactam and 6-days of imipenem cilastatin. Symptoms did not improve and fever
		"persisted. Blood was submitted for mNGS analysis and within 14-h, 14,352 TM reads"
		were detected with a relative abundance of 98.09%. Antibiotic treatment was
		immediately changed to intravenous amphotericin B combined with oral
		itraconazole. The condition of the child gradually improved. Blood culture showed
		"TM on the 7th day after hospitalization, confirming bloodstream infection. After"
		"the 13th day of hospital admission, the patient's body temperature dropped close"
		to 38°C and was discharged on the 30th day of hospitalization. Oral itraconazole
		was prescribed with follow up at the outpatient clinic. CONCLUSIONS: HIV-negative
		patients with CD40LG mutations may be potential hosts for TM. TM infections are
		rare in children and their detection by conventional microbial culture methods
		are inadequate for an early diagnosis. mNGS is a rapid detection method that
		"permits early diagnosis of uncommon infectious agents, such as TM, allowing for"
		improved patient outcomes.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To improve the diagnosis and treatment of Penicilliosis marneffei
		without human immunodeficiency virus infection. METHODS: Analyze and review the
		"clinical features, diagnosis and treatment of six cases of P. marneffei without"
		human immunodeficiency virus infection at The First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian
		"Medical University. RESULTS: Two cases were diagnosed in the ENT Department,"
		three cases in the respiratory department and one case in the dermatological
		"department. Penicillium marneffei infection was confirmed by sputum culture,"
		"blood culture and tissue biopsy. After definite diagnosis, one refused further"
		"treatment, and others showed significant improvement. CONCLUSION: Penicilliosis"
		marneffei is insidious onset and easy to be escaped and misdiagnosed. To achieve
		"early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, doubtful cases should be alerted for"
		the diagnoses as P. marneffei.

PG	-	427-9
AB	-	"INTRODUCTION: Penicilliosis is caused by Penicillium marneffei, a dimorphic"
		"fungus endemic in southeast Asia and southern China. Since 1988, this deep"
		mycosis has been one of the most frequent opportunistic infections in subjects
		with HIV infection in this region. We report the first observation of
		penicilliosis in Laos in a subject infected by HIV. CASE: A Laotian women with
		"HIV infection and under treatment for tuberculosis, was hospitalized with a"
		"cough, fever and cervical lymphadenopathy. A lymph node smear stained with RAL"
		555 confirmed the diagnosis of penicilliosis. The histologic examination detected
		"some Penicillium marneffei, stained by PAS and Gomori-Grocot. The patient was"
		treated successfully with ketoconazole. DISCUSSION: Penicilliosis is endemic in
		"southeast Asia. Especially in Thailand, it is a common opportunistic infection in"
		"HIV-infected persons. This case confirms the existence of penicilliosis in Laos,"
		where its prevalence as an opportunistic infection is probably underestimated.
		"The diagnostic method (slide stained with RAL 555) used in this case is simple,"
		"rapid, and appropriate for countries with limited economic resources to devote to"
		the penicilliosis diagnosis.

AB	-	We report a case of Talaromyces marneffei fungemia in a patient with HIV
		"infection with a history of travelling to southern China. At first, Pneumocystis"
		pneumonia was considered in this case because chest CT images showed typical
		"ground-glass opacity and elevated β-D-glucan levels. However, PCR testing of"
		sputum for Pneumocystis jirovecii was negative and a filamentous fungus was
		isolated from blood cultures. The cultured fungus was subsequently identified as
		"T. marneffei, and the patient was considered to have pneumonia caused by this"
		"organism. However, skin disease and lymphadenopathy, which are common in T."
		"marneffei infections, were not observed during the disease course. This patient"
		was successfully treated with voriconazole and consequently the chest CT shadow
		"disappeared. In the present case, T. marneffei infection required differentiation"
		from pneumonia with Pneumocystis jirovecii infection.

AB	-	Talaromyces marneffei is a dimorphic fungus endemic mainly in southeast and south
		"Asia. It causes severe mycosis, usually in immunocompromised individuals, such as"
		those with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Concomitant infection
		with T. marneffei and other opportunistic pathogens is plausible because the
		majority of T. marneffei infections occur in patients with advanced HIV
		"infection. Nonetheless, coinfection in the same site has rarely been reported,"
		and poses a considerable diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. We report the case
		of an HIV-infected Japanese patient who had lived in Thailand for 6 years. The
		"patient developed T. marneffei and Mycobacterium tuberculosis coinfection, and"
		both pathogens were isolated from the same sites: a blood specimen and a lymph
		node aspirate. Clinicians should be aware of concomitant infection with T.
		marneffei and other pathogens in patients with advanced HIV disease who are
		living in or who have visited endemic areas.

		"drugs (OR = 13.05, 95% CI: 2.39-71.21) were associated with increased odds of"
		"having OIs in heterosexual patients while increasing age (OR = 1.1, 95% CI:"
		1.01-1.24) was correlated to increased odd of acquiring OIs in the MSM group.
		"HIV-infected MSM accumulates OIs with increasing age, while heterosexual"
		individuals increase opportunistic infections by buying sex or injecting drugs.

		retrospective review.
PG	-	436-41
AB	-	Histoplasmosis and penicilliosis are fungal infections with similar clinical
		presentation and laboratory findings that were reported mainly in the era prior
		to highly active antiretroviral therapy. We conducted a retrospective review at
		two hospitals in Central Thailand of the medical records of HIV-positive patients
		with microbiologic evidence of histoplasmosis or penicilliosis between January
		2003 to September 2007 when antiretrovirals became widely available in Thailand.
		"Fifty patients met inclusion criteria; 36 had histoplasmosis, and 14 had"
		penicilliosis. Symptoms and laboratory findings on presentation were similar
		between the two infections except for a greater incidence of tachypnea and
		neutropenia among patients with histoplasmosis (both p < 0.05). For
		"histoplasmosis, blood culture had a significantly lower yield for detecting"
		infection compared to tissue microscopic examination highlighting the importance
		of obtaining tissue for diagnosis (p < 0.05).

PG	-	e13447
LID	-	10.1111/tid.13447 [doi]
AB	-	Talaromycosis is a fungal infection endemic in Southeast Asia. We report a case
		of a renal transplant recipient who developed infection after a trip to South
		China. She presented with constitutional symptoms and was found to have an
		FDG-avid lung mass. Histopathology demonstrated small yeast cells and culture
		grew Talaromyces marneffei. The patient was treated with 2 weeks of liposomal
		amphotericin B followed by itraconazole. The dose of tacrolimus was significantly
		reduced because of the interaction with itraconazole. Mycophenolate mofetil was
		"discontinued. After 12 months of treatment, the mass had completely resolved."
		Talaromycosis has mainly been reported in patients with AIDS and is uncommon
		among solid organ transplant recipients. The immune response against T. marneffei
		infection is mediated predominantly by T cells and macrophages. The diagnosis may
		not be suspected outside of endemic areas. We propose a therapeutic approach in
		transplant patients by extrapolating the evidence from the HIV literature and
		following practices applied to other endemic mycoses.

		"1991, because of fever, cough, skin eruptions, anorexia, and weight loss during"
		"the previous 2 months. In October, 1990, he had traveled in Sumatra. On"
		"examination he was ill, tachypneic, normotensive with a temperature of 39.1"
		degrees Celsius. The spleen was substantially enlarged. Laboratory investigations
		"showed: ALAT 72 U/I (normal 23 U/1), LDH 508 U/1 (normal 275 U/1). A bronchoscopy"
		with bronchoalveolar lavage revealed yeast cells. Gastroscopy showed an ulcer in
		the hypopharynx and an erosion in the stomach. Biopsies of this ulcer
		demonstrated the presence of Penicillium marneffei. Biopsies of the liver showed
		the same organism. The patient was treated with amphotericin B induction therapy
		"(1 dd 0.5 mg/kg for 21 days, total dose of 730 mg) in combination with"
		"flucytosine (3 dd 2500 mg, total dose 142 g in 19 days). In the following 2 weeks"
		"the temperature became normal, and the dyspnea and the skin eruptions"
		"disappeared, except for the mollusca contagiosa. The spleen diminished by 50%."
		LDH and ALAT became normal. Oral maintenance therapy followed with fluconazole
		"(the first 3 months 400 mg daily, followed by 200 mg a day). 24 months later, no"
		"recurrence had been observed. Case 2 was a 28-year-old, HIV-infected, homosexual"

AB	-	BACKGROUND: HIV-related opportunistic infections (OIs) and malignancies continued
		to cause morbidity and mortality in Chinese HIV-infected individuals. The
		objective for this study is to elucidate the prevalence and spectrums of OIs and
		malignancies in HIV-infected patients in the Beijing Ditan Hospital. METHODS: The
		evaluation of the prevalence and spectrums of OIs and malignancies was conducted
		by using the clinical data of 834 HIV-infected patients admitted in the Beijing
		"Ditan hospital from January 1, 2009, to November 30, 2012. RESULTS: The"
		prevalence and spectrums of OIs and malignancies varied contingent on geographic
		"region, transmission routes, and CD4 levels. We found that tuberculosis was most"
		"common OI and prevalence was 32.5%, followed by candidiasis(29.3%), Pneumocystis"
		"pneumonia(PCP)(22.4%), cytomegalovirus(CMV) infection(21.7%), other fungal"
		"infections(16.2%), mycobacterium avium complex(MAC)(11.3%), cryptococcosis(8.0%),"
		"progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy(PML)(4.4%), Cerebral"
		Toxoplasmosis(3.5%) and Penicillium marneffei infection(1.4%); while
		"Lymphoma(2.9%), Kaposi's sarcoma(0.8%) and cervix carcinoma(0.3%) were emerged as"
		common AIDS-defining malignancies. Pulmonary OI infections were the most
		prevalent morbidity and mortality in patients in the AIDS stage including
		pulmonary tuberculosis (26.6%) and PCP (22.4%). CMV infection(21.7%) was most
		common viral infection; Fungal OIs were one of most prevalent morbidity in
		"patients in the AIDS stage, including oral candidiasis (29.3%), other fungal"
		"infection (16.2%), Cryptococcosis (8.0%) and Penicillium marneffei infection"
		(1.4%). We found the low prevalence of AIDS-defining illnesses in central neural
		"system in this study, including progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy"
		"(4.4%), cerebral toxoplasmosis (3.5%), tuberculosis meningitis (3.2%),"
		cryptococcal meningitis (2.4%) and CMV encephalitis (1.1%). In-hospital mortality
		"rate was 4.3 per 100 person-years due to severe OIs, malignancies, and medical"
		"cost constraints. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence and spectrums of OIs, malignancies"
		and co-infections were discussed in this study. It would help increase the
		awareness for physicians to make a diagnosis and empirical treatment sooner and
		"plan good management strategies, especially in resource limited regions."

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Talaromyces marneffei is a highly pathogenic fungus that can cause
		life-threatening fatal systemic mycosis. Disseminated Talaromycosis marneffei
		"affects multiple organs, including the lungs, skin, and reticuloendothelial"
		"system. However, T. marneffei infection has rarely been reported in human"
		immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative infants with multiple intestinal
		perforations and diffuse hepatic granulomatous inflammation. CASE PRESENTATION:
		We present the case of an HIV-negative 37-month-old boy who has had recurrent
		pneumonia since infancy and was infected with disseminated Talaromycosis.
		Contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the whole abdomen showed hepatomegaly
		and intestinal wall thickening in the ascending colon and cecum with mesenteric
		"lymphadenopathy. Colonoscopy showed a cobblestone pattern with erosion, ulcer,"
		"polypoid lesions, and lumen deformation ranging from the colon to the cecum. T."
		"marneffei was isolated from the mucous membrane of the colon, liver, and bone"
		"marrow. After antifungal treatment and surgery, his clinical symptoms"
		significantly improved. Whole-exome sequencing using the peripheral blood of the
		patient and his parents' revealed a heterozygous missense mutation in exon 17 of
		"the STAT3 gene (c.1673G>A, p.G558D). CONCLUSIONS: In T. marneffei"
		"infection-endemic areas, endoscopic examination, culture, or histopathology from"
		the intestine tissue should be performed in disseminated Talaromycosis patients
		with gastrointestinal symptoms. Timely and systemic antifungal therapy could
		improve the prognosis. Immunodeficiency typically should be considered in
		HIV-negative infants with opportunistic infections.

TI	-	Multiresistent opportunistic talaromycosis in a patient with ovarian cancer.
PG	-	464-466
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Talaromycosis (penicillinosis) is multiresistent opportunistic
		mycosis. The infection can be inapparent and it can simmulate malignant tumor
		dissemination in some patients. CASE: We present a case of 33-years-old patient
		"with mucinous adenocarcinoma of left ovary, initially FIGO IIC. The patient had"
		"had hysterectomy, bilateral adnexectomy, omentectomy and port-site metastasis"
		extirpation. Six cycles of 1st chemother-apy paclitaxel and carboplatin had been
		administered to patient follow-ing the surgery. Positron emission tomography /
		"computed tomography (PET/CT) scan after the treatment, had shown metabolic"
		"activity infiltrat-ing both lung apexes, supposedly with no dis-ease correlation,"
		"and hypermetabolic foci in spleen, suspicious of be-ing metastases. Pa-cient"
		"showed no clinical symp-toms, nor markers of inflammation elevation. Initially"
		elevated serum tumor markers CA125 and CA72-4 had decreased after the treatment.
		Bronchoalveolar lavage cytology described presence of inflammatory infiltration
		with fungiform-ing hyphae - most probably an aspergillosis. Mannan and
		"galactomannan serology was negative. In regard to splenectomy plans, treatment"
		with voriconazol was initiated empirically. Result of fungi cultivation out of
		"bronchoalveolar lavage was finalized later, show-ing sporadic presence o"
		Penicillium sp. with resistance to antimycotic treatment except for amphotericin
		"B. Liposomal amphotericin B treatment was administered in two cures, 28 days in"
		total. Immunomodulatory treatment of secondary cellular immunodeficiency and
		vaccination against encapsulated bacteria was given to the patient. Splenectomy
		was performed 6 months after the end of chemother-apy treatment. Histopathology
		"showed chronic granulomatous inflammation without mycotic hyphae, with no"
		"evidence of tumor cells. After the splenectomy, patient was treated by surgical"
		incision and drainage and by klindamycin for intraabdominal abscess in left
		"hypogastric area. CONCLUSION: Patient is under follow up by oncologist,"
		"immunologist and gynecologist 12 months after the splenectomy, she is surveilled"
		by PET/CT and serum tumor markers. Talaromycosis can be clinically inapparent in
		"spite of its dissemination. It can be present in diffuse, granulomatous and mixed"

		commonly reported in southeast Asia. T. marneffei infection predominantly occurs
		in patients with immunodeficiency and can be fatal if diagnosis and treatment
		were delayed. Conventional diagnosis of T. marneffei infection relies heavily on
		"tissue culture and histologic analysis, which is time consuming and has limited"
		positive rate. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of T. marneffei remains urgent for
		effective therapy and prevention. This case is the first reported T. marneffei

		diagnosis of T. marneffei infection assistant by mNGS underlies the potential of
		this technique in rapid etiological diagnosis.

AB	-	Talaromyces (Penicillium) marneffei (T. marneffei) is an important pathogenic
		thermally dimorphic fungus in Southeast Asia that leads to a life-threatening
		"systemic mycosis in immunodeficient hosts, especially in AIDS patients. With the"
		"increasing AIDS epidemic, the number of patients with T. marneffei infections in"
		mainland China has increased rapidly in recent years. The infection can be
		"life-threatening in people with immunodeficiencies, such as HIV, organ"
		"transplantations, autoimmune diseases, and malignant tumors. Here, we present a"
		disseminated T. marneffei infection case in a renal transplant recipient
		successfully treated with voriconazole followed by itraconazole. We describe the
		patient's clinical progression from onset symptoms to recovery and review the
		additional 14 published cases with T. marneffei infections in renal transplant
		"recipients. In addition, we discuss the route of infection and treatment"
		strategies of T. marneffei. Our data suggest that patients with kidney
		transplantations in T. marneffei infection-endemic areas should presume the
		possibility of infection and initiate appropriate antifungal treatment.

AB	-	"RATIONALE: Recently, Talaromyces marneffei (T. marneffei) has been reported in"
		"human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative patient with underlying diseases,"
		"such as oral cancer, colon cancer, haematological malignancies, connective tissue"
		"disease, diabetes mellitus, and corticosteroids or immunosuppressive agents."
		"Similar to HIV-positive ones, such patients were observed with CD4"
		lymphocytopenia. PATIENT CONCERNS: We reported a case of a 45-year-old woman who
		was diagnosed with disseminated T. marneffei and Mycobacteria kansasii (M.
		kansasii) with papillary thyroid cancer as the underlying disease. T-cell subsets
		"counts, CD4 T-cell%, CD8 T-cell%, CD4/CD8 ratio, and NK cell% were all turned out"
		to be normal. DIAGNOSES: Based on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and skin lesions
		"secretion cultures, blood culture, the patient was diagnosed with disseminated T."
		marneffei and M. kansasii. Pathological examination reported papillary thyroid
		cancer with cervical lymph node metastasis. INTERVENTIONS: The patient received
		the combined and longer antifungal therapy and drug regimens for M. kansasii. She
		had total thyroidectomy with radical neck dissection to treat the papillary
		thyroid cancer. OUTCOMES: The patient had a favorable outcome for 19 months
		without recurrence. LESSONS: T. marneffei could infect non-HIV individuals with
		underlying disease under the condition of normal T-cell counts. The symptoms were
		lack of specificity and were more likely to be misdiagnosed. Such patients with
		unidentified T-cell dysfunction or other unidentified primary immunodeficiency
		"disorders may prone to coinfect with other opportunistic pathogens, such as M."
		"kansasii. Compared with HIV-positive ones, they need combined and much longer"
		antifungal therapy.

TI	-	T. marneffei infection complications in an HIV-negative patient with pre-existing

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Talaromyces marneffei (T. marneffei) is a thermal dimorphic
		pathogenic fungus that often causes fatal opportunistic infections in human
		immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. Although T. marneffei-infected
		cases have been increasingly reported among non-HIV-infected patients in recent
		"years, no cases of T. marneffei infection have been reported in pulmonary"
		"sarcoidosis patients. In this case, we describe a T. marneffei infection in an"
		HIV-negative patient diagnosed with pulmonary sarcoidosis. CASE PRESENTATION: A
		41-year-old Chinese man who had pre-existing pulmonary sarcoidosis presented with
		daily hyperpyrexia and cough. Following a fungal culture from bronchoalveolar
		"lavage (BAL), the patient was diagnosed with T. marneffei infection. A"
		high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) chest scan revealed bilateral lung
		"diffuse miliary nodules, multiple patchy exudative shadows in the bilateral"
		"superior lobes and right inferior lobes, air bronchogram in the consolidation of"
		"the right superior lobe, multiple hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathies and"
		"local pleural thickening. After 3 mos of antifungal therapy, the patient's"
		"pulmonary symptoms rapidly disappeared, and the physical condition improved"
		markedly. A subsequent CT re-examination demonstrated that foci were absorbed
		remarkably after treatment. The patient is receiving follow-up therapy and
		assessment for a cure. CONCLUSION: This case suggested that clinicians should pay
		more attention to non-HIV-related lung infections in patients with pulmonary
		sarcoidosis. Early diagnosis and treatment with antifungal therapy can improve
		the prognosis of T. marneffei infection.

AB	-	Talaromyces marneffei is an opportunistic fungal infection seen in
		immunocompromised patients including those with HIV/AIDS. It is usually seen in
		"patients who live in or are from tropical Asia. In HIV patients, oropharyngeal"
		and laryngeal lesions are usually part of disseminated infection. We describe a
		case of 63-year-old Vietnamese male with history of HIV/AIDS who presented with
		localized T. marneffei tonsillar infection without disseminated disease. Imaging
		studies showed a right tonsillar mass with right cervical lymphadenopathy which
		was initially thought to be malignancy. The patient underwent biopsy of the mass
		and histology showed noncaseating granulomas on hematoxylin and eosin stain as
		well as yeast on Grocott methenamine silver stain. Fungal culture of the biopsy
		specimen grew suede-like grayish-white colonies with diffuse underlying deep red
		color pigment which was identified as Talaromyces marneffei. The patient was
		treated with intravenous liposomal amphotericin B and achieved resolution of
		symptoms and tonsillar mass. In HIV/AIDS patients who are either from endemic
		regions or with history of travel to endemic areas particularly Southeast Asia
		"and China, T. marneffei infection should be considered in differential diagnoses"
		of a tonsillar mass.

AB	-	"Talaromyces marneffei (T. marneffei) is a pathogenic, thermally dimorphic fungus"
		that can cause invasive infection and significant morbidity in immunocompromised
		"patients, especially those with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or other"
		"immune defects. Currently, T. marneffei infection is understood to be not limited"
		"only to immunodeficient patients, as cases of immunocompromised patients or"
		immunocompetent patients associated with T. marneffei infection have been
		increasingly reported in recent years. The exact mechanism is not yet clear. This
		study reports a case of an advanced lung adenocarcinoma patient with T. marneffei
		infection. The patient is a 59-year-old female with a 3-month history of
		"coughing, expectoration, and progressive dyspnea. Computed tomography (CT) scans"
		"showed a mass in the left lower lung, multiple plaques and nodules in both lungs,"
		"and left pleural effusion. The patient was diagnosed with T. marneffei infection,"
		as T. marneffei was found in both the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and the
		sputum. According to the pathology of the left lung lesion by transbronchial lung
		"biopsy (TBLB) and contrast-enhanced brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the"
		patient was diagnosed with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
		mutation-positive stage Ⅳ lung adenocarcinoma (T4N3M1c). She received intravenous
		"liposomal amphotericin B and oral itraconazole as anti-fungal treatments,"
		"meanwhile, icotinib was used as an anti-tumor treatment. Following treatment, CT"
		"re-examination showed that the mass was remarkably absorbed, and some of the lung"
		nodules had disappeared. No relapse of T. marneffei infection was found during
		the follow-up. This case indicates that patients with malignant lung tumors may
		possibly become infected with T. marneffei. Sequential treatment of amphotericin
		liposome B followed by itraconazole is effective for lung cancer patients with T.
		marneffei infection.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: The clinical and laboratory characteristics of AIDS-associated
		"Talaromyces marneffei infection, a rare but a fatal mycosis disease of the"
		"central nervous system, remain unclear. CASE PRESENTATION: Herein, we conducted a"
		retrospective study of ten AIDS patients with cerebrospinal fluid
		culture-confirmed central nervous system infection caused by Talaromyces
		marneffei. All 10 patients were promptly treated with antifungal treatment for a
		"prolonged duration and early antiviral therapy (ART). Among them, seven patients"
		"were farmers. Nine patients were discharged after full recovery, while one"
		"patient died during hospitalization, resulting in a mortality rate of 10%. All"
		patients initially presented symptoms and signs of an increase in intracranial
		"pressure, mainly manifesting as headache, dizziness, vomiting, fever, decreased"
		"muscle strength, diplopia or even altered consciousness with seizures in severe"
		patients. Nine patients (90%) showed lateral ventricle dilatation or intracranial
		infectious lesions on brain CT. Cerebrospinal fluid findings included elevated
		"intracranial pressure, increased leukocyte count, low glucose, low chloride and"
		high cerebrospinal fluid protein. The median CD4(+) T count of patients was
		"104 cells/μL (IQR, 36-224 cells/μL) at the onset of the disease. The CD4(+) T"
		cell counts of three patients who eventually died were significantly lower
		"(W = 6.00, p = 0.020) than those of the patients who survived. CONCLUSIONS: The"
		common clinical symptoms of T. marneffei central nervous system infection are
		associated with high intracranial pressure and intracranial infectious lesions.
		Earlier recognition and diagnosis and a prolonged course of amphotericin B
		treatment followed by itraconazole combined with early ART might reduce the
		mortality rate.

PG	-	79-85
AB	-	"A case of disseminated penicilliosis marneffei, the first to be diagnosed in"
		"Italy, is described in a male HIV-positive drug addict. The patient had visited"
		Thailand several times in the two years prior to his hospitalization. The
		"presenting signs were fever, productive cough, facial skin papules and pustules,"
		nodules on both thumbs and oropharyngeal candidiasis. Penicillium marneffei was
		isolated from a series of blood specimens with the lysis centrifugation
		"procedure. Septate, yeast-like cells were observed in histological sections of"
		the nodules and sputum smears. The patient was treated for 6 weeks with
		"amphotericin B (total dosage 1,400 mg) and flucytosine (150 mg/kg/die) for the"
		first 3 weeks. Prompt clinical improvement and sterilization of all biological
		specimens were attained. Itraconazole was administered as maintenance therapy
		(400 mg/die for the first month and 200 mg afterward). During the follow-up
		"period, no relapse was observed. The patient, however, did succumb to a variety"
		of non-mycotic infections and died nine months after start of therapy. At
		"autopsy, P. marneffei was not detected in his tissues. Serological studies were"
		performed with a micro-immunodiffusion procedure using a mycelial culture
		filtrate antigen of P. marneffei. Sera taken early in the course of the disease
		gave positive antibody reactions. Whereas sera taken 3-5 months following therapy
		were negative. All known cases of penicilliosis marneffei in bamboo rats and in
		humans among the inhabitants and visitors to the endemic areas of P. marneffei in
		South East Asia and Indonesia are summarized.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: An upper abdominal mass without tenderness often indicates a benign
		or malignant tumor once liver or spleen hyperplasia has been excluded. A
		lymphadenopathic mass from Talaromyces marneffei infection is rare. CASE
		PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 29-year-old human immunodeficiency virus
		(HIV) infected man who presented with an upper abdominal mass and without any
		symptoms related with infection. Histopathology and next-generation sequencing
		(NGS) following biopsy of the mass confirmed T. marneffei-infected
		"lymphadenopathy, and the patient was successfully treated with amphotericin B and"
		itraconazole. CONCLUSIONS: This case report suggests that potential fungal
		infection should be considered during the diagnostic workup of a mass in clinical
		practice.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: This study presents a relatively rare case of disseminated Talaromyces
		marneffei (T. marneffei) infection in an HIV-negative patient. METHODS: An
		8-month-old girl was hospitalized because of uncontrollable fever and cough for 6
		"days. Routine laboratory tests, biochemical detection, immunological tests,"
		"pathogenic examination, and imaging inspection were performed. Genetic tests of"
		"trio whole genome sequencing (Trio-WES), trio copy number sequencing"
		"(Trio-CNVseq), and Sanger sequencing were conducted to identify pathogenic"
		variants. In silico analysis of the sequence alignment and structural modeling
		results was carried out to study the possible pathogenicity of the identified
		variant. Western blotting was performed to investigate the expression of the
		identified gene at the protein level. RESULTS: Enhanced CT and MRI scanning
		"demonstrated thymic dysplasia, diffuse pulmonary and liver nodules, and many"
		"balloon-like air sacs in both lungs. The white blood cell count, neutrophil"
		"count, and neutrophil ratio were normal or elevated. The patient was HIV-negative"
		and bone marrow and blood culture showed T. marneffei infection. Total lymphocyte
		"count, CD3+ T lymphocyte count, CD3+CD4+ T lymphocyte count, CD3+CD8+ T"
		"lymphocyte count, and NK cell count decreased, while the number of CD19 positive"
		"B cells increased. However, the ratio of CD3+CD4+:CD3+CD8+ T cells increased."
		Trio-WES identified a homozygous private variant of NM_006509:
		c.400_c.401insAGC/p.Lys134 delinsLysGln in RELB and Sanger sequencing validated
		the result. Structural modeling indicated that the variant may be pathogenic.
		Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis showed
		that the expression of RelB in the patient was lower than that in the healthy
		controls at mRNA and protein levels. CONCLUSION: This is the first report on
		disseminated T. marneffei infection in a patient with a homozygous private
		variant of RELB.

AB	-	Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC) is a disorder of recurrent or persistent
		"chronic noninvasive symptomatic infections of the skin, nails and mucous"
		"membranes. This disorder is primarily caused by Candida albicans. Many factors,"
		"including primary immunodeficiencies, can make a host more susceptible to CMC."
		Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) gain-of-function (GOF)
		mutations are the most common genetic etiologies of CMC. We describe a case of
		CMC with disseminated Talaromyces marneffei infection caused by a new pathogenic
		"Y287N mutation at amino acid 287 in the coiled-coiled domain of STAT1, which was"
		identified using whole-exome sequencing. Position 287 might be a hot spot for
		missense mutations because several amino acid substitutions were found there.
		Flow cytometry suggested that the Y287N mutation might reduce the expression of
		IL-17 of Th17 cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated by phorbol
		myristate acetate and ionomycin. The STAT1 Y287N GOF mutation may be the direct
		"cause of recurrent cutaneous and mucosal candidiasis, including the T. marneffei"
		infection in this patient.

AB	-	Penicillium marneffei (Talaromyces marneffei) infection sometimes occurs in
		"HIV-infected patients in South-East Asia. However, reports on asymptomatic cases"
		"are rare. Herein, we report a case of a 27-year-old Burmese HIV-positive woman"
		"with pulmonary penicilliosis. Chest radiography showed a lung mass; however, the"
		patient did not have any respiratory symptoms. Cultures of bronchoalveolar lavage
		and lung tissue grew P marneffei. The patient was diagnosed with penicilliosis
		and successfully treated with amphotericin B and itraconazole. Our findings
		suggest that P marneffei infection should be considered in the differential
		"diagnosis of a lung mass in HIV-infected patients, even when asymptomatic for"
		respiratory symptoms.

AB	-	Talaromyces marneffei (also called Penicilliosis Marneffei or T. marneffei) is a
		rare fungal disease that is prevalent mainly in Southeast Asia and commonly seen
		in immunocompromised hosts. It was rarely observed in immunocompetent hosts. We
		report a case of acute disseminated T. marneffei in an immunocompetent patient in
		the non-prevalent region. This patient had never visited the endemic area. The
		patient experienced a persistent fever. Brain CT and magnetic resonance imaging
		(MRI) showed a mass in the right frontal with osteolytic damage. Excessive white
		blood cell (WBC) count and C-reactive protein content were observed. Antibiotics
		"including meropenem and linezolid could not play an effect, and another two hard"
		masses appeared in his right neck and front chest wall. The aspirates from the
		right frontal mass and bone marrow were cultured. The final diagnose of this
		"infection was disseminated T. marneffei. After voriconazole treatment, all"
		symptoms improved gradually. We present this case and aim to promote more
		clinicians and microbiologists in the non-endemic region to recognize this rare
		disease.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Talaromyces marneffei, also named Penicillium marneffei, is an"
		opportunistic pathogen that can cause systemic or limited infection in human
		beings. This infection is especially common in human immunodeficiency virus
		"(HIV)-infected hosts; however, it has also been recently reported in HIV-negative"
		"hosts. Here, we report a very rarely seen case of T. marneffei pulmonary"
		infection in a non-HIV-infected patient with signal transducer and activator of
		transcription 3 (STAT3) mutation. CASE PRESENTATION: A 34-year-old woman was
		admitted to our hospital for uncontrollable nonproductive cough and dyspnea with
		exercise. She had been immunocompromised since infancy. Computerized tomography
		scan showed multiple ground glass opacities with multiple bullae in both lungs.
		Next generation sequencing (NGS) of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid identified
		T. marneffei nucleotide sequences. Culture of bronchoscopy specimens further
		"verified the results. The patient was HIV negative, and blood gene detection"
		"indicated STAT3 mutation. To date, following the application of itraconazole, the"
		"patient has recovered satisfactorily. CONCLUSION: In clinical practice, T."
		"marneffei infection among HIV-negative individuals is relatively rare, and we"
		found that patients who are congenitally immunocompromised due to STAT3 mutation
		may be potential hosts. Early diagnosis and timely treatment are expected to
		improve the prognosis of T. marneffei infection. NGS is a powerful technique that
		may play an important role in this progress. The reviews of this paper are
		available via the supplemental material section.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Autoantibody to interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) has been reported to be
		associated with adult-onset immunodeficiency in patients from Asian countries.
		This study aimed to determine the prevalence of autoantibody to IFN-γ among
		non-HIV patients in northern Thailand who were repeatedly infected with unusual
		"intracellular pathogens. METHODS: A cross-sectional, case-control study was"
		conducted between March 2011 and March 2012 at Chiang Mai University Hospital. 20
		"cases, non-HIV, aged 18-60 years, presented with at least 2 episodes of culture"
		or histopathology proven opportunistic infections were enrolled. Controls
		comprised 20 HIV-infected patients and 20 healthy adults who were age- and
		sex-matched with cases. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to
		detect the presence of antibody to IFN-γ. RESULTS: 11 participants in each group
		"were female. The mean ages were 48.1±6.4, 48.3±6.3, and 47.1±6.5 years among"
		"cases, HIV-infected, and healthy controls, respectively. The opportunistic"
		infections among 20 cases included disseminated non-tuberculous mycobacterial
		"(NTM) infection (19 patients/24 episodes), disseminated penicilliosis marneffei"
		"(12 patients/12 episodes), and non-typhoidal Salmonella bacteremia (7 patients/8"
		"episodes). At the cutoff level of 99 percentile of controls, the prevalence of"
		"autoantibody to IFN-γ were 100%, 0%, and 0%, among cases, HIV-infected, and"
		"healthy controls, respectively (p-value <0.001). The mean concentrations of"
		antibody to IFN-γ were 3.279±0.662 and 0.939±0.630 O.D. among cases with and
		"without active opportunistic infection, respectively (p-value<0.001)."
		"CONCLUSIONS: In northern Thailand, autoantibody to IFN-γ was strongly associated"
		with adult-onset immunodeficiency. The level of antibody to IFN-γ in patients who
		had active opportunistic infection was relatively higher than those without
		active infection.

PG	-	67-70
LID	-	10.1080/17843286.2022.2067957 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal symptoms are not uncommon in patients infected with
		"Talaromyces marneffei (T. marneffei). However, the reports on intestinal T."
		marneffei infection were rare. We report a case of disseminated T. marneffei
		infection with intestine involvement. CASE PRESENTATION: A 41-year-old female
		with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) was admitted to our hospital for
		"long-term fever, followed by abdominal pain and diarrhea. The colonoscopy"
		performed in our hospital revealed ulcerative lesions in the colon and terminal
		ileum. Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining of intestinal ulcer revealed that the
		small dots distributed inside and outside of the macrophages were yeast
		microorganisms. Further culture of bone marrow sample was confirmed T. marneffei
		"positive. A diagnosis of disseminated T. marneffei infection was made, with"
		"intestine involvement. We also summarized the clinical characteristics,"
		endoscopic findings and histopathological features of intestinal T. marneffei by
		literature review. CONCLUSION: In HIV-infected and other immunocompromised
		patients with gastrointestinal symptoms and/or associated abdominal imaging
		"abnormalities, intestinal T. marneffei infection should be taken into"
		consideration. Serious manifestations such as intestinal obstruction and
		intestinal perforation may occur. Early diagnosis is of great significance to
		prevent the deterioration of the illness and improve the prognosis.
		Histopathological examination and culture of intestinal lesions are helpful to
		improve the diagnosis of intestinal T. marneffei infection. ABBREVIATIONS: AIDS:
		acquired immune deficiency syndrome; ART: antiretroviral therapy; ESR:

AB	-	Talaromyces Marneffei infection is rarely reported in patients with chronic
		active Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. We reported an old man with chronic
		"fever, pleomorphic rash, cough, EBV viraemia, and secondary hemophagocytic"
		syndrome. Repeated histological biopsy and culture of skin lesions revealed
		Talaromyces Marneffei. This patient was diagnosed as chronic active EBV
		"infection, and Talaromyces Marneffei infection. After treated with glucocorticoid"
		"steroids and anti-fungal therapy, the patient finally recovered. EBV infection is"
		"usually seen in immune compromised patients, who are susceptible to opportunistic"
		pathogens rarely as Talaromyces Marneffei in this case.

PG	-	235-7
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To present a rare Chinese case of disseminated Penicillium marneffei
		infection with fungemia and endobronchial disease in an AIDS patient. CLINICAL
		PRESENTATION AND INTERVENTION: A 26-year-old policeman who had resided in Guangxi
		"Province, China, for 3 years presented to his county hospital with a 2-month"
		history of high fever and cough. A provisional diagnosis of pulmonary
		"tuberculosis (TB) was made. Accordingly, the patient was treated with anti-TB"
		drugs for 1 month but with no clinical improvement; he was then referred to West
		China Hospital. Blood and bone marrow cultures as well as a bronchoscopic biopsy
		were positive for P. marneffei. A confirmatory serologic test for HIV was
		positive. A combination therapy with amphotericin B and itraconazole was
		"instituted, and the patient responded well to treatment. CONCLUSION: This case"
		shows endobronchial involvement caused by an emerging fungal microorganism.
		HIV-positive patients with a history of residence in or travel to southern China
		and a clinical presentation suggestive of TB but responding poorly to anti-TB
		treatment may have P. marneffei infection.

		in an AIDS patient: a case report and literature review.
PG	-	1493-1499
LID	-	10.2147/IDR.S207819 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Talaromyces marneffei (T. marneffei) is an important opportunistic
		pathogen found in human immunodeficiency virus-positive individuals in Southeast
		"Asia, Southern China, and Northeastern India. Patients with disseminated"
		talaromycosis commonly develop multi-organ involvement including the skin. In
		"this report, we describe the clinical presentation, investigation, management,"
		and clinical outcome of an acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patient
		with newly diagnosed disseminated talaromycosis without skin involvement. CASE
		PRESENTATION: A 27-year-old male with AIDS presented with acute onset of
		"abdominal pain for 4 days and fever for 2 days. He had been diagnosed with AIDS,"
		"pneumocystis pneumonia, and presumptive smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis"
		2 months previously. His initial CD4 count was 91 cells/mm(3). After a 3-week
		"course of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and anti-tuberculosis treatment,"
		anti-retroviral therapy was initiated. Physical examination revealed left upper
		"quadrant tenderness but no abnormal skin lesions. On this visit, his CD4 count"
		rose to 272 cells/mm(3) (19%). Computed tomography of the abdomen showed evidence
		of a small hypodense lesion with a thin enhancing rim at the spleen and extensive
		intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy. Empirical amphotericin B deoxycholate was
		"administered in response to positive serum galactomannan, although this was"
		switched to intravenous liposomal amphotericin B 1 week later because of acute
		kidney injury. Blood and bone marrow cultures for fungus grew T. marneffei on
		"days 9 and 12, respectively. After 21 days of treatment, oral itraconazole"
		replaced intravenous therapy. The patient was discharged home after 29 days in
		the hospital and continued to improve clinically at a follow-up visit as an
		outpatient. CONCLUSION: Talaromycosis is a fairly common opportunistic infection
		"among AIDS patients in Thailand, despite a rise in CD4 count which may reflect a"
		"change in immune status. To a lesser extent, a systemic disease without skin"
		involvement can be expected in real clinical practice.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Talaromyces marneffei, is an opportunistic pathogenic fungus that is"
		most commonly reported in Southeast Asia and disseminated T.marneffei infection
		predominantly occurs in patients with immunodeficiency. With a potential to
		"invade multiple organs, it can be fatal for patients if diagnosis and treatment"
		"are delayed. In current clinical practice, the diagnosis of T.marneffei infection"
		"relies heavily on tissue culture and histologic analysis, which may suffer from"
		limited positive rate and is sometimes time consuming. The rapid and accurate
		diagnosis of disseminated T.marneffei infection remains challenging. CASE
		"PRESENTATION: A 22-year-old man gradually developed fever, cough, lower"
		"extremities weakness, jaundice and rash, for which a 3-month extensive"
		"investigation failed to reach a diagnosis. After admitted into our hospital,"
		laboratory and radiological tests revealed multiple lesions in the patient's
		"brain, spinal cord, and lungs. We performed next generation sequencing on the"
		"patient's skin tissue, bone marrow, blood and cerebrospinal fluid, which all"
		identified numerous Talaromyces marneffei nucleotide sequences and leaded to the
		rapid diagnosis and treatment of disseminated T.marneffei infection. CONCLUSIONS:
		This case underline the clinical significance of T.marneffei as a possible
		pathogen in immune-competent patients. This successful application of the next
		generation sequencing assisting the rapid diagnosis of disseminated T.marneffei
		infection provides a new perspective in the clinical approach to the systematic
		fungi infections and highlights the potential of this technique in rapid
		etiological diagnosis.

AB	-	We report a case of Penicillium marneffei infection in a previously healthy 3.5
		years-old Chinese boy and review the literature. The details of the case are
		described with emphasis on his immune function and treatment outcome. This boy
		had transient immunodeficiency involving phagocytic and NK cells due to P.
		marneffei infection which resolved after treatment with gamma interferon and
		amphotericin B. A prolonged course of fluconazole of 1 year was successful in
		"preventing relapse. Gamma interferon, amphotericin B and a prolonged course of"
		fluconazole may be useful in the treatment of life-threatening infection by P.
		marneffei.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: A retrospective study was performed to investigate the clinical
		features and associated factors of invasive mycoses (IM) in patients with
		connective tissue disease (CTD) from Southern China. METHODS: Demographic and
		clinical data were recorded. Associated factors were analyzed by logistic
		regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 6911 patients with CTD were included. IM
		"was diagnosed in 32 patients (incidence, 0.5%). IM was predominant in patients"
		"with ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) (incidence, 1.5%, 7/480). Lung was commonly"
		"involved (30/32, 93.8%). Aspergillus spp. (81.3%) were the leading strain. The"
		positive rate of fungi detection in sputum culture was 69.0%. Serum galactomannan
		"(GM) test was positive in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from seven (7/10,"
		"70.0%) patients. Ten patients died (31.3%), including three with AAV (42.9%) and"
		"seven with SLE (36.8%). Penicillium marneffei was the most fatal (mortality,"
		"100%). Non-survivors had higher prevalence of leukopenia (30.0% vs 4.5%,"
		"P = 0.04), lymphopenia (100.0% vs 59.1%, P = 0.02), elevated serum creatinine"
		"(70.0% vs 27.3%, P = 0.02), and co-infection (70.0% vs 18.2%, P = 0.004) than"
		survivors. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that lymphopenia
		"[odds ratio (OR) = 3.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29-8.38, P = 0.01] and"
		"median-to-high dose of glucocorticoid (GC) [OR = 3.40, 95% CI 1.04-11.13,"
		P = 0.04] were associated with IM in patients with CTD. CONCLUSIONS: IM tended to
		"develop in patients with AAV, resulting in high mortality. Sputum culture and GM"
		test in BALF were effective methods to distinguish IM. Vigilance against
		"lymphopenia, impaired kidney function, and co-infection improved the prognosis of"
		IM.

LID	-	10.1159/000347112 [doi]
AB	-	Immunodeficiency due to anti-interferon-gamma autoantibody (anti-IFN-γ autoAb) is
		an emerging adult-onset immunodeficiency syndrome predominantly found in
		Southeast Asians. It is associated with severe or disseminated infections caused
		by non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) and other opportunistic pathogens. We
		describe 3 patients with anti-IFN-γ autoAb who developed reactive and infective
		"dermatoses, and thoroughly review the existing literature on dermatoses"
		associated with the immunodeficiency syndrome. Case 1 developed Sweet's syndrome
		associated with Mycobacterium chelonae lymphadenitis and penicilliosis. Case 2
		suffered from multiple episodes of lobular panniculitis during recurrent
		"infections by NTM, Penicillium marneffei and Burkholderia pseudomallei. Both"
		cases responded to immunomodulating agents including corticosteroid and
		non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Case 3 had direct skin invasion by M.
		chelonae and responded to prolonged anti-mycobacterial therapy. A novel working
		algorithm is proposed for the diagnosis and treatment of these patients who may
		be encountered by the dermatologist and histopathologist in clinical practice.

AB	-	Infection with Penicillium marneffei has rarely been reported in human
		immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative infants. We aimed to determine the
		"epidemiological, clinical, pathological, and immunological characteristics of 7"
		"HIV-negative infants infected by P. marneffei, and to provide insights into its"
		diagnosis and treatment.We retrospectively reviewed the cases of 7 HIV-negative
		infants infected by P. marneffei who presented to the First Affiliated Hospital
		"of Guangxi Medical University between January 1, 2003 and December 1, 2014. The"
		"infants' median age was 23.43 months (SD = 8.34), and all lived in Guangxi"
		"Province in China, where P. marneffei is endemic. The median time from disease"
		"onset to diagnosis was 2.29 months (SD = 2.12). Of the cases studied, 5 (71.43%)"
		"had medical histories that included frequent pneumonia or bronchopneumonia,"
		"thrush, congenital megacolon, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, and"
		"hemophagocytic syndrome. The most common symptoms were fever, cough, and anemia,"
		"followed by lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and being underweight. Four"
		patients had slightly elevated white blood cell counts. The lymphocyte and CD4
		"T-cell counts were normal. The CD8 T-cell counts, serum immunoglobulin (Ig) G"
		"titer, and serum IgA titer were low in 5 patients, and the serum IgM titers were"
		high in 3 infants. Caseous necrosis was observed in 3 patients whose lymph nodes
		were affected. One case who received intravenous amphotericin B and 3 cases who
		"received intravenous voriconazole improved, and these patients were cured after"
		continual treatment with oral voriconazole for 6 or 12 months. The remaining
		patients died before they received antifungal treatment.P. marneffei causes
		"severe disease and disseminated infections, and it has high mortality rates in"
		HIV-negative infants in endemic areas. P. marneffei susceptibility may be
		"associated with immunodeficiencies or immune disorders. In endemic areas,"
		clinicians should aware of disseminated P. marneffei infections when infants
		"present with serious or recurrent infections, even if they are HIV negative. P."
		marneffei is highly susceptible to amphotericin B and voriconazole. Timely
		diagnosis and treatment can improve patients' prognoses. Intravenous voriconazole
		could be recommended as the initial antifungal agent for HIV-negative infants
		"infected by P. marneffei, because of its low nephrotoxicity, high sensitivity,"
		and high efficacy levels.

		A unique case report.
PG	-	e9658
LID	-	10.1097/MD.0000000000009658 [doi]
LID	-	e9658
AB	-	RATIONALE: This report describes a rare case in Wenzhou city of Zhejiang province
		that a non-HIV infected male recovering from fungemia caused by Penicillium
		"marneffei (P. marneffei). Interestingly, it's very easy to misdiagnose with"
		"aspergillosis, a fungal disease prevalent in Wenzhou, during the whole procedure."
		PATIENT CONCERNS: An 80-year-old Chinese male subject with pre-existing chronic
		obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) presented with symptoms of chest tightness
		and high fever for a month. DIAGNOSES: Fungal culture from the blood isolated P
		"marneffei. Naturally, the patient was diagnosed with P marneffei fungemia."
		"However, he was proven serologically to be negative for human immunodeficiency"
		virus (HIV). INTERVENTIONS: The patient was treated with voriconazole at 200mg/dL
		every 12 hours via intravenous administration. OUTCOMES: The fever returned to
		normal and chest tightness disappeared gradually after a week of voriconazole
		treatment. LESSONS: A high level of clinical suspicion and awareness is necessary
		"for early diagnosis of P marneffei fungemia, especially in elder patients with"
		underlying diseases.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Penicillium marneffei, an endemic fungus in Southeast Asia and"
		"southern China, is the cause of opportunistic infection in HIV-infected patients"
		"who may present with symptoms and signs of the lungs, and abnormal chest"
		"radiographs. However, only a few cases of pulmonary infection from this organism"
		have been reported. OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical manifestations of patients
		with Penicillium marneffei pneumonia diagnosed by sputum or bronchoalveolar
		lavage (BAL) fluid culture MATERIAL AND METHOD: Retrospective descriptive study
		of patients who were diagnosed with Penicillium marneffei pneumonia at Maharaj
		Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital from September 1999 to July 2004. RESULTS: Twelve
		"patients (eight males, four females) were included with mean age of 36.1 years."
		"Nine cases were HIV-infected. Their presenting symptoms included fever, cough,"
		"dyspnea and weight loss. Skin lesions, hepatomegaly and lymphadenopathy were"
		"extrapulmonary signs. Chest radiographs revealed diffuse reticulonodular, diffuse"
		"reticular, localized alveolar, localized reticular infiltration, and cavitary"
		lesion. The diagnosis was made by cultures from the sputum in five cases and BAL
		"fluid in the others. Co-infections with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella"
		"pneumoniae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Cryptococcus neoformans, and"
		Strongyloides stercoralis were found. Most of them were treated by intravenous
		"amphotericin B followed by oral itraconazole, or oral itraconazole. CONCLUSION:"
		"Penicillium marneffei pneumonia has non-specific clinical manifestations, it"
		cannot be excluded from other infections and may have co-infections. Physicians
		should include this infection in their differential diagnosis especially in
		immunocompromised patients.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: The limited information available on mixed mycosis involving the lungs
		makes the understanding of mixed fungal diseases insufficient and affects
		prognosis. Our study aims to improve understanding by exploring experience in the
		successful management of mixed fungal infections. METHODS: Patients who had two
		types of mycosis involving the lung at the same disease course were
		"retrospectively enrolled. RESULTS: Between September 2011 and December 2019, 17"
		patients with proven mixed mycosis were enrolled. Four patients were
		"immunocompromised, with one case each of lung transplantation, corticosteroid"
		"treatment, STAT3 hyper-IgE syndrome, and anti-IFN-γ autoantibody-associated"
		"immunodeficiency syndrome. Among 13 patients who were not immunocompromised, 9"
		had type 2 diabetes mellitus. Eight cases were coinfection with Mucor and
		"Aspergillus, 4 cases were Cryptococcus and Aspergillus, 2 cases were Talaromyces"
		"marneffei and Cryptococcus, 2 cases were Talaromyces marneffei and Aspergillus,"
		and 1 case was Candida and Aspergillus. Seven patients were diagnosed with mixed
		"pulmonary mycosis at almost the same time. Among the remaining 10 patients, the"
		"initial treatment was ineffective in four cases, and six patients showed a"
		"partial response to the initial antifungal treatment, but the original fungal"
		lesions became re-enlarged. Three patients were admitted to the intensive care
		"unit during hospitalization, and one patient died. Another Mucor coinfection"
		patient died due to treatment refusal. CONCLUSION: Mixed mycosis involving the
		lungs is not uncommon in patients without apparent immune deficiency diseases.
		"During the management of mycosis, we recommend keeping mixed mycosis in mind for"
		"patients with a poor response to initial antifungal treatment, even in"
		"immunocompetent populations, and identifying the cause of illness through a"
		rigorous procedure.

		Diagnosis of T. Marneffei Infection in an HIV-Positive Patient: a Case Report.
LID	-	10.7754/Clin.Lab.2020.200601 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Rapid and accurate diagnosis of HIV-positive patients with
		Talaromyces marneffei (T. marneffei) infections remains challenging. A
		"60-year-old woman came to our inpatient department presenting with hematuria,"
		"abdominal pain, and diarrhea for one week. The patient had a past medical history"
		of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). The patient's stool was watery and
		"the color of soy sauce. The patient was without fever, cough, and skin lesions."
		METHODS: The blood routine was performed with a Mindray BC-6900 hematology
		analyzer. RESULTS: Blood routine showed leukocytosis with neutrophilia and
		basophils and the WBC/DIFF scattergram showed a cluster of neutrophils connected
		with a monocyte and lymphocyte cluster and an additional cluster of immature
		"granulocytes and heterotypic lymphocytes or primitive cells. Surprisingly, the"
		peripheral blood film evaluation revealed small round-to-ovoid yeast cells within
		the cytoplasm of neutrophils. A T. marneffei infection was suspected and
		anti-fungal therapy was initiated. The patient's diarrhea improved after
		treatment with amphotericin B for two days. A second blood routine showed a
		normal number of leukocytes and basophils and a diminished cluster of immature
		"granulocytes and heterotypic lymphocytes or primitive cells. After one week,"
		blood cultures had grown T. marneffei. CONCLUSIONS: The WBC/DIFF scattergram
		obtained from a Mindray BC-6900 analyzer provided significant hints to enhance
		diagnosis of T. marneffei when combined with results of a peripheral blood smear.

AB	-	"Talaromyces marneffei, previously known as Penicillium marneffei, is the most"
		important pathogenic thermally dimorphic fungus causing systemic mycosis in
		"Southeast Asia. Traditionally, T. marneffei infection in human was mainly"
		associated with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome caused by HIV infection. In
		"recent years, there has been an increasing number of T. marneffei infections"
		"reported in non-HIV-infected patients with other immunocompromised conditions,"
		"including autoantibodies against interferon-gamma, systemic lupus erythematosis,"
		"solid organ transplantation, Job's syndrome, hematological malignancies, and use"
		"of novel targeted therapies. In this article, we describe the first case of fatal"
		"T. marneffei infection in a patient with underlying autoimmune hepatitis,"
		presented as fever without localizing features. The diagnosis of talaromycosis
		was confirmed with the identification of the fungi isolated from the blood
		culture specimen by conventional methods and using matrix-assisted laser
		desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer. This case shows the
		"importance of a high index of suspicion, particularly for such a highly fatal but"
		potentially treatable fungal infection.

		Nationwide Population-Based Cohort Study in Taiwan.
PG	-	117-125
LID	-	10.1097/QAI.0000000000001216 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: HIV-associated vasculopathy and opportunistic infections (OIs) might
		"cause vascular atherosclerosis and aneurysmal arteriopathy, which could increase"
		"the risk of incident stroke. However, few longitudinal studies have investigated"
		the link between HIV and incident stroke. This cohort study evaluated the
		association of HIV and OIs with incident stroke. METHODS: We identified adults
		"with HIV infection in 2000-2012, using the Taiwan National Health Insurance"
		"Research Database. A control cohort without HIV infection, matched for age and"
		"sex, was selected for comparison. Stroke incidence until December 31, 2012 was"
		then ascertained for all patients. A time-dependent Cox regression model was used
		to determine the association between OIs and incident stroke among patients with
		"HIV. RESULTS: Among a total of 106,875 patients (21,375 patients with HIV and"
		"85,500 matched controls), stroke occurred in 927 patients (0.87%) during a mean"
		"follow-up period of 5.44 years, including 672 (0.63%) ischemic strokes and 255"
		"(0.24%) hemorrhagic strokes. After adjusting for other covariates, HIV infection"
		was an independent risk factor for incident all-cause stroke [adjusted hazard
		ratio (AHR) 1.83; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.58 to 2.13]. When the type of
		"stroke was considered, HIV infection increased the risks of ischemic (AHR 1.33;"
		95% CI: 1.09 to 1.63) and hemorrhagic stroke (AHR 2.01; 95% CI: 1.51 to 2.69).
		The risk of incident stroke was significantly higher in patients with HIV with
		"cryptococcal meningitis (AHR 4.40; 95% CI: 1.38 to 14.02), cytomegalovirus"
		"disease (AHR 2.79; 95% CI: 1.37 to 5.67), and Penicillium marneffei infection"
		(AHR 2.90; 95% CI: 1.16 to 7.28). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with HIV had an increased
		"risk of stroke, particularly those with cryptococcal meningitis, cytomegalovirus,"
		or P. marneffei infection.

TI	-	Nontuberculous mycobacterial infections in King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital.
PG	-	2035-46
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) can cause infections in both human
		immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected and HIV-noninfected patients. The incidence
		of NTM infections has been increasing since the acquired immunodeficiency
		"syndrome (AIDS) epidemics. However, the epidemiologic and clinical data of NTM"
		"infections in Thailand are limited. OBJECTIVE: Determine the epidemiology,"
		"clinical manifestations, treatment, and outcome of NTM infections in King"
		Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital from January 2000 to December 2003. MATERIAL AND
		"METHOD: One hundred and fourteen patients had positive NTM cultures; however,"
		complete medical records were available in only 103 (90.3%) patients. RESULTS:
		"There were 71 (68.9%) HIV-infected patients, and 38 (87%) of them had the CD4"
		"counts of < 200 cells/microL (range 4-360). Among HIV-infected patients, the most"
		"common previous opportunistic infections included tuberculosis (36.6%),"
		"Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (25.3%), cryptococcal meningitis (15.5%),"
		"penicilliosis (5.6%), and cytomegalovirus infection (5.6%). Most patients"
		"presented with prolonged fever (67%), chronic cough (54.4%), lymphadenopathy"
		"(52.4%), weight loss (50.5%), or chronic diarrhea (31%). The clinical"
		manifestations included disseminated (17.4%) and localized (82.6%) infections.
		"The localized infection included pulmonary infection (82.3%), followed by"
		"gastrointestinal infection (34.1%), skin infection (12.9%), lymphadenitis (8.2%),"
		"genitourinary tract infection (2.4%), central nervous system infection (2.4%),"
		and keratitis (1.2%). Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) was the predominant
		"species (48.5%), followed by M. kansasii (19.4%), and rapidly growing"
		mycobacteria (16.4%). Diffuse reticular infiltration was most commonly observed
		on chest radiography (53.4%). Abnormal laboratory findings included anemia
		"(48.5%), hyponatremia (42.7%), and elevated alkaline phosphatase (39.8%). The"
		overall mortality rate was 34.8% (45.9% and 11.1% in HIV- and HIV-noninfected
		patients). CONCLUSION: A diagnosis of NTM infection requires a high index of
		suspicion in patients especially with AIDS or immunocompromised status who
		"present with prolonged fever, with or without organ-specific symptoms and signs."
		"Therefore, clinical specimens must be sent for mycobacterial cultures for a"
		"definite diagnosis, a determination of the species of NTM, and an appropriate"
		"management. In addition to four standard antituberculous drugs, clarithromycin"
		should be added for the treatment of MAC in patients with AIDS who presented with
		disseminated opportunistic infections before obtaining the microbiologic results.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Tropical infectious diseases like dengue, scrub typhus, murine"
		"typhus, leptospirosis, and enteric fever continue to contribute substantially to"
		the febrile disease burden throughout Southeast Asia while malaria is declining.
		"Recently, there has been increasing focus on biomarkers (i.e. C-reactive protein"
		(CRP) and procalcitonin) in delineating bacterial from viral infections.
		METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A prospective observational study was performed
		to investigate the causes of acute undifferentiated fever (AUF) in adults
		"admitted to Chiangrai Prachanukroh hospital, northern Thailand, which included an"
		"evaluation of CRP and procalcitonin as diagnostic tools. In total, 200 patients"
		with AUF were recruited. Scrub typhus was the leading bacterial cause of AUF
		"(45/200, 22.5%) followed by leptospirosis (15/200, 7.5%) and murine typhus"
		"(7/200, 3.5%), while dengue was the leading viral cause (23/200, 11.5%)."
		Bloodstream infections contributed to 7/200 (3.5%) of the study cohort. There
		"were 9 deaths during this study (4.5%): 3 cases of scrub typhus, 2 with"
		"septicaemia (Talaromyces marneffei and Haemophilus influenzae), and 4 of unknown"
		"aetiologies. Rickettsioses, leptospirosis and culture-attributed bacterial"
		"infections, received a combination of 3rd generation cephalosporin plus a"
		"rickettsia-active drug in 53%, 73% and 67% of cases, respectively. Low CRP and"
		white blood count were significant predictors of a viral infection (mainly
		dengue) while the presence of an eschar and elevated aspartate aminotransferase
		and alkaline phosphatase were important predictors of scrub typhus.
		INTERPRETATION: Scrub typhus and dengue are the leading causes of AUF in
		"Chiangrai, Thailand. Eschar, white blood count and CRP were beneficial in"
		differentiating between bacterial and viral infections in this study. CRP
		outperformed procalcitonin although cut-offs for positivity require further
		"assessment. The study provides evidence that accurate, pathogen-specific rapid"
		diagnostic tests coupled with biomarker point-of-care tests such as CRP can
		inform the correct use of antibiotics and improve antimicrobial stewardship in
		this setting.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Although many studies have been carried out on pulmonary diseases in
		"HIV-infected patients, studies specifically investigating the aetiologies of"
		cavitary lung lesions are rare. METHODS: HIV-infected patients enrolled in a
		cohort study who presented with cavitary lung lesions by radiography were
		identified between June 1994 and March 2008. Medical records and radiological and
		microbiological data for these patients were retrospectively reviewed using a
		"standardized case collection form. RESULTS: During the 14-year study period, 73"
		episodes of cavitary lung lesions were diagnosed in 66 of 1790 (3.7%)
		"HIV-infected patients. At the diagnosis of cavitary lung lesions, the median CD4"
		count was 25 cells/microL (range 1-575 cells/microL). Eighty-one pathogens were
		"considered causative, with fungi being the most common aetiology (42.0%),"
		"followed by bacteria (29.6%) and mycobacteria (25.9%). Of the fungal pneumonias,"
		"19 (55.9%) were caused by Penicillium marneffei, 11 (32.4%) by Cryptococcus"
		"neoformans, two (5.9%) by Pneumocystis jirovecii, and two (5.9%) by Aspergillus"
		"species. During the study period, 11 of 205 patients (5.4%) who were diagnosed as"
		"having tuberculosis presented with cavitary lung lesions, compared with 19 of 36"
		patients (52.8%) with penicilliosis and 11 of 64 patients (17.2%) with
		cryptococcosis (P<0.0001). The median CD4 count of patients with cavitary lung
		lesions resulting from tuberculosis (115 cells/microL) was significantly higher
		than that of patients with cavitary lung lesions resulting from penicilliosis (4
		cells/microL) and cryptococcosis (29.5 cells/microL). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings
		suggest that invasive infections attributable to endemic fungi were the leading
		"cause of cavitary lung lesions among patients in the late stage of HIV infection,"
		and were more common than infections attributable to bacteria and mycobacteria.

AB	-	Certain Penicillium species are emerging opportunistic pathogens. While these can
		"be common causes of airborne contamination of clinical cultures, an increasing"
		number of reports describe clinically significant disease in the
		"immunocompromised population, particularly in patients with hematologic"
		"malignancy. The typical site of infection is respiratory, but disseminated"
		"infection is also reported with some frequency. Therefore, culture growth of"
		Penicillium in respiratory and other clinical samples from immunocompromised
		patients requires thorough investigation with clinical correlation. Here we
		report a case of angioinvasive Penicillium cluniae infection of the right shin in
		a patient with acute myeloid leukemia and review reported cases of invasive
		Penicillium infection (excluding Talaromyces marneffei) in hematologic malignancy
		patients to characterize the emerging pathogen in this vulnerable population.

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence of WHO clinical stage 3 and 4 conditions
		during early anti-retroviral therapy (ART) in resource limited settings (RLS).
		DESIGN/SETTING: A descriptive analysis of routine program data collected
		prospectively from 25 Médecins Sans Frontières supported HIV treatment programs
		"in eight countries between 2002 and 2010. SUBJECTS/PARTICIPANTS: 35,349 study"
		participants with median follow-up on ART of 1.33 years (IQR 0.51-2.41). OUTCOME
		MEASURES: Incidence in 100 person-years of WHO stage 3 or 4 conditions during 5
		periods after ART initiation. Diagnoses of conditions were made according to WHO
		criteria and relied upon clinical assessments supported by basic laboratory
		investigations. RESULTS: The incidence of any WHO clinical stage 3 or 4 condition
		over 3 years was 40.02 per 100 person-years (31.77 for stage 3 and 8.25 for stage
		4). The incidence of stage 3 and 4 conditions fell by over 97% between months 0-3
		and months 25-36 (77.81 to 2.40 for stage 3 and 28.70 to 0.64 for stage 4).
		During months 0-3 pulmonary tuberculosis was the most common condition diagnosed
		in adults (incidence 22.24 per 100 person-years) and children aged 5-14 years
		(25.76) and oral candidiasis was the most common in children <5 years (25.79).
		Overall incidences were higher in Africa compared with Asia (43.98 versus 12.97
		"for stage 3 and 8.98 versus 7.05 for stage 4 conditions, p<0.001). Pulmonary"
		"tuberculosis, weight loss, oral and oesophageal candidiasis, chronic diarrhoea,"
		HIV wasting syndrome and severe bacterial infections were more common in Africa.
		"Extra-pulmonary tuberculosis, non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection,"
		"cryptococcosis, penicilliosis and toxoplasmosis were more common in Asia."
		CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of WHO stage 3 and 4 conditions during the early
		"period after ART initiation in RLS is high, but greatly reduces over time. This"
		is likely due to both the benefits of ART and deaths of the sickest patients
		occurring shortly after ART initiation. Access to appropriate disease prevention
		"tools prior to ART, and early initiation of ART, are important for their"
		prevention.

AB	-	Talaromyces marneffei infection is an endemic opportunistic infection for
		"immunodepression patients, especially HIV-positive patients. Our case describes"
		"an unendemic and HIV-negative patient who presented with fever, subcutaneous"
		"mass, osteolytic destruction of the skull and subcutaneous abscess penetrating"
		the diseased skull. The growth of Talaromyces marneffei was identified by the
		"culture of the frontal pus, sputum, blood and bone marrow. Due to severe nausea"
		"and vomiting during the use of amphotericin B, voriconazole was finally selected"
		"for treatment. Two weeks after intravenous infusion of voriconazole injection,"
		the patient was given oral voriconazole tablets for 5 months. After the initial
		"intravenous treatment of voriconazole, the patient developed increased dyspnea"
		"and required ventilator support with endotracheal intubation, and"
		methylprednisolone was given intravenously for 5 days. All lesions absorbed and
		no obvious discomfort was found during the follow-up at the third month after
		"discharge. At present, the patient has been followed up for more than 3 years"
		without recurrence. The case aims to raise doctors' awareness of this rare
		disease in non-endemic areas and HIV-negative patients.

TI	-	Effects of cotrimoxazole prophylaxis on Talaromyces marneffei infection in
		HIV/AIDS patients receiving antiretroviral therapy: a retrospective cohort study.
PG	-	367-376
LID	-	10.1080/22221751.2019.1588078 [doi]
AB	-	The dimorphic fungus Talaromyces marneffei (TM) is a common cause of
		HIV-associated opportunistic infections in Southeast Asia. Cotrimoxazole (CTX)
		inhibits folic acid synthesis which is important for the survival of many
		"bacteria, protozoa, and fungi and has been used to prevent several opportunistic"
		infections among HIV/AIDS patients. We question whether CTX is effective in
		"preventing TM infection. To investigate this question, we conducted an 11-year"
		(2005-2016) retrospective observational cohort study of all patients on the
		"Chinese national antiretroviral therapy (ART) programme in Guangxi, a province"
		with high HIV and TM burden in China. Survival analysis was conducted to
		"investigate TM cumulative incidence, and Cox regression and propensity score"
		matching (PSM) were used to evaluate the effect of CTX on TM incidence. Of the
		"3359 eligible individuals contributing 10,504.66 person-years of follow-up,"
		"81.81% received CTX within 6 months after ART initiation, and 4.73% developed TM"
		"infection, contributing 15.14/1,000 person-year TM incidence rate. CTX patients"
		had a significantly lower incidence of TM infection than non-CTX patients (4.11%
		"vs. 7.53%; adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 0.50, 95% CI 0.35-0.73). CTX reduced TM"
		"incidence in all CD4(+) cell subgroups (<50 cells/μL, 50-99 cells/μL,"
		"100-199 cells/μL), with the highest reduction observed in patients with a"
		baseline CD4(+) cell count <50 cells/μL in both Cox regression and the PSM
		"analyses. In conclusion, in addition to preventing other HIV-associated"
		"opportunistic infections, CTX prophylaxis has the potential to prevent TM"
		infection in HIV/AIDS patients receiving ART.

AB	-	A 25-year-old man with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection presented
		with fever that had lasted 1 month. The CD4+ T lymphocyte count was 7 cells/μL
		"and computed tomography showed several small lung nodules, splenomegaly, and"
		multiple lymphadenopathy. Talaromyces marneffei was isolated in the initial blood
		cultures. As the fever persisted despite clearance of fungemia and 10 days of
		"liposomal amphotericin B treatment, cervical lymph node fine-needle aspiration"
		was performed. Mycobacterium intracellulare was isolated from sputum and neck
		node aspiration cultures. The patient was successfully treated with liposomal
		"amphotericin B, clarithromycin, and ethambutol in addition to antiretroviral"
		therapy. This case suggests that we should consider coinfection of opportunistic
		pathogens in febrile immunosuppressed patients if the patient does not respond
		properly to the initial treatment.

AB	-	Disseminated infection with the fungus Penicillium marneffei is one of the most
		common opportunistic infections in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease in
		"northern Thailand. We report the clinical, laboratory and therapeutic features of"
		21 human immunodeficiency virus-infected children with disseminated P. marneffei
		who were prospectively followed. Significant clinical and laboratory features
		"included generalized lymphadenopathy (90%), hepatomegaly (90%), body temperature"
		"> 38.5 degrees C (81%), papular skin lesions with central umbilication (67%),"
		"splenomegaly (67%), failure to thrive (52%), severe anemia (hemoglobin < 60"
		g/liter) (43%) and thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 0.5 x 10(11)/liter) (21%).
		The response rate in patients who were treated with appropriate antifungal
		"therapy (amphotericin B, fluconazole or ketoconazole) was 82%. No relapse was"
		"observed in patients given ketoconazole prophylactically. Skin lesions, usually"
		"papules with central necrotic umbilication, provide the most significant clue to"
		the diagnosis. Early diagnosis based on finding P. marneffei in the skin smear or
		lymph node provides the basis for prompt administration of antifungal therapy and
		improved outcome.

OAB	-	This report describes the epidemiology of Penicillium marneffei infections among
		"HIV infected children who were seen at Chiang Mai University Hospital, Thailand,"
		between April 1989 and January 1995. HIV infections among children 18 months old
		and older were determined by both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and particle
		agglutination tests. Confirmation of HIV infection was made among younger
		children by signs and symptoms and repeated reactive serum tests. Diagnosis of P.
		marneffei infection was determined by isolation of the organism from clinical
		blood or tissue specimens. Antifungal agents were administered and improvement
		was recorded. There were 23 cases of P. marneffei among the 362 children
		diagnosed with HIV infection during the study period. One case was a non-HIV
		infected girl and another was a thalassemic patient who had received an HIV
		infected blood transfusion. The remaining 21 children acquired the infection
		perinatally. All mothers of the 21 children had acquired the HIV infection as
		prostitutes or from husbands who used prostitutes. All 21 children had clinical
		cases of HIV infection at the onset of the P. marneffei infection. The median
		time of presentation was 32 months. Fever was a primary symptom. 67% had skin
		lesions and most lesions were on the face and extremities. Other laboratory
		findings are reported. 9 of the 21 children had other HIV-related opportunistic
		infections diagnosed at the same time as the diagnosis of P. marneffei. There
		"were 4 cases of Salmonella bacteremia, 2 cases of cryptosporidiosis, 1 case of"
		"Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremia, 1 case of Pneumocystis carinii and"
		"cytomegalovirus pneumonia, and 1 case of nontyphoid Salmonella bacteremia and"
		herpes zoster. All 7 culture-proved patients who did not receive antifungal
		therapy died. 9 culture-proved and 3 other cases responded to antifungal
		treatment. Findings suggest that P. marneffei infection should be included as
		another AIDS-defining illness. The case fatality rate of patients with P.
		"marneffei infection was very high, mostly due to late diagnosis."

AB	-	Talaromycosis typically occurs as an opportunistic infection among
		immunocompromised individuals. Infection caused by species other than T.
		"marneffei is uncommon. While most reported cases describe infection in the lungs,"
		we report an extremely rare intracranial Talaromyces species infection. This
		61-year-old with end-stage renal disease who was unwell for the previous two
		"months, presented with fever and worsening confusion lasting for three days."
		Lumbar puncture was suggestive of meningitis. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture
		was later confirmed to be Penicillium chrysogenum. The patient was co-infected
		with Group B Streptococcus sepsis. He improved with amphotericin B and
		"ceftriaxone and was discharged with oral itraconazole for four weeks. However, he"
		died of unknown causes two weeks later at home. Talaromyces species infection in
		the central nervous system is uncommon. This case highlighted a rare but
		"life-threatening fungal meningitis. Among the four reported cases worldwide, none"
		of the patients survived.

AB	-	Objective: To improve the awareness of hyper-IgE syndrome (HIES) characterized by
		disseminated infection. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed a patient with HIES
		characterized by Talaromyces marneffei and Staphylococcus aureus mixed
		disseminated infection in Shenzhen People's Hospital. The clinical
		"manifestations, results of laboratory tests/genetic examinations, therapeutic"
		"strategies and prognosis were summarized. The keywords ""hyper-lgE syndrome"" were"
		used to search and review the literature in Wanfang databases and Pubmed
		"database. Results: In February 2021, an 18-year-old male patient was admitted to"
		our hospital with backache for over 3 weeks and fever for 4 days. Physical
		"examination revealed deciduous teeth in the oral cavity, bilateral renal pain on"
		"percussion, and interphalangeal joint hyperextension. Laboratory studies"
		demonstrated increased blood eosinophils and serum level of total IgE. Bacterial
		"culture from bronchoscopic secretions, bronchial mucosa, and necrotic tissue from"
		the left upper arm showed Talaromyces marneffei. Bacterial culture from alveolar
		"lavage fluid, left upper arm necrotic tissue, puncture fluid of right"
		retroauricular abscess and renal drainage fluid suggested methicillin-sensitive
		Staphylococcus aureus. The chest and abdominal CT revealed diffuse patchy and
		"nodular lesions in bilateral lungs, cavitary lesions in the upper lobe of the"
		"left lung, multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum, and infectious"
		"lesions within both kidneys and perirenal space. Furthermore, the patients was"
		"identified with STAT3 mutations by whole exome sequencing, which confirmed the"
		"diagnosis of HIES. Nineteen literature articles were retrieved, involving 27"
		adult patients with a median age of diagnosis of 23 years. The most common
		"manifestations included: skin infection (16/27), eczema (15/27), elevated IgE"
		"(26/27) and eosinophils (17/27), as well as positive STAT3 mutation (11/27)."
		Conclusion: Clinicians should be alert to the possibility of hyper-IgE syndrome
		in patients with severe or disseminated intracellular bacterial infections.

AB	-	Patients with anti-interferon (IFN)-γ autoantibodies have weakened immune
		defenses against intracellular pathogens. Because of its low incidence and
		"non-specific symptoms, diagnosis of anti-IFN-γ autoantibody syndrome is difficult"
		"to establish during the early stages of infection. Here, we report a patient with"
		high titers of serum anti-IFN-γ autoantibodies suffering from opportunistic
		infections. The patient presented with intermittent fever for 2 weeks. During his
		"first hospitalization, he was diagnosed with Talaromyces marneffei pulmonary"
		"infection and successfully treated with antifungal therapy. However, multiple"
		cervical lymph nodes subsequently became progressively enlarged. Mycobacterium
		abscessus infection was confirmed by positive cervical lymph node tissue
		cultures. High-titer serum anti-IFN-γ antibodies were also detected. Following
		"anti-M. abscessus therapy, both his symptoms and lymph node lymphadenitis"
		gradually improved. Anti-IFN-γ autoantibody syndrome should be considered in
		adult patients with severe opportunistic coinfections in the absence of other
		known risk factors.

AB	-	Penicillosis caused by Penicillium marneffei is endemic in Asia and is a highly
		"fatal disease in HIV-AIDS patients. Reports, however; in other immunocompromized"
		diseases are scanty. This report describes the cytological diagnosis of P.
		marneffei infection from the sputum of a pediatric patient with
		"hypogammaglobulinemia with hyper IgM and severe pneumonia. In this case, rapid,"
		differential identification of the characteristic septated structure of P.
		"marneffei in the macrophages, bronchial epithelium and also extracellularly"
		"allowed prompt and proper treatment. In addition, morphometry of P. marneffei"
		obtained from the clinical specimen was reported. This report demonstrated the
		"fungus was not only in the phagocytes, a phenomenon that is well recognized, but"
		"also in epithelial cells. Moreover, it also highlights the need for awareness of"
		"penicillosis in non-AIDS immunocompromized patients living in, or persons"
		"traveling to, P. marneffei-endemic areas."

		bronchial washing cytology and biopsy.
PG	-	45-48
LID	-	10.4103/0970-9371.197618 [doi]
AB	-	Penicilliosis is a disseminated and progressive infection that is mainly found in
		"immunocompromised individuals, especially those with human immunodeficiency virus"
		(HIV) infection. Because of the high mortality of patients with disseminated
		"Penicillium marneffei infection, rapid diagnosis and early treatment are"
		required. Diagnosis is traditionally made by biopsy and/or culture of blood or
		"any involved organ. Cytology offers several advantages over biopsy, including"
		more rapid diagnosis and greater resolution of cytomorphologic details of
		"organisms, allowing rapid initiation of treatment. Here, we describe a case of"
		penicilliosis in an HIV-positive patient with emphasis on the morphological
		"characteristics of the organism in cytologic specimens, as well as a comparison"
		of bronchial washing and biopsy findings.

LID	-	e0215
AB	-	Hyperimmunoglobulin E syndromes (HIES) are rare primary immunodeficiency diseases
		"characterized by markedly elevated serum immunoglobulin (Ig) E, recurrent"
		"pneumonia, and chronic eczema. To date, information about pediatric HIES is"
		limited. We aimed to evaluate the spectrum of clinical and immunological features
		in pediatric patients with HIES in China.We retrospectively reviewed the cases of
		4 pediatric patients with HIES followed at the Guangzhou Women and Children's
		Medical Center from May 2013 to September 2017. We analyzed clinical
		"presentation, laboratory data, immunological evaluations, imagenological"
		"characteristics, treatment, response to therapy, genetic and bronchoalveolar"
		"lavage fluid (BALF) findings, and prognosis.The common clinical features of the"
		patients were recurrent respiratory and mucocutaneous infections and eczematoid
		"skin lesions. In 3 of 4 patients, BALF and transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB)"
		demonstrated fungal pneumonia with organisms including invasive Aspergillus and
		"Penicillium marneffei. Elevated serum IgG and IgM were detected in 3 and 2 cases,"
		"respectively, while CD4+ T and CD19+ B cells were slightly reduced in only 1"
		"patient. Nitroblue tetrazolium tests (NBTs) were normal in all patients, and"
		reduced natural killer cell counts were identified in 3 patients. A novel
		"missense mutation in exon 17 (c.1593A>T, p.K531N) was identified in the signal"
		transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) gene that has not been
		reported previously. One patient had 3 homozygous nonsynonymous variations of the
		"complement receptor 2 (CR2) gene distributed in exons 10 (c.1916G>A, p.S639N) and"
		"11 (c.1987T>C, p.S663P and c.2012G>A, p.R671H) with high frequency.This case"
		series suggests that fungi are important respiratory pathogens in children with
		HIES and should be considered in cases of pneumonia in this population. The NIH
		"scoring system does not allow diagnostic certainty, particularly in infants,"
		because some of the common manifestations of HIES may not develop until the
		patient matures. Pulmonary complications must be identified in the early stage of
		"the disease to treat them effectively. In addition, we report a mutation in STAT3"
		that has not been identified previously.

		HIV-infected patient rapidly verified by metagenomic next-generation sequencing:
		a case report.
PG	-	376
LID	-	10.1186/s12879-021-06063-1 [doi]
LID	-	376
AB	-	BACKGROUND: The manifestation of Talaromyces marneffei infection in some
		HIV-infected patients may be atypical. Cases with gastrointestinal involvement
		have rarely been reported. It is hard to make a diagnosis when patients are
		lacking the characteristic rash and positive blood culture. CASE PRESENTATION:
		"Here, we described a patient living with HIV who complained of fever and"
		"abdominal pain, and was rapidly diagnosed with Talaromyces marneffei infection by"
		metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) using formalin-fixation and
		paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples of omentum majus tissue. We also reviewed
		reported related cases. CONCLUSIONS: Talaromyces marneffei is an unusual cause of
		clinical presentations involving obvious abdominal pain and lower
		"gastrointestinal bleeding, but can be included in the differential diagnosis. As"
		"an important diagnostic tool, the significance of mNGS using FFPE samples of"
		lesions provides a more targeted diagnosis.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: The affecting factors of mucocutaneous manifestations in human
		immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients
		remain unclear in China. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted among
		"HIV/AIDS patients in Yunnan, China. The demographic data, mucocutaneous"
		"manifestations, CD4 cell counts, and antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens were"
		collected. The effects of CD4 cell count and ART on the spectrum of mucocutaneous
		"manifestations were evaluated. RESULTS: Among 508 HIV/AIDS patients, 86.0% of"
		cases showed mucocutaneous manifestations. The average CD4 cell count (176
		cells/μl) of the patients with manifestations was significantly lower than those
		without manifestations (328 cells/μl) (P < 0.001). Diseases such as herpes
		"zoster, oral candidiasis, condyloma acuminatum, genital herpes, oral leukoplakia,"
		"talaromycosis, cryptococcosis, and HIV-PPE (pruritic papular eruption) were"
		represented quite frequently in patients with CD4 cell count <200 cells/μl
		"(P < 0.05), but eczema was suffered by those with CD4 cell count ≥200 cells/μl"
		"(P < 0.05). ART could decline the incidence of herpes zoster, oral candidiasis,"
		"condyloma acuminatum, genital herpes, oral leukoplakia, talaromycosis, and"
		cryptococcosis (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Mucocutaneous manifestations are closely
		related to the CD4 cell count and can be used as early predictors of HIV/AIDS and
		immune status in clinic. ART could reduce the incidence of certain mucocutaneous
		manifestations.

AB	-	A patient with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia who had previously been treated
		with cladribine presented with septic arthritis caused by Escherichia coli. The
		"patient's condition subsequently deteriorated, and he succumbed to pneumonia and"
		mixed fungaemia due to Candida tropicalis and Penicillium marneffei. Profound
		lymphopenia coexisted with fungaemia. This is the first reported case of mixed
		Penicillium marneffei and Candida fungaemia and penicilliosis marneffei in a
		patient with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia. Penicilliosis marneffei should be
		considered as a potential complication in patients with markedly impaired
		cell-mediated immunity who have travelled to or resided in endemic areas.
		Patients who have undergone therapy with purine nucleoside analogues such as
		fludarabine and cladribine are also at risk.

		immune-compromised patients and it is endemic in Southeast Asia. A 39-yr-old
		"HIV-infected male, living in Laos, presented with fever, cough, and facial"
		"vesiculopapular lesions, which had been apparent for two weeks. CT scans showed"
		bilateral micronodules on both lungs; Pneumocystis jirovecii was identified by
		bronchoscopic biopsy. Despite trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and anti-tuberculosis
		"medications, the lung lesions progressed and the facial lesions revealed central"

		with the culture showing P. marneffei hyphae and spores. The P. marneffei was
		identified by rRNA PCR. A review of the bronchoscopic biopsy indicated
		penicilliosis. The patient completely recovered after being prescribed
		amphotericin-B and receiving antiretroviral therapy. This is the first case of
		penicilliosis in a Korean HIV-infected patient. It is necessary to consider P.
		"marneffei when immunocompromised patients, with a history of visits to endemic"

PG	-	674-6
AB	-	"Penicillium marneffei (PM), the only dimorphic species of the genus penicillium"
		is the etiological agent of penicilliosis marneffei. This opportunistic fungal
		infection occurs among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected and other
		"immunocompromised patient in several regions of South-east Asia, where the"
		infection is considered as an indicator disease of AIDS. A case of penicilliosis
		marneffei is reported in a patient whose HIV status was unknown and later turned
		to be in the late stage of AIDS. This demonstrates that it is indeed an indicator
		"disease of AIDS. In India, penicilliosis has been reported among the inhabitants"
		of Manipur state where the prevalence of HIV infection / AIDS is very high. The
		causative agent was first isolated from a captive bamboo rat. Investigation of
		the prevalence of the organism among bamboo rats of different countries of South
		East Asia revealed four species of bamboo rats to be harboring the organism.
		"These four species of bamboo rats are Rhizomys sinensis, R. pruinosus, R."
		"sumatrensis and Cannomys badius. In Manipur, Penicillium marneffei has been"
		isolated from Cannomys badius. Any patient presenting with penicilliosis
		marneffei should be subjected to HIV counselling and testing if the HIV status is
		not known and further study regarding the ecology and epidemiology of the fungus
		is needed.

		HIV-infected patients in Thailand.
PG	-	334-8
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Disseminated fungal infections are common presenting opportunistic
		infections among AIDS patients in developing countries. Primary prophylaxis with
		itraconazole has been shown to be effective in northern Thailand. This study
		aimed to compare the efficacy of fluconazole vs itraconazole as primary
		prophylaxis for fungal infections in HIV-infected patients. METHODS: A
		retrospective cohort study was conducted among HIV-infected patients who received
		primary prophylaxis with fluconazole 400 mg once weekly or itraconazole 200 mg
		once daily at Chiang Mai University Hospital. We compared the incidence of
		systemic fungal infections and the probability of disease-free survival between
		"groups. RESULTS: From January 2000 to June 2010, 308 HIV-infected patients who"
		received primary fungal prophylaxis were enrolled; 148 were male (48.1%) and the
		mean age was 38.2 ± 8.0 years. 276 patients received fluconazole and 32 received
		"itraconazole. Baseline CD4+ cell count was 35 (IQR 15, 70) and 50 (IQR 21,75)"
		"cells/mm(3) in fluconazole and itraconazole groups, respectively (p=0.159). The"
		"median follow-up time was 12 months (IQR 7, 19) in fluconazole group and 15.5"
		"months (IQR 9, 21.5) in itraconazole group. Seven patients (2.5%) who received"
		fluconazole and 2 patients (6.3%) who received itraconazole developed systemic
		"fungal infections, giving the incidence of 17.0 and 34.8/10000 person-months,"
		respectively (p=0.261). The probability of developing any systemic fungal
		infections or death did not differ between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Although P.
		"marneffei has a reduced susceptibility in in vitro to fluconazole, our study has"
		demonstrated that once-weekly fluconazole is at least as effective as once-daily
		itraconazole as primary prophylaxis for systemic fungal infections in AIDS
		patients in northern Thailand.

AB	-	The incidence of fungal keratitis is less common than bacterial and viral
		"keratitis. However, it remains a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Delayed"
		clinical diagnosis is common mainly because of lack of suspicion. Further slow
		growth of fungus increases the time for confirmed laboratory diagnosis. After
		"accurate diagnosis, patient's management remains inadequate due to lack of"
		availability of antifungal agents and its poor corneal penetration. Multitude of
		genera of molds and yeast have been identified in fungal keratitis. Due to their
		"ubiquitous nature and easy isolation from the environment, their role in true"
		"pathogenesis is difficult to ascertain. Worldwide, incidence of fungal keratitis"
		"is rising at present. The predisposing factors comprises trauma, use of contact"
		lenses and topical steroids. Filamentous fungi and dematiaceous fungi are the
		frequently encountered etiological agents of fungal keratitis. Dimorphic fungi
		are reported less frequently. Fungal keratitis tends to occur more frequently in
		young males and usually in winter and monsoon. Penicillium genera includes
		several species. By far Penicillium marneffei (P. marneffei) infection is most
		"common, mainly associated with AIDS. A number of infections caused by species"
		other than P. marneffei have been reported as well. Here we report a case of
		"Penicillium keratitis in a young, HIV negative male farmer."

AB	-	Penicillium marneffei is a thermally dimorphic pathogenic fungus that causes
		systemic infection similar to disseminated cryptococcosis. P. marneffei is
		"endemic in Southeast Asia, usually infecting HIV-infected individuals; infection"
		"of HIV-negative individuals is extremely rare. Here, we describe a disseminated"
		P. marneffei infection within an osteolytic lesion in an HIV-negative patient. A
		"40-year-old Chinese woman presented with intermittent fever, generalized"
		"lymphadenopathy, and a skin rash. Following a sternum biopsy, the patient was"
		diagnosed with P. marneffei infection. An emission computed tomography bone scan
		revealed the presence of increased radioactivity in the left clavicle and
		"sternum, indicative of an osteolytic lesion. In addition to reporting this very"
		"rare case, we also present a brief review of the literature, highlighting the"
		differences in clinical manifestations between HIV-positive and HIV-negative
		patients infected with P. marneffei as it applies to our case.

PG	-	18-22
AB	-	AIM: to describe the spectrum of HIV-related skin disorders as well as their
		prevalence and relation to CD4-cell counts among HIV-seropositive patients from
		"West Java, Indonesia. METHODS: all HIV-positive patients presenting in 2008 at"
		"the HIV-clinic, Hasan Sadikin Hospital, were included in a cross-sectional study."
		Patients who had a skin complaint were examined by a dermatologist. Skin diseases
		"were classified based on ICD 10. RESULTS: among 843 patients, 121 (14.4%) had a"
		"skin complaint, consisting of skin manifestations (73.3%), drug eruptions"
		"(30.5%), and sexually transmitted infections (15.7%), some of them had more than"
		"one diseases. The most common skin manifestations were drug eruptions, pruritic"
		"papular eruptions, seborrhoeic dermatitis, herpes zoster, dermatophytosis, and"
		"bacterial skin infections. Among patients who started nevirapine, 6.4% (95%CI:"
		"3.9% - 8.9%) developed any kind of drug eruption, and 1.4% (95%CI 0.2%-2.6%)"
		"developed a severe drug eruption. No cases of Kaposi sarcoma, penicilliosis,"
		"eosinophilic folliculitis were seen, however one case of histoplasmosis was"
		diagnosed. CONCLUSION: this is the first report describing the prevalence and
		characteristic of skin manifestation in HIV-positive in Indonesia. Indonesian
		physicians should be alert about HIV when patient presents with certain skin
		manifestations. The rate of severe drug eruptions following treatment with
		nevirapine is a cause of concern that needs further study.

PG	-	755-9
AB	-	The first case of AIDS patient in the northern part of Thailand was reported in
		"1987 (Vithayasai et al., 1996), marking the outbreak of an epidemic. In our"
		"experience, the neurological involvement in AIDS patients seems to have changed"
		in pattern and incidence during the last 8 years. We have conducted a
		retrospective study to review the incidence of AIDS-defining diseases in the
		"patients admitted to Chiang Mai University Hospital, Thailand during the period"
		September 2001 to August 2002. There were 155 AIDS patients admitted during this
		"specified period, 118 of which were male and 37 female, aged between 16 and 60."
		"The incidence of neurological complications was 50.3 per 100 person-years, in"
		which central nervous system involvement account for 46.5 per 100 person-years
		and peripheral nervous system involvement account for 3.8 per 100 person-years.
		The incidence of cryptococcal meningitis appeared to be decreasing since 1994
		whereas the incidence of cerebral toxoplasmosis appeared to be increasing. The
		"incidence of cryptococcal meningitis, cerebral toxoplasmosis and cytomegalovirus"
		"(CMV) infection was 18.0, 14.8 and 7.0 per 100 person-years, respectively. Other"
		common non-neurological AIDS-defining illnesses in northern Thailand include
		"pulmonary tuberculosis (15.4 per 100 person-years), extra-pulmonary tuberculosis"
		"(9.6 per 100 person-years), and disseminated penicilliosis (12.2 per 100"
		"person-years). In this way and summarizing, in northern Thailand, the three most"
		common neurological involvements before the era of highly active anti-retroviral
		"therapy are cryptococcal meningitis, cerebral toxoplasmosis and CMV infection."
		The incidence of cryptococcal meningitis appeared to be decreasing whereas the
		incidence of cerebral toxoplasmosis seemed to be increasing.

AB	-	Clinical deterioration during the treatment of tuberculosis remains a diagnostic
		challenge. We describe the case of a 46-year-old man with a history of oral
		cancer status after a radical operation who had pulmonary tuberculosis with
		pleura and neck lymph node involvement. The clinical condition improved after
		"antituberculosis therapy. However, the patient suffered from low-grade fever,"
		"progressive dyspnea, and cough after 7 weeks of the therapy. The findings of"
		chest plain films were relapse and progression of left lung haziness. The
		deterioration was caused by disseminated Penicillium marneffei infection.
		"Disseminated P. marneffei in a non-HIV patient with tuberculosis is rarely seen,"
		and the manifestations are similar to a paradoxical response and relapse of
		"pulmonary tuberculosis, thereby making it difficult to establish a diagnosis."

AB	-	Penicillium marneffei is the only dimorphic fungus among Penicillium spp. that
		can cause a fatal infection in immunocompromised patients. P. marneffei is
		endemic in Southeast Asia and eastern China. P. marneffei infection is an
		AIDS-defining illness and the third most common opportunistic infection in the
		"endemic regions. Here, the authors report a case of disseminated P. marneffei"
		infection in a patient who underwent liver transplantation in China. During the
		"hospital stay, the mold form of the fungus that produced a red wine-colored"
		"pigment on the agar plate was isolated from the patient's urine, transtracheal"
		"aspirate, and blood. The fungus was identified as P. marneffei by direct"
		sequencing of the D1-D2 and ITS regions. Thermal dimorphism was also confirmed by
		"subculturing the colony at 37 degrees C. To the best of our knowledge, this is"
		the first Korean case of disseminated P. marneffei infection in a liver
		transplant recipient.

		diabetes: a case report.
PG	-	496
LID	-	10.1186/1471-2334-13-496 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Following the recent transfer of all accepted species of Penicillium
		"subgenus Biverticillium to Talaromyces (including Talaromyces marneffei, formerly"
		"Penicillium marneffei), Penicillium species are becoming increasingly rare causal"
		"agents of invasive infections. Herein, we present a report of a type 2 diabetes"
		patient with a fungus ball in the respiratory tract caused by Penicillium
		capsulatum. CASE PRESENTATION: A 56-year-old Chinese female gardener with a
		5-year history of type 2 diabetes presented at the Shanghai Changzheng Hospital
		"with fever, a cough producing yellow-white sputum, and fatigue. The therapeutic"
		"effect of cefoxitin was poor. An HIV test was negative, but the β-D-glucan test"
		was positive (459.3 pg/ml). Chest radiography revealed a cavitary lesion in the
		"left upper lobe, and a CT scan showed globate cavities with a radiopaque,"
		gravity-dependent ball. The histopathologic features of the tissue after
		haematoxylin-eosin staining showed septate hyphae. The fungus was isolated from
		the gravity-dependent ball and identified as Penicillium capsulatum based on the
		morphological analysis of microscopic and macroscopic features and on ribosomal
		"internal transcribed spacer sequencing. After surgery, the patient was cured with"
		a sequential treatment of fluconazole 400 mg per day for 90 days and caspofungin
		70 mg per day for 14 days. CONCLUSIONS: Although the prognosis is often
		"satisfactory, clinicians, mycologists and epidemiologists should be aware of the"
		"possibility of infection by this uncommon fungal pathogen in diabetes patients,"
		since it may cause severe invasive infections in immunocompromised hosts such as
		diabetes and AIDS patients.

PG	-	277-84
AB	-	Cryptococcal meningitis and Penicillium marneffei infection are common serious
		fungal infections in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in
		"Southeast Asia. In a prospective, double-blind trial, 63 patients with HIV"
		infection and CD4+ lymphocyte counts of <200 cells/microL were randomized to
		"receive oral itraconazole (200 mg per day), and 66 similar patients received a"
		matched placebo. Both groups were monitored for evidence of invasive fungal
		infections. Baseline characteristics and the CD4+ cell counts of the 2 groups
		"were similar. In the intent-to-treat analysis, a systemic fungal infection"
		developed in 1 patient (1.6%) assigned to receive itraconazole (P. marneffei) and
		"in 11 patients (16.7%) given placebo (7 patients had cryptococcal meningitis, and"
		"4 patients had P. marneffei infection; P=.003, by the log-rank test). The"
		incidence of recurrent or refractory mucosal candidiasis was significantly
		reduced in the itraconazole group. The 2 groups did not differ with regard to
		adverse effects. Primary prophylaxis with oral itraconazole is well tolerated and
		prevents cryptococcosis and penicilliosis marneffei in patients with advanced HIV
		"infection, especially those with CD4+ lymphocyte counts of <100 cells/microL."
		"However, prophylaxis with itraconazole was not found to be associated with a"
		survival advantage when it was given to patients with advanced HIV disease.

		chrysogenum.
PG	-	21
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Penicillium sp., other than P. marneffei, is an unusual cause of"
		invasive disease. These organisms are often identified in immunosuppressed
		"patients, either due to human immunodeficiency virus or from immunosuppressant"
		medications post-transplantation. They are a rarely identified cause of infection
		in immunocompetent hosts. CASE PRESENTATION: A 51 year old African-American
		female presented with an acute abdomen and underwent an exploratory laparotomy
		which revealed an incarcerated peristomal hernia. Her postoperative course was
		"complicated by severe sepsis syndrome with respiratory failure, hypotension,"
		"leukocytosis, and DIC. On postoperative day 9 she was found to have an"
		anastamotic breakdown. Pathology from the second surgery showed transmural
		ischemic necrosis with angioinvasion of a fungal organism. Fungal blood cultures
		were positive for Penicillium chrysogenum and the patient completed a 6 week
		"course of amphotericin B lipid complex, followed by an extended course oral"
		intraconazole. She was discharged to a nursing home without evidence of recurrent
		infection. DISCUSSION: Penicillium chrysogenum is a rare cause of infection in
		"immunocompetent patients. Diagnosis can be difficult, but Penicillium sp. grows"
		"rapidly on routine fungal cultures. Prognosis remains very poor, but aggressive"
		"treatment is essential, including surgical debridement and the removal of foci of"
		infection along with the use of amphotericin B. The clinical utility of newer
		antifungal agents remains to be determined.

TI	-	Pulmonary infection caused by Talaromyces purpurogenus in a patient with multiple
		myeloma.
PG	-	153-7
AB	-	A 66-year-old female patient with multiple myeloma (MM) was admitted to the
		"emergency service on 29.09.2014 with an inability to walk, and urinary and faecal"
		incontinence. She had previously undergone autologous bone marrow transplantation
		(ABMT) twice. The patient was hospitalized at the Department of Haematology.
		Further investigations showed findings suggestive of a spinal mass at the
		"T5-T6-T7 level, and a mass lesion in the iliac fossa. The mass lesion was"
		resected and needle biopsy was performed during a colonoscopy. Examination of the
		specimens revealed plasmacytoma. The patient also had chronic obstructive
		pulmonary disease (COPD) and was suffering from respiratory distress. After
		consultation with an infectious diseases specialist the patient was placed on an
		intravenous antibiotherapy with piperacillin/tazobactam (4.5g x 3) on 17.10.2014.
		"During piperacillin/tazobactam treatment, the patient suffered from drowsiness,"
		"her general condition deteriorated, and she had rales on auscultation of the"
		lungs. The patient underwent thoracic computerized tomography (CT) which showed
		areas of focal consolidation in the lower lobes of the two lungs (more prominent
		"on the left), and increased medullary density. The radiology report suggested"
		that fungal infection could not be ruled out based on the CT images. The sputum
		sample was sent to the mycology laboratory and direct microscopic examination
		performed with Gram and Giemsa staining showed the presence of septate hyphae;
		"therefore voriconazole was added to the treatment. Slow growing (at day 10),"
		grey-greenish colonies and red pigment formation were observed in all culture
		media except cycloheximide-containing Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) medium. The
		"isolate was initially considered to be Talaromyces marneffei. However, it was"
		subsequently identified by DNA sequencing analysis as Talaromyces purpurogenus.
		"The patient was discharged at her own wish, as she was willing to continue"
		"treatment in her hometown. Unfortunately, the patient died on December 8, 2014."
		"In conclusion, apart from T. marneffei, less common strains such as T."
		purpurogenus should be considered when clinical samples obtained from patients
		with haematologic/oncologic disorders show fungal colonies that form red pigments
		on the culture media and when microscopic examination suggests a morphological
		appearance similar to Penicillium species.

PG	-	1237-41
AB	-	"OBJECTIVE: In this study, researchers investigated the demographic and clinical"
		"characteristics of AIDS patients who died in hospitals, analyzed the specific"
		"causes of death, and looked for the correlation between specific cause of death"
		and their clinical characteristics. METHODS: Data of clinical characteristics of
		patients and their specific causes AIDS of death who died in the seven hospitals
		from 2009 to 2010 were collected retrospectively. All the specific causes of
		death were classified according to the Cause of Death (CoDe) project protocol.
		Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to
		find the association between some categorical variables and the risk for AIDS
		patients died from AIDS related illnesses. RESULTS: Clinical characteristics and
		the cause of death of the 381 deceased in seven hospitals in this study were
		"collected. 82.4% were male, with priority as 30-45 years old. 123 (32.3%) death"
		"patients had received ART before death. In all death cases, the cause of death of"
		"252 patients (66.1%) were due to AIDS related diseases, with opportunistic"
		"infections the most (92.4%). Tubercle bacillus, infection of Penicillium"
		marneffei and Pneumocystis jiroveci were the three leading causes of
		opportunistic infection deaths. Of 129 patients who died of non-AIDS related
		"disease, non-AIDS infection (29.5%), hepatitis (22.5%), and non-AIDS"
		malignancy(10.1%)were the first three causes of death. The cause of death in
		"patients who had injecting drug use behavior within one year, had not received"
		"ART or not long enough, with opportunistic infections, without hepatitis, with"
		the last low CD4 cell counts before death etc. were tend to due to AIDS related
		"disease. CONCLUSION: Opportunistic infections, non-AIDS related infections and"
		hepatitis were the three leading causes of death in this study. The duration of
		time on ART had impact on the patient's cause of death. The HIV infected patients
		who had received ART before death had more risk to die of non-AIDS related
		"disease, compared to patients who had not. The longer time they had accessed to"
		"ART, the less likely they would die on non-AIDS related illnesses."

TI	-	Penicillium marneffei infection in an African man.
PG	-	2
AB	-	Penicilliosis is a systemic fungal infection caused by Penicillium marneffei. The
		"infection is most commonly seen in Southeast Asia, Southern China, Hong Kong, and"
		"Taiwan. It is rarely seen among individuals of African descent. Here, we report a"
		case of penicilliosis in an African man from Namibia who was studying in
		"Malaysia. He presented with multiple umbilicated papules associated with cough,"
		"fever, loss of appetite, and weight. He also had urethral discharge and admitted"
		to unprotected sexual intercourse with multiple partners. Histopathological
		examination of a skin papule showed the presence of multiple 2 to 4 microm
		intracellular yeast cells. Culture of the papule revealed Penicillium marneffei.
		The serology for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was positive. This case
		illustrates the need to recognize penicilliosis in any individuals staying or
		travelling to Southeast Asia and the need to look for underlying HIV infection in
		adults with umbilicated papules.

		Singapore.
PG	-	605-9
AB	-	Penicillium marneffei has emerged as an important opportunistic pathogen in
		HIV-infected patients in Southeast Asia. We report the first 5 cases of P.
		marneffei diagnosed in Singapore. All the patients were HIV-infected and were
		"either Thai nationals or had frequently travelled to Thailand. Fever, weight"
		"loss, anaemia and papular skin lesions were common clinical manifestations in our"
		"patients, all of whom had the organism isolated from blood. Skin biopsy specimens"
		"showed histological evidence of P. marneffei in 2 patients. In 1 patient each,"
		the organism grew in cultures of specimens from bone marrow and respiratory
		secretions. Amphotericin B therapy followed by itraconazole were used in 3 of our
		5 patients and was associated with good clinical response and outcome.

TI	-	Incidence and risk factors of major opportunistic infections after initiation of
		antiretroviral therapy among advanced HIV-infected patients in a resource-limited
		setting.
PG	-	464-9
AB	-	"OBJECTIVE: To study incidence, risk factors, and impact of major opportunistic"
		infections (OIs) after initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART). METHODS: A
		retrospective cohort study was conducted among naïve HIV-infected patients who
		were initiated ART during January 2003-December 2004. All patients were followed
		until 15 months after ART. RESULTS: There were 793 patients with mean+/-SD age of
		35.2+/-7.4 years and 56.3% male. Median (IQR) CD4 was 26 (9-78) cells/mm3. Of 793
		"patients, 61 (8%) patients developed 81 episodes of OIs after ART. These included"
		"tuberculosis (48.1%), CMV retinitis (19.8%), MAC infection (14.8%), PCP (9.9%),"
		cryptococcosis (6.2%) and penicilliosis (1.2%). Overall incidence of new episode
		of OIs after ART was 8.0% during the first year of ART. Probabilities of OIs at
		"1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months after ART were 2.6%, 4.0%, 5.3%, 6.9% and 8.0%,"
		"respectively. Baseline CD4 < or = 50 cells/mm3, male gender, and low body weight"
		were associated with higher incidence of OIs after ART (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS:
		Most of new episodes of major OIs develop within the first three months after
		ART. Tuberculosis is the most frequent OIs in this situation. The substantial
		increase of new episode of OIs after ART was observed among HIV-infected patients
		with CD4 cell counts < or = 50 cells/mm3 at ART initiation.

LID	-	10.3855/jidc.11830 [doi]
AB	-	"Aureobasidium pullulans (A. pullulans) is a dematiaceous, yeast-like fungus that"
		"is ubiquitous in nature, which can colonize the human hair and skin. A. pullulans"
		"has been clinically implicated to cause skin and soft tissue infections,"
		"meningitis, splenic abscesses, and peritonitis. Herein, molecular diagnostic of"
		internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing was used to investigate a suspected
		"case of A. pullulans infection, and the infection source had been traced. A"
		27-year-old female case was suspected of kala-azar due to the recurrent fever.
		"Bone marrow specimens were analyzed. The samples were negative for Leishmania,"
		Penicillium marneffei and Histoplasma capsulatum. DNA was extracted from the bone
		"marrow specimens, and the 583-bp sequence was amplified with the fungal ITS"
		universal primers. The sequence was compared by Blast query to be identified as
		A. pullulans. A strain of A. pullulans was also isolated from the kitchen of the
		patient's living room. Culture characteristics were the same as the human
		"pathogens of A. pullulans, and the ITS sequence was identical to the bone marrow"
		"ITS amplification. In conclusion, a deep infection caused by A. pullulans is"
		"rare, often occurring in the indwelling catheter, which may cause peritonitis and"
		other symptoms. ITS sequencing of fungi can be used as a diagnostic reference. As
		"A. pullulans is a common fungus in environment, amplification of ITS sequence of"
		A. pullulans in the aseptic body fluid would be necessary to make a comprehensive
		diagnosis based on the clinical symptoms and signs.

		"methods can be time-consuming, particularly for non-albicans Candida species,"
		"non-Candida yeasts, and moulds. An oligonucleotide array system targeting the"
		internal transcribe spacer (ITS) 1 or 2 region of the rRNA genes was used to
		analyse prospectively 116 fungus-positive blood cultures [BACTEC Myco/F Lytic
		"bottles (Becton-Dickinson Microbiology Systems, Sparks, MD, USA)] from 105"
		"patients, and the results were compared with those obtained using conventional"
		methods. A total of 124 yeast isolates and two mould isolates were identified;
		"these microorganisms (isolate no.) included C. albicans (50), C. tropicalis (26),"
		"C. glabrata (18), C. parapsilosis (14), Cryptococcus neoformans (9), Trichosporon"
		"asahii (2), Rhodotorula mucilaginosa (2), Penicillium marneffei (2) and three"
		other species. Multiple species fungaemia (MSF) was detected in ten samples as
		"opposed to six detected using conventional methods. In two discrepant samples,"
		antifungal susceptibility testing revealed that the additionally detected isolate
		had higher MICs of fluconazole. An isolate reported as Rhodotorula glutinis by
		"the Vitek Yeast Biochemical Card (bioMérieux Vitek, Marcy l'Etoile, France) was"
		identified as R. mucilaginosa by the array and the identification by array
		hybridization was confirmed by sequence analysis of the ITS region. A test
		sensitivity of 100% was obtained. The test specificity was 100% according to
		examination of 57 blood samples containing non-target fungal species or bacterium
		"only. From the time at which growth was detected in blood cultures, the entire"
		identification procedure could be completed within 16-24 h.

		pneumonia in a natural history cohort of people living with HIV/AIDS in Northern
		Thailand.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) plays a pivotal role in innate immunity;
		"however, its impact on susceptibility to opportunistic infections (OIs) has not"
		yet been examined in a natural history cohort of people living with HIV/AIDS.
		METHODS: We used archived samples to analyze the association between MBL
		expression types and risk of major OIs including Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia
		"(PCP), cryptococcosis, talaromycosis, toxoplasmosis, and tuberculosis in a"
		prospective cohort in Northern Thailand conducted from 1 July 2000 to 15 October
		2002 before the national antiretroviral treatment programme was launched.
		"RESULTS: Of 632 patients, PCP was diagnosed in 96 (15.2%) patients, including 45"
		patients with new episodes during the follow-up period (1006.5 person-years). The
		total history of PCP was significantly associated with low MBL expression type:
		"high/intermediate (81/587, 13.8%), low (10/33, 30.3%) and deficient (5/12, 41.7%)"
		"(p = 0.001), whereas the history of other OIs showed no relation with any MBL"
		expression type. Kaplan-Meier analysis (n = 569; log-rank p = 0.011) and Cox's
		proportional hazards model revealed that deficient genotype dramatically
		"increased the risk of PCP, which is independent upon sex, age, CD4 count, HIV-1"
		"viral load and hepatitis B and C status (adjusted hazard ratio 7.93, 95%"
		"confidence interval 2.19-28.67, p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Deficiency of MBL"
		expression is a strong risk factor determining the incidence of PCP but not other
		major OIs.

TI	-	Clinical diversity of invasive cryptococcosis in AIDS patients from central
		China: report of two cases with review of literature.
PG	-	1003
LID	-	10.1186/s12879-019-4634-7 [doi]

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Although antiretroviral therapy (ART) has greatly improved the
		"prognosis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients globally,"
		"opportunistic infections (OIs) are still common in Chinese AIDS patients,"
		especially cryptococcosis. CASE PRESENTATION: We described here two Chinese AIDS
		patients with cryptococcal infections. Case one was a fifty-year-old male. At
		"admission, he was conscious and oriented, with papulonodular and umbilicated skin"
		"lesions, some with ulceration and central necrosis resembling molluscum"
		contagiosum. The overall impression reminded us of talaromycosis: we therefore
		"initiated empirical treatment with amphotericin B, even though the case history"
		"of this patient did not support such a diagnosis. On the second day of infusion,"
		"the patient complained of intermittent headache, but the brain CT revealed no"
		"abnormalities. On the third day, a lumbar puncture was performed. The cerebral"
		"spinal fluid (CSF) was turbid, with slightly increased pressure. India ink"
		"staining was positive, but the cryptococcus antigen latex agglutination test"
		"(CrAgLAT: IMMY, USA) was negative. Two days later, the blood culture showed a"
		"growth of Cryptococcus neoformans, and the same result came from the skin"
		"culture. We added fluconazole to the patient's treatment, but unfortunately, he"
		died three days later. Case two was a sixty-four-year-old female patient with
		"mild fever, productive cough, dyspnea upon movement, and swelling in both lower"
		limbs. The patient was empirically put on cotrimoxazole per os and moxifloxacin
		"by infusion. A bronchofibroscopy was conducted with a fungal culture, showing"
		growth of Cryptococcus laurentii colonies. Amphotericin B was started thereafter
		but discontinued three days later in favor of fluconazole 400 mg/d due to
		worsening renal function. The patient became afebrile after 72 h of treatment
		with considerable improvement of other comorbidities and was finally discharged
		with continuing oral antifungal therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Our cases illustrate that
		cryptococcal disease is an important consideration when treating
		immunocompromised individuals such as AIDS patients. Life threatening meningitis
		or meningoencephalitis caused by C. neoformansmay still common in these
		"populations and can vary greatly in clinical presentations, especially with"
		"regard to skin lesions. Pulmonary cryptococcosis caused by C. laurentii is rare,"
		but should also be considered in certain contexts. Guidelines for its earlier
		"diagnosis, treatment and prophylaxis are needed."

TI	-	Four cats with fungal rhinitis.
PG	-	53-8
AB	-	Fungal rhinitis is uncommon in the cat and cases of nasal
		aspergillosis-penicilliosis have been rarely reported. Signs of fungal rhinitis
		"include epistaxis, sneezing, mucopurulent nasal discharge and exophthalmos."
		Brachycephalic feline breeds seem to be at increased risk for development of
		nasal aspergillosis-penicilliosis. Computed tomography (CT) imaging and
		rhinoscopy are useful in assessing the extent of the disease and in obtaining
		diagnostic samples. Fungal culture may lead to false negative or positive results
		and must be used in conjunction with other diagnostic tests. Serological testing
		was not useful in two cats tested. The cats in this study were treated with oral
		"itraconazole therapy. When itraconazole therapy was discontinued prematurely,"
		clinical signs recurred. Hepatotoxicosis is a possible sequel to itraconazole
		therapy.

LID	-	10.1186/1756-0500-6-506 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Infection with Penicillium marneffei is a common opportunistic
		infection in Southeast Asia where it is endemic. We report a case of Penicillium
		marneffei infection with fatal outcome in a Togolese woman infected with Human
		"Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). CASE PRESENTATION: A 45-years-old patient, infected"
		with Human Immunodeficiency Virus had consulted for ongoing febrile pneumonia
		"since two weeks. Clinical examination revealed fever of 38.5°C, dyspnea,"
		"pulmonary syndrome condensation and papulo-nodular of ""molluscum contagiosum"""
		"like lesions located on the face, arms, neck and trunk. Sputum smear was negative"
		for tuberculosis. The chest radiograph showed reticulonodular opacities in the
		right upper and middle lobes and two caves in the right hilar region. The CD4
		count was 6 cells/mm3 after a year of antiretroviral treatment
		(Zidovudine-Lamivudine-Efavirenz). She was treated as smear negative pulmonary
		tuberculosis after a lack of gentamicin and amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid
		response. Culture of skin samples and sputum had revealed the presence of P.
		marneffei. A treatment with ketoconazole 600 mg per day was initiated. After two
		"weeks of treatment, there was a decrease in the size and number of papules and"
		"nodules, without any new lesions. We noted disappearance of cough and fever. The"
		chest X-ray showed a decrease of pulmonary lesions. There was no reactivation of
		P. marneffei infection but the patient died from AIDS after two years of follow
		up. CONCLUSION: We report a case of P. marneffei infection in a HIV-infected
		patient in a non-endemic country. Clinicians should think of P. marneffei
		"infection in all HIV-infected patients with ""molluscum contagiosum"" like lesions."

AB	-	Talaromycosis is endemic in Southeast Asia and is commonly described in
		HIV-infected patients. We describe the first case of Talaromycosis in
		HIV-infected patient in Burkina Faso. This is an 83-year-old man with skin
		lesions on the right foot. The thick scales were used for the mycological
		examination. Microscopic examination of growth allowed isolation of Talaromyces
		marneffei in its yeast and mold forms. The patient was treated successfully with
		Itraconazole (400 mg/day) for 8 weeks.

		infection.
PG	-	433-8
AB	-	The first natural infection due to Penicillium marneffei in a human was reported
		in the United States in 1973. We describe a second case of penicilliosis
		"marneffei that was diagnosed in Florida. In both instances, the patients had a"
		history of travel in Southeast Asia where P. marneffei is endemic. The Florida
		patient had recurrent episodes of hemoptysis attributed to bronchitis and
		bronchiectasis. In spite of therapy with various antibacterial antibiotics for
		"tuberculosis, the granulomatous lesions in the left upper lobe of the lungs"
		persisted. The diagnosis of penicilliosis marneffei was established by isolating
		"and identifying the dimorphic species of Penicillium, P. marneffei. The"
		histopathologic features of the lung tissue included granulomata with central
		"areas of necrosis and neutrophilic infiltration with many yeast-like, tissue-form"
		"cells of P. marneffei, which multiplied by a fission rather than a budding"
		process.

		Penicillium marneffei.
PG	-	167-78
LID	-	10.1093/mmy/myt006 [doi]
AB	-	"A number of pathogens, most of them intracellular, employ the glyoxylate cycle in"
		order to ingest fatty acids as carbon sources as a way of coping with nutrient
		"deprivation during the infection process. Isocitrate lyase, which is encoded by"
		"the pathogen's acuD gene, plays a pivotal role in the glyoxylate cycle, which has"
		"been implicated in fungal pathogenesis. In this study, the acuD gene of"
		Penicillium marneffei was knocked down using siRNA expressed by a filamentous
		fungi expression system. The acuD siRNA reduced the acuD gene's mRNA and protein
		"expression by 21.5 fold and 3.5 fold, respectively. When macrophages were"
		"infected with different transformants of P. marneffei, the knockdown of acuD"
		"expression with RNA interference was lethal to the pathogens. In addition, the"
		secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma from the infected
		"macrophages was reduced. Moreover, the RNAi-mediated silencing of acuD expression"
		reduced the fungal burden in the nude mice infected with P. marneffei; inhibited
		"the inflammatory response in the lungs, livers, and spleens during the chronic"
		phase instead of the acute phase of infection; and thus prolonged survival of the
		"infected animals. Collectively, our data indicate that the RNAi-mediated"
		silencing of acuD expression could attenuate virulence of P. marneffei. The
		endogenous expression of the delivered siRNA vector could be used to evaluate the
		role of functional genes by continuous and stable expression of siRNA.

		"with renal transplantation. This is the first reported case, to our knowledge, of"
		P. marneffei infection in an SOT recipient acquired during travel to an endemic
		"country, and highlights the importance of an accurate travel history when"
		"opportunistic infection is suspected, as well as giving appropriate health advice"
		to transplant patients who travel.

		case].
PG	-	325-9
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical and laboratory features of disseminated
		Penicillium marneffei infection in patients with AIDS. METHODS: The HIV antibody
		in serum was assayed by both enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and Western immunoblot
		(WIB) methods. Morphology of the pathogenic fungus in smear and biopsy specimens
		of bone marrow was observed. The fungus was isolated from the patient's skin
		lesion and inoculated into the abdominal cavities of 2 rats and 2 mice. Twenty
		days later the rats and mice were killed and their viscera were taken out. Blood
		from the organs were cultured in Sabourand glucose agar at 25 degrees C and 37
		degrees C. The colonies were observed. The morphology of the fungus was observed
		by microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: The most common clinical
		"manifestations of Penicilium marneffei infection were fever, weight loss, anemia,"
		"papular skin lesion, hepatosplenomegaly, and lymphadenectasis. Yeast-like cells"
		were found in the culture at 37 degrees C or in tissues. The fungi outside the
		"host cells were elongated, often curved, sausage-like and with clear central"
		"septi. When cultured at 25 degrees C, the fungus was mycelia-like and produced a"
		"characteristic red pigment, diffusing into the medium. CONCLUSION: Disseminated"
		Penicilliosis marneffei is one of the most important opportunistic infections in
		patients with AIDS in Southeast Asia and the southern part of China. Since there
		"is no specific clinical manifestation for Penicillium marneffei infection, it is"
		often misdiagnosed. Definite diagnosis requires culture of the pathogenic fungus
		"from clinical specimens. The fungus is thermally dimorphic, produces red pigment,"
		and is sausage-form with clear central septum outside the host cell. Amphotericin
		B and itraconazole are effective in treating Penicilliosis marneffei.

AB	-	The pathological and molecular findings associated with Talaromyces
		marneffei-induced pneumonia with concomitant infection by canine distemper virus
		(CDV) are described in a dog. The principal pathological alteration occurred in
		the lungs. Histopathology confirmed multifocal granulomatous pneumonia associated
		with numerous intralesional and intracellular septate fission cells consistent
		with T. marneffei. A molecular assay designed to amplify a partial fragment of
		the 18S rRNA gene of T. marneffei provided positive results from two fungal
		cultures derived from the lung. Sequencing and phylogenetic analyses confirmed
		"the results of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Furthermore, antigens of the CDV"
		N protein were identified within the bronchial epithelium by immunohistochemistry
		and a PCR assay amplified the CDV N gene from hepatic and pulmonary fragments.
		"Collectively, the pathological and molecular techniques confirmed a diagnosis of"
		T. marneffei-induced pneumonia with concomitant infection by CDV. These findings
		represent the first description of pulmonary penicilliosis in the dog and extend
		"the geographical niche of this emerging infectious pathogen. In this case,"
		"infection by CDV may have induced immunosuppression, which facilitated the"
		development of pulmonary penicilliosis.

PG	-	57-60
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To analyze the death causes of 345 cases with HIV/AIDS in Guangdong
		area. METHODS: The situations of 345 hospitalized death cases with HIV/AIDS were
		conducted by retrospective analysis. RESULTS: (1)There were total 3406
		hospitalized cases with HIV/AIDS in a hospital from January 2001 to December 2011
		"and 345 cases died, the fatality rate was 10. 13%. Since 2005 the introduction of"
		"free anti-viral treatment, the fatality rate of HIV/AIDS declined. The fatality"
		rate of the patients whose CD4+ T lymphocyte counts <200 cells/microl was 14.61%
		(299/2046) and it was significantly higher than that of patients whose CD4 T
		lymphocyte counts >or=200 cells/microl (P <0.01). (2) 99.42% of the death cases
		had more than one kind of opportunistic infections (OI) and there were 924 cases
		of OI totally. 84. 64% of OI related to the death directly. Fungal infection was
		"the most common in OI, followed by bacterial infection. Most OI occurred in the"
		"lungs, mouth, other systemic disseminated diseases, gastrointestine, central"
		"nerver system, septicemia, skin. The AIDS defining opportunistic infections such"
		"as several pneumonia, disseminated penicilliosis marneffei and CNS infections"
		accounted for 29.65%. Other factors that caused HIV/AIDS death included
		"opportunistic tumors, HIV related disease and non AIDS-related disease accounted"
		for 15.36%. No accepted effective highly active antiretroviral therapy (HARRT)
		"also constituted factors of death. Among cases which accepted HARRT treatment,"
		only 6.96% had the period of treatment over three months. CONCLUSION: The
		fatality rate of end-stage AIDS patients was high and the opportunistic
		infections was the most important cause of death. Early diagnosis and treatment
		"for opportunistic infections, timely effective HARRT were the key to improve the"
		quality of life of AIDS patients.

		"histopathology of tissue, gross and microscopic morphology of the culture and PCR"
		assay of the isolated fungus. Successful antifungal treatment was with

PG	-	77-82
AB	-	Survival from the time of AIDS diagnosis to death was determined retrospectively
		among Thai patients (> or = 13 years old) who attended a public tertiary care
		"infectious disease hospital in a suburb of Bangkok, Thailand, from February 1987"
		through February 1993. An AIDS diagnosis was based on the 1987 Centers for
		"Disease Control (CDC) definition, except Penicillium marneffei infection was"
		"included as an AIDS-defining condition. Of 329 AIDS patients, 152 (46.2%) had"
		"died. The median age at diagnosis was 31.5 years (range, 18-74) 306 patients"
		"(93.0%) were males. Reported risk categories were heterosexual contact (55.2%),"
		"injecting drug use (IDU, 22.6%), male homosexual or bisexual contact (9.5%), and"
		unidentified risk or other (12.7%). Median survival time (Kaplan-Meier) for all
		patients was 7.0 months; 1-year survival probability was 39.2% (95% confidence
		interval [CI] = 31.5-46.9%). Cox's proportional hazards model showed three
		"factors associated with survival: age, reported risk category, and presenting"
		"diagnosis. Patients aged 26 to 35 years survived longer (median survival time,"
		"10.6 months; relative hazard [RH] = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.44-0.85, referent: others),"
		"as did patients in sexual risk categories (median survival time, 7.3 months; RH ="
		"0.59, 95% CI = 0.40-0.78, referent: IDU and other categories). A single"
		presenting diagnosis of extrapulmonary tuberculosis was also associated with
		"longer survival (median survival time, 19.9 months, RH = 0.55, 95% CI ="
		"0.35-0.86, referent: other diagnoses). AIDS patients in the early phase of the"
		epidemic in Bangkok have much shorter survival times than patients in developed
		"countries, in part perhaps because they are often diagnosed late in the course of"
		HIV infection. Increased attention should be given to the early diagnosis and
		treatment of these patients.

TI	-	Bacteremia and fungemia in patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus
		(HIV) infection in Taiwan.
PG	-	690-7
AB	-	To understand the etiology and clinical outcome of bacterial and fungal sepsis in
		"patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in Taiwan, we"
		conducted a prospective study of nonmycobacterial bacteremia and fungemia in
		HIV-infected patients with fever who were admitted to a university hospital in
		"Taiwan during a 42-month period. Of 210 patients, 41 (19.5%) had a total of 52"
		"episodes of sepsis due to nonmycobacterial bacteria or fungi, or both (15.5% of"
		336 episodes of fever). All but one patient had acquired immunodeficiency
		"syndrome (AIDS), and the mean CD4 lymphocyte count was 29/microL (range,"
		0-321/microL). A total of 57 pathogens (39 bacteria and 18 fungi) were isolated
		from blood; polymicrobial sepsis due to both bacteria and fungi occurred in four
		episodes. Nontyphoid Salmonella (NTS) was the most common cause of
		"community-acquired bacteremia (24/30, 80%). Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia was"
		diagnosed in three episodes while Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia was found
		in only one. Cryptococcus neoformans was the most common cause of fungemia and
		"was responsible for 12 episodes, while fungemia due to Penicillium marneffei and"
		"Histoplasma capsulatum, two emerging fungi in Taiwan, were diagnosed in four"
		"cases and one case, respectively. Nine episodes, eight of bacteremia and one of"
		"candidemia, were nosocomial. The overall in-hospital mortality was 29%, and"
		"nosocomial sepsis was associated with a higher mortality rate (56%, p = 0.02)."
		The mean duration of survival after recovery from initial sepsis was 426 days. We
		conclude that NTS bacteremia was the most common cause of sepsis in patients with
		advanced HIV infection in Taiwan and clinicians caring for such patients should
		watch for emerging fungal infections. Nosocomial sepsis was associated with a
		high mortality rate. The mean survival duration after recovery from sepsis of our
		patients was short.

AB	-	Talaromyces marneffei (T. marneffei) is a dimorphic fungus that causes systemic
		"infection in immunocompromised patients. Here, we present a case of T. marneffei"
		infection in an immunocompetent patient with an osteolytic lesion. Diagnosis was
		established by fungal culture. The patient responded rapidly to intravenous
		"voriconazole, followed by oral voriconazole. We reviewed 18 reported cases of"
		"T. marneffei infection with osteolytic lesions, which suggests a much higher rate"
		of osteolytic lesions in immunocompetent patients than previously thought.

PG	-	167-70
AB	-	We present a case of central nervous system (CNS) infection by a member of the
		Penicillium genera in a HIV-negative man in Brazil. The patient was admitted
		complaining of loss of visual fields and speech disturbances. CT scan revealed
		multiple brain abscesses. Stereotactic biopsies revealed fungal infection and
		amphotericin B treatment begun with initial improvement. The patient died few
		days later as a consequence of massive gastrointestinal bleeding due to ruptured
		esophageal varices. The necropsy and final microbiologic analyses disclosed
		infection by Penicillium sp. There are thousands of fungal species of the
		Penicillium genera. Systemic penicilliosis is caused by the P. marneffei and was
		"formerly a rare disease, but now is one of the most common opportunistic"
		infection of AIDS patients in Southeast Asia. The clinical presentation usually
		"involves the respiratory system and the skin, besides general symptoms like fever"
		and weight loss. Penicillium spp infection caused by species other than P.
		marneffei normally cause only superficial or allergic disease but rare cases of
		invasive disease do occur. We report the fourth case of Penicillium spp CNS
		infection.

AB	-	Subcutaneous mycoses are a group of fungal infections of dermis and subcutaneous
		"tissue which consist of sporotrichosis, chromoblastomycosis, phaeohyphomycosis,"
		"hyalohyphomycosis, mycetoma, subcutaneous zygomycosis, rhinosporidiosis,"
		lobomycosis and disseminated penicilliosis. A total of 46 consecutive patients
		with clinically suspected subcutaneous mycoses attending various departments of
		Assam Medical College and Hospital were included in this prospective study to
		know the prevalence of subcutaneous mycoses in this eastern part of Assam. Direct
		"microscopy in 10 and 40 % KOH, histopathological examination of biopsied tissue,"
		colony characteristics on Sabourauds dextrose agar media both at 25 and 37 °C and
		detailed morphology of each fungus on lactophenol cotton blue mount were the
		basis of identification of the fungi. Subcutaneous mycoses were confirmed in 32.6
		"% (n = 15) cases. Out of 15 positive cases of subcutaneous mycoses,"
		"chromoblastomycosis was detected in six cases (n = 40 %), hyalohyphomycosis in"
		"three cases (n = 20 %), and lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis, disseminated"
		"penicilliosis and mycetoma in two cases each (n = 13.3 % each). In this study,"
		seven different species of fungus were found to be responsible for five different
		"clinical types of subcutaneous mycosis. Cladosporium cladosporioides, Bipolaris"
		"spicifera and Curvularia lunata were responsible for chromoblastomycosis,"
		"Fusarium oxysporum and Aspergillus terreus for hyalohyphomycosis, C. lunata for"
		"mycetoma, Sporothrix schenckii for lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis and Penicillium"
		marneffei for disseminated penicilliosis. C. cladosporioides and C. lunata were
		the commonest black fungi causing subcutaneous mycosis in this sub-Himalayan
		"belt. Rare species C. cladosporioides, B. spicifera and C. lunata were found to"
		be causing chromoblastomycosis in this study.

PG	-	ND05-6
LID	-	10.7860/JCDR/2014/9632.4825 [doi]
AB	-	Opportunistic infection in HIV disease often present to clinicians in an atypical
		"manner testing clinical acumen. Here, we report a case of Penicilliosis marneffei"
		(PM) infection presenting to surgical emergency as acute abdomen with undiagnosed
		"HIV status in advanced AIDS, chief complaints being prolonged fever and diffuse"
		abdominal pain. Radiologic imaging showed non-specific mesenteric and
		retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of the
		"lymph node was done and subjected to direct microscopy, gram staining and culture"
		on Sabouraud's dextrose agar (SDA) which showed Penicillium marneffei. He was
		then treated with intravenous amphotericin. This case is reported for its rarity
		and unusual presentation to sensitise clinicians and microbiologists to consider
		"PM as an aetiology in acute abdomen in high risk individuals, more so, in"
		patients from north-east India.

AB	-	A 53-yr-old Chinese sailor developed prolonged pyrexia with unresolved lobar
		"pneumonia, cervical lymphadenopathy, generalized subcutaneous abscesses, and"
		pericardial effusion. Penicillium marneffei was isolated from pericardial fluid
		and subcutaneous pus and was demonstrated on histologic sections of lymph nodes
		"and lung tissue. The penicilliosis was treated successfully with amphotericin B,"
		"ketoconazole, and 5-fluorocytosine. Subsequently, he also developed other"
		T-lymphocyte-related opportunistic infections such as disseminated cutaneous
		herpes zoster and chronic osteomyelitis of sternum caused by Salmonella
		typhimurium. He was also a chronic carrier of cytomegalovirus. Further
		investigations showed that he had persistent depression of T-lymphocyte function
		"and enhancement of B-lymphocyte activity, the cause of which was undetermined."

TI	-	Comparing the first and second hundred AIDS cases in Hong Kong.
PG	-	236-40
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To study the clinical and epidemiological features of the first 200
		AIDS patients in Hong Kong. METHOD: A retrospective analysis of the data reported
		to the Department of Health. The patients were divided into two groups of first
		100 and second 100 cases for comparison so as to discern the temporal changes.
		RESULTS: The first 100 AIDS cases were reported from February 1985 through to
		March 1994 (122 months) while the second 100 in the following 26 months. For both
		"groups, they were predominantly male (94%, 89%), Chinese (66%, 74%) who acquired"
		"HIV via sex (83%, 91%). The proportion of Caucasians and homo/bi-sexual contacts"
		"in first and second 100 cases have fallen from 26% to 12% (p = 0.012), and from"
		"53% to 31% (p = 0.006) respectively. For primary AIDS-defining illness (ADI), the"
		"frequency of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) has decreased (46% to 30%, p ="
		"0.03) while that of tuberculosis (10%, 19%) and Penicillium marneffei (5%, 14%)"
		infection have increased. Mycobacterium avium intracellualare and cytomegalovirus
		"infection have become commoner subsequent ADIs. Frequency of PCP (22%, 9.5%) as"
		"the cause of death have dropped while that of tuberculosis has risen (4.8%,"
		14.3%). Median survival probability had improved from 7.3 months for the first
		half of patients to 11.9 months for the second half. CONCLUSION: Incidence of PCP
		"has declined among local AIDS patients whereas tuberculosis, penicilliosis, MAI,"
		and CMV diseases have increased. Survival chance of AIDS patients has improved
		over the years.

PG	-	2699-702
AB	-	We describe four cases of disseminated infection caused by endemic Penicillium
		marneffei in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients from the
		"Manipur state of India. The most common clinical features observed were fever,"
		"anorexia, weight loss, hepatosplenomegaly, and, more importantly, skin lesions"
		resembling molluscum contagiosum. The diagnosis in each of the four cases was
		"achieved by direct examination of smears, observance of intracellular yeast-like"
		"cells multiplying by fission in biopsied tissue from skin lesions, and isolation"
		"of the dimorphic P. marneffei in pure culture in each case. In one case,"
		fluorescent antibody studies allowed specific diagnosis. This report documents a
		"new area in which P. marneffei is endemic, located in eastern India, and"
		describes the first occurrence in India of P. marneffei in HIV-infected patients
		as well as the extension of the areas of P. marneffei endemicity westward to the
		northeastern state of Manipur.

PG	-	7-Mar
AB	-	"A 57-year-old female, born in Laos and who had lived in Thailand prior to"
		"immigrating to Canada in 1989, was seen by her physician with a chief complaint"
		of cough and dyspnea. Her chest X-ray showed bilateral pulmonary air fluid
		"levels. A fungus, with a diffusible red pigment, tentatively identified as"
		"Penicillium marneffei, was isolated from the patient's bronchial washings and"
		"sputum specimens. At 37 degrees C, the fungus converted to a yeast form when"
		cultured on brain heart infusion agar. Microscopic examination of this culture
		revealed yeast cells that reproduced by fission. The identity of the patient's
		isolate was confirmed as P. marneffei with an exoantigen test. The patient's
		serum demonstrated specific antibodies to P. marneffei antigen. Treatment with
		"amphotericin B and ketoconazole resulted in clinical improvement, clearing of"
		chest X-rays and conversion to sero-negativity. Our case is the first recorded
		diagnosis of imported penicillosis marneffei in Canada. The minimal inhibitory
		"concentrations recorded for the patient's isolate to fluconazole,"
		"5-fluorocytosine, itraconazole and miconazole were 12.5, 0.39, < 0.195 and <"
		"0.195 micrograms/ml, respectively."

LID	-	10.12182/20200360605 [doi]
AB	-	This study is aimed to explore the value of metagenomic next-generation
		sequencing (mNGS) in diagnosing pathogen in fever patients. It is often a
		challenge to identify the pathogen that caused the infection in the HIV patients
		with fever. How could the mNGS be helpful for pathogen diagnosis is unclear. Here
		we reported a case of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patient with 2-month
		period of fever. After routine clinical laboratory tests including the
		"conventional smear, culture, serological tests and pathological examinations, the"
		causal pathogen still remained undiagnosed. Then the lymph node biopsy tissue was
		subjected to broad-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the peripheral blood
		"was subjected to mNGS. At the same time, peripheral blood culture was carried out"
		with an extension of culture time to acquire the pathogen. Results from both
		broad-range PCR and mNGS revealed the pathogen was Talaromyces marneffei. The
		isolate recovered from the peripheral blood culture was subjected to the
		whole-genome sequencing. Whole genome sequencing revealed that the antimicrobial
		"resistance gene FLU1 existed in this pathogen's genome, but mNGS did not detect"
		the FLU1 gene. Phylogenetic analysis based on whole genome sequence revealed that
		this isolate was far from other clones published in NCBI database. Here we
		"reported a case of Talaromyces marneffei infection diagnosed by mNGS, showing"
		that mNGS is helpful in etiological diagnosis for HIV patients with unexplained
		"fever. However, application of mNGS in antimicrobial resistant genes detection"
		and pathogen tracing need to be well-studied in the future.

		Chinese HIV/AIDS patients: a retrospective cross-sectional study.
PG	-	1767-1770
AB	-	Bloodstream infections (BSIs) are prevalent among people living with HIV/AIDS.
		The etiology varies in different regions and different periods. We aimed to
		survey the etiological and clinical features of BSIs in HIV patients in mainland
		China. We assessed all HIV patients with a positive blood culture in a Chinese
		teaching hospital from September 2009 through December 2014. We excluded those
		with specimens likely to have been contaminated. We used Pearson's chi-squared
		test to measure the differences in characteristics among subgroups of different
		"pathogens. Among 2442 Chinese HIV-seropositive inpatients, 229 (9.38 %)"
		experienced BSIs. The most common pathogens detected included Cryptococcus
		"neoformans (22.7 %), Penicillium marneffei (18.8 %), Mycobacterium tuberculosis"
		"(15.3 %), and non-tuberculous mycobacterium (14.8 %). 30/229 (13.1 %) HIV"
		patients with BSIs had a poor prognosis. BSIs are prevalent in hospitalized
		patients with HIV/AIDS in China. Fungi and mycobacteria are the predominant
		pathogens.

TI	-	Systemic Penicillium marneffei infection in a child with common variable
		immunodeficiency.
PG	-	780-3
AB	-	Penicillium marneffei is rarely pathogenic in humans. Most previously reported
		cases of P. marneffei infection were from Southeast Asia where patients were
		usually in an immunocompromised state due to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
		infection. The majority of the patients reported in Western countries were
		"immunocompromised by malignancy, especially Hodgkin's lymphoma. In Taiwan, the"
		first case of P. marneffei infection was reported in 1994 and involved an adult
		with HIV infection. We report a case of systemic P. marneffei infection in a
		"child with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). The patient, a 4-year,"
		"5-month-old boy, had a 1-year history of oligoarthritis resembling juvenile"
		rheumatoid arthritis (JRA). He developed a low grade fever (38 degrees C) and
		hepatosplenomegaly 1 month before admission to the hospital. Although cultures of
		synovial fluid obtained at the time of onset of oligoarthritis did not grow any
		"organisms, cultures of blood, bone marrow, synovial fluid, and lymph node biopsy"
		samples taken during this admission were positive for P. marneffei. Further
		immunologic studies revealed a profile characteristic of CVID. The fungal
		"infection was finally eradicated by combined therapy with amphotericin B,"
		"fluconazole, itraconazole, and regular immunoglobulin replacement. This case"
		reminds us that JRA or JRA-like arthritis should be differentiated from septic
		arthritis caused by rare pathogens in immunocompromised patients.

AB	-	Acquired immunodeficiency due to autoantibody against gamma interferon has
		"recently been associated with opportunistic nontuberculous mycobacteriosis,"
		"especially among Southeast Asians. We report another 8 cases, all except one"
		apparently immunocompetent hosts who suffered from concomitant or sequential
		"infections by other intracellular pathogens causing penicilliosis,"
		"extraintestinal nontyphoidal salmonellosis, and burkholderiosis. The only case"
		with an underlying immunodeficiency syndrome had systemic lupus erythematosus
		that was quiescent throughout the multiple infective episodes. Eight out of 10
		"(80.0%) patients with serological evidence of penicilliosis, 5 out of 7 (71.4%)"
		"with culture-positive extraintestinal nontyphoidal salmonellosis, 5 out of 28"
		"(17.9%) with serological evidence of melioidosis, and 7 out of 13 (53.8%) with"
		culture-positive nontuberculous mycobacteriosis possessed autoantibody against
		"gamma interferon, whereas only 1 out of 100 patients with systemic lupus"
		erythematosus did. Our study represents the first and largest case series linking
		this emerging immunodeficiency syndrome with these atypical infections in
		"apparently immunocompetent hosts. Thus, we advocate that any patient with"
		unexplained recurrent or polymicrobial infections due to these intracellular
		pathogens should be screened for acquired immunodeficiency due to autoantibody
		against gamma interferon.

		the diagnosis of Penicillium marneffei infection. This is perhaps the first case

		"Cytomegalovirus infections. One month later he re-presented with epigastric pain,"
		an epigastric mass and skin lesions. Abdominal imaging revealed large volume

		"yielded Penicillium marneffei, a dimorphic fungus endemic to South-east Asia. The"

		challenges of management in the context of multiple comorbidities and
		polypharmacy are discussed.

		"South-East Asia with unexplained fever (> 38 degrees C), weight loss, a"
		"generalised lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, skin lesions, cough and"
		anaemia. Diagnosis is made by culture and/or histopathological examination. Mild
		to moderate infections are treated with itraconazole 400 mg/day as first choice.
		Amphotericin B parenteral therapy may be required for seriously ill patients.
		Maintenance therapy with itraconazole 200 mg/day is necessary to prevent

AB	-	The first case observed in Argentina of AIDS-related human penicillosis is herein
		presented. The patient was a six- teen year-old young man coming from a rural
		area of southern China. He was admitted at the F. J. Muñiz Hospital of Buenos
		Aires city with severe pneumonia and adult respiratory distress. Penicillium
		marneffei was isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage fuid and was microscopically
		observed in a skin cytodiagnosis. P. marneffei identification was confirmed by
		rRNA amplification and its phenotypic characteristics. The patient suffered an
		advanced HIV infection and also presented several AIDS-related diseases due to
		"CMV, nosocomial bacterial infections and Pneumocystis jirovecii which led to a"
		fatal outcome.

TI	-	Massive hepatosplenomegaly caused by Penicillium marneffei associated with human
		immunodeficiency virus infection in a Thai patient.
PG	-	143-4
AB	-	A 29 year old Thai woman presented with non-specific features and examination
		revealed left upper zone consolidation and hepatosplenomegaly. The initial
		clinical differential diagnosis included tuberculosis and melioidosis. She died
		"four days after admission, while still under investigation. Postmortem"
		"examination revealed antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus, disseminated"
		"Penicillium marneffei infection, and Salmonella enteritidis infection."
		Penicillium marneffei is a well described AIDS defining pathogen in South East
		Asia but is very rare in the UK. Appropriate antifungal treatment may be
		associated with a successful outcome. Increased awareness of this clinical
		association may enable correct diagnosis in affected patients from South East
		Asia presenting within the UK.

		serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9: a case report.
PG	-	6307-12
AB	-	Carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) is the most frequently applied serum tumor
		"marker for diagnosis of cancers in the digestive organs. However, some patients"
		with benign diseases can have elevated serum levels of CA19-9 as well. The
		current study presents a 55-year-old female who was admitted to our hospital for
		further evaluation of a nodular cavity shadow in the right lower lobe and
		clarification of the cause of the marked elevation of serum CA19-9 levels.
		Abdominal MRI and gastrointestinal endoscopy did not find any malignancy. As lung
		"cancer cannot be excluded in this patient, a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery"
		"was carried, intraoperative and postoperative biopsy analysis both suggested"
		chronic bronchitis with fungal infection (due to Histoplasma capsulatum or
		Penicillium marneffei) and organization. Immunohistochemistry showed marked
		positive staining for CA19-9 in the damaged lung tissue. The CA19-9 levels
		"quickly returned to the normal range following lobe resection. Therefore, the"
		"marked elevation of serum CA19-9 levels, in this case, may have resulted from the"
		chronic bronchitis with fungal infection.

PG	-	55-7
AB	-	CLINICAL CASE: We present a case of conjunctivitis in a diabetic patient in whom
		"not improvement was observed after empiric treatment, and finally developed a"
		conjunctival granuloma. Culture of the conjunctival exudate and histological
		examination of the conjunctival biopsy confirmed the infection by Penicillium sp.
		The antifungical treatment (local and systemic) improved signs and symtoms
		gradually. DISCUSSION: Penicillium sp is an infrequent cause of conjunctival
		infection. This diagnosis should be considered when no response after usual
		therapy to conjunctivitis is obtained and should be confirmed by identification
		of the fungus in the lesions biopsed and cultured. Succesful management of ocular
		penicilliosis is achieved with both local and systemic antifungal treatment.

TI	-	Disseminated Paecilomyces lilacinus infection in a patient with AIDS.
PG	-	"212-3, 218, 221"
AB	-	We describe a case of disseminated Paecilomyces lilacinus infection occurring in
		a patient with advanced HIV infection. P lilacinus is a ubiquitous environmental
		fungus that has been associated with infection in various immunocompromised
		"hosts, in patients with invasive medical devices, and in contact-lens wearers."
		"The clinical features, morphologic characteristics, and response to antifungal"
		therapy in our patient are similar to findings reported in disseminated infection
		"due to Penicillium marneffei, another opportunistic fungal infection in"
		HIV-infected patients. We believe this to be the first report of infection with P
		lilacinus in a patient with AIDS.

TI	-	[Disseminated Penicillium marneffei infection suggesting visceral leishmaniasis
		in an HIV infected patient].
PG	-	363-4
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Penicilliosis is a fungal infection caused by Penicillium marneffei.
		"In Southeast Asia, this infection is common in HIV-infected patients but few"
		cases have been reported in Europe. CASE REPORT: The patient lived in southern
		France. He had HIV infection and was immunocompromised. The clinical signs
		suggested visceral leishmaniasis. Iterative travels to Southeast Asia were
		reported leading to the diagnosis of P. marneffei infection. DISCUSSION: In
		"southern France, imported penicilliosis marneffei may be misdiagnosed as visceral"
		leishmaniasis.
