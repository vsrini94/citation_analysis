LID	-	10.1093/trstmh/traa164 [doi]
AB	-	"In this communication, we report on the first-ever patient presenting with 17"
		lesions of Madurella mycetomatis eumycetoma in different parts of the body. The
		reported patient is a 15-y-old female who presented to the Mycetoma Research
		"Centre, University of Khartoum, Khartoum, Sudan, in 2017 with recurrent back and"
		"anterior abdominal wall eumycetoma lesions. They were surgically excised, and"
		"during the course of follow-up, she developed 15 other eumycetoma lesions,"
		scattered mostly on her upper and lower limbs and gluteal region. The diagnosis
		of Madurella mycetomatis was confirmed by molecular identification of grains and
		"culture, histopathological examination and ultrasound examination. The cause and"
		the explanation of such a presentation in puzzling; it is not due to multiple
		subcutaneous implantations because of the lack of history of relevant local
		trauma. Lymphatic spread is unlikely as the distribution of the lesions is not in
		line with this. Haematogenous spread is a possible explanation. This rare
		presentation of eumycetoma poses a great challenge for diagnosis and management.

TI	-	Mycetoma in north-western Yemen: Clinico-epidemiological and histopathological
		study.
PG	-	615-622
LID	-	10.25259/IJDVL_500_2021 [pii]
AB	-	"Background Mycetoma is widespread in Yemen; however, there are only a few"
		documented reports on the entity from this geographical area. Methods A
		prospective study of 184 cases of mycetoma (male 145 and female 39) from
		different regions of north-western Yemen was conducted between July 2000 and May
		2014. Clinical profile was recorded in a standardized protocol. The diagnosis was
		"based on clinical features, X-ray studies, examination of grains, and"
		"histopathology. Results Eumycetoma was diagnosed in 129, caused by Madurella"
		"mycetomatis in 124, Leptosphaeria senegalensis in one and pale grain fungus in"
		"four, whereas actinomycetoma occurred in 55, caused by Streptomyces somaliensis"
		"in 29, Actinomadura madurai in nine, Actinomadura pelletieri in one, and Nocardia"
		in sixteen. Eumycetoma cases were treated with prolonged course of antifungal
		"drugs, mostly ketoconazole, with itraconazole being used in four patients, along"
		with excision or debulking. Results were better when antifungal drugs were given
		two to three months before surgery and in those who received itraconazole.
		Actinomycetoma cases were initially treated with co-trimoxazole monotherapy;
		later streptomycin was added in 30 cases. Six patients who did not show adequate
		improvement and two others from the start were treated with modified Welsh
		regimen and with good results. Limitations Identification of different causative
		agents was done by histopathology and could not be reconfirmed by culture.
		Conclusion Mycetoma is widespread in north-western Yemen with a higher incidence
		of eumycetoma and a majority of the cases were caused by Madurella mycetomatis.
		Modified Welsh regimen in actinomycetoma and itraconazole with excision in
		eumycetoma showed the best results.

AB	-	Mycetoma is a neglected tropical disease which is endemic in Senegal. Although
		"this subcutaneous mycosis is most commonly found on the foot, extrapodal"
		"localisations have also been found, including on the leg, knee, thigh, hand, and"
		"arm. To our knowledge, no case of blood-spread eumycetoma has been reported in"
		"Senegal. Here, we report a case of pulmonary mycetoma secondary to a Madurella"
		mycetomatis knee eumycetoma. The patient was a 41-year-old farmer living in
		"Louga, Senegal, where the Sudano-Sahelian climate is characterised by a short and"
		unstable rainy season and a steppe vegetation. He suffered a trauma to the right
		more than 20 years previously and had received treatment for more than 10 years
		with traditional medicine. He consulted at Le Dantec University Hospital in Dakar
		for treatment of a right knee mycetoma which had been diagnosed more than 10
		years ago. He had experienced a chronic cough for more than a year; tuberculosis
		documentation was negative. Grains collected from the knee and the sputum
		"isolated M. mycetomatis, confirmed by the rRNA gene ITS regions nucleotide"
		"sequence analysis. An amputation above the knee was performed, and antibacterial"
		and antifungal therapy was started with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and
		terbinafine. The patient died within a month of his discharge from hospital.

AB	-	PURPOSE: To report an unusual case of isolated Acremonium eumycetoma presenting
		as a protuberant mass over the cornea. METHODS: Case report and literature
		review. RESULTS: A 55-year-old male patient referred to our center with a case of
		perforated corneal ulcer with uveal tissue prolapse was examined in the casualty
		"department and found to have central melt, approximately 8 mm, along with"
		suspected uveal tissue prolapse. A provisional diagnosis of sloughed corneal
		ulcer with uveal prolapse was made along with differential diagnoses of fungal
		ball and infected foreign body granuloma. Tectonic penetrating keratoplasty under
		"general anesthesia was planned. Intraoperatively, the suspected uveal (brown"
		colored) tissue was found to be an epicorneal mass growing over an intact and
		infiltrated cornea. Histopathological and microbiological analysis of the
		epicorneal mass and host cornea revealed it to be a fungal ball (mass full of
		septate hyphae) with growth of Acremonium species on culture. The patient was
		"administered topical and oral antifungal agents postoperatively, in addition to"
		topical antibiotics and cycloplegics. CONCLUSIONS: Isolated corneal Acremonium
		eumycetoma masquerading as a perforated corneal ulcer with prolapsed uveal tissue
		is a rare entity. Surgical intervention and appropriate antimicrobial therapy are
		key to successful outcome.

AB	-	"OBJECTIVE: Mycetoma is a slowly progressive, chronic granulomatous infection of"
		"skin and subcutaneous tissues with involvement of underlying fasciae and bones,"
		"usually affecting extremities. In India, among mycetoma, the eumycetoma"
		"constitutes about 35% of cases. Hereby, we report the first case of eumycetoma"
		"caused by uncommon fungus, Aspergillus candidus. CASE REPORT: A 61 year old"
		female presented to the Department of Dermatology with history of swelling of
		right foot associated with multiple firm nodules of approx. 1.5 × 1.5 cm each
		over dorsum of foot with discharging sinus containing white color granules.
		Biopsy of lesion on right foot on direct KOH examination revealed septate hyphae.
		Histopathology examination showed a histiocytic granuloma with fungal elements.
		Culture on Sabouraud Dextrose Agar grew white mycelial colonies which were
		identified to be Aspergillus species phenotypically. Genetic sequencing using
		"Internal transcribed spacer gene, beta tubulin gene and Calmodulin gene was done"
		and the isolate was identified to be Aspergillus candidus. Lesion was excised and
		patient was started on itraconazole. CONCLUSION: Timely identification and
		starting of antifungal treatment can help in reducing morbidity due to eumycetoma
		to a large extent. As newer and newer species of fungi are emerging as
		"significant causative agents of human infections, it is pertinent to report such"
		findings from epidemiological point of view.

		participation in cleaning animal pens and knowledge of the medical importance of
		"ticks. In the village with a high mycetoma prevalence rate, there were high"
		infestation rates of ticks in domestic animals. Hyalomma and Rhipicephalus
		species were the most prevalent species in houses with mycetoma patients and
		together they constituted 83% of the total collection. Pool screening of vectors
		for the detection of Madurella mycetomatis recombinant RNA genes showed one
		positive pool from Rhipicephalus evertsi following amplification of the universal
		fungal primer and one positive sample from Hyalomma rufipes following the use of
		a specific primer. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate a possible role of ticks in
		"the transmission of eumycetoma causative agents. However, further in-depth"
		studies are needed to verify this.

		features of colonization and invasive disease by Scedosporium and Lomentospora.
		METHODS: We conducted a 20-year retrospective study. Patients with at least 1
		"histopathology specimen and concurrent culture were included. Clinical features,"
		"histopathology, microbiology, and outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: Eighteen"
		"patients were identified, and all were immunocompromised. Eight patients had"
		"colonization, while 10 had invasive disease (pneumonia [n = 3], skin and"
		"soft-tissue infections [n = 3], disseminated disease [n = 4]). Scedosporium"
		"apiospermum was identified in 15 patients, Lomentospora prolificans in 2"
		"patients, and Scedosporium ellipsoideum in 1 patient. Fungal elements were"
		"identified histologically in 11 patients. Granulomatous, suppurative, and"
		necrotizing inflammation with irregular branching hyphae and characteristic
		microconidia were observed in 9 cases; conidiogenous cells were identified in 4
		"cases. Seven patients died of invasive disease despite therapy, and 3 recovered"
		after treatment. No deaths were observed in patients with colonization.
		"CONCLUSIONS: Scedosporium and Lomentospora are rare, virulent opportunistic"
		"fungal pathogens. Fungal morphology may overlap with other hyaline molds, but"
		identification of obovoid conidia should allow a diagnosis of non-Aspergillus
		hyalohyphomycosis and consideration of Scedosporium and Lomentospora.
		Histopathologic correlation with culture and polymerase chain reaction is
		critical for diagnosis and treatment.

AB	-	"Mycetoma is a chronic granulomatous infectious disease that can affect the skin,"
		"subcutaneous tissue, fascia and bone. It can be caused by filamentous bacteria or"
		fungi and usually involves the legs and feet. Mycetoma is endemic in tropical and
		subtropical regions and is easily misdiagnosed in clinical practice because of
		its nonspecific clinical features and lack of awareness of the disease. Although
		"mycetoma is very rare in mainland China, an increasing number of cases have been"
		"reported in recent years. Here, we report a case of mycetoma in a patient who was"
		"misdiagnosed many years before receiving the correct treatment, leading to"
		disease progression and motion limitation. The grains that represent
		microorganismal colonies were important clues for diagnosis. We also reviewed
		reported cases of mycetoma in mainland China. The majority of cases were reported
		from southern regions. Actinomycetoma was more commonly reported than was
		eumycetoma. The causative agents of actinomycetoma included Nocardia
		"brasiliensis, N. asteroides, N. otitidiscaviarum, N. ninae and Gordonia terrae,"
		"and the causative fungi of eumycetoma were identified as Madurella mycetomatis,"
		"Fonsecaea pedrosoi and Acremonium falciforme. Notably, the diagnosis of mycetoma"
		"was delayed from months to decades in all of the patients, likely due to a lack"
		of clinical experience. Our literature review suggests the importance of
		"increased awareness of mycetoma in clinical practice, especially in non-endemic"
		regions. Further investigative studies are needed to determine the real incidence
		of the disease in China.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY: Mycetomas are chronic sub-cutaneous tropical infections
		"in which exogenous causative agents, fungal (eumycetes) or bacterial"
		"(actinomycetes), generate grains. The typical presentation is multi-fistulized"
		"pseudotumors. This disease, particularly eumycetoma, is difficult to treat. It is"
		"a major health problem in tropical and subtropical countries. In France, the"
		"disease is rare, but patients have access to a broader range of treatments. The"
		authors had for objective to present the cases of mycetomas diagnosed in
		developed country and their management. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective
		study was made on the clinical presentation and management of mycetomas from 1995
		"to 2011, in the Bobigny Avicenne teaching hospital. RESULTS: Six patient files"
		were studied. The patients were men with a median age of 31 years (16-70). Five
		"patients were from Sub Saharan Africa, one from Sri Lanka. The etiologies were"
		one actinomycetoma and five eumycetomas. There was bone involvement in five
		cases. There was one atypical presentation: a primary intra-osseous mycetoma.
		Three patients were cured including two by surgical management and one by medical
		treatment (actinomycetoma). Antifungal therapy failed (four patients) in every
		"case (voriconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, terbinafine, caspofungin)."
		CONCLUSION: The results of this study made in a non-epidemic zone revealed that
		"despite a typical clinical presentation, the diagnosis and management were"
		delayed because this imported disease is rare in France. The patients received
		"new broad-spectrum triazole and caspofungin, but none were cured with antifungal"
		therapy alone.

AB	-	Mycetoma is a neglected tropical disease endemic in tropical and subtropical
		"countries, particularly Sudan. The disease is characterised by the triad of"
		"painless subcutaneous mass, multiple sinuses and discharge that contain grains."
		"It is a chronic, debilitating disease most commonly affecting the feet or hands"
		"and leads to substantial morbidity, loss of function and even amputation. It"
		"predominantly affects poor, rural populations and patients typically present late"
		with advanced disease and complications. In this descriptive cross-sectional
		"study, we characterise the disabling consequences of mycetoma. The study included"
		300 patients; 228 (76%) male and 72 (24%) female with confirmed mycetoma seen at
		"the Mycetoma Research Centre, University of Khartoum, Sudan in the period May"
		2016 and January 2017. The study design was based upon the International
		"Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, examining the impact of"
		mycetoma on eight life domains. Our major finding is that mycetoma is a
		significantly disabling disease. Over 60% of the study population (181 patients)
		had moderate impairment or difficulty in at least one domain variable. The
		important disability was mobility impairment and walking difficulty that was
		reported in 119 patients (39.7%). There was significant pain associated with
		"mycetoma lesions in 103 patients (34%), challenging the traditional view of"
		mycetoma as a painless disease. The economic burden was also found to be
		"substantial, with 126 patients (46.7%) reporting barriers to their ability to"
		sustain themselves. This is the first study evaluating the disabling consequences
		of mycetoma and shows clear areas for intervention and further research. Options
		for mitigating social and economic impacts include routine integration of
		"analgesia and physiotherapy into treatment protocols, and adapting educational"
		provision and working practices based on disability assessment. Our data show
		that mycetoma is a public health issue with direct implications on quality of
		life.

TI	-	Mycetomas in Iran: a review article.
PG	-	135-41
AB	-	Mycetomas are the subcutaneous and relatively rare chronic pustular infections.
		The etiologic agents of mycetomas are a group of saprophytic fungi and
		actinomycetes living in soil. We retrospectively discussed the overall prevalence
		of mycetomas and the prevalence of infective agents in Iran between 1972 and
		2005. Seventy-six cases of mycetomas have been reported from various geographical
		locations in Iran during 33 years. Analysis of the records revealed that 84.5%
		were actinomycetoma and only 15.5% were eumycetoma. Disease mainly has been seen
		"in foot, and the male to female ratio was 2:1. Mycetomas were abundant among"
		farmers in rural areas of Iran. The commonest agents of mycetomas were Nocardia
		"asteroids, Actinomadura madura (actinomycetoma) and Allesheria boydii"
		(eumycetoma). The peak age of onset was between 31 and 51 years.

		histologically proven fungal infection.
PG	-	851-859
LID	-	10.1111/myc.13325 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Although fungi are found relatively easily by microscopic examination
		"of pathological samples, identification of fungal genus and species in"
		pathological samples is not easy because the morphological features of fungi are
		similar among genera and species. OBJECTIVES: A multiple real-time PCR was
		"developed for identification of fungal genus/species, and morphological"
		characterizations of fungi were analysed in pathological samples.
		PATIENTS/METHODS: Seventy-five formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples
		morphologically proven to contain any fungus were examined. A multiple real-time
		PCR system was developed to identify 25 fungal genus/species in pathological
		samples. Morphology of fungus in the specimens was re-reviewed retrospectively
		based on the results of real-time PCR. RESULTS: Real-time PCR identified fungal
		genus/species in 56 of 75 (74.6%) specimens with histologically proven fungal
		"infection. In 53 specimens of filamentous fungi, Aspergillus spp. (22 specimens),"
		"Cladosporium (8), Scedosporium apiospermum (4), Malassezia sympodialis (1) and"
		Candida albicans (1) were identified. Pseudohyphae of Candida were confused with
		filamentous fungus in a case. Morphological observation suggested differences in
		"the presence of septated or non-septated hyphae, the filament size, and the"
		"branch angle among genus/species of filamentous fungi; however, genus/species was"
		not able to be determined by their morphological features. In 22 specimens of
		"yeasts, real-time PCR allowed for the identification of Candida albicans (12"
		"specimens), Candida glabrata (2), Cladosporium (2), Scedosporium apiospermum (2),"
		Pichia kudriavzevii (1) and Aspergillus sydowii (1). CONCLUSIONS: These data
		suggest that it is difficult to identify fungal genus/species by morphological
		features alone. Real-time PCR is useful to identify fungal genus/species in
		pathological samples.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Mycetoma is an uncommon chronic granulomatous infection of cutaneous
		and subcutaneous tissues that can be caused by filamentous bacteria
		(actinomycetoma) or fungi (eumycetoma). It is the prerogative of young men
		between the third and fourth decade and is transmitted through any trauma causing
		an inoculating point. The classic clinical triad associates a painless hard and
		"swelling subcutaneous mass, multiple fistulas, and the pathognomonic discharge of"
		"grains. Although endemic in many tropical and subtropical countries, mycetoma can"
		"also be found in non-endemic areas as in Morocco, and causes then diagnosis"
		"problems leading to long lasting complications. Therefore, we should raise"
		awareness of this neglected disease for an earlier management. Under medical
		"treatment however, mycetoma has a slow healing and surgery is often needed, and"
		relapses are possible. CASE PRESENTATION: Herein we report a case of a 64 years
		"old patient, with a history of eumycetoma occurring ten years ago treated with"
		oral terbinafine coupled with surgery. A complete remission was seen after
		2 years. He presented a relapse on the previous scar 6 months ago. There wasn't
		any bone involvement in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The patient was put
		under oral terbinafine with a slow but positive outcome. CONCLUSION: Through this
		"case report, we perform a literature review and highlight the importance of"
		increase awareness of mycetoma in clinical practice especially in non-endemic
		regions.

		Literature.
PG	-	1355-1361
LID	-	10.4269/ajtmh.16-0710 [doi]
AB	-	AbstractMycetoma is a chronic soft tissue infection caused by fungal or bacterial
		"pathogens, and is endemic in tropical and subtropical regions. Cases in developed"
		countries outside the mycetoma belt are rare and usually imported by immigrants.
		Sporadic cases have been reported in Israel. Unpublished cases in the
		"participating medical centers are reported. In addition, a systematic review of"
		the literature was performed. All published mycetoma cases diagnosed in Israel
		were included with relevant variables collected. Twenty-one cases of mycetoma
		"were diagnosed in Israel between 1942 and 2015, including four unpublished cases"
		"and 17 published cases. The mean age at diagnosis was 42 years (range 23-73), and"
		16 of the patients were male. The foot was the primary involved organ. Fifteen
		"patients were immigrants from Yemen, Ethiopia, and Sudan. Five cases were"
		autochthonous. One case was travel related. Among patients who developed symptoms
		"after immigration, the mean time from exposure to symptom onset was 5.6 years"
		(range 1-10 years). The mean time from symptom onset to diagnosis was 6.6 years
		(range 0.2-35 years). The autochthonous cases demonstrate that Israel is endemic
		of mycetoma. The immigrant population represents two distinct waves of
		immigration to Israel in the past century. Two unpublished cases of Ethiopian
		immigrants are the first reported cases of mycetoma acquired in Ethiopia. The
		diagnostic and therapeutic challenges along with the epidemiological data
		emphasize the need of raising the awareness of physicians to this devastating
		condition even in developed countries.

TI	-	Reporting of mycetoma cases from skin and soft tissue biopsies over a period of
		ten years: A single center report and literature review from Pakistan.
PG	-	e0010607
LID	-	10.1371/journal.pntd.0010607 [doi]
LID	-	e0010607
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Mycetoma is an important neglected tropical disease associated with
		"debilitation, disfigurement and death if not diagnosed and treated adequately. In"
		"Pakistan, mycetoma cases have frequently been diagnosed in histopathology and"
		"microbiology laboratories. However, there is scarcity of published data from this"
		"country. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to evaluate the frequency"
		and type of mycetoma reported in skin and soft tissue biopsies from a single
		center over 10 years and review of published literature from Pakistan. METHOD:
		This descriptive observational retrospective study was conducted at the Aga Khan
		"University Hospital laboratory, Karachi, Pakistan. Laboratory data from 2009-2018"
		of skin and soft tissue biopsies with positive findings of mycetoma were
		retrieved from hospital information system. The variables for statistical
		"analysis were age and gender of patient, anatomical site of lesion, residence of"
		"patient (geographical location) in the country, etiologic agents of mycetoma and"
		significant gross and microscopic histopathological findings. The data was
		"entered, and descriptive epidemiologic assessment was carried out using MS excel"
		2013. Geographical information system was used for mapping the location.
		"Literature review of mycetoma cases reported from Pakistan was done on PubMed,"
		Google search and PakMediNet from 1980 till April 2019. RESULT: During ten years
		"of study period, 89 skin and soft tissue biopsies were reported as mycetoma,"
		majority were eumycetoma [n = 66/89 (74%)] followed by actinomycetoma [n = 23/89
		(26%)]. Involvement of lower limb was predominantly observed [n = 74/89 (83%)] in
		which foot had significant contribution [n = 65/74 (88%)]. Only 18 specimens were
		"submitted for microbiological assessment and six grew agents of mycetoma, with"
		Madurella mycetomatis reported in only three. Well-formed granuloma formation was
		observed in only 26%[n = 23/89] of cases. Specific geographical location was not
		"identified, and cases were reported from across the country. From Pakistan, only"
		two original papers and 7 case reports were available in published literature.
		CONCLUSION: This single center study reports a handful of cases of mycetoma from
		Pakistan. We conclude that the index of suspicion should remain high among
		treating surgeons and physicians and clinical laboratories should improve their
		diagnostic capacity and skills. This will have a great impact on disease outcome
		and patient's life.

PG	-	e0008240

LID	-	e0008240
AB	-	"Mycetoma is considered a neglected tropical disease globally. However, data on"
		its burden and the associated complications in Uganda are limited. Hence we aimed
		"to estimate its burden in Uganda. Firstly, a systematic PubMed search for all"
		studies of any design on mycetoma in Uganda without restriction to the year of
		publication was conducted. A retrospective review of all the biopsy reports at
		"the Pathology Reference Laboratory, Department of Pathology, Makerere University,"
		"Kampala, Uganda from January 1950 to September 2019 was conducted to identify any"
		"reports on mycetoma histological diagnosis. During the 70-years study period, 30"
		"cases were identified by the literature review, with 249 additional cases"
		identified by review of biopsy reports (total of 279 cases). The average
		"incidence was estimated at 0.32/100,000 persons and prevalence of 8.32/100,000"
		"persons per decade. However, there was a general decline in the number of cases"
		detected recently. Males and the age group of 21-30 years were the most affected
		"by mycetoma in Uganda, and only 7% of the cases were children. The highest number"
		of cases was recorded from Kampala (n = 30) and Jinja (n = 19) districts. The
		majority of the cases (68%) were referred from surgical units. The foot was the
		most affected part of the body (72%). Ten per cent of the cases had bone
		involvement of which 58% required amputation. Fungi were the most common
		causative agents (89%) followed by Nocardia species (5%) and Actinomycetes (4%).
		The index of clinical suspicion of mycetoma was low (45%) with a very large
		"differential diagnosis. Mycetoma is a relatively rare disease in Uganda, mostly"
		"caused by fungi, and there is a big gap in data and epidemiological studies. More"
		systematic studies are warranted to define the true burden of mycetoma in Uganda.

TI	-	Madurella mycetomatis infection of the buttock in an Eritrean refugee in
		Switzerland: a case report.
PG	-	32
LID	-	10.1186/s13256-018-1962-y [doi]
LID	-	32
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Mycetoma is a neglected infectious disease caused by a fungus
		(eumycetoma) or bacteria (actinomycetoma); it is characterized by chronic local
		inflammation with sinus formation and purulent discharge. Its course can be quite
		devastating because of the difficulty in diagnosing the infection and in
		eliminating the causative agent. Although endemic in many countries in the
		"tropics and subtropics, the migration of Africans to Europe may increase the"
		presence of this neglected disease in European countries. We present a case of an
		Eritrean patient living in a non-endemic country who was diagnosed as having an
		infection of Madurella mycetomatis in an atypical location in his body. CASE
		PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 35-year-old African male refugee from
		"Eritrea, living in Switzerland since 2015, who presented with a 1-year history of"
		a painful soft tissue swelling associated with dark nodules in his right buttock.
		He mentioned having several previous surgeries after 2001 while he was in Eritrea
		"due to recurrent abscess formation on this body area. In the previous months, the"
		swelling had become more significant and nodules started draining a purulent
		fluid. An initial diagnostic hypothesis of buttock abscess was made and he was
		referred to a dermatologist for diagnostic confirmation and further specialist
		"care due to the size and atypical presentation. After a punch biopsy, the"
		diagnosis of eumycetoma was confirmed and cultures developed Madurella
		mycetomatis. The initial treatment approach consisted of oral treatment by
		"itraconazole; however, a surgical resection of the lesions was finally needed."
		"CONCLUSIONS: Although rare, mycetoma should be diagnosed as early as possible to"
		avoid long-lasting complications. Primary care physicians in European countries
		are frequently in the first line of care of migrant patients and therefore should
		be aware of the common and uncommon clinical presentations of mycetoma.

TI	-	Madura foot in Europe: diagnosis of an autochthonous case by molecular approach
		and review of the literature.
PG	-	156-9
AB	-	Madura foot is a chronic granulomatous infection of the soft-tissue of the foot
		and it is endemic in tropical and subtropical countries. Some cases have also
		been reported in local people or migrants in temperate countries. The
		microbiological diagnosis requires prolonged bacterial cultures in aerobic and
		"anaerobic conditions, but the use of the molecular approach could be helpful for"
		an early and rapid diagnosis. We describe an autochthonous case of Actinomadura
		madurae foot infection in an Italian woman. The diagnosis was achieved 36 months
		after symptoms onset by PCR detection and sequencing of 16S rDNA directly on
		"biopsy. She started therapy with rifampin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and"
		amikacin. After 3 months the pain had disappeared and the swelling subsided. We
		reviewed the literature on Madura foot due to bacterial causative agents in
		"Europe and observed that the median time from onset to diagnosis is high,"
		possibly due to several factors like the difficulties of the microbiological and
		radiological diagnosis. Our case report and the review of literature point out
		"that the implementation of a surveillance system, the involvement of an"
		"infectious diseases specialist, with experience in tropical diseases, and the"
		availability of a microbiology unit to perform feasible and rapid molecular
		diagnostic tests could result in an earlier diagnosis and an optimal antibiotic
		"therapy of this rare but difficult-to-treat and, above all, difficult-to-diagnose"
		infection.

AB	-	"""Madura foot"" or pedal mycetoma is a rare destructive infection of the skin and"
		"subcutaneous tissues of the foot, progressing to involve muscle and bone. The"
		infection can be caused by both bacteria and fungi. Infection typically follows
		"traumatic implantation of bacteria or fungal spores, which are present in soil or"
		"on plant material. Clinically, this entity can be difficult to diagnose and can"
		have an indolent and progressive course. Early diagnosis is important to prevent
		"patient morbidity and mortality. We present two cases of pedal mycetoma, review"
		"the literature, review new developments in diagnosis, and discuss magnetic"
		resonance imaging (MRI) features of this unusual entity.

AB	-	Mycetoma is a pathological process in which eumycotic (fungal) or actinomycotic
		causative agents from exogenous source produce grains. It is a localized chronic
		"and deforming infectious disease of subcutaneous tissue, skin and bones. We"
		report the first case of eumycetoma of the oral cavity in world literature. CASE
		"REPORT: A 43-year-old male patient, complaining of swelling and fistula in the"
		"hard palate. On examination, swelling of the anterior and middle hard palate,"
		with fistula draining a dark liquid was observed. The panoramic radiograph showed
		extensive radiolucent area involving the region of teeth 21-26 and the
		"computerized tomography showed communication with the nasal cavity, suggesting"
		the diagnosis of periapical cyst. Surgery was performed to remove the lesion.
		Histopathological examination revealed purulent material with characteristic
		grain. Gram staining for bacteria was negative and Grocott-Gomori staining for
		"the detection of fungi was positive, concluding the diagnosis of eumycetoma. The"
		"patient was treated with ketoconazole for nine months, and was considered cured"
		"at the end of treatment. CONCLUSION: Histopathological examination, using"
		"histochemical staining, and direct microscopic grains examination can provide the"
		distinction between eumycetoma and actinomycetoma accurately.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Mycetoma is the most common neglected disease in humans. It is a
		"chronic, progressive, and destructive disease primarily caused by fungi or"
		"bacteria characterized by formation of dark pale grains commonly involve skin,"
		soft tissue and rarely bone. CASE PRESENTATION: A 19 year old male patient with
		"chronic right ankle pain, swelling and abscess formation for more than 1 year,"
		patient was treated repeatedly with incision and drainage without any success. No
		"X-ray, biopsy or swab for culture and sensitivity had been considered through the"
		course of presentation. Patient was referred to Omdurman hospital where
		osteomyelitis secondary euomycetoma infection has been confirmed based on
		radiological and pathological assessment. Patient was treated surgically with
		aggressive debridement and bone curettage plus postoperative Itraconazole for
		1 year. CONCLUSION: Clinicians must consider osteomyelitis as important
		differential diagnosis during initial assessment Eumycetoma infection in adults.
		Aggressive bone curettage followed by regular X-ray follow up can be limb saving
		procedure in such cases.

AB	-	Eumycetoma is a morbid chronic granulomatous subcutaneous fungal disease. Despite
		"high environmental exposure to this fungus in certain regions of the world, only"
		few develop eumycetoma for yet unknown reasons. Animal studies suggest that
		co-infections skewing the immune system to a Th2-type response enhance eumycetoma
		susceptibility. Since chronic schistosomiasis results in a strong Th2-type
		response and since endemic areas for eumycetoma and schistosomiasis do regionally
		"overlap, we performed a serological case-control study to identify an association"
		"between eumycetoma and schistosomiasis. Compared to endemic controls, eumycetoma"
		patients were significantly more often sero-positive for schistosomiasis
		"(p = 0.03; odds ratio 3.2, 95% CI 1.18-8.46), but not for toxoplasmosis, an"
		"infection inducing a Th1-type response (p = 0.6; odds ratio 1.5, 95% CI"
		"0.58-3.83). Here, we show that schistosomiasis is correlated to susceptibility"
		for a fungal disease for the first time.

		patients with chronic pulmonary disease. While Scedosporium prolificans is
		"resistant to most antimycotics, Scedosporium apiospermum is usually sensitive to"
		voriconazole and posaconazole. Pharmacokinetics and efficacy of nebulized
		voriconazole have been described in a murine model previously. We report for the

AB	-	Australia-wide population-based surveillance for scedosporiosis identified 180
		"cases, with 118 (65.6%) cases of colonization and 62 (34.4%) cases of infection."
		Predisposing factors for isolation of Scedosporium spp. included chronic lung
		disease in 37.8% and malignancy in 21.7% of cases. Predictors of invasive disease
		"(n=62) included haematological stem cell transplantation (n=7), leukaemia (n=16)"
		"and diabetes mellitus (n=8). Of 183 phenotypically-speciated isolates, 75 (41%)"
		"were Scedosporium prolificans (risk factors: haematologic cancer (n=17),"
		neutropaenia (n=14)) and 108 (59%) had Scedosporium apiospermum/Pseudallescheria
		boydii phenotype [risk factor: diabetes (n=15)]. Scedosporium prolificans (p
		0.01) and leukaemia (p 0.03) independently predicted death. Epidemiological and
		antifungal susceptibility profiles of Scedosporium aurantiacum
		(prevalence>or=15.8%) and S. apiospermum were similar. No patient with S.
		aurantiacum infection (n=6) died. This is the first description of clinical
		features associated with S. aurantiacum.

AB	-	This is a case report of a 42-year-old woman who presented to a clinic with a
		history of progressive left foot and ankle swelling. She had a suspected history
		"of myectoma, but had never been officially diagnosed despite repeated cultures"
		and debridements over the course of decades. The inciting event occurred
		approximately 30 years prior in her home country of Belize. Her wound culture
		revealed Scedosporium apiospermum as the causative agent. Treatment included
		surgical debridement and oral antifungal therapy. This case represents an
		"interesting adjunct to the differential diagnosis for military physicians, as"
		mycetomas are prevalent in many of the areas where our forces are deployed and
		may only present after the service member has left active service because of its
		naturally indolent course.

		and bacterial pathogens. Correct diagnosis to the species level is mandatory for
		"proper treatment. In endemic areas, various diagnostic tests and techniques are"
		"in use to achieve that, and that includes grain culture, surgical biopsy"
		"histopathological examination, fine needle aspiration cytological (FNAC)"
		examination and in certain centres molecular diagnosis such as PCR. In this
		"retrospective study, the sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of"
		"grain culture, surgical biopsy histopathological examination and FNAC to identify"
		the mycetoma causative organisms were determined. The histopathological
		examination appeared to have better sensitivity and specificity. The histological
		examination results were correct in 714 (97.5%) out of 750 patients infected with
		"Madurella mycetomatis, in 133 (93.6%) out of 142 patients infected with"
		"Streptomyces somaliensis, in 53 (74.6%) out of 71 patients infected with"

		"patients with Madurella mycetomatis eumycetoma, in 50 (37.5%) out of 133"
		"Streptomyces somaliensis patients, 43 (60.5%) out of 71 Actinomadura madurae"
		patients and 11 (68.7%) out of 16 Actinomadura pelletierii. The mean time
		"required to obtain the FNAC result was one day, and for the histopathological"
		"examinations results it was 3.5 days, and for grain it was a mean of 16 days. In"
		"conclusion, histopathological examination and FNAC are more practical techniques"
		for rapid species identification than grain culture in many endemic regions.

		to Madurella mycetomatis Mycetoma--A Retrospective Study.
PG	-	e0004061
LID	-	10.1371/journal.pntd.0004061 [doi]
LID	-	e0004061
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Madurella mycetomatis is the most prevalent causative agent of
		"eumycetoma in Sudan, an infection characterized by the formation of grains. Many"
		"patients are exposed to the causative agent, however only a small number develop"
		"infection. M. mycetomatis contains chitin in its cell wall, which can trigger the"
		human immune system. Polymorphisms in the genes encoding for the chitin-degrading
		"enzymes chitotriosidase and AMCase were described, resulting in altered chitinase"
		activity. We investigated the association between 4 of these polymorphisms and
		the incidence of M. mycetomatis mycetoma in a Sudanese population. METHODOLOGY:
		Polymorphisms studied in 112 eumycetoma patients and 103 matched controls
		"included a 24-bp insertion in the chitotriosidase gene (rs3831317), resulting in"
		impaired chitinase activity and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the
		"AMCase gene (rs61756687), resulting in decreased AMCase activity. Also, a SNP"
		(rs41282492) and a 10-bp insertion in the 5'UTR region of the AMCase gene
		"(rs143789088) were studied, both resulting in increased AMCase activity. DNA was"
		isolated from blood and genotypes were determined using PCR-RFLP. PRINCIPAL
		FINDINGS: Histological staining proved the presence of chitin in the fungal
		grain. The polymorphism resulting in decreased chitotriosidase activity was
		associated with increased odds of eumycetoma (odds ratio 2.9; p = 0.004). No
		association was found for the polymorphisms in the genes for AMCase (all p>0.05).
		CONCLUSION: Decreased chitotriosidase activity was associated with increased risk
		of M. mycetomatis mycetoma.

TI	-	Geographical distribution of mycetoma cases in senegal over a period of 18 years.
PG	-	250-256
LID	-	10.1111/myc.13037 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Mycetoma is a pathological process in which fungal or actinomycotic
		agents of exogenous origin produce grains. In the absence of data on the global
		"burden, it is important to map mycetoma cases, which are useful to implement"
		control strategies. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to map mycetoma
		cases diagnosed in Senegal over a period of eighteen years. METHODOLOGY: The
		cases of mycetoma identified in the laboratory of Mycology at Aristide Le Dantec
		Hospital were extracted from the notebooks; information on the dates of
		"collection, geographical origin and fungal agent identified was entered in Excel"
		and analysed. RESULTS: Three hundred and thirty-seven cases of mycetoma were
		diagnosed from 1993 to 2016 at Aristide Le Dantec Hospital. Mapping shows that
		"overall, the western zone presented the majority of cases 47% (120), followed,"
		"respectively, by the central zone 32% (80), the northern zone 18% (47) and the"
		"southern zone 2% (6). However, over the years, this distribution is different"
		with a decrease in cases from the periods 1993-2000 and 2011-2016 of 19% in the
		"western and a progressive increase of cases in northern and central zones of,"
		"respectively, 13% and 14%. In the 1990s, the cases were predominant in Dakar,"
		"Louga and Diourbel. During 2011-2016, Thies, Diourbel, Fouta and Louga presented"
		more cases. CONCLUSION: The spatial distribution of mycetoma in Senegal changed
		"over the years, most frequent in the west of the country, and during 1993 to"
		"2000, mycetoma is now more common in the north."

TI	-	Scedosporium apiospermum chorioretinitis.
PG	-	540-2
AB	-	PURPOSE: A case of a 24-year-old immunocompetent woman who developed unilateral
		Scedosporium apiospermum chorioretinitis and diffuse cervical lymphadenitis 10
		years after facial steroid injection is described. METHODS: The patient was
		initially treated for the misdiagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis.
		"Contemporaneous to the enlargement of her lymph nodes, she experienced gradual"
		loss of vision in her left eye. She subsequently underwent lymph node biopsy.
		RESULTS: Histopathologic sections stained with Grocott's methenamine silver
		showed branched septate hyphae and cultures on Sabouraud's agar yielded
		Scedosporium apiospermum. The patient received oral itraconazole 200 mg twice
		daily. Lymphadenitis regressed within a year and chorioretinitis scarred within
		two years. CONCLUSION: Scedosporium apiospermum may cause isolated
		chorioretinitis in an immunocompetent individual years after local surgery or
		trauma and result in significant visual morbidity. Treatment may require
		prolonged use of systemic itraconazole.

PG	-	1044-1052
LID	-	10.1093/mmy/myaa018 [doi]
AB	-	"Fungal infections cause substantial morbidity and mortality. However, the burden"
		of deep fungal infections is not well described in Uganda. We aimed to estimate
		the burden and etiology of histologically diagnosed deep fungal infections in
		Uganda. We retrospectively reviewed histology reports at the Pathology Reference
		"Laboratory, Department of Pathology, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda from"
		January 1950 to September 2019 to identify any reports that had a fungal
		"infection as the diagnosis. Over the study period, 697 cases of deep fungal"
		"infections were identified with an average incidence of 0.73/100,000 persons per"
		decade. There was a general decline in the number of cases detected. Median age
		of the cases was 28 years (IQR: 11-40) and majority (59%) were male. The age
		group of 0-10 years were the most affected. The foot was the most affected part
		"of the body (26%). Deep mycoses identified include eumycetoma (32%), subcutaneous"
		"phycomycosis (26%), histoplasmosis (9.2%), chromoblastomycosis (4.6%),"
		"aspergillosis (3.3%), cryptococcosis (3.3%), blastomycosis (1.6%), subcutaneous"
		"mycosis (1.4%), dermatomycosis (1.3%), coccidioidomycosis (0.6%), mucormycosis"
		"(0.6%), and sporotrichosis (0.1%). Histoplasma was the commonest causative agent"
		"(9.2%) followed by Aspergillus (3.4%) and Cryptococcus (3.3%), while 81% of the"
		fungal pathogens were not identified to genus/species level. Only 31% of the
		cases were diagnosed clinically as deep fungal infections. There is a substantial
		burden of deep fungal infections caused by multiple fungal pathogens in Uganda.
		There is need to build local capacity for mycology so as to improve on the index
		of clinical suspicion and diagnostic capabilities.

LID	-	e3271
AB	-	"Patients with mycetoma usually present late with advanced disease, which is"
		"attributed to lack of medical and health facilities in endemic areas, poor health"
		"education and low socio-economic status. With this background, an integrated"
		patient management model at the village level was designed to address the various
		problems associated with mycetoma. The model was launched in an endemic village
		"in the Sudan, between 2010 and 2013. This model is described in a prospective,"
		"descriptive, community-based study, aimed to collect epidemiological, ecological,"
		"and clinical data and to assess knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) in order"
		"to design effective and efficient management measures. In this study, the"
		"prevalence of mycetoma was 14.5 per 1,000 inhabitants. The patients were farmers,"
		"housewives and children of low socio-economic status, and no obvious risk group"
		was detected. All had surgery performed in a mobile surgical unit in the village
		which encouraged patients to present early with small early lesion leading to a
		"good clinical outcome. The close contact with the Acacia tree thorns, animals and"
		"animal dung, walking bare footed and practising poor hygiene may all have"
		contributed to the development of mycetoma in the village. Knowledge of mycetoma
		"was poor in 96.3% of the study population, 70% had appropriate attitudes and"
		"beliefs towards interaction with mycetoma patients and treatment methods, and 49%"
		used satisfactory or good practices in the management of mycetoma. Knowledge and
		practices on mycetoma were found to be significantly associated with age. Based
		"on the KAP and epidemiological data, several health education sessions were"
		conducted in the village for different target groups. The integrated management
		approach adopted in this study is unique and appeared successful and seems
		"suitable as an immediate intervention. While for the longer term, establishment"
		of local health facilities with trained health staff remains a priority.

AB	-	"Herein, we describe a fatal case of central nervous system (CNS)"
		"pseudallescheriasis following near-drowning. A 13-year-old boy, who had been"
		"successfully resuscitated after near-drowning, presented with a transient episode"
		of mental confusion during a hospital stay after recovering from severe
		aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
		scan of the brain showed a small brain abscess in the left basal ganglia and
		ventriculitis in the left lateral ventricle. The brain abscess and ventriculitis
		did not respond to 4 weeks of antibiotic treatment and appeared even worse on a
		follow-up MRI. A diagnosis of CNS pseudallescheriasis was only possible with
		invasive stereotactic biopsy and aspiration of the abscess that showed the
		presence of hyphae and Scedosporium apiospermum. CNS pseudallescheriasis did not
		"respond to multiple combinations of antifungal agents, including amphotericin B,"
		"isoconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole. Two ventricular drainages and"
		insertion of Ommaya reservoirs with intraventricular injection of voriconazole
		were insufficient to halt the infection. The patient passed away from sudden
		septic shock 2 months after identification of the brain abscess and
		ventriculitis. The patient's diagnosis was delayed because multiple examinations
		of the cerebrospinal fluid did not show positive cultures and could only be
		obtained from the aspirates of stereotactic biopsy. Physicians should be aware of
		CNS pseudallescheriasis associated with near-drowning because of the difficulty
		of diagnosis and the high mortality rate (70%) owing to poor responses to
		currently available antifungal agents.

		microbiologically at Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine. Retrospective analysis
		of the records revealed that the ratio of actinomycetomas and eumycetomas was 197
		: 67; the male to female ratio was 183 : 81. Ninety-four cases occurred in the
		"1980s and 170 in 1990s, with significantly more infections of Actinomadura spp."
		(P < 0.01) and fewer with Nocardia caviae (P < 0.01) during the last decade.
		Pricking was the most common injury associated with eumycetomas (P < 0.01). A
		total of 196 infections were in exposed body parts and 68 in covered areas. The
		"localization of mycetomas differed significantly (P < 0.01) according to sex,"
		"incidence of actinomycetomas or eumycetomas, and obvious history of trauma."
		"Exposed area cases were more common among agricultural workers (P < 0.01), while"
		covered area mycetomas were almost always actinomycetomas with a remarkably lower
		"incidence of N. caviae, A. madurae and Madurella grisea infections. The peak age"
		of onset was between 16 and 25 years. The delay of diagnosis for the 80th
		percentile of cases was around 6 years for cases caused by N. brasiliensis and
		Streptomyces spp.; 8 years for N. caviae and N. asteroides; and 10 years for M.
		"grisea and Actinomadura spp. From the history of trauma in 130 patients, the 80th"
		"percentile incubation period (IP) was calculated for N. brasiliensis, N. caviae"
		and N. asteroides as 3 years; for Actinomadura spp. 7 years and for M. grisea 9
		years. The minimum IP for all organisms was around 3 months.

		Case report.
PG	-	83-7
AB	-	Scedosporium apiospermum is a fungus found in the soil and in contaminated water.
		"Common cutaneous manifestations include Madura foot, a painless swelling on the"
		sole of the foot. Invasive infection is usually associated with
		immunosuppression. The authors present a 16-month-old immunocompetent boy who had
		"a near-drowning event. Following this, he was severely disabled with spastic"
		quadriparesis. Early computerized tomography scans revealed diffuse hypoxic
		injury. Magnetic resonance images obtained 3 months after the initial event
		demonstrated multiple ring-enhancing lesions in the brain. Aspiration of the
		"lesion was performed. Scedosporium apiospermum, the asexual form of"
		"Pseudallescheria boydii, was cultured. Conventional antifungal agents were"
		"commenced, with minimal effect. The child was subsequently treated with a new"
		"antifungal agent, voriconazole, a broad-spectrum triazole antifungal agent with"
		"good penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid. The patient improved, with a good"
		radiological outcome and a moderate clinical outcome. The authors review the use
		of voriconazole for central nervous system infections and review the literature
		on S. apiospermum associated with near drowning.

AB	-	"Mycetoma, also commonly referred to as Madura foot, is statistically rare in the"

		"pseudotumor characterized by a triad of tumefaction, draining sinuses, and"

		"require different treatment approaches. Therefore, the exact diagnosis and"
		culture of the organism is vital to successful treatment outcomes. Synovial
		"sarcoma, in contrast, is a malignancy much more commonly seen in the United"
		"States. It is characterized by a well-circumscribed, often palpable, mass that is"
		usually well delineated on magnetic resonance imaging. It has characteristic
		histologic and genetic features that help distinguish it from other soft tissue
		masses. We present a case of a soft tissue mass diagnosed in the United States.
		The patient had several clinical and radiographic features of synovial sarcoma
		but the histologic outcome was mycetoma. The case is followed by a review of the

		Report of a Case and Review of Literature.
PG	-	277-288
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-020-00524-y [doi]
AB	-	Eumycetomas are chronic suppurative granulomas caused by fungi characterised by
		"invasive tumefactive lesions, sinuses and discharging grains. Herein, we describe"
		a case of pedal eumycetoma due to Fusarium solani sensu stricto in a person with
		diabetes mellitus. A 45-year-old gentleman presented with an insidious onset
		swelling over his right foot with nodules and discharging grains. He had received
		"itraconazole and anti-tuberculous therapy elsewhere, without response."
		Re-evaluation included a biopsy which confirmed eumycetoma and newly diagnosed
		"diabetes. Surgical excision followed by histopathological, microbiological and"
		"multigene sequencing analyses [translation elongation factor, calmodulin and"
		internal transcribed spacer region of rDNA] of the mould on culture were
		performed. Histopathology revealed septate fungal hyphae amidst a dense
		inflammatory infiltrate (Splendore-Hoeppli) reaction. Oral voriconazole was
		started and good glycemic control attained. Tissue growth sequences showed > 99%
		similarity with Fusarium solani sensu stricto. Antifungal susceptibility testing
		showed lowest MIC to voriconazole (0.5 mg/L). The patient showed excellent
		response to combined therapeutic modality with a near-complete resolution in size
		of lesion and obliteration of sinuses following 4 months of therapy and is
		planned for prolonged voriconazole therapy till complete radiological resolution.
		Diabetes predisposes to fungal infections of foot but eumycetomas are uncommon.
		Combined surgery and antifungals can improve morbidity and avoid amputations.

		review of treatment.
PG	-	519-23
AB	-	PURPOSE: We report our experience in treating two cases of Scedosporium
		apiospermum keratitis and provide a review of basic scientific and clinical data
		regarding the treatment of this visually devastating disease. METHOD: We present
		a case report and literature review. RESULTS: A 35-year-old woman and a
		"73-year-old man both reported pain, redness, and a foreign body sensation in the"
		eye after trauma. They were initially treated with antibacterials. When cultures
		"were positive for S. apiospermum, the first patient was treated with fluconazole"
		and amphotericin with good results. The second was treated with fluconazole and
		"natamycin, but the infection persisted and the eye was eventually enucleated."
		Review of the literature showed variable responsiveness of S. apiospermum to
		antifungal treatment. CONCLUSIONS: It is difficult to predict how S. apiospermum
		"keratitis will respond to treatment, but miconazole appears to be useful in"
		conjunction with other antifungals. Voriconazole shows promise as an effective
		alternative.

PG	-	167-170
AB	-	"Mycetoma (or ""madura foot"") is characterized by deformation, cutaneous lesions,"
		"infection of tissues extending from the cutaneous layer to the underlying fascia,"
		and an indolent course. A number of fungal or bacterial agents that are
		"introduced through traumatic inoculation can be responsible for the disease, but"
		Actinomadura madurae is among the most common agents of mycetoma occurring
		worldwide. We report a case of madura foot caused by A. madurae in an
		immunocompetent young Somali man who was admitted with a diagnosis of skin and
		soft tissue infection of the left foot with osteomyelitis. The present report
		"emphasizes the importance of the knowledge of this infection, which is sporadic"
		"but problematic to treat and, above all, difficult to diagnose. Moreover, a"
		multidisciplinary approach with involvement of an infectious diseases specialist
		with experience in tropical diseases and a microbiology unit performing rapid
		molecular diagnostic tests is required for early diagnosis and an optimal
		antibiotic therapy.

AB	-	"Mycetoma is a chronic granulomatous infection of skin and subcutaneous tissue,"
		which may involve bone. The disease is caused by true fungi (eumycetoma) or
		filamentous bacteria (actinomycetoma). Both types of organism are important soil
		"saprophytes, and therefore infection is normally acquired by traumatic"
		"inoculation of the skin by contaminated material. Clinically, mycetomas are"
		"characterized by tumefaction, draining sinuses and discharging grains. The grains"
		"are aggregates of fungal hyphae or bacterial filaments, and grain size, colour"
		and consistency provide the initial clue to the causative organism. To our
		"knowledge, this probably is the first case report of oral eumycetoma of infancy."
		Review of literature shows only ten cases of eumycetoma involving the head and
		"neck, including the present case. Histological examinations of the biopsies were"
		the cornerstone in the diagnosis of mycetoma. The distinction between eumycetoma
		and actinomycetoma is essential for treatment. Direct microscopic examination of
		"the grain and histopathological examination, using histochemical staining will"

AB	-	"Mycetoma, well known as ""Madura foot,"" is a long-standing granulomatous infection"
		of the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Causative organisms are filamentous fungi
		(eumycetes) and bacteria (actinomycetes). It characteristically presents with
		"firm woody swelling, discharging sinuses with grains (containing the causative"
		organism). Diagnosis in suspected cases can be made by microbiological
		"evaluation, histopathological, cytological and radio imaging techniques. To"
		differentiate between eumycetoma and actinomycetes histopathology is an accurate
		diagnostic modality as seen in the present case. We report a case of 42 years
		male who presented with swelling on his back with discharging sinus.
		"Histopathological specimen containing multiple, irregular, greyish, whitish"
		tissue pieces with skin attached all together measuring around 12×9×4 cm from the
		paraspinal region. The section shows histopathological features suggestive of
		"eumycetoma. Periodic acid -Schiff stain showed the presence of septate, branching"
		fungal hyphae and black granules. Eumycetoma can be accurately diagnosed by
		histopathological evaluation using a special stain. It is confirmatory and
		provides a guide for treatment plans with a high index of suspicion.

TI	-	Epidemiology of invasive fungal infections in lung transplant recipients in
		Western Australia.
PG	-	e13085
LID	-	10.1111/tid.13085 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Invasive fungal infections (IFI) are common after lung
		transplantation with reported incidence of 8.1% to 16% at 12 months
		"post-transplant, and 3-month all-cause mortality after IFI of 21.7%. METHODS: We"
		performed a retrospective study of IFI and fungal colonization in lung
		transplants (LTs) from November 2004 to February 2017. RESULTS: 137 LTs were
		followed for a median 4.1 years (IQR 2.1-6.2 years). In addition to nebulized
		"amphotericin for the transplant admission to all LTs, systemic mold-active azole"
		"was given to 80/130 (61.5%) LTs in the first 6 months post-transplant, 57/121"
		"(47.1%) in the period 6-12 months after transplant, and 93/124 (75%) in the"
		period more than 12 months post-transplant. Mold airways colonization was found
		in 81 (59.1%) LTs before and 110 (80.3%) LTs after transplantation. There were 13
		"IFIs for an overall incidence of 2.1 per 100 person-years, occurring at a median"
		"583 days (IQR 182-1110 days) post-transplant, a cumulative incidence of 3.8% at"
		"1 year, 7.6% at 3 years and 10.1% at 5 years post-transplant. All-cause 3-month"
		mortality after IFI was 7.7%. Aspergillus species followed by Scedosporium
		apiospermum and Cryptococcus species were the commonest fungi causing IFI.
		"CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort the rate of IFI was comparatively low, likely because"
		of comprehensive early antifungal use and preemptive therapy at any time after
		transplant. Prospective studies of fungal colonization late after LT are required
		to determine the risks and benefits of watchful waiting compared to preemptive
		therapy.

AB	-	"INTRODUCTION: Mycetoma is a chronic disease, which is endemic in tropical and"
		subtropical countries. We report a rare case of mycetoma located on the foot of a
		patient living in a temperate-climate country followed by a short discussion.
		OBSERVATION: A 50-year-old woman with painless swelling in her left foot. The
		swelling started after a banal penetrating injury on the sole of her left foot 23
		years ago. X-rays images showed multiple osteolytic lesions of the tarsus. The
		histological analyses identified the fungus madurella mycetomatis. The treatment
		was radical surgery (amputation). The patient had a tibial prosthesis and
		recovered an autonomous gait. DISCUSSION: Mycetoma is a chronic granulomatous
		inflammatory response often with sinus tract formations due to fungal or
		bacterial organisms. The infection of the forefoot is quite typical. It is a
		slowly progressing disease affecting the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissues
		that can extent to the underlying bones. CONCLUSION: If it is not diagnosed early
		"on, mycetoma can cause functional and esthetical impairments."

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Mycetoma is a neglected tropical disease characterized by nodules,"
		"scars, abscesses, and fistulae that drain serous or purulent material containing"
		the etiological agent. Mycetoma may be caused by true fungi (eumycetoma) or
		filamentous aerobic bacteria (actinomycetoma). Mycetoma is more frequent in the
		so-called mycetoma belt (latitude 15° south and 30° north around the Tropic of
		"Cancer), especially in Sudan, Nigeria, Somalia, India, Mexico, and Venezuela. The"
		"introduction of new antibiotics with fewer side effects, broader susceptibility"
		"profiles, and different administration routes has made information on"
		actinomycetoma treatment and outcomes necessary. The objective of this report was
		"to provide an update on clinical, therapeutic, and outcome data for patients with"
		actinomycetoma attending a reference center in northeast Mexico.
		"METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This was a retrospective, cross-sectional,"
		descriptive study of 31 patients (male to female ratio 3.4:1) diagnosed with
		"actinomycetoma by direct grain examination, histopathology, culture, or serology"
		from January 2009 to September 2018. Most lesions were caused by Nocardia
		brasiliensis (83.9%) followed by Actinomadura madurae (12.9%) and Actinomadura
		"pelletieri (3.2%). About 50% of patients had bone involvement, and the right leg"
		was the most commonly affected region in 38.7% of cases. Farmers/agriculture
		"workers were most commonly affected, representing 41.9% of patients. The most"
		"commonly used treatment regimen was the Welsh regimen (35.5% of cases), a"
		"combination of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) plus amikacin, which had a"
		"90% cure rate, followed by TMP/SMX plus amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in 19.4% of"
		"cases with a cure rate of 100%. In our setting, 28 (90.3%) patients were"
		completely cured and three (9.7%) were lost to follow-up. Four patients required
		multiple antibiotic regimens due to recurrences and adverse effects.
		"CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In our sample, actinomycetoma was predominantly caused"
		by N. brasiliensis. Most cases responded well to therapy with a combination of
		TMP/SMX with amikacin or TMP/SMX and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Four patients
		required multiple antibiotics and intrahospital care.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Deep mycoses and pseudomycoses (DMP) may cause significant disability
		"and even death; however, the reports regarding these diseases, mainly affecting"
		"the foot, are scarce. OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiological, clinical, and"
		diagnostic characteristics of DMP of the foot in 160 patients. METHODS: A
		retrospective and observational study of DMP affecting the foot was carried out
		in a tertiary-care center in Mexico for 20 years (from January 2000 to December
		2019). Cases with confirmatory microbiological studies were included; the
		identification of the isolated fungi was based on the forms of reproduction. For
		"actinomycetes, morphological analysis in an automated system ATB Vitek® 1574"
		"(Biomèrieux) was used. The fungi were identified by PCR, using several primers"
		from the ITS regions and for actinomycetes in the 16S rRNA region. Data from
		histopathological studies were also collected. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty
		proven cases of DMP of the foot were included. The cases were categorized into
		nine types of infections including mycetoma (actinomycetoma and eumycetoma) in
		"102 cases (63.7%); sporotrichosis in 21 cases (13.1%); chromoblastomycosis, 18"
		"cases (11.2%); phaeohyphomycosis, 3 cases (1.8%); histoplasmosis, 12 cases"
		(7.5%); coccidioidomycosis 2 cases (1.2%) and botryomycosis and nocardiosis with
		one case respectively (0.6%). Most cases developed after traumatic implantation
		"(147 cases, 91.8%). One hundred fifteen cases (71.8%) were men. The evolution was"
		chronic in 125 cases (78.2%); bone involvement was observed in 64 cases (40%).
		Parasitic forms were observed In 139 cases (86.8%). The isolation and
		identification of the etiological agents were confirmed in all cases. CONCLUSION:
		The main DMP affecting the foot were infections due to traumatic implantation;
		most were endemic mycoses. The clinical characteristics and the evolution of the
		"diseases are easily misdiagnosed, and thus, diagnostic tests are usually"
		required.

AB	-	We report a 21-year-old farmer with a 4-year history of a nodular plaque with
		fistulas and induration of adjacent skin. The lesion had been treated surgically
		"at another hospital, but recurred 2 years later. Black, charcoal-like grains were"
		observed draining through the fistulas. A biopsy specimen showed brown grains
		"with filaments in an abscess surrounded by macrophages, giant cells, and"
		lymphocytes. Culture demonstrated small white colonies of Madurella mycetomatis.
		"The patient was treated with itraconazole for 6 months, followed by surgery. TNP"
		"was initiated in the immediate post-operative period, and copious granulation"
		"tissue was observed within 1 week. Autologous skin grafting was performed, and"
		itraconazole was continued for an additional 3 months. Although necrosis of the
		"graft ensued, the functional result was acceptable. The patient appeared free of"
		disease at 18 months of follow-up. Eumycotic mycetoma is an infectious and
		inflammatory process that occurs after traumatic inoculation of fungi through the
		"skin. Surgery is the treatment of choice, but successful reconstruction may be"
		challenging and recurrence is common. Topical negative pressure (TNP) promotes
		"the formation of granulation tissue, which facilitates closure of deep wounds and"
		chronic ulcers. This case illustrates that eumycotic mycetoma is difficult to
		"treat. Whether TNP contributed to the successful outcome cannot be proven but,"
		"given the generally poor response of eumycetoma to therapy, we suggest that the"
		role of TNP in the management of this disease merits attention.

		"becomes difficult with low cure rates and frequent relapses. Here, we present"
		such a very rare case of a 38-year-old cattle farmer who presented with verrucose
		"nodules, tumefaction and multiple discharging nodules on the left lower 1/3 rd"
		leg and foot since last 9 years. Direct KOH mount of the verrucose tissue showed
		Fonsecaea pedrosoi sclerotic muriform bodies and a biopsy of one granule
		discharging nodule demonstrated fungal mycetoma. He was put on tab. Itraconazole
		200 mg o.d. and cotrimoxazole bid for 6 months with very little improvement. The
		rarity of this combination is most probably due to different geographical
		distribution.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Mycetoma is a chronic, granulomatous infection of subcutaneous"
		"tissue, that may involve deep structures and bone. It can be caused by bacteria"
		(actinomycetoma) or fungi (eumycetoma). There is an epidemiological association
		"between mycetoma and the environment, including rainfall, temperature and"
		humidity but there are still many knowledge gaps in the identification of the
		"natural habitat of actinomycetes, their primary reservoir, and their precise"
		geographical distribution. Knowing the potential distribution of this infection
		and its ecological niche in endemic areas is relevant to determine disease
		management strategies and etiological agent habitat or reservoirs.
		METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This was an ambispective descriptive study of 31
		patients with actinomycetoma. We determined the biophysical characteristics
		"including temperature, precipitation, soil type, vegetation, etiological agents,"
		and mapped actinomycetoma cases in Northeast Mexico. We identified two disease
		"cluster areas. One in Nuevo Leon, with a predominantly kastanozems soil type,"
		"with a mean annual temperature of 22°, and a mean annual precipitation of 585.2"
		"mm. Herein, mycetoma cases were produced by Actinomadura pelletieri, Actinomadura"
		"madurae, Nocardia brasiliensis, and Nocardia spp. The second cluster was in San"
		"Luis Potosí, where lithosols soil type predominates, with a mean annual"
		"temperature of 23.5° and a mean annual precipitation of 635.4 mm. In this area,"
		all the cases were caused by N. brasiliensis. A. madurae cases were identified in
		"rendzinas, kastanozems, vertisols, and lithosols soils, and A. pelletieri cases"
		"in xerosols, kastanozems, and rendzinas soils. Previous thorn trauma with Acacia"
		"or Prosopis plants was referred by 35.4% of subjects. In these states, the"
		"presence of thorny plants, such as Acacia spp., Prosopis spp., Senegalia greggi,"
		"Vachellia farnesiana and Vachellia rigidula, are common."
		CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Mapping this neglected tropical infection aids in the
		"detection of disease cluster areas, the development of public health strategies"
		for early diagnosis and disease prediction models; this paves the way for more
		ecological niche etiological agent research.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Actinomycetoma is a chronic granulomatous infection that follows
		traumatic implantation. Thoracic actinomycetoma (TA) is rare and may lead to
		severe complications. METHODS: A retrospective study of cases of TA diagnosed
		"from 1985 to 2019 was carried out. Each case underwent direct examination,"
		"culture and biopsy. RESULTS: Sixty-four cases (12.8%) were included, with a male"
		predominance (84.3%); the main occupation was peasant farmer (71.8%) and the main
		site was the back (76.5%). Vertebral involvement was observed in 21.8% and
		pulmonary involvement in 7.8%. Nocardia brasiliensis was the main aetiological
		"agent (53 cases, 74.5%). CONCLUSIONS: TA is a poorly studied disease that can"
		cause neurological and lung complications.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Mycetoma is a chronic granulomatous infection involving cutaneous and
		"subcutaneous tissues. It is endemic in tropical and subtropical areas, but"
		sporadic cases have been reported also in countries of temperate climate. The
		purpose of this paper is to review the cases of mycetoma in European subjects
		"(and presumably acquired in Europe), to give an insight in the main factors"
		"associated with this condition, and to describe two previously unpublished cases"
		observed at our Centre. METHODS AND FINDINGS: PubMed was systematically searched
		for case reports and case series of mycetoma in Europeans reported between 1980
		"and 2014, using specific search strategies. Two further cases diagnosed by the"
		authors are described. Forty-two cases were collected. Eleven cases were caused
		"by Scedosporium apiospermium, mainly in immunosuppressed patients from Bulgaria,"
		"Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain and the United Kingdom."
		"Excluding all patients with immunosuppression, 29 cases remain. Most of them were"
		reported from Bulgaria and in Albanian patients (all diagnosed outside Albania).
		"In the Bulgarian case series many different micro-organisms, both bacteria and"
		"fungi, were isolated, while all the 5 cases from Albania were caused by"
		"Actinomadura spp. Other countries reporting cases were Greece, Italy and Turkey."
		"In general, Actinomadura spp is the most frequent causative agent isolated,"
		followed by Nocardia spp and Madurella mycetomatis. The foot was the most
		"reported site involved. Most patients were medically treated, but unfortunately a"
		long-term follow up (at least one year) was available only in a few cases.
		CONCLUSIONS: Our review and our own cases suggest that Europeans without travel
		history can be affected by Madura foot. The lack of a surveillance system is
		"likely to cause an underreporting of cases. Moreover, the unfamiliarity of"
		"Western doctors with this peculiar infection may cause a mismanagement, including"
		unnecessary amputations.

LID	-	e3102
AB	-	Mycetoma is a chronic granulomatous disease. It is classified into eumycetoma
		caused by fungi and actinomycetoma due to filamentous actinomycetes. Mycetoma can
		be found in geographic areas in close proximity to the Tropic of Cancer. Mexico
		is one of the countries in which this disease is highly endemic. In this
		"retrospective study we report epidemiologic, clinical and microbiologic data of"
		mycetoma observed in the General Hospital of Mexico in a 33 year-period (1980 to
		2013). A total of 482 cases were included which were clinical and microbiology
		confirmed. Four hundred and forty four cases (92.11%) were actinomycetomas and 38
		cases (7.88%) were eumycetomas. Most patients were agricultural workers; there
		was a male predominance with a sex ratio of 3:1. The mean age was 34.5 years old
		(most ranged from 21 to 40 years). The main affected localization was lower and
		upper limbs (70.74% and 14.52% respectively). Most of the patients came from
		"humid tropical areas (Morelos, Guerrero and Hidalgo were the regions commonly"
		reported). The main clinical presentation was as tumor-like soft tissue swelling
		with draining sinuses (97.1%). Grains were observed in all the cases. The
		principal causative agents for actinomycetoma were: Nocardia brasiliensis
		"(78.21%) and Actinomadura madurae (8.7%); meanwhile, for eumycetomas: Madurella"
		mycetomatis and Scedosporium boydii (synonym: Pseudallescheria boydii) were
		"identified. This is a single-center, with long-follow up, cross-sectional study"
		that allows determining the prevalence and characteristics of mycetoma in
		different regions of Mexico.

PG	-	1645-7
AB	-	BACKGROUND: The most common fungi that cause invasive infection in transplant
		"recipients are the spp, spp, and the endemic fungi such as and. Recently,"
		"however, other fungal pathogens have emerged as important causes of invasive"
		"disease in these immunocompromised individuals, including the dematiaceous fungi,"
		"such as and the spp, species of and, and the hyalohyphomycoses, such as"
		(Pseudallescheria boydii) (1). METHODS: We present a single patient case report
		and literature review. RESULTS: We illustrate the first reported case of a
		postoperative sternal wound infection and pneumonia caused by in a heart
		"transplant recipient and review the significant clinical, microbiologic, and"
		therapeutic aspects of infection with this important opportunistic pathogen.
		CONCLUSIONS: Postsurgical wound infection should be added to the growing list of
		infections in the transplant population caused by.

AB	-	History A 21-year-old man presented with swelling of the medial aspect of the
		left thigh of 1-month duration. There was no history of fever or penetrating
		injury in the left thigh. The patient had undergone renal transplantation 7 years
		earlier and had been taking immunosuppressants since transplantation. He had
		undergone two surgeries at the same site in the medial aspect of the left thigh
		"in the past 3 years for a similar problem. At physical examination, there was"
		"swelling in the medial aspect of the left thigh, with mild tenderness. A surgical"
		scar was noted anterior to the swelling ( Fig 1 ). No redness or discharging
		"sinus was present. Laboratory results were as follows: hemoglobin level, 11.3"
		"g/dL (normal range, 13.8-17.2 g/dL); white blood cell count, 9.7 × 10(9)/L"
		"(normal range, [4-11] × 10(9)/L); neutrophil, 75% (normal range, 48%-77%);"
		"lymphocyte, 22% (normal range, 10%-24%); eosinophil, 1% (normal range, 0.3%- 7%);"
		"monocyte, 1% (normal range, 0.6%-10%); serum creatinine level, 1.3 mg/dL (114.9"
		"μmol/L) (normal range, 0.5-1.6 mg/dL [44.2-141.4 μmol/L]); and serum glucose"
		"(random) level, 82 mg/dL (4.5 mmol/L) (normal range, 79-140 mg/dL [4.4-7.8"
		mmol/L]). Radiography of the left thigh showed soft-tissue swelling in the medial
		"aspect of the left thigh, without underlying bone involvement (not shown)."
		Ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the left thigh were
		performed. [Figure: see text].

TI	-	Scedosporium cerebral abscesses after extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation.
PG	-	671-6
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Scedosporial infections are usually encountered in the
		"immunocompromised patients. However, they are now emerging in the immunocompetent"
		population and have an affinity for the central nervous system. They represent a
		"therapeutic challenge, since they are highly resistant to most antifungal"
		medications. METHODS: We report the case of an immunocompetent patient with
		multiple cerebral abscesses secondary to Scedosporium apiospermum following
		extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and review the literature about this
		challenging cerebral infection. RESULTS: A previously healthy 33-year-old male
		admitted to the hospital for a community-acquired pneumonia requiring ECMO
		subsequently developed multiple cerebral abscesses. He was empirically treated
		"with caspofungin, which was changed to voriconazole once surgical aspiration"
		"revealed Scedosporium apiospermum. Despite multiple aspirations, decompressive"
		"craniectomy to alleviate intracranial pressure, and an appropriate antifungal"
		"agent, the patient did not survive this aggressive infection. CONCLUSION: Brain"
		abscesses with Scedosporium apiospermum present a therapeutic challenge. High
		clinical suspicion leading to early appropriate antifungal therapy and combined
		surgical interventions might improve the prognosis.

LID	-	10.1177/1534734613512504 [doi]
AB	-	Mycetoma is chronic granulomatous infection of skin and subcutaneous tissue
		caused by both bacteria and fungi. We report a case of mycetoma caused by
		Scedosporium apiospermum in the right foot of a 45-year-old farmer in north
		India. The patient had a history of trauma in the sole of the right foot followed
		by discharge of white granules along with proximal progression. Scedosporium
		apiospermum was identified based on colony characteristics and microscopic
		features on slide culture. Mycetoma is a progressive disease. Foot is commonly
		"affected in persons who walk barefoot, especially in south India. Untreated"
		mycetoma progress and involve the underlying fasciae and tissues along with bones
		often resulting in loss of limb. By prompt and reliable diagnosis with
		"corresponding antimicrobial administration, we can prevent further progression"
		and limb disability.

TI	-	Criteria for the diagnosis of sinus mycetoma.
PG	-	475-85
AB	-	Recent improvements in the treatment options for fungal disease of the sinuses
		make rapid distinction between the syndromes of invasive and noninvasive
		sinusitis necessary. On the basis of the extensive review of the literature
		"detailed here, we developed case-finding criteria for the noninvasive syndrome of"
		"sinus mycetoma. Using these criteria, we identified 20 cases of sinus mycetoma in"
		the medical literature and compared findings in these patients to those of five
		"patients with mycetoma evaluated in our clinics. Like those in the literature,"
		our patients appeared immunocompetent and were often first seen for evaluation of
		symptoms other than those usually associated with sinusitis. Two were first seen
		with a new-onset seizure disorder and one with nasal obstruction alone. Patients
		"from both groups more commonly had mycetoma in their maxillary sinuses, and"
		"fungus failed to grow from the cheesy, grey-green, hyphae-rich material removed"
		"at the time of surgery. Clinical features in our five patients, which are not"
		"noted in published reports of sinus mycetoma, included frequent atopy, nasal"
		"polyps, calcification within the sinus on computed tomography, and an excellent"
		"response to surgical treatment. Serendipitously, one patient had both allergic"
		fungal sinusitis and a mycetoma in the same sinus. On the basis of this
		"experience, we have modified our case-finding criteria into proposed diagnostic"
		criteria for sinus mycetoma. The elements of these criteria are designed to: (1)
		exclude patients with invasive fungal sinusitis and (2) differentiate sinus
		mycetoma from other forms of noninvasive fungal sinusitis on the basis of
		specific histopathologic findings. This study and the criteria presented reflect
		our view that sinus mycetoma represents a distinct but not necessarily isolated
		element in the spectrum of noninvasive fungal disease of the sinuses.

TI	-	Paranasal sinus fungus balls.
PG	-	481-6
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Paranasal sinus fungus balls (mycetomas) are a form of fungal sinus
		"infection distinct from allergic fungal sinusitis, fulminant invasive fungal"
		"disease, and paranasal aspergillus granulomas. METHODS: The Mayo Clinic surgical"
		pathology files of inflammatory sinus specimens from 1984 to 1994 were examined.
		Twenty-nine paranasal sinus fungus balls were identified. Cases of allergic
		fungal sinus and invasive fungal disease were excluded. RESULTS: The fungus ball
		"occurred in 11 men and 18 women, with an age range of 28 to 86 years, mean 64"
		"years. Sinuses involved included maxillary (20 cases), sphenoid (10 cases),"
		"ethmoid (9 cases), and frontal (6 cases). In 12 patients, multiple sinuses were"
		involved in a variety of combinations. By culture the most common pathogens were
		Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus flavus. Treatment was by a variety of
		surgical procedures. Follow-up in 28 patients showed two recurrences and three
		deaths due to intracerebral bleed as a complication of surgery. These deaths
		occurred in patients with sphenoid sinus fungus balls. CONCLUSIONS: Paranasal
		sinus fungus balls occurs in an elderly population and have a female
		predominance. They have a low morbidity and recurrence rate. Death can occur in
		sphenoid sinus lesions as a complication of surgery.

LID	-	10.1016/j.trstmh.2009.07.016 [doi]
AB	-	We report on 722 children with confirmed mycetoma seen at the Mycetoma Research
		"Centre, Khartoum, Sudan during May 1991 to March 2009. There were 531 males"
		(73.5%) and 191 females (26.5%) with an age range of 4-17 years (mean 13.7+/-2.9
		years); most were students. The majority of patients were from Central and
		Western Sudan. The disease duration ranged between 6 months and 14 years (mean
		2.27+/-2.12 years). Most of the patients had eumycetoma (79.1%). The clinical
		course was typical in the majority of the patients. Family history of mycetoma
		"was reported in 15% of patients. The foot was affected most, followed by knee,"
		"hand, head and neck, chest wall and buttocks. In the foot, the metatarsal bones"
		and calcaneum were affected most. Cytological and ultrasonic examinations of the
		lesions and histological examination of the surgical biopsies were the
		cornerstone in the diagnosis of mycetoma. Combined medical treatment and surgical
		excision was the standard treatment. Disease recurrence after surgical excision
		"was reported in 17.9% of patients. The morbidity rate in this study was high, and"
		"it had led to high school dropout and many socioeconomic impacts on patients,"
		families and community. Children with mycetoma need psychological support to
		identify and to treat their psychosocial problems.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Fungal origin mycotic aneurysms are rare and carry a high mortality
		rate. Scedosporium apiospermum is an ubiquitous fungus which has been described
		to cause devastating infections in immunocompromised hosts. CASE DESCRIPTION: We
		report a case of a 23-year-old patient with Burkitt's lymphoma and
		graft-versus-host disease admitted with intracerebral hemorrhage and sequential
		development of 12 anterior circulation aneurysms from disseminated Scedosporium
		"infection. Despite aggressive surgical and antimicrobial treatment, the patient"
		died 6 months later from multiorgan failure. The notable feature of this case is
		the rapid angioinvasiveness of the infection with new aneurysm formation within
		days of clear angiographic imaging despite the apparent lack of skull base
		osteomyelitis. CONCLUSION: We highlight the difficulties in treating fungal
		mycotic aneurysms and the associated high mortality. While a less aggressive
		"approach might have been appropriate given the known poor outcomes, the age of"
		the patients as well as the family wishes dictated the treatment decisions.

PG	-	563-566
LID	-	10.1111/ijd.13499 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: Mycetoma and chromoblastomycosis are subcutaneous fungal infections
		"caused by pigmented fungi, common in the tropics and subtropics. Here we report a"
		pregnant woman who presented with a swelling around the ankle joint which was
		"clinically diagnosed as a case of mycetoma; however, further investigations"
		revealed it to be a case of chromoblastomycosis. METHODS: 24 year old
		primigravida presented with an indurated swelling around the ankle joint with
		multiple nodules and sinuses draining serosanguinous discharge. There was no
		improvement with antibiotic therapy or surgical debridement. Patient was
		"investigated in detail including radiographs, KOH smear, pus culture and biopsy"
		for histopathology and fungal culture. RESULTS: o grains were identified from the
		discharge and KOH smear was negative for fungal elements. Pus culture revealed no
		"bacterial growth. On the other hand, histopathology and fungal culture confirmed"
		it to be a case of chromoblastomycosis caused by Fonsecaea pedrosoi. Treatment
		"was initiated with terbinafine 250 mg daily, and patient showed excellent"
		response within 6 months of therapy. CONCLUSION: This unusual mycetoma-like
		presentation of chromoblastomycosis has not been previously reported in
		literature and may be attributed to the altered immune status in pregnancy. This
		should alert the clinician about the need to be vigilant of the atypical
		"presentations of well-known dermatological conditions, especially in special"
		situations like pregnancy.

TI	-	The association between the interleukin-10 cytokine and CC chemokine ligand 5
		polymorphisms and mycetoma granuloma formation.
PG	-	527-33
LID	-	10.3109/13693786.2012.745201 [doi]
AB	-	Mycetoma is a progressive and destructive chronic granulomatous subcutaneous
		inflammatory disease caused by bacteria and fungi. The genetic determinants for
		susceptibility to and the development of mycetoma are unclear. Polymorphisms in
		genes encoding for cytokines and chemokines usually influence the efficiency of
		the immune response to infection and are associated with disease susceptibility
		"and progression. Therefore, we hypothesized that polymorphisms of CC chemokine"
		ligand 5 (CCL5) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) promoter regions might contribute to
		"the initiation, susceptibility, and severity of eumycetoma. This case-control"
		study included 149 mycetoma patients and 206 healthy matched controls. In the
		"study population, three functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CCL5"
		and two in IL-10 were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction and restriction
		fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Significant differences in allele
		"distribution were demonstrated for CCL5 -28 C/G (P < 0.0001), CCL5 In1.1 T/C (P <"
		0.0001) and IL-10 -592 A/C. Since in previous studies it was demonstrated that
		the genotypes obtained for CCL5 and IL-10 were connected with CCL5 and IL-10
		production we measured the serum levels of CCL5 and IL-10 in mycetoma patients
		and healthy controls. Elevated serum levels for both CCL5 and IL-10 were found in
		mycetoma patients and we describe that genetic differences in CCL5 and IL-10 are
		associated with the development of the mycetoma granuloma.

LID	-	e2400
AB	-	It is still challenging and difficult to treat patients with eumycetoma; the
		current treatment has many side effects and has proven to be expensive and
		"characterized by high recurrence rate, hence the poor patients' treatment"
		"compliance. Most of the patients are of low socio-economic status, have many"
		"financial constraints and hence, many of them rely on alternative and herbal"
		"medicine for the treatment of their disease. With this background, the current"
		study was conducted to determine the prevalence of herbal medicine usage among
		"patients with eumycetoma. This cross-sectional, observational,"
		"questionnaire-based study was conducted at the Mycetoma Research Center,"
		"University of Khartoum, Khartoum, Sudan. A convenience cohort of 311 patients"
		with confirmed eumycetoma was invited to participate in the study after informed
		consent. The study showed that 42.4% of the study population used herbal medicine
		for the treatment of eumycetoma at some stage of their illness. The commonly used
		"herbs were Moringa oleifera, Acacia nilotica, Citrullus colocynthis and Cuminum"
		cyminum. Most of the patients claimed no benefits from the herbal treatment.
		Ninety one patients (29.3%) had encountered complications with herbal treatment.
		The high prevalence of herbal treatment encountered in the study can be explained
		by the patients' dissatisfaction with the current medical therapeutic modalities.
		"To reduce the high prevalence of herbal medicine usage, governmental control and"
		"health policies are mandatory; likewise, native healers need to be educated in"
		that. Moringa oleifera was the commonly used herb in this study and many reports
		"claimed medicinal properties of this tree; hence, further in-depth studies to"
		determine the active ingredients in the different parts of the tree and its
		effect are required.

		This is the first report of M. mycetomatis as the etiologic agent of human or
		animal infections in Israel. The definitive identification of the isolate was
		established by molecular methods. In addition the mold was cultured on various
		media through which we found that its growth rate was significantly augmented on
		"incubation on trypticase soy agar, more so if horse serum was added to this"
		medium. Sixteen previously published cases defined by the authors as mycetoma in
		"horses are briefly reviewed. Among these, only one indicated that the infection"

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Few central nervous systems (CNS) cases of actinomycetoma have been
		"recorded in the literature, and most were reported in tropical and subtropical"
		"regions. The management of this invasive infection is difficult, especially when"
		it affects the spine and the cranio-cervical regions. CASE: We report an unusual
		"case of a cranio-cervical junction actinomycetoma, in a patient presenting a"
		cerebellar syndrome from brainstem compression. The CT scan showed a compressive
		solid osteolytic lesion in the cranio-cervical junction. The patient underwent
		cranio-cervical decompression and lesion resection. The diagnosis of
		actinomycetoma was confirmed on immune-histochemistry and molecular analysis. At
		"4 months' follow-up, the patient presented a fatal recurrence disseminating"
		within the cerebellum and the spine. CONCLUSION: The surgical treatment of CNS
		actinomycetoma presented poor prognosis and a disseminating recurrence. We
		"believe that clinicians and surgeons must be informed about these ""new"""
		"infectious pathologies that are so difficult to treat, especially with the"
		arrival of migrant patients from endemic countries in conflict.

TI	-	Madura foot: atypical finding and case presentation.
PG	-	327-31
AB	-	"Mycetomas are chronic, subcutaneous infections characterized by a clinical triad"
		"of chronic induration, draining sinuses, and discharge of granules. The granules"
		are composed of colonies of either actinomycotic bacteria or eumycotic fungi. The
		infection develops after traumatic inoculation with contaminated soil and
		"progresses to adjacent tissues or bone. The foot, hand, and lower-leg regions are"
		the most commonly affected areas. Treatment can be difficult and includes
		surgical debridement with prolonged antibiotic or antifungal treatment. Mycetomas
		are primarily found in tropical and subtropical areas of the world and are
		relatively rare in the United States. A case of indigenously obtained
		actinomycoses that was successfully treated with surgical resection and long-term
		antibiotic therapy is presented. This case is unique because of the rarity of
		contracting this type of infection in the United States. Mycetomas have been
		"reported in southern states, but there are no reported cases of obtaining this"
		pathogen in Michigan. This case stresses the need for clinical suspicion of this
		"rare dermatosis, especially considering the increase in immigration to the United"
		States.

PG	-	204-212
LID	-	10.1111/myc.12590 [doi]
AB	-	"Recently, mycetoma was added to the World Health Organization's list of neglected"
		tropical disease priorities. Fusarium as a genus has been reported to cause
		"eumycetoma, but little is known about the species involved in this infection and"
		"their identification. In this study, molecular tools were applied to identify"
		Fusarium agents from human eumycetoma cases. The partial translation elongation
		factor 1-alpha (TEF-1α) gene was used as diagnostic parameter. Two additional
		"cases of eumycetoma, due to F. keratoplasticum and F. pseudensiforme,"
		"respectively, are presented. A systematic literature review was performed to"
		"assess general features, identification, treatment and outcome of eumycetoma"
		"infections due to Fusarium species. Of the 20 reviewed patients, the majority"
		"(75%) were male. Most agents belonged to the F. solani species complex, ie"
		"F. keratoplasticum, F. pseudensiforme, and an undescribed lineage of F. solani."
		"In addition, F. thapsinum, a member of Fusarium fujikuroi species complex was"
		"encountered. The main antifungal drugs used were itraconazole, ketoconazole and"
		"amphotericin B, but cure rates were low (15%). Partial response or relapse was"
		"observed in some cases, and a case ended in amputation. Clinical management of"
		eumycetoma due to Fusarium is complex and combination therapy might be required
		to increase cure rates.

TI	-	Treatment of a chronic Scedosporium apiospermum vertebral osteomyelitis. Case
		report.
PG	-	E9
AB	-	Scedosporium apiospermum is a rare cause of fungal vertebral osteomyelitis that
		may result in chronic infection requiring multiple surgical interventions and
		long-term medical therapy. This case is the seventh one reported in the
		literature and is the first to include salvage surgery of a previous major spinal
		reconstruction. This report is also the first to describe the use of the new
		antifungal agent voriconazole. In treating this case of chronic vertebral
		"osteomyelitis, several principles are emphasized from both the surgical and"
		"medical perspectives. From a surgical perspective, the use of salvage surgery,"
		"temporary avoidance of spinal instrumentation, and an appropriate choice of graft"
		"materials are emphasized. From a medical perspective, confirmation of the"
		"diagnosis, the need for long-term antifungal therapy, the need for long-term"
		"patient compliance, and the use of the new antifungal agent voriconazole are"
		emphasized. Application of these principles has led to an adequate 2-year
		outcome.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Few cases of scedosporiosis have been reported in animals, but the"
		true prevalence is probably underestimated due to a lack of awareness.
		"Scedosporiosis in dogs has often been associated with localized infection (i.e.,"
		"nasal infection, eumycetoma, or keratomycosis) or, in rare cases, disseminated"
		infections. CASE PRESENTATION: This case report describes the clinical and
		pathological features and the diagnostic process of a rare systemic and fatal
		fungal infection in a dog caused by Scedosporium apiospermum. A 10-month-old
		"female Maremmano-Abruzzese sheepdog showing weakness, lethargy, lateral"
		"decubitus, miosis and muscular rigidity was presented. Rodenticide poisoning was"
		"clinically suspected for the differential diagnosis. However, postmortem"
		examinations revealed the presence of a swollen and soft subcutaneous nodule
		"located near the right inguinal breast, which was associated with massive"
		"enlargement of the inguinal lymph nodes and small disseminated, cream-colored"
		nodules in the kidneys and mesentery. Multiple fungal pyogranulomas were observed
		"upon histological examination. Fungal isolation from the kidneys, breast and"
		inguinal lymph nodes was performed. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS)
		sequences from the fungal colony DNA were searched in BLAST in the NCBI GenBank
		for species identification. The sequences of the fungi isolated from the kidney
		and breast cultures showed 100% sequence identity with sequences from
		Scedosporium apiospermum. CONCLUSIONS: This report shows that Scedosporium
		apiospermum may act as a primary pathogen in young and apparently healthy dogs
		and represents an important pathogen that should be considered during the
		"diagnostic process, particularly when a fungal infection is suspected."

TI	-	A tropical diabetic foot.
PG	-	362-4
AB	-	Foot infections are a common problem and an important cause of morbidity in
		"patients with diabetes. We report a patient with type 2 diabetes, presenting with"
		"a chronic foot wound resistant to standard care, in whom the diagnosis of"
		eumycetoma was made through histopathological examination of a bone biopsy
		specimen and confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Diagnosis and
		treatment of eumycetoma are reviewed. Eumycetoma caused by Madurella mycetomatis
		"is an uncommon cause of osteomyelitis in patients with diabetes in Europe, but"
		should be considered in patients from endemic regions when (antibacterial)
		therapy fails.

TI	-	Actinomycetoma in SE Asia: the first case from Laos and a review of the
		literature.
PG	-	349
LID	-	10.1186/1471-2334-12-349 [doi]
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Mycetoma is a chronic, localized, slowly progressing infection of the"
		cutaneous and subcutaneous tissues caused either by fungi (eumycetoma or
		implantation mycosis) or by aerobic actinomycetes (actinomycetoma). It is
		"acquired by traumatic implantation, most commonly in the tropics and subtropics,"
		especially in rural agricultural communities. Although well recognized elsewhere
		"in Asia, it has not been reported from the Lao People's Democratic Republic"
		(Laos). CASE PRESENTATION: A 30 year-old female elementary school teacher and
		"rice farmer from northeast Laos was admitted to Mahosot Hospital, Vientiane, with"
		"a massive growth on her left foot, without a history of trauma. The swelling had"
		progressed slowly but painlessly over 5 years and multiple draining sinuses had
		developed. Ten days before admission the foot had increased considerably in size
		"and became very painful, with multiple sinuses and discharge, preventing her from"
		walking. Gram stain and bacterial culture of tissue biopsies revealed a branching
		filamentous Gram-positive bacterium that was subsequently identified as
		Actinomadura madurae by 16S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing. She was
		treated with long-term co-trimoxazole and multiple 3-week cycles of amikacin with
		a good therapeutic response. CONCLUSION: We report the first patient with
		actinomycetoma from Laos. The disease should be considered in the differential
		diagnosis of chronic skin and bone infections in patients from rural SE Asia.

PG	-	582-4
AB	-	Pathological fractures in mycetoma are a rarity and only 1 patient was reported
		in the literature. We report an unexpectedly high incidence of pathological
		"fractures in mycetoma seen at the Mycetoma Research Centre, Khartoum, Sudan over"
		a 10-year period. Plain radiographs of 517 patients with confirmed mycetoma in
		various body sites were reviewed and correlated with the clinical presentation of
		the patients. Pathological fractures were detected in 12 patients (2.3%). The
		explanation of this high incidence is unclear. Pain-reducing agents produced by
		mycetoma may be the reason that these fractures were overlooked clinically.

AB	-	We describe a patient with Pseudallescheria boydii keratitis. The treatment of
		mycotic keratitis remains difficult. This case demonstrates that identification
		and susceptibility testing should be rapidly performed. In cases of indolent
		"keratitis, the possibility of fungal infection should be kept in mind."

TI	-	Mycetoma in Yemen: clinicoepidemiologic and histopathologic study.
PG	-	586-93
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Mycetoma is widespread in Yemen, but has not been fully documented."
		"METHODS: A prospective study of 70 patients (53 male, 17 female; from different"
		regions of Yemen) was performed. The clinical profile of the cases was recorded
		"in a special protocol. The diagnosis was based on clinical features, examination"
		"of grains, roentgenographic studies, and histopathology (44 cases). RESULTS:"
		Fifty cases were diagnosed as eumycetoma and 20 as actinomycetoma. The
		identification of the causative species was performed in 44 cases by
		"histopathologic studies. Among the cases of eumycetoma, Madurella mycetomatis was"
		"recognized in 27 patients, Leptosphaeria senegalensis in two, and pale-grain"
		"fungi in two. Among the cases of actinomycetoma, Streptomyces somaliensis was"
		"seen in eight patients, Streptomyces madurae in one, and Nocardia species in"
		four. The treatment of eumycetoma patients with ketoconazole and excision in
		selected cases controlled the disease activity in the majority. Most of the cases
		"of actinomycetoma were better controlled with drug therapy alone, with a"
		"combination of penicillin and cotrimoxazole, or cotrimoxazole alone. CONCLUSIONS:"
		"Mycetoma is widespread in Yemen, with a higher incidence of eumycetoma and a"
		maximum number of cases from the Hudaida region. A multicenter study is needed to
		evaluate the exact extent of disease.

TI	-	Mycetoma in children: experience with 15 cases.
PG	-	50-2
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Mycetoma is a chronic infection caused by aerobic actinomycetes and
		filamentous fungi. It is an occupational disease frequent in tropical countries
		and is uncommon in children. METHODS: A retrospective (25 years) report of
		mycetomas was conducted in children less than 15 years of age. Each of the cases
		was studied clinically and proven with microbiologic tests: direct examinations
		"(to identify and classify the grains), cultures and identification based on"
		morphology and biochemical tests. The therapeutic experience of the cases was
		"also reviewed. RESULTS: In a 25-year period, a total of 334 mycetomas were seen"
		"at our institution, 15 of which (4.5%) were in patients 15 years of age and"
		"younger (mean age: 11.2 years, age range: 6-15 years). Twelve cases were males"
		and 3 females. The main clinical location was the foot in 10 of 15 (66.6%).
		Etiologies included 13 actinomycetomas and 2 eumycetomas. Etiologic agents were
		"Nocardia brasiliensis in 12 cases, Nocardia asteroides in one and Madurella"
		mycetomatis in 2. Eleven of the13 cases of actinomycetomas treated with
		trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus diaminodiphenylsulfone were cured. The 2
		failures were successfully treated with amoxicillin/clavulanate. One of the
		"eumycetomas was cured with itraconazole therapy, whereas the other failed various"
		treatments eventuating in surgical amputation. CONCLUSIONS: Mycetomas are
		"exceptional in children; in our setting, actinomycetomas are more frequent than"
		"eumycetomas. The clinical and microbiologic diagnosis is simple. Overall,"
		treatment response is better for actinomycetomas than for eumycetomas.

AB	-	"Madura foot, relatively easy to diagnose in tropical countries, is very rare and"
		"unrecognized in Morocco, causing diagnostic delays. We present the case of a"
		54-year-old patient with mycetoma for 3 years who initially consulted two general
		"practitioners, then an endocrinologist and finally a dermatologist in order to be"
		diagnosed correctly. The diagnosis of mycetoma based on biological criteria was
		established at a late stage of irreversible bone lesions; requiring amputation by
		the orthopedic team. Mycetomas are fungal or bacterial. Delays in diagnosis and
		"care are frequent in Morocco. The diagnosis is based on biology; however,"
		radiological examinations are necessary to assess the extension. The initial
		treatment is medicinal. Surgery takes place in late stages.

AB	-	"Nontraditional human pathogenic fungi, including Fusarium, Paecilomyces, and"
		"Acremonium species, have been increasingly documented as agents of infection in"
		"immunocompromised patients and, occasionally, in normal hosts. Although"
		"definitive identification of these fungi requires culture, they often can be"
		identified provisionally in tissue sections by a combination of histologic
		"features, including hyaline septate hyphae and characteristic reproductive"
		structures known as phialides and phialoconidia. These morphologic
		"characteristics, although familiar to mycologists, are easily overlooked by"
		"histopathologists; as a result, Fusarium species and Paecilomyces lilacinus are"
		frequently misidentified in tissue sections as Aspergillus or Candida species. We
		"identified 19 culture-proved cases of infection with species of Fusarium,"
		"Paecilomyces, or Acremonium; retrospectively reviewed histologic specimens"
		"stained by routine hematoxylin and eosin, Gomori methenamine silver, and/or"
		periodic acid-Schiff stains; and delineated morphologic criteria that will help
		pathologists make a preliminary identification of these fungi by histopathology.
		Adventitious sporulation was found in 9 of 9 infections caused by Paecilomyces
		"species, 7 of 10 infections caused by Fusarium species, and in the single case of"
		infection caused by Acremonium strictum. Histologic recognition of these
		morphologies may help clinicians select appropriate initial antifungal treatment
		and manage the infection.

		literature review.
PG	-	729-37
AB	-	"Fungal sinusitis secondary to Pseudallescheria boydii is rare, as only 25 cases"
		have been previously reported in the literature. Although Pboydii resembles
		"Aspergillus on pathologic examination, it is typically resistant to amphotericin"
		"B. Therefore, culture is necessary to differentiate the two. Patients with P"
		boydii sinusitis should generally be treated with a combination of surgery and
		antifungal therapy. Combination treatment is particularly important for
		immunocompromised patients with fungal invasion because mortality among these
		"patients is high. The prognosis is better for immunocompetent patients, even"
		those with fungal invasion. We describe a new case of invasive fungal sinusitis
		"secondary to P. boydii infection, and we review the literature on this emerging"
		pathogen.

		discharging sinuses mimicking malignancy.
PG	-	1265-1272
LID	-	10.1002/dc.24567 [doi]
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Discharging sinuses is a form of chronic unhealed infection that
		can present at any site due to a variety of infectious organisms. These
		discharging sinuses may be associated with mass lesions and lymphadenopathy to
		mimic some neoplastic processes. Identifying these infections with accuracy and
		"promptness is essential, as the treatment regimens are specific. Fine-needle"
		"aspiration (FNA) of these lesions, along with appropriate cytochemical stains,"
		aids in the rapid and precise diagnosis of these infections and excludes
		"neoplasms at these sites. Also, material for culture and other studies can be"
		obtained by FNA. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted in
		the Department of pathology from 2018 to 2020. A total of 179 patients with
		similar clinical presentation and confirmed infection on cytology were
		"identified. On the evaluation of the requisition forms, 32 (18%) patients were"
		identified with discharging sinus associated along with swelling. RESULTS: The
		"five infections (32 cases) that were identified, included 18 cases of"
		"tuberculosis (56.25%) followed by 9 cases of actinomycosis (28.12%), 3 cases of"
		"pheohypomycosis (9.37%), and one case each of Nocardia (3.12%) and eumycetoma"
		(3.12%) which presented as swelling with discharging sinus. Special stains were
		performed in all cases for confirmation. Histopathological/Microbiological
		correlation was done whenever available. CONCLUSION: Infections presenting as
		swelling with discharging sinuses mimicking malignancy can be diagnosed on FNAC
		with good accuracy.

PG	-	69-71
LID	-	10.1016/j.surneu.2009.06.014 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Madurella species of fungus causes chronic subcutaneous infection of
		lower extremities; the infection is commonly labeled as Madura foot. We report a
		case of Madurella infection involving the cranial cavity. Such an involvement by
		Madurella fungal infection is not recorded in the literature. CASE DESCRIPTION: A
		31-year-old non-immunocompromised male patient presented with complaints of left
		hemifacial pain for 1 year and diplopia on looking toward left side for a period
		"of 2 weeks. On examination, he had ipsilateral sixth nerve paresis."
		Investigations revealed a large paranasal sinus lesion that extended in the
		cavernous sinus. The lesion was partially resected. Histologic examination
		revealed that the lesion was a fungus Madurella mycetomi. CONCLUSION: A rare
		cranial extension of Madurella fungal infection is reported.

AB	-	"A new species of nonsporulating fungus, isolated in a case of black-grain"
		"mycetoma in Sudan, is described as Madurella fahalii. The species is"
		characterized by phenotypic and molecular criteria. Multigene phylogenies based
		"on the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) internal transcribed spacer (ITS), the partial"
		"β-tubulin gene (BT2), and the RNA polymerase II subunit 2 gene (RPB2) indicate"
		that M. fahalii is closely related to Madurella mycetomatis and M.
		pseudomycetomatis; the latter name is validated according to the rules of
		botanical nomenclature. Madurella ikedae was found to be synonymous with M.
		mycetomatis. An isolate from Indonesia was found to be different from all known
		species based on multilocus analysis and is described as Madurella tropicana.
		"Madurella is nested within the order Sordariales, with Chaetomium as its nearest"
		neighbor. Madurella fahalii has a relatively low optimum growth temperature
		"(30°C) and is less susceptible to the azoles than other Madurella species, with"
		"voriconazole and posaconazole MICs of 1 μg/ml, a ketoconazole MIC of 2 μg/ml, and"
		an itraconazole MIC of >16 μg/ml. Since eumycetoma is still treated only with
		"azoles, correct species identification is important for the optimal choice of"
		antifungal therapy.

LID	-	10.1016/j.ijid.2011.03.004 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to highlight the importance of infections
		caused by members of the genera Pseudallescheria/Scedosporium in HIV-positive
		patients. METHODS: We describe a case of a fatal scedosporiosis in a
		treatment-naïve HIV patient and review all previously reported cases of
		pseudallescheriosis/scedosporiosis from a search of the PubMed and Deutsches
		"Institut für Medizinische Dokumentation und Information (DIMDI) databases,"
		"applying the terms 'Pseudallescheria', 'Scedosporium', 'Allescheria',"
		"'Monosporium', 'Petriellidium', 'boydii', 'prolificans', 'inflatum',"
		cross-referenced with 'HIV' and 'AIDS'. RESULTS: Detection of Scedosporium and
		Pseudallescheria species has been reported in 22 HIV-positive patients. Fourteen
		isolates belonged to the Pseudallescheria boydii complex and eight to
		Scedosporium prolificans. Invasive scedosporiosis (IS) was proven in 54.5% of the
		patients. Among them dissemination was observed in 66.7%.
		Pseudallescheria/Scedosporium species were mainly isolated from male individuals.
		Patients with proven IS showed CD4+ cell counts <100/μl and a higher co-infection
		rate as compared to colonized patients. Patients with central nervous system
		(CNS) manifestations showed CD4+ cell counts <50/μl. The mortality rate for
		patients with proven IS was 75% and was 100% for patients with dissemination/CNS
		manifestations. The fatality rate for patients treated with antifungal drugs plus
		surgery was lower compared to patients treated with antimycotic agents alone.
		CONCLUSIONS: IS only occurred in HIV-positive patients with a strongly impaired
		immune system. The survival rates of patients with advanced HIV disease and
		invasive scedosporiosis can be improved by rapid diagnosis by biopsy and requires
		"complex therapy with a combination of active antifungal drugs, surgery and"
		supportive immune augmentation.

AB	-	Endoscopic prelacrimal recess approach is a promising technique for treating
		various maxillary sinus diseases because it allows for adequate visualization and
		"wide access to the entire maxillary sinus. However, the incidence of absent"
		"prelacrimal recess (PLR) has ranged from 7% to 17.5%, implying that there is a"
		"limitation for the application of EPLA in this population. Here, a male patient"
		with concomitant Krouse T2 maxillary inverted papilloma and mycetoma presenting
		with unilateral nasal obstruction and blood-tinged secretion is described. The
		presurgical computed tomography showed no recess. By dislocating the nasolacrimal
		duct from the bony canal and removing the medial maxillary wall sufficiently to
		"extend the surgical corridor; and by preserving the inferior turbinate, nasal"
		"mucosa, and nasolacrimal duct, the patient did not experience any postoperative"
		"complications. In conclusion, our modified technique may be an effective and safe"
		strategy for treating maxillary sinus disease without prelacrimal recess.

AB	-	OBJECTIVES: Botryomycosis is a rare chronic granulomatous inflammatory disease of
		bacterial origin. Two forms of the disease exist; the cutaneous and the visceral
		form. The subcutaneous form mimics actinomycetoma clinically and histologically;
		"however, the treatment is different. In this communication, we report on a"
		Sudanese male patient who presented with foot botryomycosis. DESIGN: Case report.
		RESULTS: The patient was initially diagnosed with actinomycetoma by the presence
		of Streptomyces somaliensis like-grains in the histological slides. The patient
		was treated with a combination of co-trimoxazole and amikacin sulfate and shifted
		"after 1 year to co-trimoxazole, amoxicillin, and clavulanic acid. Despite"
		"treatment, the infection progressed, and the bone was invaded. The infected limb"
		was amputated. The histopathological report of the surgical biopsy showed
		gram-positive cocci inside the grain. The 16S sequence identified these cocci as
		Staphylococcus aureus. CONCLUSION: This is the first reported botryomycosis case
		"from Sudan, and it highlights why molecular identification is vital in diagnosis."

PG	-	207-9
AB	-	BACKGROUND: The fungus Scedosporium prolificans was first described as a human
		"pathogen in 1984, and has been associated with metastatic endophthalmitis and one"
		previously reported case of sclerokeratitis. METHODS: We report a case of S.
		prolificans sclerokeratitis in the setting of late scleral necrosis complicating
		pterygium surgery with adjunctive beta-irradiation. RESULTS: A poor clinical
		"response to topical natamycin and amphotericin B, and systemic itraconazole and"
		"ketoconazole was encountered. Enucleation was required, with subsequent"
		microbiological cure. Pathological correlation is described. CONCLUSIONS: S.
		prolificans infections often respond poorly to medical therapy. Early surgical
		intervention is indicated in culture-proven scleritis due to Scedosporium
		prolificans.

PG	-	319-22
AB	-	Actinomycetous infections typically involve either the head and neck or the
		extremities following a traumatic implantation. Classic clinical associations are
		draining sinus tracts. This case report describes the pathologic and MR findings
		of a relatively acute mycetomatous process involving the soft tissues. Pathologic
		"findings in this case included an occasional granule composed of gram positive,"
		thin branching elements. These and other findings were consistent with
		"actinomycetes bacterium infection. The discussion centers around the use of MR,"
		"both with and without gadolinium, in evaluating this type of granulomatous"
		infection. Infiltration of the adjacent subcutaneous tissues was easier to
		appreciate on both the T1-weighted images without gadolinium and the T1-weighted
		images with gadolinium when compared to the T2-weighted images. Signal
		characteristics as described in this case report may suggest a granulomatous
		process.

AB	-	"This study focuses on the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, risk factors,"

		infections in a tertiary center. Medical records of 18 patients of culture-proven
		"CNS fungal infections were retrospectively reviewed from 2000 to 2007, including"
		12 isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and seven from tissue biopsy.
		Patient demographic data included 10 males and eight females. The mean age was 55
		years (range: 24-89 years). All but one patient were immunocompromised. Fungal
		"organisms isolated from CSF included: Cryptococcous neoformans (8 patients),"
		"Coccidioides immitis (3 patients), and Aspergillus versicolor (1 patient)."
		Histopathology of seven biopsy cases revealed groups of pigmented golden-brown
		"fungal forms in three cases; three cases showed septate fungi, two of which had"
		melanin in their walls; and one case showed multiple round spherules. These cases
		"on microbiological cultures grew Coccidioides immitis (1 patient), Aspergillus"
		"fumigatus (1 patient), Cladophialophora bantiana (2 patients), Fonsecaea"
		monophora (1 patient) and Scedosporium apiospermum (2 patients). Five of the
		seven fungal organisms isolated from tissue biopsies were dematiaceous fungi.
		"Twelve patients died after a period of a few weeks to months, two were lost to"
		"follow-up, and four are alive with severe neurological sequelae. CNS fungal"
		infections in our cohort were more common in patients post-transplant and with
		"hematologic malignancies. In our series, rare dematiaceous fungi are emerging"
		agents for cerebral mycosis. The outcome of CNS fungal infections is poor despite
		vigorous antifungal therapy.

		material.
PG	-	9-Jun
LID	-	10.1016/j.trstmh.2009.06.015 [doi]
AB	-	The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the use of the cell block
		"technique as a safe, accurate and quick tool for the cytodiagnosis of mycetoma."
		The study included 240 patients with suspected mycetoma. The suspected lesion was
		aspirated and the aspirated material was processed to form cell blocks. The cell
		blocks were processed as described for routine tissue histopathological
		examination. Haematoxylin/eosin-stained sections were reviewed to identify the
		morphological features of the mycetoma grains and the different inflammatory
		tissue reactions. The findings were compared with those seen in histopathological
		sections. The different mycetoma grains showed distinct morphological features on
		the cell block that were identical to those seen in histopathological sections.
		Distinction between eumycetoma and actinomycetoma and their classification
		according to the causative agent were possible. The cell block technique had
		"sensitivities of 87.5% and 85.7% for eumycetoma and actinomycetoma, respectively,"
		and there were no statistical differences in the findings obtained by the cell
		"block and histopathological techniques. The technique is simple, rapid, specific,"
		sensitive and inexpensive. It can be used in the routine diagnosis of mycetoma
		and to obtain grains for culture identification. The cell blocks can be preserved
		for a long period for future studies.

TI	-	Pulmonary mycetoma due to Candida albicans: case report and review.
PG	-	133-5
AB	-	A pulmonary mycetoma is a round to oval-shaped mass of fungi situated within a
		cavity in the lung. Most mycetomas are caused by Aspergillus species. Other fungi
		have occasionally been reported to cause clinically and roentgenographically
		similar lesions. We report a case of pulmonary mycetoma caused by Candida
		albicans. Review of the literature suggests that pulmonary mycetoma due to this
		"species is uncommon, and when it has been suspected, specific documentation has"
		been lacking.

PG	-	854-9
LID	-	10.1111/j.1365-2559.2009.03309.x [doi]
AB	-	AIMS: Clinical presentation can provide a clue to the subcategories of fungal
		"rhinosinusitis (FRS); however, tissue examination provides accurate"
		classification. The aim was to analyse the incidence and histopathological
		spectrum of FRS. METHODS AND RESULTS: A retrospective analysis of all the cases
		of rhinosinusitis reported in the last 5 years was carried out. Haematoxylin and
		eosin-stained sections along with special stains such as periodic acid-Schiff and
		Grocott's were examined. These cases were subclassified based on the presence of
		"allergic mucin, mycelial elements and tissue reaction. Out of a total of 665"
		"cases of rhinosinusitis, 284 (42.7%) were of FRS. On histopathological"
		"examination they were broadly categorized as: (i) non-invasive FRS (n = 171,"
		"60.2%), which included 160 cases (56.3%) of allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFRS)"
		"and eleven (3.9%) of fungal ball; (ii) invasive FRS (n = 101, 35.6%), which"
		"included 48 cases (16.9%) of chronic invasive granulomatous FRS, four (1.4%) of"
		chronic invasive FRS and 49 (17.3%) of acute fulminant FRS; and (iii) mixed
		"pattern FRS, comprising 12 cases (4.25%). CONCLUSIONS: AFRS is the most common"
		type of FRS. Cases with mixed reaction pattern suggest that different types of
		FRS represent a progressive spectrum of disease. An exact histopathological
		categorization of FRS is important as regards treatment.

PG	-	1018-21
AB	-	We report a case of eumycetoma due to Madurella mycetomatis affecting the left
		"dorsal forefoot in a 35-year-old woman. She had spent her childhood in Jamaica,"
		and had been resident in the U.K. for 20 years prior to her presentation. She
		"gave a highly suggestive history for a mycetoma, having observed the intermittent"
		discharge of black grains from the lesion. The diagnosis was confirmed by
		"histological and mycological analysis of the grains, and a magnetic resonance"
		imaging scan excluded osteomyelitis. She has responded very favourably to
		treatment with itraconazole. Mycetomas due to M. mycetomatis have not previously
		been reported from Jamaica.

AB	-	Identification of dematiaceous fungi responsible for black-grain mycetoma has
		remained cumbersome and time consuming for years leading to delayed diagnosis and
		"thereby increased agony to patients. Moreover, difficult morphology of some of"
		these fungi demanding enough expertise for species identification in addition to
		culture-negativity has often led to misdiagnosis and hence inapt treatment to the
		patients. We report the identification of Madurella mycetomatis from
		culture-negative black granules discharged from foot nodular lesions of a 27
		years old male using PCR followed by sequencing of the internal transcribed
		spacer region. The patient's lesions were successfully treated using a
		"combination of itraconazole (200mg) and terbinafine (250mg), confirming our"
		"diagnosis. Our case study proves the clinical value of PCR as the best, rapid and"
		accurate diagnostic method for the identification of Madurella mycetomatis and
		"related fungi, particularly in culture-negative cases."

AB	-	Mycetoma is an infrequent subcutaneous infection caused by true fungi
		(eumycetoma) or aerobic actinomycetes (actinomycetoma). We report the case of a
		62-year-old man with eumycetoma involving the left foot and ankle. Skin biopsy
		"revealed black-brown grains, and in culture, a white colony fungus grew at day 8."
		Molecular sequencing using ITS1-ITS4 primers identified the species as
		Aspergillus sydowii. The patient was treated with itraconazole 200 mg twice daily
		"and terbinafine 250 mg daily for 8 months, with complete response and no"
		recurrence after 2.5 years of follow-up. Aspergillus sydowii is a saprotrophic
		fungus that rarely causes skin or nail disease. No cases of eumycetoma caused by
		this agent have been previously reported. As its geographic distribution
		"continues to expand, it may increasingly be recognized as a cause of human"
		disease.

LID	-	e236948
AB	-	Actinomycotic mycetoma is a disease of the tropical region and usually presents
		"as a chronic, suppurative and deforming granulomatous infection. We present an"
		unusual case of actinomycotic mycetoma of the abdominal wall that was found to
		infiltrate into the bowel. A 51 year-old man presented with pain and swelling in
		the left flank of 2-year duration. Even after comprehensive preoperative
		"evaluation with advanced radiological imaging, biochemistry and pathology, the"
		diagnosis could not be arrived at. Histopathological examination of the excised
		"specimen after the surgery guided to the diagnosis of actinomycotic mycetoma,"
		which entirely changed the management in the postoperative period. We propose
		that mycetoma should be kept as a possible differential diagnosis for anterior
		abdominal wall swelling in the indicated clinical setting and the investigations
		"be done keeping the same in mind. Otherwise, a lot of valuable time may be lost"
		allowing the disease to progress further.

		were females (21.4%). Their age ranged between 5 to 70 years with a mean of 32
		years. The disease duration at presentation ranged between 2 months and 17 years.
		The majority of the patients 118 (42.8%) had mycetoma of 1 year duration. In this
		"study, students were the most affected; 105 (38%) followed by workers 70 (25.4%),"
		then farmers 48(17.3%). The majority of the patients were from the Central Sudan
		"207 (75%), Western Sudan 53 (19.2%) while 11 patients (4%) were from the Northern"
		part. Past history of surgical intervention performed elsewhere was reported in
		196 patients (71.1%). Family history of mycetoma was reported in 50 patients
		"(18.1%). The foot was the most affected site, 245 (88.7%), followed by the hand"
		seen in 19 (6.8%) patients and 44 (4.5%) had different sites involvement. Most of
		the patients 258 (93.5%) had wide local surgical excisions while 18 had major
		amputation. The model predicted that the certain groups have a high risk of
		"recurrence, and these include patients with disease duration greater than 10"
		years and extra-pedal mycetoma. Patients with disease duration between [5-10]
		"years, with pedal mycetoma, who had previous surgery, with positive family"
		history and underwent wide local surgical excision. Patients with disease
		"duration [5-10] years, with pedal mycetoma, had previous surgery, with no family"
		"history but presented with a disease size (> 10 cm), were non- farmers and"
		underwent wide local surgical excision. Other groups are patients with disease
		"duration (≤5 years), with pedal mycetoma, age <59 years, living in the Western"
		/Eastern / Southern regions of the Sudan and with positive family history and had
		wide local surgical excision. Also included patients with disease duration (≤5
		"years), with pedal mycetoma, aged <59 years, living in the northern or central"
		"region, with no family history but presented with a disease size >10 cm, working"
		"as farmers or students and underwent wide local surgical excision. In conclusion,"
		these groups of patients need special care to reduce the incidence of
		post-operative recurrence with its morbidity and detrimental consequences. In
		depth studies for the other predisposing factors for post-operative recurrence
		"such as genetic, immunological and environmental factors are needed."

TI	-	Recurrent Scedosporium apiospermum mycetoma successfully treated by surgical
		excision and terbinafine treatment: a case report and review of the literature.
PG	-	31
LID	-	10.1186/s12941-017-0195-z [doi]
LID	-	31
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Scedosporium apiospermum is an emerging opportunistic filamentous
		"fungus, which is notorious for its high levels of antifungal-resistance. It is"
		able to cause localized cutaneous or subcutaneous infections in both
		"immunocompromised and immunocompetent persons, pulmonary infections in patients"
		with predisposing pulmonary diseases and invasive mycoses in immunocompromised
		patients. Subcutaneous infections caused by this fungus frequently show chronic
		mycetomatous manifestation. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 70-year-old
		"immunocompromised man, who developed a fungal mycetomatous infection on his right"
		leg. There was no history of trauma; the aetiological agent was identified by
		microscopic examination and ITS sequencing. This is the second reported case of
		"S. apiospermum subcutaneous infections in Hungary, which was successfully treated"
		"by surgical excision and terbinafine treatment. After 7 months, the patient"
		remained asymptomatic. Considering the antifungal susceptibility and increasing
		"incidence of the fungus, Scedosporium related subcutaneous infections reported in"
		the past quarter of century in European countries were also reviewed.
		CONCLUSIONS: Corticosteroid treatment represents a serious risk factor of S.
		"apiospermum infections, especially if the patient get in touch with"
		manure-enriched or polluted soil or water. Such infections have emerged several
		times in European countries in the past decades. The presented data suggest that
		"besides the commonly applied voriconazole, terbinafine may be an alternative for"
		the therapy of mycetomatous Scedosporium infections.

PG	-	684-8
LID	-	10.3855/jidc.2387 [doi]
AB	-	Madura foot is a deep mycosis commonly seen in tropical and subtropical countries
		"such as India. Its incidence is likely to rise in temperate regions as well, due"
		to the increase in worldwide travel. The cases presented here are all
		"agricultural workers from a rural part of northern India who had induration,"
		fibrosis and minimal discharge from sinuses over the foot. Although culture
		"remains the gold standard diagnostic test, this case report highlights the"
		importance of histopathology in the early diagnosis and differentiation of common
		causative agents in Madura foot as repeated cultures are sometimes negative. Thus
		"for mycetomas in which causative infectious agents cannot be isolated, histology"
		may prove beneficial by avoiding inadvertent use of combined antifungal and
		"antimicrobial agents so that a correct therapeutic modality can be decided,"
		"prognostic outcome be explained to the patient, and a preventable cause of"
		deformity and disability can be identified and treated at an early stage.

AB	-	"Mycetoma is a chronic granulomatous infection that is difficult to treat, notably"
		when due to fungi such as Scedosporium apiospermum. Recent antifungal agents
		"could be an option, but cases are rarely reported, and none with posaconazole."
		"Paradoxical responses, defined as initial clinical worsening despite appropriate"
		"treatment, are common in tuberculosis but rare in deep mycoses in"
		"non-immunocompromised hosts. Hence, paradoxical responses in context other than"
		mycobacterial infection in an immunocompromised host could provide insights into
		the pathophysiology and the optimal strategy for treatment. We report the first
		case of a mycetoma caused by S. apiospermum with bone involvement treated with
		"posaconazole, and the paradoxical response observed at the beginning of the"
		"treatment. As with mycobacterial infections, a paradoxical response in deep"
		mycosis could represent the earliest marker of therapeutic efficacy.

		River. The first nodules appeared on the left foot at the age of 13years (1985).
		The patient suffered frequent flare-ups with the appearance of black grains and
		underwent surgery in 1988 and 1992 in Senegal. After remission for several months
		"after surgery, new fistulae occurred. The patient emigrated to France in 1995 and"
		underwent a third surgical intervention in 1996. M. mycetomatis was cultured from
		"the black grains. The patient was otherwise in good health, with no diabetes, and"
		"HIV tests were negative. We saw the patient for the first time in 2005, at which"
		time he had flare-ups every two to three months. Imaging disclosed an absence of
		"bone involvement. The patient underwent a fourth operation in October, 2005, and"
		"voriconazole treatment was initiated. A new flare-up occurred in February, 2006."
		"CT, MRI, and PET scans revealed calcaneus and tarsal involvement, and"
		"posaconazole then replaced voriconazole. Flucytosine was added four months later,"
		due to an absence of improvement. New flares-ups occurred and a fifth surgical
		"intervention was performed in September, 2006. The pain, which had been present"
		"for three years, worsened; the patient had to stop working and was no longer able"
		to walk without crutches. Amputation of the foot was considered. Empiric
		"treatment with a NSAID, diclofenac (Voltaren(®); 100mg/day), was added to the"
		"antifungal treatment in November 2006, to treat the patient's pain and"
		inflammation. A major improvement was observed within one week. The patient was
		"able to walk without crutches one month later. After two months, clinical"
		"examination was normal: no pain, inflammation, nodules or fistulae. Flucytosine"
		"was stopped after six months of treatment, in January 2007, diclofenac after"
		"10months, in October 2007, and posaconazole after 18.5months, also in October"
		2007. No relapse has occurred during the eight years of follow-up since treatment
		"ended. The patient seems to have been cured and has normal CT, MRI, and PET"
		"scans. IN SUMMARY: This eumycetoma, which had progressed over 20years despite"
		"surgery and antifungal treatments, seems to have been cured by the addition of a"
		NSAID. This observation suggests that inflammation plays a major role in the
		pathogenesis of fungal mycetoma. Clinical studies of treatments including an
		NSAID should be conducted to confirm this finding.

AB	-	We present a case of mycetoma by Madurella mycetomatis on the foot of a Chinese
		"young man, living in Italy for more than ten years. Clinically the lesion closely"
		resembled and was initially misinterpreted as a vascular neoformation. We analyze
		the histological and morphological features of the Madurella mycetomatis
		infection through which we managed to type the etiological agent. Our case is
		worth reporting because of the rarity of this disease in Europe and the unusual
		clinical presentation. It also offers the opportunity to stress the need for the
		"clinical suspicion of this dermatosis, considering the increase of immigration"
		towards our regions.

AB	-	Mycetoma or maduromycosis is a rare chronic granulomatous disease caused by a
		fungus infection. We report a rare case of mycetoma in the hand; to our knowledge
		this is the first report in the United States of mycetoma caused by Nocardia
		asteroides. The patient had had 2 years of chronic drainage and edema of the left
		hand after a penetrating injury sustained in the shipyards. After surgical
		"debridement he was treated with co-triamazole, 1 tablet orally four times a day"
		for 6 months. The chronic drainage has ceased but most of his wrist and hand
		joint movements are restricted.

		"the ""mycetoma belt"" countries but rare in North America. We report a case of"
		pedal eumycetoma in the state of Maryland. A 51-year-old male immigrant from
		"Guatemala presented with multiple, enlarging nodules on the dorsal surface of his"
		"left great toe present for 1 year, and a new one in the left arch area present"
		for 6 months. The nodular lesions were surgically excised in two separate
		operations. Pathologic evaluation of all nodules revealed eumycetomas
		"characterized by the Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon, showing an amorphous"
		"eosinophilic center filled with numerous fungal hyphae, observed on periodic"
		"acid-Schiff-stained slides, with a surrounding cuff of neutrophils. Polymerase"
		chain reaction-based sequencing identified Cladosporium cladosporioides in the
		tissues. The patient was further treated with oral fluconazole for 2 months. The
		patient recovered well postoperatively and had no recurrence at 20-month
		"follow-up. In conclusion, even though eumycetoma is regarded as a rare disease in"
		"North America, its incidence may be higher than reported because of millions of"
		"immigrants from endemic regions in the United States, which highlights the need"
		to raise awareness of this devastating disease in the medical community.
		Eumycetoma needs to be differentiated from other infectious and noninfectious
		benign and malignant lesions. Optimal treatment includes surgical excision with
		antifungal therapy.

		and Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococcus faecium Intra-Cranial Abscesses.
PG	-	500-1
LID	-	10.1089/sur.2016.023 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: The aim of this submission is to demonstrate the need for broad
		"antimicrobial therapy, including empiric anti-fungal therapy, if rim-enhancing"
		lesions are noted on cerebral imaging. METHODS: A retrospective microbiological
		and radiologic review of the management of a rare case of multiple Scedosporium
		apiospermum and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium intra-cranial abscesses
		in an immunocompromised patient was performed. A manual chart review assessing
		clinical and epidemiologic characteristics was completed including procedures and
		"operative notes, use of invasive devices, biochemical and haematological blood"
		"test results, antimicrobial agents received, and documentation of a travel"
		"history. RESULTS: Antimicrobial therapy combined with source control, typically"
		"surgical drainage, is considered the gold standard management of an intra-cranial"
		"abscess. Fungal abscesses produce rim-enhancing lesions, and where this"
		"radiographic feature is identified, evidence suggests that anti-fungal agents"
		"should be added. Antimicrobial therapy with linezolid and voriconazole failed,"
		and the patient died. There was extensive disease progression evident on serial
		imaging despite therapy. A definitive surgical drainage procedure could not be
		performed. CONCLUSIONS: Interval imaging assisted with the management of this
		challenging case. A low index of clinical suspicion for fungal intra-cerebral
		abscesses is necessary when treating immunosuppressed patients.

		"tropical areas, which are caused by exogenous fungi that produce grains in vivo."
		"The objective of our work is to establish their epidemiological, clinical and"
		"mycological profile in our Moroccan context. Therefore, we conducted a"
		"retrospective study, extending from 1975 to 2019, compiling all cases of"
		eumycetomas that were diagnosed in the parasitology-mycology laboratory of the
		"Ibn Sina University Hospital of Rabat. The diagnosis, based on the swabbing of"
		"exudates and eventual grains or the study of biopsies, included the direct"
		"examination of 30% KOH mounts, the realization of appositions colored by"
		May-Grünwald-Giemsa and the incubation on 3 Sabouraud media at 27° and 37°C. In
		"44 years, 12 cases of eumycetoma have been diagnosed, with a male to female ratio"
		"of 5:1 and a mean age of 44.8 years. The lesions, evolving from 1 to 30 years,"
		"were podal in 10 cases, popliteal and gluteal in one case each, with osteolysis"
		"in 3 patients. The collected grains were black in 9 cases, white in 2 others."
		"Direct examination was unanimously positive, revealing entangled hyphae, whilst"
		"culture isolated Madurella sp. in 9 cases, Trichophyton rubrum, Acremonium sp. in"
		one case each and remained sterile in the last case. The treatment was medical in
		"8 cases, medico-surgical in 3 others, with loss of sight of most patients."

		"base osteomyelitis, internal carotid artery vasculitis and subsequent stroke."
		"Despite the multiple complications encountered, prompt diagnosis and initiation"
		of appropriate antifungal treatment resulted in patient survival. Multiple
		imaging modalities were used to aid the establishment of the diagnosis in this
		complex case and highlight the radiological findings associated with skull base
		osteomyelitis and its possible complications.

		computed tomography findings and literature review.
PG	-	247-52
LID	-	10.1097/RCT.0b013e318172d629 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to evaluate chest computed tomography
		(CT) findings in 3 lung transplant recipients infected with Pseudallescheria
		"boydii complex or its asexual anamorph, Scedosporium apiospermum, 2 after"
		double-lung transplant and 1 after single-lung transplantation. Awareness and
		"early diagnosis of this rare but potentially lethal infection are important, as"
		it is largely refractory to treatment with the antifungal agents of choice used
		for the more common Aspergillus species. Computed tomography investigation
		"focused on the location, quality, and appearance of the various pulmonary lesions"
		"as well as the presence of cavitation, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and pleural"
		effusions. A literature review of previous lung and other solid organ transplant
		recipients infected with pulmonary Pseudallescheria boydii was also conducted and
		compared with our findings. CONCLUSION: While the high-resolution CT findings of
		pulmonary P. boydii infection are nonspecific and markedly similar to the
		"manifestations of the more common Aspergillus species, awareness of this rare"
		"opportunist is important, given the high mortality associated with disseminated"
		infection and the relative success possible with timely and appropriate
		treatment. The most common CT abnormalities present in our 3 patients included
		"hilar and paratracheal adenopathy, noncavitary tree-in-bud nodules surrounded by"
		"ground-glass opacities, and airway thickening."

AB	-	"In this communication, a case of black grain eumycetoma produced by the fungus C."
		atrobrunneum is reported. The patient was initially misdiagnosed with M.
		mycetomatis eumycetoma based on the grains' morphological and cytological
		"features. However, further aerobic culture of the black grains generated a"
		melanised fungus identified as C. atrobrunneum by conventional morphological
		methods and by internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) ribosomal RNA gene
		sequencing. This is the first-ever report of C. atrobrunneum as a
		eumycetoma-causative organism of black grain eumycetoma. It is essential that the
		"causative organism is identified to the species level, as this is important for"
		proper patient management and to predict treatment outcome and prognosis.

		well to treatment with voriconazole. This case highlights the importance of
		diagnosing the causative agent in fungal osteomyelitis as species specific
		susceptibility can aid in the treatment of fungal osteomyelitis.

		and review.
PG	-	890-6
AB	-	Pseudallescheria boydii is an uncommon cause of central nervous system (CNS)
		infections. Of a total of 21 cases of CNS infections caused by P. boydii (one
		described for the first time and 20 reported previously in the English-language
		"literature), eight occurred in immunosuppressed patients and four in patients who"
		nearly drowned; three were trauma related and two were iatrogenic (epidural
		"anesthesia and ventriculoperitoneal shunt, respectively); one occurred in a"
		"patient with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and three, in patients without"
		underlying disease or predisposing conditions. The clinical manifestations
		"included brain abscesses (13 cases), spinal pachymeningitis (two cases), chronic"
		"meningitis (two cases), intraventricular device-related ventriculitis (two"
		"cases), cranial epidural abscess (one case), and acute meningitis (one case)."
		Seven patients showed clinical evidence of extraneural involvement by P. boydii.
		"The outcome is known for 20 patients. Of these, the diagnosis was established"
		"while the patient was alive in 18 cases, in spite of which, 15 patients died. All"
		"five survivors were managed surgically, and two received intravenous miconazole."
		P. boydii should be included in the differential diagnosis of CNS infections that
		"occur in the face of immunosuppression, near drowning, and trauma. Occasionally"
		P. boydii can cause CNS infection in the absence of underlying disease or
		predisposing conditions.

AB	-	"Mycetoma is a chronic granulomatous, subcutaneous disease endemic in tropical and"
		"subtropical countries. It is currently a health problem in rural areas of Africa,"
		Asia and South America. Nine cases of mycetoma were analysed in a retrospective
		study. All isolates were identified by morphological features. The level of
		species identification was reached by molecular tools. Definitive identification
		of fungi was performed using sequence analysis of the ITS of the ribosomal DNA
		region and the ribosomal large-subunit D1/D2. Identification of actinomycetes was
		accomplished by the 16S rRNA gene sequence. Six unusual clinical isolates were
		"identified: Aspergillus ustus, Cyphellophora oxyspora, Exophiala oligosperma,"
		"Madurella pseudomycetomatis, Nocardia farcinica and Nocardia wallacei. The"
		prevalence of mycetoma in Venezuela remains unknown. This study represents the
		first report in the literature of mycetoma caused by unusual pathogens identified
		by molecular techniques.

		"in morbidity. Here, we report a case of sporotrichoid form of LV in a 38 year old"
		male who presented as cutaneous lesions mimicking mycetoma. High index of
		clinical suspicion and relevant investigations play a vital role in confirmation
		of diagnosis wherever atypical form of cutaneous TB is suspected.

PG	-	153-6
AB	-	"Mycetomas are inflammatory pseudotumors of chronic and progressive evolution, of"
		"fungal (Eumycetoma), or bacterial (Actinomycetoma) origin. We conducted a"
		retrospective study of patients who have been consulted for mycetoma over a
		period of 28 years. Thirteen cases of mycetomas were collected during the 28-year
		"period, 10 patients were of rural origin. The lesions were localized on the foot"
		in all instances. There was no male predominance. Histopathological examination
		confirmed mycetoma in all 13 cases and the determination of the infectious agent
		in 9 cases: 4 actinomycotic and 5 fungal. Microbiological examination identified
		the species in 7 cases. Bone involvement was found in 10 cases. Eumycetomas were
		treated by ketoconazole. The other cases were treated as actinomycetomas by
		antibiotics. The antibiotic treatment was associated with surgical excision in 4
		"cases and with amputation in 1 case. Mycetomas are rare in Tunisia, and only"
		"observed sporadically, for this reason the diagnosis is usually late, with severe"
		"functional, psychological, and socioeconomic consequences."

		"have been recently approved (voriconazole) and the echinocandins, a new"
		antifungal class of which the first approved agent caspofungin is now available.
		"We review the clinical data, side effects, drug interactions, and unique spectrum"
		of activity of these newer antifungal agents against both Candida and clinically
		relevant mold species.

AB	-	The expectoration of metal fragments (metalloptysis) is a rare complication after
		thoracic surgery. It usually occurs in patients with severe emphysema. We present
		a case of metalloptysis of surgical staples that is unique in several aspects: it
		"occurred longer after surgery than any previously reported case, it occurred"
		"after lobar resection surgery, and it most likely developed as a result of"
		chronic necrotizing aspergillosis. Although metalloptysis usually requires no
		"therapy, it may indicate an active infectious process that requires appropriate"
		therapy.

		fibrosis.
PG	-	53-6
AB	-	The incidence of airway colonization by Scedosporium apiospermum and of related
		sensitization was investigated prospectively in 128 patients with cystic fibrosis
		"over a 5-year period, and results were compared with clinical data. Scedosporium"
		"apio-spermum, recovered from sputum samples in 11 of 128 (8.6%) patients, was the"
		most frequent filamentous fungus after Aspergillus fumigatus.
		"Counterimmuno-electrophoresis, used to detect scedosporiosis serologically, was"
		positive in 27 of 128 (21.1%) patients. The discrepancy between the mycological
		and serological results may be related to immune cross-reactions between
		"Scedosporium apiospermum and Aspergillus fumigatus. However, symptoms of allergic"
		bronchopulmonary disease were observed in two patients chronically colonized by
		Scedosporium apiospermum. The results clearly demonstrate that the frequency of
		this fungus is largely underestimated and that it may trigger an inflammatory
		"response, thus suggesting a pathogenic role in patients with cystic fibrosis."

PG	-	411-5
LID	-	10.1016/j.anl.2008.09.008 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: Surgery for localized sphenoid sinus disease can be performed in
		different ways. Direct (transnasal) and indirect (transethmoidal) approaches are
		now prevalent in endoscopic endonasal sinus surgery (ESS) because they are safe
		"and effective. However, the identification or treatment of a sinus is"
		"occasionally difficult due to the anatomical variation, postoperative changes, or"
		"other reasons. In such difficult cases, we currently used an endoscopic endonasal"
		"transseptal approach (EETA) to the sphenoid sinus. The indications, procedures,"
		and outcomes of this surgical method are presented here. PATIENTS AND METHODS:
		"Six of 11 patients with localized sphenoid sinus disease (mycetoma, n=1;"
		"mucocele, n=5) were treated using EETA. Surgery was performed under local"
		"anesthesia in all subjects. Following endoscopic conventional septoplasty, the"
		sphenoid sinus was opened by perforating the anterior wall through the
		"septoplasty wound. The sphenoid disease was treated through this opening, and"
		then drained to the nasal cavity. RESULTS: The patients operated on using EETA
		"had no surgical complications or disease recurrence, and the use of navigation or"
		fluoroscopy systems was not required. The mean follow-up period of the patients
		was 27.7 months (range 18-48 months). Follow-up management included endoscopic
		examination and computed tomography. CONCLUSIONS: A transseptal approach to the
		sphenoid sinus with a sublabial incision was once frequently performed in
		pituitary surgery. We modified the transseptal approach as EETA with the use of
		an endoscope and endonasal incision. This approach is practical and reliable for
		"ESS, and may serve as an alternative for difficult-to-manage sphenoid sinus"
		disease. EETA can be performed in the office as it can be achieved under local
		anesthesia without a navigation system.

AB	-	Diaporthe phaseolorum (syn. Phomopsis phaseoli) is a frequent fungal parasite of
		"plants, present on all continents around the world. It has rarely been involved"
		in human diseases. We report a case of eumycetoma with osteomyelitis of the
		forefoot caused by this fungus and diagnosed by molecular biology. The patient
		had positive HTLV-1 serology and was a farmer from French Guiana who walked
		barefoot. He was successfully treated with long-term oral itraconazole (400
		mg/day). A review of the literature underlines the essential roles of plants and
		host immunosuppression in this infection and the favourable outcome with a
		triazole antifungal treatment.

AB	-	"Mycetoma is a neglected tropical disease, endemic in many tropical and"
		"subtropical regions, characterised by massive deformity and disability and can be"
		fatal if untreated early and appropriately. Interleukins (IL) -35 and IL-37 are
		newly discovered cytokines that play an important role in suppressing the immune
		"system. However, the expression of these interleukins in patients with Madurella"
		mycetomatis (M. mycetomatis) induced eumycetoma has not yet been explored. The
		"aim of this study is to determine the levels of IL-1 family (IL-1β, IL-37) and"
		"IL-12 family (IL-12, IL-35) in a group of these patients and the association"
		between these cytokines levels and the patients' demographic characteristics. The
		"present, case-control study was conducted at the Mycetoma Research Centre, Soba"
		"University Hospital, University of Khartoum, Sudan and it included 140"
		individuals. They were divided into two groups; group I: healthy controls [n =
		70; median age 25 years (range 12 to 70 years)]. Group II: mycetoma patients [n =
		70 patients; median age 25 (range 13 to 70 years)]. Cytokines levels were
		measured in sera using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). There was a
		significant negative correlation between IL-1β and IL-12 levels and lesion size
		"and disease duration, while IL-37 and IL-35 levels were significantly positively"
		correlated with both lesion size and disease duration. The analysis of the risk
		factors of higher circulatory levels of IL-37 in patients of mycetoma showed a
		"negative significant association with IL-1β cytokine, where a unit increment in"
		IL-1β will decrease the levels of IL-37 by 35.28 pg/ml. The levels of IL-37 among
		the patients with a duration of mycetoma infection ≤ 1 year were significantly
		low by an average of 18.45 pg/ml compared to patients with a mycetoma infection's
		"duration of ≥ 5years (reference group). Furthermore, the risk factors of higher"
		levels of IL-35 in mycetoma patients revealed a negative significant association
		"with IL-12, as a unit increment in IL-12 decreases the levels of IL-35 by 8.99"
		pg/ml (p < 0.001). Levels of IL-35 among the patients with duration of mycetoma
		infection ≤ one year were significantly low on average by 41.82 pg/ml (p value =
		0.002) compared to patients with a duration of mycetoma infection ≥ 5 years
		"(reference group). In conclusion, this study indicates that both IL-35 and IL-37"
		are negatively associated with the levels of IL-1β and IL-12 in eumycetoma
		mycetoma infection; and high levels of IL-37 and IL-35 may have a negative impact
		on disease progression.

AB	-	"Mycetoma, also known as madura foot, is a local, chronic, slowly progressive"
		"disease with the classic presentation involving tumefaction, multiple draining"
		"sinuses, and grain-filled pus. It is primarily produced by either a bacteria"
		(actinomycetoma) or a fungal (eumycetoma) organism. Determining the causative
		organism is fundamental to the treatment process. All types of mycetoma
		infections should be treated with early surgical debridement and tissue culture.
		"Tissue should be sent for gross, microscopic, and histopathologic evaluation. In"
		"addition to surgical management, these patients should be managed adjunctively"
		with a prolonged course of chemotherapy. Patients with actinomycetoma are treated
		with an antibiotic and can expect to have a clinical cure with little chance for
		"recurrence, whereas, patients with eumycetoma are treated with an antifungal"
		agent and usually do poorly with a high rate of recurrence. The case presented
		involved an infection due to Actinomadura madurae (Nocardiaform madurae) and
		demonstrates successful treatment with surgical resection and prolonged

		"rare, represents a big problem for clinicians because of its aggressive clinical"
		presentation and the lack of an effective therapy. New drugs with in vitro
		"activity against Scedosporium spp (voriconazole, posaconazole) should be"
		"considered. However, their clinical activity should be more widely demonstrated."

TI	-	Subcutaneous mycoses in coastal Karnataka in south India.
PG	-	70-8
LID	-	10.1111/ijd.12943 [doi]
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Subcutaneous mycoses are chronic, localized infections of the skin"
		and subcutaneous tissue which occur following traumatic implantation of the
		etiological agent. The causative organisms are soil saprophytes of regional
		epidemiology with varying ability to adapt to the tissue environment and elicit
		disease. OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to evaluate the various types of
		"subcutaneous mycoses, including actinomycotic mycetomas, in south coastal"
		"Karnataka, India. METHODS: Between January 2005 and January 2013, a total of 25"
		patients were diagnosed with subcutaneous mycoses based on a detailed clinical
		"history and presentation, histopathology, and culture of organisms. RESULTS:"
		"Chromoblastomycosis was the infection most commonly seen (n = 16 patients, 64%),"
		"followed by mycetoma (n = 4, 16%), sporotrichosis (n = 4, 16%), and"
		"rhinoentomophthoromycosis (n = 1, 4%). The extremities were the most common site"
		"of involvement, with the lower limb being most affected (64%). Males were more"
		commonly afflicted (64%) than females (36%). Most patients were agricultural
		"workers, although preceding trauma was noted in only three patients. The majority"
		of patients responded well to therapy and were disease-free on follow-up.
		CONCLUSIONS: Subcutaneous mycoses are a rare group of disorders.
		Chromoblastomycosis is the most frequent subcutaneous fungal infection in south
		"India. Morphologically, chromomoblastomycoses present as verrucous, ulcerative,"
		"nodular, or eczematous lesions. Clinical diagnosis is important as culture is"
		often negative. The incidence of infection is higher among rubber tappers. It is
		important to clinically differentiate chromoblastomycosis from tuberculosis
		"verrucosa cutis. Most of the subcutaneous mycoses respond well to treatment, with"
		"the exception of rhinoentomophthoromycosis, which is a rare form of deep mycosis"
		with associated mutilation. Eumycetomas are not observed in this part of India.

AB	-	"'Madura foot' or mycetoma is a chronic granulomatous soft-tissue infection,"
		caused by either true fungi (eumycetoma) or Gram-positive aerobic bacteria
		"(actinomycetoma). The infection is endemic to equatorial, tropical or"
		"sub-tropical regions. However, sporadic cases have been reported in the Western"
		world mostly in the migrant population. The disease follows a slow progression
		"from the time of traumatic inoculation to presentation of symptoms, characterised"
		"by a triad of chronic indurated swelling, draining sinuses and discharging"
		granules. The granules are diagnostic as they represent collections of fungal
		hyphae or bacterial filaments. We present a case of a 4-year eumycetoma of the
		"left foot in a 16-year-old Somalian girl, resident in the UK for over a year. She"
		underwent aggressive surgical debridement with a 6-month course of anti-fungal
		"medication. We emphasise the need for suspicion of this rare dermatosis, in view"
		of the increasing immigrant population.

TI	-	Prevalence of fungal corneal ulcers in northern India.
PG	-	207-9
AB	-	Fungal corneal ulcer is common in India due to the tropical climate and a large
		"agrarian population that is at risk. Various factors such as trauma, the"
		injudicious use of topical antibiotics and corticosteroids are involved. Many of
		the age and sex-related risk factors also play a minor role. This 6-year study
		from Northern India revealed that fungi were detected in 61 (8.4%) out of 730
		patients investigated. Direct microscopy was positive in 51 (7%) and culture in
		53 (7.3%) patients. Aspergillus spp. were the most common causative agents
		"accounting for 25 (40.1%) of the isolates, followed by Fusarium sp. with ten"
		"(16.4%), Curvularia sp. with five (8.2%), Candida albicans with five (8.2%),"
		"Acremonium sp. with four (6.6%), Paecilomyces sp. with three (4.9%), Penicillium"
		"sp. with two (3.3%), Alternaria sp. with two (3.3%), Fonsecaea pedrosoi var."
		"cladosporium with two isolates (3.3%) and Pseudallescheria boydii, Drechslera sp."
		and Aureobasidium pullulans with one isolate (1.6%) each. The prevalence of
		fungal ulcers in males was three times higher than in females. The affected
		individuals had a rural background and were in the 51-60 year age group.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Optimal management of eumycetoma, a severely debilitating chronic"
		"progressive fungal infection of skin, disseminating to bone and viscera, remains"
		"challenging. Especially, optimal antifungal treatment and duration are ill"
		defined. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted a monocentric retrospective
		study of 11 imported cases of eumycetoma treated by voriconazole or posaconazole
		for at least 6 months. Response to treatment was assessed through evolution of
		clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). (1→3) ß-D-glucan (BG) and positron
		emission tomography using [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose (PET/CT) results were also
		assessed. Identified species were Fusarium solani complex (n = 3); Madurella
		"mycetomatis, (n = 3), and Exophiala jeanselmei, (n = 1). Moreover, two"
		coelomycetes and one phaeohyphomycetes strains without species identification
		"were retrieved. Serum BG and PET/CT were abnormal in 7/8 and 6/6 patients tested,"
		respectively. Patients received last generation azoles for a mean duration of
		25.9±18 months. Complete response (major clinical and MRI improvement) was
		"observed in 5/11 patients, partial response (minor MRI improvement or stable MRI"
		"findings) in 5 and failure (MRI evidence of disease progression) in one, with a"
		73±39 [6-132] months mean follow-up. Relapse occurred in 2 patients after
		"treatment discontinuation. Optimal outcome was associated with fungal species,"
		"initiation of last generation triazole therapy (<65 months since first symptoms),"
		"negative serum BG and PET/CT normalization. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: MRI, PET/CT"
		and serum BG appear as promising tools to assess optimal time of antifungal
		treatment for eumycetoma.

		her right foot is presented. A single nodule on the sole was excised 15 years ago

		signal most likely representing the fungal balls or grains were detected.
		Histopathological examination revealed large clusters of microorganisms
		"resembling fungal hyphae and bacteria, which were surrounded by mixed"
		inflammatory infiltrate cells and stained positively by PAS and Gomori's
		methenamine silver stain. As minimal regression was seen on MRI with 4 months'
		"itraconazole (200 mg day(-1)) treatment, co-trimoxazole (160 TMP/800 SMX b.i.d.)"
		was added to treatment. Complete remission was established by MRI examination
		after 10 months with this combination therapy.

TI	-	Madura foot in the U.K.: fungal osteomyelitis after renal transplantation.
PG	-	151-3
AB	-	We report the case of an ethnic Asian patient who attended the renal transplant
		follow-up clinic complaining of pain in the right great toe. He had undergone
		transplantation nine months earlier and was maintained on triple
		"immunosuppression. Initially, a clinical diagnosis of gout was made and the"
		patient treated with analgesia. Two weeks later he remained symptomatic and
		developed a discharging sinus on his toe. A plain X-ray revealed a lytic lesion
		with minimal periosteal reaction. Aspiration of his first right metatarsal
		phalangeal joint was performed and fungal hyphae were observed in the fluid.
		"Subsequently, despite surgical debridement and treatment with Itraconozaole"
		amputation of the toe was required. Microbiological analysis revealed the
		"organism to be Madurella grisea,which was resistant to both Itraconazole and"
		Amphotericin B. He has remained well since amputation. We believe this to be the
		first case of Madurella infection to be described in a transplant patient.

PG	-	113-8
AB	-	Curvularia lunata was cultured from black granules found in granulomatous
		tumefactions excised from the subcutis of a three year old Medium Schnauzer dog.
		Draining sinuses were present in some of the tumefactions. Accordingly the
		diagnosis of eumycotic mycetoma was made. This diagnosis was confirmed by
		histopathological examination. During the four years following the first surgical
		"intervention, several more similar tumefactions were excised on three different"
		occasions. The dog died of chronic renal failure at the age of 8 years. There was
		no bone involvement or visceral diffusion of the fungus. The granules were
		"examined by scanning electron microscopy. Immunoglobulins in the dog's serum,"
		"assessed by a qualitative test, proved to be equal to immunoglobulins in the"
		serum of a control dog. Precipitating antibodies against C. lunata were not
		found. The dog was treated for 150 days with itraconazole. In spite of good
		"initial results, recurrence of the fungal lesions were observed after the"
		treatment's interruption. Further treatment with itraconazole for 45 days proved
		"ineffective. No side effects of the drug were observed. This is, to the best of"
		"our knowledge, the first case in which C. lunata is identified as the causative"
		agent of an animal eumycetoma.

LID	-	S0385-8146(12)00191-5 [pii]
LID	-	10.1016/j.anl.2012.07.008 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: Isolated sphenoid sinus aspergilloma (ISSA) is a rare disorder that is
		difficult to diagnose in a timely manner. These lesions can also extend to
		adjacent structures and thereby cause severe complications. ISSA patients with
		orbital complications typically have a poor prognosis even when surgical
		interventions have been successful. We here reviewed 30 ISSA cases with respect
		to clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes. METHODS: A group of 30
		patients diagnosed with ISSA between January 1990 and October 2010 were
		"retrospectively reviewed in terms of clinical manifestations, endoscopic"
		"findings, radiologic imaging data, and treatment results. We also compared the"
		clinical manifestations and treatment results between patients with and without
		"orbital complications. RESULTS: Old age (median, 55 years) and a female"
		predominance (23 women in the study) were noted. The most commonly reported
		symptom was headache (80%) and the average duration of the symptoms before
		"diagnosis was 8.1 months. On radiologic examination, including CT and MRI scans,"
		13 patients showed bony wall erosions and five patients demonstrated orbital
		complications including diplopia and visual loss. The appearance of a bony wall
		erosion on a CT scan and the acute onset of ISSA symptoms were found to be
		significant factors in the onset of orbital complications (P=0.003 in each case).
		Endoscopic sphenoidotomy was performed in all 30 cases. Most of the preoperative
		"symptoms among the patients, including headache, facial pain, and postnasal drip,"
		were improved after surgery. Among the five patients in the study group with
		"orbital complications, diplopia was completely resolved after surgery in each"
		case but there was no improvement in visual loss. CONCLUSIONS: An early diagnosis
		"of ISSA, although not easy, is important to prevent complications arising from"
		extensions of these lesions beyond the sphenoid sinus. Our present study
		demonstrates that ISSA could be effectively treated with an endoscopic
		"sphenoidotomy, and that timely intervention is needed in patients with a sinus"
		bony wall to prevent irreversible complications such as visual loss.

PG	-	133-5
LID	-	10.4103/0970-9371.73297 [doi]
AB	-	Eumycetoma is a chronic cutaneous and subcutaneous infection caused by various
		genera of fungi producing specific colored granules known as grains. A
		45-year-old farmer presented clinically with a left foot mass with multiple
		discharging sinuses existing for last 3 years. Clinical and radiological findings
		suggested a diagnosis of chronic osteomyelitis with suspicion of tuberculosis.
		Imprints plus fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) smears exhibited distinct
		brown-black colonies of a fungus having branching and septate hyphae embedded in
		matrix like material against a mixed inflammatory background. Periodic acid
		Schiff (PAS) stain gave positive staining and subsequent fungal culture confirmed
		the cytological diagnosis and aided in species identification as Madurella
		"mycetomatis. Thus, eumycetoma can precisely be diagnosed and confidently"
		differentiated from similar conditions such as actinomycetoma by simple and
		"inexpensive cytological techniques such as FNAC and imprint smears, employing"
		"routine May-Grünwald-Giemsa, Papanicolaou and simple PAS stains on cytological"
		"specimen, thus leading to rapid diagnosis for institution of correct treatment."

		medical therapy with voriconazole.
PG	-	311-5
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-011-9432-8 [doi]
AB	-	We report on the first case of eumycetoma caused by the organism Leptosphaeria
		tompkinsii to be diagnosed and possibly acquired within the United Kingdom.
		Conventional culture of fungal grains and surgical tissue specimens was negative
		and the diagnosis was achieved using panfungal polymerase chain reaction and
		sequencing technology. Despite limited surgical resection and prolonged
		"antifungal therapy with voriconazole, the patient developed progressive disease"
		with mycetoma bone involvement. This case highlights the usefulness of molecular
		diagnostic techniques in eumycetoma where organisms may fail to grow with
		conventional culture or be difficult to identify morphologically. It also reminds
		us that eumycetoma is a difficult infection to treat and despite optimism
		"regarding the efficacy of the newer triazole antifungals in this condition,"
		treatment failures may still occur.

PG	-	456-60
AB	-	As increasingly aggressive chemotherapeutic regimens are used to treat
		"malignancy, more patients will become susceptible to various opportunistic"
		"pathogens. Specifically, several fungal organisms previously viewed as relatively"
		non-pathogenic are more frequently causing serious disease in these patients.
		"Identification of these organisms is of paramount importance, as some are"
		relatively resistant to standard antifungal therapies. We report a patient with
		"disseminated cutaneous Pseudallescheria boydii, diagnosed from histopathological"
		examination and culture of a skin biopsy specimen. Identification of the organism
		was achieved shortly before the patient died. Clinicians must be aware of the
		"numerous emerging opportunistic pathogens, which may require special culture"
		techniques for diagnosis and varied or combined modes of therapy.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To illustrate by this case report that Acremonium must now be
		considered as a differential diagnosis in cases of maxillary fungus balls. CASE
		REPORT: Seventy-seven-year-old woman consulted for persistent pain of the right
		"maxillary sinus, with rhinorrhea and nocturnal coughing. Computed tomography (CT)"
		of the sinuses showed a heterogeneous opacification of the right maxillary sinus
		with well-defined hyperdense foci suggesting aspergillosis. She underwent a
		"middle meatus antrectomy by an endonasal approach. Six months after the surgery,"
		her symptoms were gone and had not recurred. Mycological examination found
		Acremonium. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Acremonium is a genus of saprobic fungi that
		rarely cause disease in humans. Infection with Acremonium has recently been
		described in immunocompromised patients. We describe the first case of fungal
		maxillary sinusitis caused by Acremonium in an immunocompetent person. Clinically
		"and radiologically, the initial diagnosis was aspergillosis. Acremonium must be"
		considered together with aspergillosis in all situations of fungus ball chronic
		sinusitis.

PG	-	89-95
AB	-	Clinical and epidemiological aspects of 41 cases of mycetoma seen in São Paulo
		city from January 1978 to December 1989 are presented. Twenty-eight cases (68%)
		"were caused by actinomycetes, while 13 (32%) were caused by true fungi. In only"
		22 (78%) actinomycetoma cases was it possible to identify the agent. Nocardia
		"brasiliensis, by far the commonest actinomycete isolated, was responsible for 13"
		"cases. Among eumycetomata, Madurella grisea was isolated from 3 cases,"
		"Scedosporium apiospermum from 2 cases, and Madurella mycetomatis from 1 case, and"
		in 7 cases the agent was not identified. Distribution by sex and age was similar
		to that reported in the literature. Feet and legs were the commonest sites
		"affected. The mean age of actinomycetoma patients was 33.2 years, while patients"
		with eumycetomata were an average of 32.8 years. Mean duration of the disease was
		6.8 and 9.8 years respectively. Most patients came from rural areas in the
		north-eastern region of the country and worked as field labourers. Bone
		involvement was frequent for both actinomycetomata and eumycetomata and was
		"characterized by osteoporosis, periostal reaction and cavitation. The authors'"
		elected treatment consists of combining sulfamethoxazole (800 mg) and

AB	-	A case of disseminated pseudallescheriasis in a German Shepherd bitch is
		"presented. Bones (ilium, a rib and phalanges), joints (elbow and acetabulum) and"
		"the surrounding tissues were the principal organs affected. In addition,"
		"Pseudallescheria boydii was isolated, in lower numbers, from the eye, kidney,"
		lymph nodes draining the affected regions and urine. The dog was euthanized. P.
		boydii was identified by morphologic characteristics and molecular techniques
		"(beta tubulin sequence). In addition, an ITS nucleotide sequence analysis showed"
		that this strain differed from another isolate identified as Scedosporium
		apiospermum that had caused a disseminated infection in another German Shepherd.
		The importance of the molecular characterization of fungi belonging to the
		"Pseudallescheria/Scedosporium complex, isolated from animals is stressed in light"
		of the ongoing attempts to recharacterize these fungi.

AB	-	We report a case of cutaneous Scedosporium apiospermum infection in an
		"immunocompromised host. S.apiospermum is an emerging opportunistic pathogen,"
		especially in organ transplant recipients. Prompt identification is critical
		because of its resistance to most antifungal drugs. Its histopathologic features
		are indistinct and overlap with those of more commonly recognized
		hyalohyphomycetes such as Aspergillus species. Cultures from infected tissue are
		generally required for correct identification. Clinicians and pathologists must
		be familiar with this organism and recognize the need for culture studies in
		addition to histopathology in the evaluation of specimens from immunocompromised
		patients with suspected fungal infection.

AB	-	This is the first documented case of post-traumatic Scedosporium inflatum
		endophthalmitis and only the second of S. inflatum endophthalmitis occurring in a
		"non-immunocompromised individual, to the authors' knowledge. A case is reported"
		"of a 57-year-old woman who, while chopping wood, had a wood chip hit her in the"
		right eye. This caused a penetrating corneal injury with uveal prolapse and
		damage to the crystalline lens. There were also vitreous and suprachoroidal
		haemorrhages. No detectable intraocular foreign material was retained. The
		"clinical manifestation of infection was delayed, but once established, it was"
		very destructive. The initially indolent endophthalmitis eventually led to loss
		of all light perception and panophthalmitis which required enucleation. The
		responsible strain of S. inflatum was found to be resistant to all antifungal
		medication in vitro.

PG	-	580-582

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Actinomycetoma caused by Nocardia usually responds well to
		"antibiotics. Emerging species of Nocardia, such as N. wallacei, can be a"
		therapeutic challenge. AIMS: Confirm the therapeutic effectivity of linezolid in
		multidrug resistant Nocardia Wallacei actinomycetoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We
		evaluated the medical management of an 18-year-old man with multidrug resistant
		actinomycetoma of the left leg caused by N. transvalensis complex treated 17
		years ago with linezolid 1200 mg a day. This bacteria was recently reclassified
		as Nocardia Wallacei by specific molecular biology technique. RESULTS: The
		infection was cured after 3 months of treatment; the patient remained
		asymptomatic for the past 17 years. No adverse effects were found. DISCUSSION:
		"Frequently, strains of N. transvalensis complex have aminoglycoside resistance;"
		"in this case, we highlight the effectiveness of linezolid for the successful"
		medical management of multidrug resistant actinomycetoma. CONCLUSION: Linezolid
		can be an alternative for the treatment of multidrug resistant Nocardia Wallacei.

PG	-	354-6
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Mycetoma is a late-stage clinical manifestation of a subcutaneous
		infection produced by bacteria (actinomycetoma) or fungi (eumycetoma). Only a few
		articles have described the morphologic appearance of this uncommon pathology on
		cytology. The distinction between eumycetoma and actinomycetoma in fine needle
		"aspiration cytology (FNAC) is as accurate as in histopathology, as demonstrated"
		in the present case. CASE: A 30-year-old man presented with a large swelling on
		his left foot with a discharging sinus. FNAC of the swelling yielded pus-like
		"material. Initial Papanicolaou and Giemsa stains showed the presence of septate,"
		branching fungal hyphae and black granules against the inflammatory background.
		The presence of fungus was confirmed by PAS stain. The species was identified as
		Exophiala jeanselmei on fungal culture. CONCLUSION: Mycotic mycetoma can be
		"accurately diagnosed by FNAC, which is a simple, inexpensive and rapid technique"
		when there is a high index of suspicion. Special stains and culture studies are
		helpful in confirmation of diagnosis and species identification.

		of mycetomas: a retrospective review from a tertiary care center.
PG	-	88-96
LID	-	10.1111/ijd.16384 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Mycetoma is a neglected tropical infectious disease which runs a
		prolonged and protracted course. Microbiological confirmation is diagnostic yet
		unreliable due to poor sensitivity and variable availability of culture
		facilities in resource poor settings. METHODS: A retrospective review was
		"performed on electronic records (histopathology, microbiology, and radiology) of"
		all patients who underwent skin biopsies with mycetoma as one of the clinical
		differential diagnoses from year 2016 to 2020. RESULTS: Out of 73 patients
		"biopsied with a differential of mycetoma, 42 fit the clinical triad of"
		"swelling-sinuses-granules. After clinical, microbiological, pathological, and"
		"radiological correlation, 31 cases were of eumycetoma and seven were of"
		actinomycetoma. Mean patient age was 37.58 ± 13.8 years with a male to female
		ratio 2.45 : 1 and mean disease duration of 11.31 ± 10.9 years. Histopathological
		findings revealed fungal hyphae in 18 cases and gram-positive bacteria in six
		cases. Fungal culture was positive in 13 cases with the three commonest organisms
		"being Madurella mycetomatis in five cases, Fusarium and Aspergillus nidulans in"
		"two cases each. X-ray changes of soft tissue, bones, and joints were seen in 25"
		"cases, and ""dot-in-circle"" sign was seen in eight of nine MRIs. CONCLUSION:"
		"Eumycetoma was more common than actinomycetoma in our setup, ratio being"
		"4.43 : 1. A clinical triad of swelling, multiple sinuses and grainy discharge"
		with any one diagnostic support (histopathology/radiology) is sufficient to make
		a definitive diagnosis of mycetoma in the absence of microbiological
		identification.

AB	-	PURPOSE: To report a case of a fungal mass misdiagnosed as a pigmented
		conjunctival melanoma. METHOD: Case report. RESULT: A 38-year-old woman was
		referred for a pigmented conjunctival lesion that was diagnosed as a melanoma.
		She had a history of a scleral buckle in that eye for retinal detachment 2 years
		before presentation. Slit-lamp examination revealed a pigmented mass from the 11-
		to 2-o'clock position. This was noted to be imbricated within the invagination of
		"a conjunctival fold from the previous surgery. The mass was removed, cultured,"
		and confirmed to be a fungal infection from Scytalidium sp. CONCLUSIONS: Scleral
		"buckles can cause folds in the conjunctiva, which can be foci for fungal"
		infection.

TI	-	Disseminated Scedosporium apiospermum infection in renal transplant recipient:
		long-term successful treatment with voriconazole: a case report.
PG	-	2033-5
AB	-	"Scedosporium apiospermum, the asexual form of Pseudallescheria boydii, is a"
		ubiquitous fungus that represents an unfrequent complication of immune
		suppression. It accounts for 20% of all non-Aspergillus mold infections in organ
		transplant recipients. The infection can be localized or disseminated in multiple
		"organs, including lungs, brain, joints, tendons, and skin, and is difficult to"
		"treat, due to resistance of S apiospermum to amphotericin B and other antifungal"
		"agents. The mortality rate is about 50%. To our knowledge, there are no"
		prospective studies or registries of transplant recipients to guide diagnosis and
		there are no evidence-based recommendations for the optimal management of this
		infection. We report a case of S apiospermum infection in a woman with renal
		transplantation. The first occurrence of infection was a solitary nodule on the
		"forearm, which was surgically excised. Two following relapses were disseminated"
		"to the knee, the Achilles tendon, and the skin of the left leg. The infection was"
		"successfully treated with voriconazole, but due to the severe iatrogenic immune"
		"suppression, a strong reduction in immunosuppressant drugs was needed."

AB	-	Hematopoietic stem-cell transplant recipients are at increased risk of developing
		invasive fungal infections. This is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. We
		report a case of a 17-year-old male patient diagnosed with severe idiopathic
		acquired aplastic anemia who developed fungal pneumonitis due to Rhizomucor sp.
		and rhinoencephalitis due to Scedosporium apiospermum 6 and 8 months after
		undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplant from an HLA-matched
		unrelated donor. Discussion highlights risk factors for invasive fungal
		"infections (i.e., mucormycosis and scedosporiosis), its clinical features, and"
		the factors that must be taken into account to successfully treat them (early
		"diagnosis, correction of predisposing factors, aggressive surgical debridement,"
		and antifungal and adjunctive therapies).

TI	-	Massive hemoptysis requiring intensive care.
PG	-	317-20
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: Massive hemoptysis can cause airway or hemodynamic compromise
		requiring intensive care. We reviewed the management and outcome of this group of
		patients in our institution. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. SETTING: Medical
		intensive care unit (MICU) in a tertiary care hospital. PATIENTS: Patients (29
		patients with 31 episodes) who were admitted to the MICU for massive hemoptysis
		(greater than 300 ml/24 h or requiring intubation) between August 1997 and April
		2001. MANAGEMENT: Patients were intensively monitored and electively intubated if
		there was danger of airway compromise. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed to
		assess the site of bleeding and patients had bronchial artery embolisation if
		deemed suitable. Patients in whom bleeding could not be controlled were referred
		"for emergency surgery. RESULTS: In 26/31 (84%) episodes, patients required"
		intubation. Bronchoscopy was more helpful in localising the bleeding (site of
		bleeding identified in 90%) than chest X-ray alone (identified site of bleeding
		in 64%). Bleeding was stopped with medical therapy in 8/31 (26%) patient;
		16/31(51%) patients were successfully treated with embolisation. Only four (13%)

		"mortality was 4/31 patients (13%). Over a 2 year follow-up, 6/27 (22%) survivors"

TI	-	Severe keratomycosis secondary to Scedosporium apiospermum.
PG	-	516-8
AB	-	PURPOSE: To report an unusual case of severe keratomycosis caused by Scedosporium
		"apiospermum without any known previous ocular injury, that resulted in a corneal"
		"perforation, which was treated with an emergency penetrating tectonic"
		keratoplasty and later with phacoemulsification and astigmatic keratotomy to
		restore good visual function. METHODS: A 45-year-old woman with a history of
		multiple sclerosis presented with a severe and refractory corneal abscess in her
		right eye without any known prior injury. Corneal scrapings were obtained and
		stained for microscopic evaluation. The samples were sent for aerobic and
		anaerobic bacterial and fungal cultures. RESULTS: Microbiologic examination of
		the corneal scraping showed Scedosporium apiospermum micelle. The fungal culture
		"was sensitive to miconazole, itraconazole and voriconazole. Partial clinical"
		"improvement was achieved with hourly topical natamycin, amphotericin B, and"
		"systemic itraconazole application, although in vitro sensitivity tests showed"
		resistance to the topical antifungal agents used. A corneal paracentral
		perforation occurred despite aggressive treatment. An emergency eccentric
		penetrating keratoplasty was performed with satisfactory results. Subsequent
		phacoemulsification and astigmatic keratotomy restored a good visual function.
		CONCLUSION: A fungal etiology should be suspected in a progressive and refractory
		corneal abscess. This report highlights the utility of microbiologic
		investigation to perform an early and accurate diagnosis. Aggressive medical
		treatment and even therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty to remove infected tissue
		could result in the maintenance of useful visual function. In view of the poor
		"prognosis of this specific fungus, a closer observation and early keratoplasty"
		might be required to preserve the ocular globe.

TI	-	Pulse therapy with amikacin and dapsone for the treatment of actinomycotic foot:
		a case report.
PG	-	742-7
AB	-	Actinomycetoma is a chronic disease caused by aerobic actinomycetes and affecting
		"the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and bones. It causes significant morbidity and"
		clinically manifests as abscesses and sinus/fistulae with or without granules.
		"Early diagnosis is based on the color, size, histopathology of the granules;"
		culture and metabolic studies are used for further species differentiation.
		Although sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim alone or in combination with dapsone for a
		"variable period of time are used as first line agents for treatment, slow"
		response to the therapy and high relapse rates have led to increasing usage of
		"alternative agents like gentamycin, amikacin and cefotaxime. We report a case of"
		actinomycetoma foot who had complete treatment failure with a
		sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim-dapsone combination and was successfully treated
		with combination therapy of amikacin and dapsone without any side effects.

		confirmed by immunohistochemistry.
PG	-	728-34
LID	-	10.1111/myc.12422 [doi]
AB	-	Chronic subcutaneous infections caused by Aspergillus species are considered to
		be extremely rare. Because these fungi are among the most common laboratory
		"contaminants, their role as eumycetoma causative agents is difficult to"
		"ascertain. Here, we report the first case of A. flavus eumycetoma confirmed by"
		"isolation, molecular identification and immunohistochemical analysis. Patient was"
		a 55-year-old male from Sudan suffering from eumycetoma on his left foot for a
		"period of 17 years. He developed swelling, sinuses and white grain discharge was"
		observed. He has been operated nine times and was treated with several regimens
		of ketoconazole and itraconazole without improvement. Initial diagnosis based on
		"histology and radiology was Scedosporium eumycetoma. However, examination of the"
		"biopsy revealed A. flavus, which was identified by molecular analysis and"
		MALDI-TOF MS. Immunohistochemistry using antibody directed against Aspergillus
		species was positive. Because of the earlier treatment failures with ketoconazole
		"and itraconazole, therapy with voriconazole was initiated. However, in vitro"
		susceptibility testing yielded a lower Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC)
		value for itraconazole (0.25 μg ml(-1) ) than for voriconazole (1 μg ml(-1) ).
		"Based on the presented results, A. flavus can be considered as one of the agents"
		of white-grain eumycetoma.

AB	-	Cunninghamella is a member of the class Zygomycetes. Cunninghamella species
		include ubiquitous filamentous fungi; infections caused by Cunninghamella species
		are less frequent but have higher mortality rates than infections caused by
		"Mucorales group members such as Rhizopus and Mucor. Herein, we reported a rare"
		fatal case of endobronchial metastasis from breast cancer accompanied with
		Cunninghamella bertholletiae tracheobronchial mycetoma. A 73-year-old female with
		a history of right-sided breast cancer who had undergone mastectomy 11 years
		previously and had no recurrence presented to our emergency department with a
		1-week history of left-sided back pain. Chest X-ray revealed left lung
		atelectasis; bronchoscopy revealed an endobronchial mass lesion in the left main
		bronchus. Pathological examination revealed fungal mycetoma but malignant lesions
		were not detected. Endobronchial and lung mycetoma caused by Cunninghamella
		bertholletiae were initially diagnosed; liposomal amphotericin B was
		"administered, but her condition deteriorated. Rigid endoscopy showed growth of"
		hemorrhagic tissue occupying the left main bronchus just under the carina.
		Pathological examination of the shaved lesion revealed metastasis from breast
		cancer covered with abundant necrotic tissue. No mold was observed in the
		necrotic tissue; this was probably due to liposomal amphotericin B treatment. To
		"our knowledge, this is the first case of endobronchial metastasis from breast"
		cancer accompanied with Cunninghamella bertholletiae mycetoma. Distinguishing
		endobronchial metastases from breast cancer and atypical presentations of
		Cunninghamella endobronchial mycetomas can be very difficult. Repeated
		bronchoscopies maybe helpful in establishing an accurate diagnosis when clinical
		prognosis does not match the initial diagnosis.

TI	-	Actinomycetoma in the United States.
PG	-	1139-50
AB	-	Actinomycetoma (Madura foot) caused by Actinomadura madurae occurred in an
		Indiana factory worker. Previous cases of culture-proven actinomycetoma from the
		United States and reports of drug therapy were reviewed. Treatment with
		"sulfonamides, streptomycin, dapsone, and other antimicrobial agents has been"
		effective. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) therapy was effective in our
		"case, but sulfadiazine was not. In vitro, SMZ was 16 times more active against"
		"the infecting strain of A. madurae than was sulfadiazine, and TMP was inactive,"
		suggesting that our patient's satisfactory treatment might have been due to SMZ
		alone. Prolonged therapy is usually necessary. Relatively simple immunologic
		procedures and antimicrobiol susceptibility tests have been useful in the
		diagnosis and management of actinomycetoma. With appropriate antimicrobial
		"therapy, surgical excision or amputation usually can be avoided. Recommendations"
		for the medical management of actinomycetoma are summarized.

PG	-	61-63
AB	-	Eumycetoma is a chronic tropical fungal disease that infiltrates subcutaneous
		"tissues, mainly in the feet and legs. Standard antifungal drugs are ineffective,"
		and mutilating surgery is common. Morphological imaging is useful for assessing
		the local extent of the disease before surgery. FDG PET/CT may be of potential
		"interest for the general extent, but PET descriptions remain scarce and mostly"
		"relate to the feet. Here, the authors present FDG PET/CT and MRI study of a very"
		"rare case of an extensive, biopsy-proven eumycetoma of the right thigh that was"
		performed to guide potential surgery.

TI	-	First reported case of Aspergillus nidulans eumycetoma in a sporotrichoid
		distribution.
PG	-	74-7
LID	-	10.1111/ijd.12571 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Mycetomas are chronic subcutaneous infections caused by either fungi
		(eumycetomas) or bacteria (actinomycetomas). Eumycetoma is commonly seen in
		"tropical and subtropical climates, usually in males working in occupations prone"
		to trauma. Aspergillus spp. are an uncommon cause of mycetomas. OBJECTIVES: We
		describe a patient with eumycetoma attributable to Aspergillus nidulans
		presenting in a sporotrichoid distribution. CASE REPORT: A 45-year-old man with
		type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension presented with multiple lumps over the
		right lower limb of four months in duration. He had initially developed a
		"solitary lesion over the right ankle, followed by multiple similar lumps which"
		had spread upwards to involve the right thigh. The entire lower limb was
		edematous. The patient denied any trauma preceding the symptoms. Biopsy revealed
		pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia with extensive granulomatous infiltrate in the
		dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Grocott-Gomorri staining revealed fungal
		elements. Culture on Sabouraud's agar revealed a whitish colony that later turned
		green. Aspergillus nidulans mycetoma in a sporotrichoid distribution was
		"diagnosed. The patient was started on oral itraconazole 200 mg twice daily, which"
		resulted in complete regression of the lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Aspergillus spp.
		"have emerged as important opportunistic pathogens, especially in immunosuppressed"
		"patients. Aspergillus nidulans occurs frequently in soil, decaying vegetation,"
		and water but has very rarely been described as a cause of mycetoma. The
		"infection responds well to treatment with itraconazole, voriconazole, and"
		amphotericin B. The current patient represents the first demonstration of
		A. nidulans mycetoma presenting in a sporotrichoid distribution.

TI	-	Disseminated Scedosporium apiospermum infection in a cystic fibrosis patient
		after double-lung transplantation.
PG	-	603-7
AB	-	Scedosporium apiospermum is a saprophytic ubiquitous filamentous fungus. It can
		"cause a wide spectrum of diseases, from localized to invasive infections. S"
		apiospermum has been described as one of the major fungal agents of chronic
		colonization of airways in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Invasive infections due
		to S apiospermum are only rarely reported in CF after lung transplantation. A
		26-year-old woman with CF and chronic bronchial colonization by S apiospermum
		developed bilateral chorioretinitis and subcutaneous nodules 4 weeks after
		double-lung transplantation (LTx). Isolates of S apiospermum from sputum samples
		before and after LTx and from vitreal fluid were typed by random amplification of
		polymorphic DNA (RAPD). The patient was treated with voriconazole (VRC). The
		patient improved with VRC given orally for 6 months. Two days after VRC
		"discontinuation, she developed sub-acute meningitis (isolation of S apiospermum"
		"from the cerebrospinal fluid). She was again given VRC, but died 23 days later"
		from uncontrolled fungal infection. Molecular typing of clinical isolates of S
		apiospermum performed by RAPD demonstrated that all isolates belonged to the same
		"genotype. S apiospermum is a frequent, but late colonizing fungal agent in CF"
		"patients. In the case of LTx, these patients can develop invasive infection due"
		"to the colonizing strain, as confirmed by molecular typing."

TI	-	A rare European case of Madura Foot due to actinomycetes.
PG	-	321-4
AB	-	We present a case of mycetoma by Actinomadura spp. on the foot of an Albanian
		young man arrived to our observation approximately 5 years after the first
		"clinical manifestations (hard tumefaction, slightly painful upon weight-bearing"
		and palpation and cutaneous fistulas that discharged an abundant granulomatous
		secretion). Direct microscopic analysis and culture of the white-yellowish grains
		"included Gram staining, which showed extensively branched Gram-positive hyphae"
		"less than 1 mm in diameter, allowing to make a diagnosis of Actinomycetoma. Since"
		"Actinomycetoma is sensitive to drug treatment, the patient was given"
		trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and amikacin twice daily for 45 days. After six
		"months of chemotherapy, the patient's general condition improved, the swelling is"
		slightly diminished and grain extrusion has ceased. The patient has been able to
		resume ambulation with normal footwear. Given the absence of liver and kidney
		"functional alterations, the patient is scheduled to continue pharmacological"
		treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

TI	-	Vertebral osteomyelitis secondary to Pseudallescheria boydii.
PG	-	361-4
AB	-	Because Pseudallescheria boydii vertebral osteomyelitis is rare and frequently
		"resistant to available antifungal agents, the proper treatment of this lesion has"
		"not been defined. To better determine the best treatment of this lesion, the"
		authors evaluated a case P. boydii vertebral osteomyelitis and reviewed the
		literature. A 48-year-old man had isolated thoracic vertebral osteomyelitis
		resulting from P. boydii and associated severe thoracic back pain and proximal
		lower extremity pain and weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging studies revealed
		continued collapse of the T6--T7 vertebrae despite previous posterior debridement
		and appropriate antifungal chemotherapy. On admission to the authors'
		"institution, the patient underwent a right thoracotomy, anterior debridement with"
		"transthoracic T6--T7 corpectomies and strut grafting, followed by posterior"
		"fusion and stabilization with pedicle screws. After operation, the patient's"
		"pain, hyperalgesia, and lower extremity symptoms resolved. He was treated with a"
		12-month course of itraconazole. Imaging and laboratory studies show no evidence
		of recurrence. P. boydii vertebral osteomyelitis can have devastating neurologic
		sequelae if not treated properly. The frequent lack of response of this unusual
		fungal infection to systemic therapy requires frequent serial follow-up
		examinations. Patients with evidence of progression on imaging studies or
		neurologic findings should undergo early and aggressive surgical debridement.

PG	-	321-4
AB	-	We report a case of fatal central nervous system infection with Scedosporium
		apiospermum (Pseudallescheria boydii) in a heart transplant recipient. This
		ubiquitous fungus is known to cause mycetoma and localized infections in patients
		with otherwise normal conditions. Disseminated infections occur rarely and are
		seen primarily in patients who are receiving immunosuppressive medications or who
		have neutropenia. Often life-threatening when infection is disseminated and
		"involves the central nervous system, this diagnosis is difficult to make rapidly"
		"because S. apiospermum (P. boydii) mimics Aspergillus spp. and Fusarium spp.,"
		"both clinically and histopathologically. Imidazoles such as miconazole, but not"
		"amphotericin B, are considered the therapeutic compounds of choice. Improved"
		diagnostic and treatment options are needed to optimize management of infections
		with S. apiospermum (P. boydii).

TI	-	Molecular identification of Phialophora oxyspora as the cause of mycetoma in a
		horse.
PG	-	84-8
AB	-	CASE DESCRIPTION: An 18-year-old mare was evaluated for an oral mass that
		"developed after extraction of a broken incisor. CLINICAL FINDINGS: An ulcerated,"
		"firm, darkly pigmented, approximately 5-cm-diameter spherical mass involved the"
		gingiva lateral and dorsal to the right first to third maxillary incisors.
		Osteolysis of the roots of the first and second right maxillary incisors and
		periosteal proliferation of the adjacent premaxilla margins were apparent on
		radiographs. Histologic examination of the mass revealed multiple coalescing and
		"ramifying foci of abscess formation, each containing a well-defined, discrete,"
		"black mass (2 to 7 mm in diameter). Myriad fungal hyphae enmeshed in a black,"
		"granular, cementlike material were within each of the black structures. Mycetoma"
		was the histologic diagnosis. The causative agent could not be identified via
		culture because of lack of distinguishing characteristics. Fungal DNA was
		isolated from frozen fungal cultures and paraffin sections. The D1/D2 domains of
		the large subunit P gene rDNA were amplified and sequenced. The sequences of the
		D1/D2 domains of both isolates were 96% homologous with those of Phialophora
		"oxyspora. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME: The mass was surgically excised, the local area"
		"curetted, and the wound allowed to heal by second intention. Postoperative"
		treatment consisted of administration of phenylbutazone and IV administration of
		sodium iodide followed by oral administration of potassium iodide. There was no
		evidence of recurrence 1 year later. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Mycetomata should be a
		differential diagnosis for equine gingival masses. Identification of the fungal
		agent can be critical for selection of optimal treatments. Molecular methods may
		permit definitive identification when standard phenotypic-based identification
		criteria are inconclusive.

LID	-	10.2169/internalmedicine.8771-16 [doi]
AB	-	Allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis (ABPM) is a pulmonary hypersensitivity disease
		mainly caused by Aspergillus fumigatus. The mainstay treatment for ABPM is
		systemic corticosteroid therapy. A 25-year-old man presented with pulmonary
		"infiltrates. His peripheral eosinophil, total serum IgE, and serum"
		Aspergillus-specific IgE levels were elevated. The patient tested positive in a
		"skin test for Aspergillus. However, sputum cultures revealed a Curvularia lunata"
		"infection. We therefore diagnosed ABPM possibly caused by C. lunata, which is"
		rare in Japan. The clinical state of the patient improved under observation.
		Identification of the causative fungus is an important aspect of the ABPM
		diagnosis.

PG	-	1319-24
AB	-	Invasive mold infections (IMIs) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality
		in patients who are undergoing bone marrow transplantation (BMT). To examine the
		"epidemiology, risk factors, and outcome of IMIs in allogeneic BMT recipients, all"
		cases of mold infection among 94 adult patients who underwent allogeneic BMT at
		this institution from 1 January 1997 through 31 December 1998 were reviewed
		retrospectively. Fifteen cases of IMI were identified; infection occurred a
		median of 102 days after BMT. Aspergillus species was the most common cause of
		"disease, and species other than Aspergillus fumigatus were present in 53% of"
		"patients. By multivariate analysis, the variable associated with infection risk"
		was systemic glucocorticosteroid use. Prophylactic antifungal therapy that was
		targeted to high-risk patients had little effect on disease incidence. These
		observations suggest that early identification of high-risk patients and better
		"approaches to prevention should be explored, to reduce incidence and severity of"
		disease in this population.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Mycetoma is a chronic granulomatous subcutaneous infection caused by
		anaerobic pseudofilamentous bacteria or fungi. It is commonly prevalent in
		tropical and subtropical countries. Men are more susceptible to the disease due
		to greater participation in agricultural works. Mycetoma commonly involves lower
		"extremities, wherein untreated cases lead to aggressive therapeutic choices, such"
		as amputation of the affected body organs and consequently lifelong disability.
		"CASE PRESENTATION: In this report, we present the rare case of a 58-year-old man,"
		originally from Algeria with a left foot chronic tumefaction of 5 years. In the
		"initial clinical examination, mycetoma was diagnosed based on tumefaction and the"
		presence of multiple sinuses with the emission of white grains. The latter was
		observed via direct examination. The histopathological analysis demonstrated an
		"actinomycetoma caused by bacteria, as the etiological agent. Imaging showed a"
		bone involvement with osteolysis at the levels of 2nd to 4th metatarsal
		diaphysis. The mycological and bacterial cultures were both negative. For an
		"accurate diagnosis, the obtained grains were subjected to molecular analysis,"
		targeting the 16S-rDNA gene. Molecular identification yielded Actinomadura
		"madurae as the causal agent, and 800/160 mg of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole was"
		"prescribed twice a day for 1 year, as a treatment. CONCLUSION: Considering low"
		"information about this disease, especially in non-endemic areas, it is of high"
		importance to enhance the knowledge and awareness of clinicians and healthcare
		"providers, in particular in the countries with immigration issues."

AB	-	Although opportunistic fungal infections occur commonly in immunocompromised
		"hosts, mycetoma has never been reported in association with HIV infection. The"
		authors present a case that to their knowledge is the first reported case of
		mycetoma associated with HIV infection. Diagnosis was confirmed by direct

		"agent, an actinomycete, was not possible. The unusual site of infection may"
		probably be related to the use of contaminated needless and syringes for HIV drug

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Mycetomas are frequent subcutaneous mycoses with typical clinical
		"characteristics such as sinuses, blood-stained, serous, or purulent exudates as"
		well as local swelling. Even though the most commonly affected areas are the
		"lower limbs, we report four cases affecting the neck and midback regions, of"
		which three were young females. We draw attention to the importance of early
		identification of these cases for prevention and specific treatment in order to
		avoid severe consequences or irreversible complications such as quadriplegia.
		OBJECTIVE: To document the occurrence of cervical spine and middle dorsal
		"thoracic mycetomas, as well as their severity, clinical manifestations, and"
		secondary complications. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was an observational and
		descriptive study in which we reviewed cases with neck and middle dorsal thoracic
		"mycetomas diagnosed at the Acapulco General Hospital of Guerrero State, Mexico."
		"We describe the cases including the mechanism of inoculation, neurological"
		"symptoms, and severity. CONCLUSIONS: We describe three cases initially diagnosed"
		clinically as cervical mycetomas and one in the middle dorsal thoracic region.
		All the cases were diagnosed at the Acapulco General Hospital of Guerrero State
		in Mexico.

TI	-	Successful treatment of Scedosporium apiospermum soft tissue abscess with

AB	-	We report the case of a 53-year-old female patient with refractory acute myeloid
		"leukemia developing a necrotic, soft tissue abscess on the right forearm caused"
		by Scedosporium apiospermum during prolonged severe neutropenia (absolute white
		blood cell count <500/μL for 49 days). In the context of the severely
		immunocompromised state of the patient and her need for allogeneic hematopoietic
		"stem cell transplantation (HSCT), surgical treatment options were not favored."
		"Therefore, combined antifungal therapy with voriconazole and caspofungin was"
		"started, based on the results of the in vitro testing (minimum inhibitory"
		"concentrations of voriconazole, posaconazole, and amphotericin B: 1, 4, and"
		">2mg/L, respectively). The local site of infection slowly improved clinically and"
		"no spread of S. apiospermum infection to other sites was observed. After HSCT,"
		the soft tissue abscess resolved completely and the patient has remained free of
		S. apiospermum infection since then. We successfully demonstrate that the use of
		combined antifungal therapy with voriconazole and casopfungin may further improve
		the clinical course and provides a promising therapeutic option to treat
		Scedosporium infections in such patients.

TI	-	Nasal infection with Scedosporium apiospermum in a dog.
PG	-	81-3
AB	-	CASE HISTORY: A 2-year-old female Siberian Husky was presented with a 6-month
		history of sneezing and mucous discharge from the right nostril. CLINICAL
		FINDINGS: Reduced airflow through the right nostril was evident. Radiographs
		showed subtle loss of detail of turbinates within the right nasal chamber.
		Rhinoscopy revealed swollen and erythematous turbinates and a white mass within
		"the caudal aspect of the right nasal cavity. Histopathologically, there was a"
		"heavy mixed inflammatory infiltrate in the submuscosa of the right turbinate, and"
		the presence of fungal hyphae and spores in the white mass. A heavy growth of
		Scedosporium apiospermum was cultured from the mass. DIAGNOSIS: Chronic rhinitis
		of the right nasal cavity and infection with S. apiospermum. CLINICAL RELEVANCE:
		This is the first reported case of S. apiospermum isolated from the nasal cavity
		of a dog in New Zealand. Fungal culture is necessary to differentiate this fungus
		from Aspergillus spp.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Mycetoma is a neglected, chronic, localized, progressively"
		"destructive, granulomatous infection caused either by fungi (eumycetoma) or by"
		aerobic actinomycetes (actinomycetoma). It is characterized by a triad of
		"painless subcutaneous mass, multiple sinuses and discharge containing grains."
		Mycetoma commonly affects young men aged between 20 and 40 years with low
		"socioeconomic status, particularly farmers and herdsmen. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL"
		"FINDINGS: A 30 year-old male farmer from an ethnic minority in Phin District,"
		"Savannakhet Province, Lao PDR (Laos) developed a painless swelling with multiple"
		draining sinuses of his right foot over a period of approximately 3 years. X-ray
		of the right foot showed osteolysis of tarsals and metatarsals. Aerobic culture
		of sinus discharge yielded large numbers of Staphylococcus aureus and a slow
		growing Gram-positive rod. The organism was subsequently identified as Nocardia
		aobensis by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. The patient received antimicrobial
		treatment with amikacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole according to consensus
		treatment guidelines. Although slight improvement was noted the patient left the
		hospital after 14 days and did not take any more antibiotics. Over the following
		22 weeks the swelling of his foot subsequently diminished together with healing
		of discharging sinuses. CONCLUSION: This is the first published case of
		Actinomycetoma caused by Nocardia aobensis and the second case of Actinomycetoma
		from Laos. A treatment course of only 14 days with amikacin and
		"trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was apparently sufficient to cure the infection,"
		although long-term treatment up to one year is currently recommended. Treatment
		trials or prospective descriptions of outcome for actinomycetoma should
		"investigate treatment efficacy for the different members of Actinomycetales,"
		"particularly Nocardia spp., with short-term and long-term treatment courses."

TI	-	Pulmonary mycetoma caused by an atypical isolate of Paecilomyces species in an
		immunocompetent individual: case report and literature review of Paecilomyces
		lung infections.
PG	-	607-11
AB	-	The first case of pulmonary fungus ball caused by Paecilomyces species is
		reported. The diagnosis was established by isolation of the fungus in culture
		from specimens obtained by percutaneous transthoracic needle aspiration in an
		"immunocompetent individual. The isolate was atypical, as it failed to produce"
		fruiting structures on routine mycological media. Identification was achieved by
		sequencing polymorphisms of the internal transcriber spacer regions of the
		ribosomal DNA. The antifungal susceptibility profile was also determined. This
		report underscores the increasing importance of Paecilomyces species in human
		infections. Paecilomyces should be included among the etiological agents of
		pulmonary mycetoma.

TI	-	Mycetoma revisited. Incidence of various radiographic signs.
PG	-	529-33
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To define and quantitate various radiographic signs of mycetoma
		infection. METHODS: A retrospective study of 516 randomly selected patients seen
		between December 1996 and December 2004 at the Mycetoma Research Centre of
		"Khartoum University, Khartoum, Sudan. All cases were confirmed by clinical"
		"examination, initial pretreatment radiographs, and histopathology. RESULTS: The"
		"most common abnormalities in these 516 patients were soft tissue swelling (93%),"
		"bone sclerosis (56%), bone cavities (32%), and periosteal reaction (27%). The"
		"incidence of bone expansion (22%), extrinsic cortical scalloping (22%), and"
		fanning of the rays in 10% were reported. Osteoporosis was seen in 19%. Only 3%
		of the patients had normal radiographs. CONCLUSION: Maximal scrutiny of
		"radiographs alone by experienced radiologists is vital, as other imaging"
		techniques are not available where mycetoma is prevalent.

AB	-	Optimal staging and evaluation of residual lesions of invasive fungal infections
		(IFIs) are major challenges in the immunocompromised host. Preliminary data have
		suggested that [¹⁸F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([¹⁸F]FDG) uptake may be observed in the
		course of active invasive fungal infections. The aim of this study was to assess
		the role of positron emission tomography with [¹⁸F]FDG ([¹⁸F]FDG-PET) in the
		diagnosis and staging of IFI. A prospective monocentric study evaluating
		[¹⁸F]FDG-PET in 30 consecutive adults and children with European Organization for
		Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group probable or proven IFI was
		"performed. Twenty males and ten females (median age, 45 years (range 6-7 years))"
		"were enrolled. Twenty-six were immunocompromised, as follows: haematological"
		"malignancy (18) with allogeneic stem cell transplantation (16/18), solid tumour"
		"(three), solid organ transplantation (two), diabetes mellitus (two) and cystic"
		"fibrosis (one). IFIs were acute invasive aspergillosis (ten), chronic"
		"disseminated candidiasis (ten), zygomycosis (two), black grains eumycetoma (two),"
		"pulmonary Histoplasma capsulatum var. capsulatum histoplasmosis (two), and"
		"Phomopsis sp. osteoarthritis, Scedosporium apiospermum and Candida krusei"
		"spondylodiscitis, and acute pulmonary coccidioidomycosis in one case each. An"
		increased uptake of [¹⁸F]FDG was observed in all areas previously identified by
		computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging to be involved by IFI. In
		"4/10 chronic disseminated candidiasis cases, [¹⁸F]FDG-PET revealed small splenic"
		abscesses that were unapparent on the corresponding computed tomography scan.
		[¹⁸F]FDG uptake disappeared after 6 months of antifungal therapy in three
		patients with chronic disseminated candidiasis for whom the [¹⁸F]FDG-PET was
		performed to assess the evolution of the disease. [¹⁸F]FDG-PET could potentially
		be useful for the initial diagnosis and staging of IFI. Whether or not
		[¹⁸F]FDG-PET might be useful for assessing the optimal duration of IFI therapy
		should now be assessed in a specific prospective study.

TI	-	Pathology of hyalohyphomycosis caused by Scedosporium apiospermum
		(Pseudallescheria boydii): an emerging mycosis.
PG	-	1266-72
AB	-	The genus Scedosporium contains two medically significant species of emerging
		"mycotic agents, S. apiospermum and S. prolificans, which have received scant"
		"attention. Scedosporium apiospermum is the anamorph, or asexual state, of the"
		"cosmopolitan fungus Pseudallescheria boydii, with both sharing the same risk"
		"factors for infection, clinical spectrum, and histopathologic features."
		"Scedosporium prolificans is a recently recognized agent of bone, soft tissue, and"
		joint infections that occurs with highest frequency in children and young adults.
		S. prolificans may also cause potentially fatal disseminated infections in
		immunocompromised persons. The drug sensitivities of both Scedosporium species
		"are significantly different from those of most other fungi, and thus"
		"identification of these organisms is important. Unfortunately, the pathological"
		features of Scedosporium infections may be easily confused with other mycotic
		"agents, resulting in delayed or inappropriate medical therapy. Because many"
		pathologists and clinicians are unfamiliar with the significance of Scedosporium
		"spp. infection, this communication describes three persons with differing"
		clinical and pathological presentations of S. apiospermum infection. In one
		"patient with sickle cell disease and chronic mycotic sinusitis, fungal colonies"
		of S. apiospermum removed from the sinuses showed a pattern of alternating zones
		"of mycelial hypercellularity and hypocellularity associated with conidiation,"
		similar to a previous report of P. boydii infection. The clinicopathologic
		"features of an immunocompetent person with S. apiospermum osteomyelitis, and a"
		patient with S. apiospermum infection of the brain after bone marrow
		"transplantation, are also described."

PG	-	903-9
AB	-	Although widely employed for well over a century as a procedure for reducing the
		"capacity of the thoracic cavity, thoracoplasty in current practice has become a"
		"rarity. A retrospective analysis of 37 patients (29 men, 8 women) who underwent"
		the procedure under the care of one thoracic surgeon in a 16-year period provides
		the basis for this presentation. Ages ranged from 23 to 82 years with a mean age
		of 58 +/- 12.8. The mean follow-up was 8.5 years. Nineteen patients underwent the
		procedure for complications after lung resection for lung cancer. There were four
		perioperative deaths in this group (21.1%) and 6 long-term survivors (31.6%).
		Eighteen patients without lung cancer underwent thoracoplasty as a planned
		"treatment or for complications. There were no perioperative deaths, two late"
		"deaths, and 16 long-term survivors (88.9%) in the group. In the entire series,"
		the overall perioperative mortality rate was 10.8% with no major long-term
		morbidity. Although proper timing and proper patient selection are essential in
		the use of thoracoplasty as a procedure to cope with the septic complications of
		"lung cancer resection, it is overall a safe and successful procedure that has a"
		relatively low mortality and that leads to considerable improvement in quality of
		life.

PG	-	425-35
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-015-9861-x [doi]
AB	-	Subcutaneous mycoses are a group of fungal infections of dermis and subcutaneous
		"tissue which consist of sporotrichosis, chromoblastomycosis, phaeohyphomycosis,"
		"hyalohyphomycosis, mycetoma, subcutaneous zygomycosis, rhinosporidiosis,"
		lobomycosis and disseminated penicilliosis. A total of 46 consecutive patients

		know the prevalence of subcutaneous mycoses in this eastern part of Assam. Direct
		"microscopy in 10 and 40 % KOH, histopathological examination of biopsied tissue,"
		colony characteristics on Sabourauds dextrose agar media both at 25 and 37 °C and
		detailed morphology of each fungus on lactophenol cotton blue mount were the
		basis of identification of the fungi. Subcutaneous mycoses were confirmed in 32.6
		"% (n = 15) cases. Out of 15 positive cases of subcutaneous mycoses,"
		"chromoblastomycosis was detected in six cases (n = 40 %), hyalohyphomycosis in"
		"three cases (n = 20 %), and lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis, disseminated"
		"penicilliosis and mycetoma in two cases each (n = 13.3 % each). In this study,"
		seven different species of fungus were found to be responsible for five different
		"clinical types of subcutaneous mycosis. Cladosporium cladosporioides, Bipolaris"
		"spicifera and Curvularia lunata were responsible for chromoblastomycosis,"
		"Fusarium oxysporum and Aspergillus terreus for hyalohyphomycosis, C. lunata for"
		"mycetoma, Sporothrix schenckii for lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis and Penicillium"
		marneffei for disseminated penicilliosis. C. cladosporioides and C. lunata were
		the commonest black fungi causing subcutaneous mycosis in this sub-Himalayan
		"belt. Rare species C. cladosporioides, B. spicifera and C. lunata were found to"
		be causing chromoblastomycosis in this study.

		Medical Treatment and Surgical Excision with Graft Reconstruction.
PG	-	e111
LID	-	10.5001/omj.2020.29 [doi]
AB	-	"Mycetoma, formerly known as Madura foot, is a chronic, localized, gradually"
		"increasing in size, granulomatous exogenous infection of the skin and"
		subcutaneous tissue with risks of bone and visceral involvement. It is unevenly
		found worldwide but it is endemic in tropical and subtropical countries. Two
		groups of mycetoma exist with similar clinical presentation; eumycetoma due to
		"true fungi, and actinomycetoma due to aerobic bacteria from actinomycomycetes"
		species. Mycetoma is difficult to treat and can lead to serious sequelae
		"including disability, deformity and even death, so early diagnosis and treatment"
		can elicit good results. The diagnosis is made based on a clinical picture of a
		"triad of painless tumefaction, draining sinuses and granules of the causative"
		micro-organism along with direct microscopic examination and histological study.
		It is very important to distinguish between actinomycetoma and eumycetoma for
		selecting the therapy. Actinomycetomas generally respond well to antimicrobials
		"compared with eumycetomas, which respond poorly and need a combination of medical"
		"and surgical therapy. Bone involvement makes treatment more difficult, keeping"
		surgical amputation as the only choice of treatment. Despite the possibility of a
		"cure with medical treatment alone, treatment failure may occur even with"
		"long-term therapy, which necessitates adding surgical intervention to achieve"
		"cure. We report a case of gluteal actinomycetoma in an Omani man, treated"
		successfully by combined medical treatment and surgical excision with graft
		reconstruction after failure of different regimens of antimicrobials.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Mycetoma is generally understood to be a chronic suppurative
		infection involving the skin and the underlying tissue. Mycetomas may be
		classified as those produced by true fungi (eumycetoma) versus those due to
		aerobic bacteria Actinomycetales (actinomycetoma). METHODS: We report the
		atypical case of a mycetomatoid infection of the penile shaft and glans in a
		"36-year-old man, originally from Senegal, affected by Takayasu's arteritis."
		RESULTS: Extensive investigations excluded any other causative pathogen other
		"than Candida albicans, and the ailment accordingly healed after fluconazole"
		monotherapy. CONCLUSION: The authors discuss the unusual site of the disease and
		the singular clinical features related to the fungal etiology and put forward
		considerations on the pathogenic role of common microorganisms.

AB	-	Craniocerebral maduromycetoma is extremely rare. The authors describe a case of
		"maduromycetoma involving the left parietal cortex, bone, and subcutaneous tissue"
		in a young male farm laborer who presented with left parietal scalp swelling that
		had progressed into a relentlessly discharging sinus. Computed tomography (CT)
		scanning of his brain revealed osteomyelitis of the parietal bone with an
		"underlying homogeneously enhancing tumor. Intraoperatively, the mass was revealed"
		"to be a black lesion involving the bone, dura mater, and underlying cerebral"
		cortex. It was friable and separated from the surrounding brain by a thick
		"gliotic scar. Gross-total excision was performed, and the patient was placed on a"
		"6-week regimen of itraconazole. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first"
		instance of cerebral mycetoma with CT findings reported in the literature.

AB	-	Primary cutaneous infections with Nocardia asteroides are rare and have been
		"reported in immunocompromised patients. Herein, we report a case of primary"
		cutaneous Nocardia asteroides mycetoma of the skin in an immunocompetent
		individual. The infection was treated successfully with
		trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Because a prolonged incubation time is required
		for the cultures and since additional biochemical tests are necessary for
		"identification of this species, the clinician should alert the microbiology"
		laboratory when such an infection is suspected clinically.

		schoenleinii in a 15-year-old girl from Senegal. The lesion was not associated
		with tinea capitis. Long-term antifungal therapy with itraconazole and
		terbinafine was unsuccessful but a favourable outcome was obtained after surgical
		"removal of the lesion. Between 1973 and 1999, only 12 previous cases of"
		dermatophyte pseudomycetoma of the scalp were reported in the literature.
		Clinical features and therapeutic outcomes of these cases are reviewed.

AB	-	The first case of feline true mycetoma because of a dermatophyte has been
		"reported in this manuscript, although pseudomycetoma has been described in dogs"
		and cats. The patient was a 9-year-old castrated male Persian cat weighing 4.2 kg
		with subcutaneous nodules on the dorsal trunk. Physical examination revealed two
		subcutaneous nodules (2.5 x 5.0 cm and 3.5 x 5.0 cm in size) that drained
		purulent exudates with cement-like substances containing yellowish granules. The
		impression smear of the yellowish granules demonstrated by PAS staining that they
		were masses of fungal septated hyphae (3-4 mum of width). From the nodular
		"inflammation with fibrosis, fistulae draining from deep tissue and many grains"
		"containing abundant hyphal filaments, the case was diagnosed as mycetoma,"
		complying with the definitive criteria of mycetoma. The etiologic fungus was
		molecularly as well as morphologically identified as Microsporum canis.

AB	-	Fungal infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients during
		chemotherapeutic treatments and malignant hematologic disease. We present a case
		of a double fungal infection with disseminated Acremonium strictum (A. strictum)
		and pulmonary Aspergillus fumigatus (A. fumigatus) and its rapid clinical course.
		A 17-year-old boy with prolonged neutropenia developed a disseminated fungal
		infection during induction chemotherapy of his acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The
		infection was rapidly lethal despite neutrophil recovery and early antifungal
		combination therapy with amphotericin B and caspofungin. Since there are only a
		"few reports about invasive Acremonium infections, we present this case with"
		regard to differences in the clinic pathologic features of Aspergillosis and
		other opportunistic fungal infections due to Fusarium or Acremonium species.

AB	-	We describe a case of mycetoma which typified the classic presentation of the
		disease: a male farmer with affection of the lower limbs and a history of trauma.
		The patient presented with a swollen right lower limb showing multiple
		"discharging sinuses for 25 years. Histopathologically, grains were found by HE"
		"stain, and clustered yeast-like cells were observed by PAS stain. The distinctive"
		"'dot-in-circle' sign was found through MRI. Besides Nocardia otitidiscaviarum,"
		"Pseudozyma aphidis was isolated from deep tissue culture, and the identification"
		"of the etiologic species was ascertained by DNA sequencing. Generally speaking,"
		"Nocardia otitidiscaviarum is an infrequent cause of mycetoma, and Pseudozyma"
		species are usually isolated from plant material rather than clinical specimens.
		This is the first case of mycetoma from which both Nocardia otitidiscaviarum and
		Pseudozyma aphidis were isolated.

TI	-	Bone and joint infection after traumatic implantation of Scedosporium prolificans
		treated with voriconazole and surgery.
PG	-	980-2
AB	-	Scedosporium prolificans is an environmental mould that may cause local infection
		"in bone and joints after traumatic implantation, or generalized infection in"
		"immunocompromised patients. The fungus is highly drug resistant, both in vitro"
		and in vivo. We present a case of osteomyelitis and arthritis caused by S.
		prolificans in a 9-y-old boy whose knee had been punctured by a hawthorn spike.
		Treatment with different drugs was difficult and arthrodesis was necessary.
		"Concomitantly, voriconazole was given, and after three months bone biopsies were"
		sterile despite a high in vitro MIC-value of the fungus against voriconazole.
		Reversible skin depigmentation and fingernail oncholysis appeared toward the end
		of 17 months of voriconazole treatment. Twelve months after discontinuation of
		"treatment, no signs of relapse were detected. CONCLUSION: Voriconazole may be a"
		valuable adjunct to surgical treatment of bone and joint infection by
		Scedosporium prolificans.

AB	-	Scedosporium prolificans has been increasingly recognized as an etiological agent
		of disseminated mycelial infections in profoundly immunocompromised patients.
		Reported herein is a case of disseminated S. prolificans infection in a patient
		undergoing anti-neoplastic chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia. Antemortem
		"blood culture yielded S. prolificans, which was confirmed on conventional"
		morphological examination and polymerase chain reaction-based DNA sequencing
		targeting internally transcribed spacer regions. Histopathology of autopsy
		"specimens indicated fungal infection in the heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, spleen,"
		"pancreas and gastrointestinal tract, with the development of hemorrhagic and"
		ischemic necrosis. The infecting fungus had developing septate hyphae and was
		"identified as belonging to the genus Scedosporium, on in situ hybridization of"
		tissue. The combination of haphazardly branching hyphae and lemon-shaped conidia
		appeared to be the most useful distinguishing features to allow differentiation
		of this fungus from other filamentous fungi in tissue. Three other unique
		histopathological characteristics of the fungus were noted: (i) parallel hyphae
		bridged at right angles to produce letter-H patterns; (ii) intravascular
		"conidiation; and (iii) purple conidia in tissue, though these are usually"
		"described as brown in most text books. Precise histopathology, in addition to"
		"other techniques such as in situ hybridization, can aid in the identification of"
		etiological fungi.

AB	-	This report describes a fatal case of central nervous system pseudallescheriasis.
		A 32 year old white man presented with headache and meningismus 15 days after
		nearly drowning in a swine sewage reservoir. Computerised tomography and magnetic
		"resonance imaging of the head revealed multiple brain granulomata, which vanished"
		"when steroid and broad spectrum antimicrobial and antifungal agents, in addition"
		"to dexamethasone, were started. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis disclosed a"
		"neutrophilic meningitis. Treatment with antibiotics and amphotericin B, together"
		"with fluconazole and later itraconazole, was ineffective. Miconazole was added"
		"through an Ommaya reservoir, but was insufficient to halt the infection."
		Pseudallescheria boydii was finally isolated and identified in cerebrospinal
		"fluid cultures, a few days before death, three and a half months after the"
		symptoms began. Diagnosis was delayed because of a reduction in the lesions after
		"partial treatment, which prevented a stereotactic biopsy. Physicians should be"
		"aware of this condition, and provide prompt stereotactic biopsy. Confirmed cases"
		"should perhaps be treated with voriconazole, probably the most effective,"
		currently available treatment for this agent.

TI	-	Successful medical treatment of an Aspergillus terreus mycetoma of the
		nostril/lip in a 16-year-old Fjord pony gelding with pituitary pars intermedia
		dysfunction.
PG	-	629-e155
LID	-	10.1111/vde.12471 [doi]
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Mycetoma is a chronic, proliferative lesion of cutaneous/subcutaneous"
		tissue characterized by draining tracts and granules in the discharge caused by
		actinomycetes (actinomycetoma) or filamentous fungi (eumycotic mycetoma).
		OBJECTIVES: This case report describes the unusual finding of a cutaneous
		mycetoma of the lateral wing of the right nostril in a gelding. ANIMAL: A
		16-year-old Fjord gelding with suspected pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction
		"(PPID) was presented for evaluation of a nonpainful, firm and raised mass"
		involving the lateral wing of the right nostril and the lip. METHODS AND RESULTS:
		Cytological examination of the mass showed marked pyogranulomatous inflammation
		and histopathological examination revealed a fungal mycetoma. Fungal culture
		"identified the causative organism as Aspergillus terreus, which is not known for"
		its propensity to cause either dermal granulomas or mycetoma in domestic animals.
		"Further investigation, including a TRH stimulation test, led to a diagnosis of"
		"PPID (Cushing's disease), which may have led to immunosuppression of the animal"
		and increased susceptibility to infection. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE:
		The horse was treated medically with pergolide for the PPID and oral potassium
		"iodide for the fungal infection, with good therapeutic response and no relapse"
		after five months. Surgical debridement or excision was not performed. To the
		"best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first case report of a cutaneous"
		mycetoma caused by A. terreus in a horse.

PG	-	508-9
AB	-	PURPOSE: To report fungal infection complicating Acanthamoeba keratitis. METHODS:
		Case report. A 45-year-old woman with contact lens-related bilateral Acanthamoeba
		"keratitis developed corneal ulcer, corneal perforation, and mature cataract in"
		"the left eye, which was managed by penetrating keratoplasty, lensectomy, and"
		vitrectomy. RESULTS: Histopathologic examination of the keratoplasty specimen
		from the left eye revealed extensive lamellar stromal necrosis with the
		coexistence of both empty cysts and branching hyphae. Cultures from the
		keratoplasty specimen grew Scedosporium apiospermum. CONCLUSION: Keratomycosis
		caused by S. apiospermum may complicate protracted Acanthamoeba keratitis.

PG	-	79-84
AB	-	Pseudallescheria (Petriellidium) boydii is the most frequent etiologic agent of
		"mycetoma in temperate regions of the world. In addition, it may also occur as a"
		systemic infection in immunocompromised patients. Infection of the central
		"nervous system is rare, and only eleven cases of Pseudallescheria brain abscess"
		have been documented. We report a leukemic patient in whom disseminated
		pseudallescheriasis was diagnosed only after death. This case is unique in that a
		"white matter cavitation was present containing a fungoma of Pseudallescheria, the"
		first report of a cerebral fungus ball caused by this organism. The previous
		"cases of Pseudallescheria brain abscess are reviewed, and the histopathologic"
		features of Pseudallescheria which permit its differentiation from Aspergillus
		and other fungi are discussed.

PG	-	731-3
AB	-	Twenty nine cases of central nervous system infection due to Monosporium
		apiospermum have been reported. Six of them occurred after an aspiration
		pneumonia following a near drowning. The case of a 53 year old man is reported: M
		"apiospermum was isolated from cerebrospinal fluid, sputum, urine and from the mud"
		of the ditch where the patient had fallen. Though the treatment used recommended
		"doses of intravenous, intrathecal and intraventricular amphotericin B, it was"
		ineffective and the patient died 97 days after the near drowning. Necropsy showed
		that the ventricular infectious process was more prominent distant from the
		antifungal ventricular source.

TI	-	Mycetoma of the hand.
PG	-	352-4
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To describe the incidence and radiographic signs of hand infection in
		mycetoma. METHODS: A retrospective review was carried out from the radiographic
		records of 516 confirmed cases of mycetoma seen between January 1994 and October
		"2002 at the referred outpatient clinic of the Mycetoma Research Center, Soba"
		"Teaching Hospital, Khartoum University, Khartoum, Sudan. RESULTS: The hands were"
		involved in 24 (4.6%) of the 516 patients. The wrist was involved in 9 (1.7%).
		Total involvement of the hand and wrist together was 33 (6.4%) of the 516
		"patients. Radiographic signs included fanning of the metacarpals, bone erosions,"
		"sclerosis, periostitis and soft tissue swelling. The most common sign was soft"
		tissue swelling in 29 (88%) while bones were involved in 15 (45%) of the 33
		patients. CONCLUSION: Hand infection in this series is less than previous
		reports. A wide range of radiographic signs is reported in hand mycetoma. This is
		the first detailed report of the radiographic findings in mycetoma of the hand.
		Early detection of mycetoma infection is important to avoid the need for
		amputation if diagnosis is delayed.

PG	-	56-8

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Mycetoma is a chronic subcutaneous mycosis caused by exogenous fungi
		or actinomycetes. This infection has a progressive course and shows a typical
		"clinical characteristic of tumefaction, draining sinuses, and grains. Infection"
		"initiation is related to local trauma and can spread to muscle, underlying bone,"
		and adjacent organs. Nocardia brasiliensis is the most frequent actinomycete
		"isolated, while N. caviae is a rare agent. METHODS: We present a case of mycetoma"
		in a 37-year-old African-American man on the right hand. The infection had been
		apparent for four years prior to the consultation. When the infection did not
		"respond to antibiotic therapy, the patient was referred to the Dermatology"
		department. Routine laboratory studies were normal. X-ray examination of the hand
		"showed an osteolytic lesion on the hand bones. On skin biopsy culture, on"
		"Sabouraud Dextrose Agar at 28 degrees C, a colony was isolated which was further"
		identified as N. caviae by biochemical and hydrolysis testing. RESULTS: The
		patient was treated with oral trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMZ) 160/800 mg
		"twice a day for 10 months. Four months after the beginning of the therapy, the"
		subject exhibited clinical improvement and functional recovery of the hand.
		Five-year follow-up X-ray examination of the hand showed no osteolytic lesion on
		the hand bones. CONCLUSION: We report the first mycetoma case caused by N. caviae
		in our country with an unusual location on the hand. The patient showed clinical
		improvement with oral TMP/SMZ.

		infection presenting with endophthalmitis.
PG	-	330-4
AB	-	The incidence of disseminated infection with Scedosporium species is increasing
		in patients with haematological malignancy. Two fatal cases are reported of
		patients with acute myeloid leukaemia and neutropenia who presented with
		Scedosporium endophthalmitis. Diagnosis of fungal infection was delayed as blood
		and vitreous cultures were positive only after 3 days in patient 1 and blood
		culture was positive at 7 days in patient 2. Despite antifungal therapy with
		"amphotericin B and additional fluconazole in patient 2, both patients died of"
		overwhelming fungal septicaemia. Post-mortem examination of the right globe in
		patient 1 showed haemorrhagic necrotizing chorioretinitis with numerous fungal
		"hyphae in choroidal vessels, choroid, retina and vitreous. Scedosporium species"
		are often resistant to conventional antifungal therapy including amphotericin B.
		Diagnosis is difficult and mortality in disseminated infection is high.

AB	-	We report the first documented case of a mycetoma caused by Nocardia
		yamanashiensis after the initial description of this species. The 16S-rRNA gene
		"sequence analysis was used to identify the novel species, which showed a"
		similarity of 99.9% to the gene sequence of the type strain. The case showed both
		clinical non-response and reduced susceptibility in vitro to amoxicillin plus
		"clavulanate, and it was treated successfully with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole"
		"and doxycycline. Given antibiotic resistance concerns, we suggest that"
		antimicrobial susceptibility testing should be done for the majority of Nocardia
		species without well-established resistance patterns.

PG	-	4901-3
AB	-	We report a case of eumycetoma due to Cladophialophora bantiana in a 3-year-old
		male Siberian Husky living in France. The dog presented a tumefaction on the
		"thorax and deformity of the second and third subjacent ribs, which were"
		"surgically removed. Macroscopic black granules were visible on the ribs, and"
		direct microscopic examination revealed their fungal origin. Cultures yielded
		pure colonies of C. bantiana. The identification of the causative agent was
		confirmed after amplification and sequence analysis of fungal internal
		transcribed spacers 1 and 2 and 5.8S ribosomal DNA regions. Surgery and
		antifungal treatment with oral itraconazole associated with flucytosine allowed
		apparent cure after a 10-month follow-up. Envenomation with pine processionary
		caterpillars (Thaumetopoea pityocampa) and subsequently intensive corticotherapy
		"were considered as possible predisposing factors. This is, to the best of our"
		"knowledge, the first case in which C. bantiana is identified as the causative"
		agent of eumycetoma.

TI	-	Actinomycetoma caused by Nocardiopsis dassonvillei.
PG	-	1332-4
AB	-	We report a case of mycetoma caused by Nocardiopsis dassonvillei in a 39-year-old
		man. He had multiple nodules and draining sinuses on the anterior aspect of his
		right leg just below the knee. Few cream-colored granules were seen in the
		"exudate. The biopsy specimen showed gram-positive, non-acid-fast granules with"
		distinct borders. An aerobic actinomycete isolated from the lesion was identified
		as N dassonvillei. We think that this is the first reported case of mycetoma
		caused by N dassonvillei.

TI	-	"The clinical spectrum of Exophiala jeanselmei, with a case report and in vitro"
		antifungal susceptibility of the species.
PG	-	318-27
LID	-	10.1080/13693780903148353 [doi]
AB	-	Exophiala jeanselmei is clinically redefined as a rare agent of subcutaneous
		"lesions of traumatic origin, eventually causing eumycetoma. Mycetoma is a"
		"localized, chronic, suppurative subcutaneous infection of tissue and contiguous"
		bone after a traumatic inoculation of the causative organism. In advanced stages
		"of the infection, one finds tumefaction, abscess formation and draining sinuses."
		"The species has been described as being common in the environment, but molecular"
		methods have only confirmed its occurrence in clinical samples. Current
		diagnostics of E. jeanselmei is based on sequence data of the Internal
		"Transcribed Spacer (ITS) region of ribosomal DNA (rDNA), which sufficiently"
		reflects the taxonomy of this group. The first purpose of this study was the
		re-identification of all clinical (n=11) and environmental strains (n=6)
		"maintained under the name E. jeanselmei, and to establish clinical preference of"
		the species in its restricted sense. Given the high incidence of eumycetoma in
		"endemic areas, the second goal of this investigation was the evaluation of in"
		vitro susceptibility of E.jeanselmei to eight conventional and new generations of
		"antifungal drugs to improve antifungal therapy in patients. As an example, we"
		describe a case of black grain mycetoma in a 43-year-old Thai male with several
		draining sinuses involving the left foot. The disease required extensive surgical
		excision coupled with intense antifungal chemotherapy to achieve cure. In vitro
		studies demonstrated that posaconazole and itraconazole had the highest
		antifungal activity against E. jeanselmei and E. oligosperma for which high MICs
		"were found for caspofungin. However, their clinical effectiveness in the"
		treatment of Exophiala infections remains to be determined.

PG	-	446-9

AB	-	Mycetoma is a chronic granulomatous infection of the subcutaneous tissue caused
		by fungi or fungus-like bacteria. The infection eventually spreads to bone
		"resulting in significant morbidity. Rarely, viscera may be involved through"
		"contiguous spread. It is common in tropical countries like India, though disease"
		"is worldwide in distribution. A 22-year-old male patient, a farmer by occupation,"
		"presented with multiple discharging sinuses over the left chest wall, shoulder,"
		"upper arm, and adjacent neck of eight months duration. A diagnosis of"
		actinomycetoma was made based on clinical and histopathological features as
		culture was negative for both fungus and bacteria. The patient was treated with a
		modified two-step regimen. It consisted of an intensive phase with intravenous
		gentamicin 80 mg 12th hourly and cotrimoxazole 320/1600 mg twice daily orally for
		four weeks. This was followed by a maintenance phase with oral cotrimoxazole and
		doxycycline 100 mg twice daily. Patient showed excellent response with healing of
		all sinuses after two months of therapy. Involvement of covered parts of the body
		such as chest wall and shoulders is common in actinomycetoma compared to
		eumycetoma. Early institution of long-term combination therapy with
		antimicrobials results in excellent outcome.

TI	-	Aspergillosis of the maxillary sinus associated with a zygomatic implant.
PG	-	1231-5
AB	-	BACKGROUND: The use of a specially designed implant to be anchored in the
		zygomatic bone has been proposed in the literature as an alternative to bone
		"grafting in the prosthetic rehabilitation of the severely resorbed maxilla, an"
		"option that has few postoperative complications. However, some complications can"
		"arise, such as the fungal infection the authors describe in this article. CASE"
		DESCRIPTION: The authors report a case of aspergillosis of the maxillary sinus
		"after zygomatic implant placement. Twelve months after placement of the implant,"
		"the patient returned with symptoms of sinusitis, and a computed tomographic scan"
		showed failure in zygomatic implant osseointegration and a radiopaque mass in the
		"left maxillary sinus. The implant was removed, as was a friable brownish-yellow"
		mass from the sinus. Histopathological analysis revealed a noninvasive hyphal
		"mass compatible with Aspergillus. At a 12-month follow up, the patient"
		experienced no recurrence of fungal sinusitis. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL
		IMPLICATIONS: Zygomatic implant placement is a safe surgical procedure.
		"Nevertheless, postoperative maxillary sinus infections by bacteria, virus and"
		fungus can occur and therefore need to be considered in the diagnosis of
		infection in the vicinity of dental and maxillofacial implants.

		surgery.
PG	-	4
AB	-	"A 29-year-old man, presented with multiple ulcers, nodules, abscesses, fistulae,"
		"and atrophic scars, over the right chest wall. Six years prior, the patient had a"
		"car accident, which resulted in skin loss of the right arm, shoulder, thoracic"
		"wall. In addition, he suffered a supracondylar fracture; orthopedic surgery and"
		skin grafts were required. Material discharging from sinus tracts was obtained
		for mycological and bacteriological studies. Direct microscopic examination
		revealed small white grains. Cultures on Sabouraud and Lowenstein-Jensen media
		isolated orange-white colonies suggestive of Nocardia. PCR assay identified
		Nocardia nova. Thoracic and right upper limb CT showed signs of chronic
		"osteomyelitis. Treatment with imipenem/cilastatin for 8 weeks, followed by"
		"amoxicillin clavulanate for 6 months, resulted in healing of lesions and"
		improvement in the patient's general health. Primary cutaneous nocardiosis
		remains a diagnostic challenge. Nocardia are soil-borne filamentous gram-positive
		bacteria. Identification of characteristic granules on examination of discharge
		smears from discharge or tissue biopsy is essential for diagnosing mycetoma.
		"Because grain discharge is discontinuous, multiple clinical specimens should be"
		submitted for microscopic examination and culture. Sulfonamides have been the
		"mainstay of Nocardia actinomycetoma treatment. However, our patient's strain was"
		"resistant to Co-trimoxazole. Therefore, treatment with imipenem followed by"
		"amoxicillin clavulanate was favored, with good clinical and analytical response."

PG	-	340-4
AB	-	Botryomycosis is a rare and chronic but readily treatable form of mycetoma. It is
		caused by a persistent bacterial infection and is distinguished by the formation
		of grains and multiple sinuses in the skin. The most usual cause is caused by
		Staphylococcus aureus. The authors' experience with four Transvaal cases is
		reported. In one case there was destruction of the skull and penetration of the
		cranial cavity by the botryomycotic process. Treatment with a range of common
		antistaphylococcal antibiotics led to astonishingly rapid recovery. Among the
		"drugs used, cotrimoxazole was, perhaps, the most practical."

LID	-	10.1097/ICO.0b013e318254a4c6 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: To describe the atypical presentation of fungal infection and
		"necrotizing scleritis, the potential role of histopathology in the diagnosis, and"
		surgical excision in the management. METHODS: Retrospective interventional case
		"series. RESULTS: Two patients presented with a pigmented conjunctival mass, one"
		resembling necrotizing scleritis with uveal prolapse and the other resembling a
		"pigmented ocular surface tumor, both after excision of nasal pterygium, 12 and 50"
		"years previously, respectively. The pigmented lesion was 2 × 1.5 mm in each case,"
		both situated on the bulbar surface 2 mm from the nasal limbus. After surgical
		"excision, each lesion histopathologically displayed fungal filaments (pigmented"
		dematiaceous fungi). CONCLUSIONS: Pigmented mycetoma (dematiaceous fungi) can
		"simulate uveal tissue prolapse, pigmented foreign body, or pigmented epibulbar"
		"tumors, particularly melanoma. Surgical excision of the entire lesion is"
		effective for management.

LID	-	10.1128/JCM.01470-12 [doi]
AB	-	"The first yellow-grain fungal mycetoma, in a 60-year-old man from Central Sudan,"
		is reported. Morphological and phylogenetic analysis of the ribosomal small
		"subunit (SSU), large subunit (LSU), internal transcribed spacer (ITS), β-tubulin"
		"(BT2), actin (ACT1), and elongation factor (TEF1) genes revealed that the isolate"
		deviated from any known agent of mycetoma; it clustered in the genus Pleurostoma
		"(anamorph genus, Pleurostomophora) in the order Calosphaeriales. The novel"
		"species, here named Pleurostomophora ochracea, is characterized by phenotypic"
		"features. The species proved to be highly susceptible to itraconazole,"
		"ketoconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole, but not to fluconazole. The fungus"
		"was inhibited by caspofungin at 8 μg/ml, while no inhibition was found with"
		5-flucytosine (MIC > 64 μg/ml). Compared to other members of the genus
		"Pleurostomophora, P. ochracea is slow growing, with a relatively high optimum"
		growth temperature (36 to 37°C). This is the first case of a yellow-grain fungal
		mycetoma; yellow grains are otherwise of bacterial nature. Our case emphasizes
		that identification of mycetoma agents by the color of the grain only is not
		sufficient and may lead to inappropriate therapy.

PG	-	245-8
AB	-	A case of endobronchitis by Scedosporium apiospermum in a child with cystic
		fibrosis is presented. The bronchial aspirate's cytology showed the presence of a
		large amount of septated-dichotomized hyphae. The bronchial aspirate's culture
		showed the presence of Scedosporium apiospermum in a pure culture of three
		consecutive samples. The scanning electron microscopy study of the mucosal
		surface revealed scarce mycelia with the presence of abundant conidiae. The
		transmission electron microscopy of the mucosa revealed inflammatory infiltrates
		"constituted by macrophages, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, a lot of dichotomized"
		mycelia and macrophages with hyphae and conidiae within the phagosomes. The
		patient was treated with amphotericin B and itraconazole.

PG	-	466-8
AB	-	"Mycetoma is a chronic, granulomatous, subcutaneous, inflammatory disease caused"
		by true fungi (eumycetoma) or filamentous bacteria (actinomycetoma). Eumycetoma
		usually affects adult males involving limbs and other exposed body parts.
		Children represent the least commonly encountered age group with this disease. A
		case of subcutaneous facial mycosis due to Madurella mycetomatis in a three year
		old child was diagnosed at the Microbiology department Armed Forces Institute of
		"Pathology Rawalpindi, which to our knowledge is the first case reported of its"
		kind. Early diagnosis and timely medical therapy lead to favourable outcome

TI	-	Intracavitary hematoma simulating mycetoma formation.
PG	-	84-8
AB	-	This case report details the initial radiographic findings of a patient with
		mixed connective-tissue disease who presented with significant hemoptysis.
		"Several radiographic findings suggested mycetoma formation, prompting appropriate"
		"antibiotic therapy; however, the rapid resolution and subsequent reappearance of"
		the lesion on serial images pointed toward a diagnosis of hemorrhage into a
		preexisting cavity. Chest radiographic and computed tomographic findings commonly
		"described as pathognomonic for the diagnosis of mycetoma are, in fact,"
		nonspecific and can be simulated by several other entities that result in
		"intracavitary masses. Familiarity with these radiographic ""mimickers"" of mycetoma"
		will aid in avoiding misdiagnosis and unnecessary or improper invasive
		interventions when the appropriate clinical history and course of disease are
		appreciated.

PG	-	1604-6
AB	-	Curvularia lunata has previously been linked to localized sinus infection in
		immunocompetent hosts. We treated a case of pansinusitis with extensive bone
		destruction and intracranial extension caused by C lunata. Curvularia lunata was
		identified when typical fungal macroconidia appeared on culture. Numerous
		"surgical procedures, in addition to a 12-month course of antifungal therapy"
		consisting of 4 g of intravenous amphotericin B and an 8-month course of 400 mg
		"of oral ketoconazole daily, were required to control the infection. This unusual"
		case of invasive sinusitis caused by C lunata alerts the treating physician to
		the presence of this mold and gives an overview of diagnostic method as well as
		the management.

		leukemia.
PG	-	611-7
AB	-	Pneumothorax caused by the rupture of a mycetoma into the pleural space is rarely
		reported in patients undergoing intensive cytotoxic therapy for hematologic
		malignancies. We reviewed 46 episodes of mycetoma that developed in 43 patients
		undergoing antineoplastic therapy; six (13%) of these episodes were further
		complicated by the occurrence of pneumothorax that developed after bone marrow
		recovery with return to normal granulocyte count. Etiologic agents included
		"Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus fumigatus plus Blastoschizomyces capitatus,"
		and Mucor (one case each). No pathogen was detected in the remaining three cases
		"of pneumothorax. Four of the six patients died (7, 10, 27, and 50 days after the"
		onset of pneumothorax). Two of the six patients with pneumothorax died of massive
		"hemoptysis, whereas only one of the 40 patients who did not develop pneumothorax"
		died of hemoptysis. This suggests that both pneumothorax and hemoptysis may
		represent the clinical expression of a more destructive course of invasive fungal
		diseases.

AB	-	"The Aspergillus species is a ubiquitous fungus, which can cause pathogenic and"

		occurrence in the host with an otherwise normal immune status. We report a case
		of an immunocompetent 45-year-old patient who developed cutaneous aspergillosis
		with a very benign course presenting simply with a gradually enlarging mass and
		none of the classical signs and symptoms. All prior laboratory examinations
		failed to detect or reproduce the organism or establish a diagnosis. Surgery was
		"both diagnostic and therapeutic, to remove the mass which causes the patient pain"
		and limitation of activity. This was to our advantage because the fungal elements
		were very well encapsulated and the mass was a well-organized conglomeration of
		cystic abscesses that even prolonged chemotherapy alone might not succeed in
		eradicating the infection.

TI	-	Madura Foot: a case report.
PG	-	"634-5, 643-4, 659"
AB	-	Mycetoma or Madura foot is a chronic infection of the foot characterized by
		swelling and multiple sinuses. The sinuses discharge pus composed of colored
		granules which contain the infecting organism. Although this entity is still rare
		"in the United States, an increasing immigrant population and rapid air"
		transportation have resulted in a greater number of cases being reported. A case
		of Madura foot is presented in which initial cultures yielded Staphylococcus
		aureus. Dicloxacillin was prescribed and this led to some improvement in the
		"condition. Later, a gram-stained specimen of exudate from an inguinal site showed"
		"actinomycetes. Because of this finding, amoxicillin was then administered. As a"
		"result, the condition dramatically improved with subsequent healing of the"
		involved bone.

TI	-	A successfully treated case of mycetoma due to Nocardia veterana.
PG	-	1349-52
AB	-	We report a successfully treated case of mycetoma from which an unusual Nocardia
		species was isolated. The isolate was identified as N. veterana by biochemical
		"characterization and 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, and it has not been"
		previously reported as a causative agent of human mycetomas. Treatment with
		various antibiotics over 6 years and surgical resection failed to cure the
		"disease. However, the combination of intravenous imipenem/cilastatin and amikacin"
		along with oral clarithromycin and minocycline proved very effective in this
		case. This is the first case report of mycetoma due to N. veterana in a clinical
		setting.

		endophthalmitis treated with pars plana vitrectomy and oral and intravitreal
		"voriconazole is described. Pars plana vitrectomy, en bloc capsulectomy, and"
		explantation of the intraocular lens were then performed combined with one to
		four intravitreal injections of voriconazole and oral voriconazole for up to 5
		"weeks. Identified fungal species included Aspergillus, Acremonium, Penicillium,"
		and Verticillium. Voriconazole may have affected the clinical and surgical
		management of fungal endophthalmitis.

PG	-	94-7

AB	-	Eumycetoma is a chronic infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue caused by
		"filamentous fungi, which usually occurs in tropical or subtropical countries. We"
		report a case of an immunocompromised patient presenting with presumed eumycetoma
		in the United States and his subsequent treatment with voriconazole. The use of
		voriconazole and liposomal amphotericin B halted the progression and allowed
		gradual resolution of the infection. The patient will require close monitoring
		and long-term therapy with voriconazole to obtain a clinical cure. Voriconazole
		"and liposomal amphotericin B are potential initial treatment options, with"
		"long-term voriconazole maintenance therapy, for an Aspergillus-induced"
		eumycetoma.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Actinomycetoma is the most frequent type of mycetoma in Mexico.
		Localization on the scalp is very rare. Because of this topography and potential
		"spread to the brain, the present case became a diagnostic and therapeutic"
		challenge. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We report the case of a 44-year-old woman with
		"a 6 × 5 cm red, friable, granulomatous, vascular neoformation on the scalp and"
		eye diagnosed as Nocardia brasiliensis actinomycetoma. RESULTS: A combination of
		amikacin and oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT) was successfully
		administered with an excellent outcome and no side effects. CONCLUSIONS: This is
		a rare presentation of mycetoma of the scalp that was cured in 12 weeks with a
		combination of amikacin and SXT.

		numbers of microcolonies were present containing segmented hyphae. No typical
		chlamydospores were observed. Cultures yielded a fungus identified as Madurella
		mycetomatis. Treatment consisted of surgical excision and local treatment with
		thiabendazole powder.

PG	-	260-2
LID	-	10.1093/bja/aes126 [doi]
AB	-	Continuous paravertebral block is commonly used for post-thoracotomy analgesia
		and compares favourably with other systemic and regional methods with regard to
		safety and efficacy. No major complications of continuous paravertebral block for
		post-thoracotomy analgesia have been reported previously. We report here a case
		of systemic local anaesthetic toxicity from continuous paravertebral block
		"administration after thoracotomy and lobectomy leading to seizure, aspiration,"
		"and ultimately, death. Potential contributing factors in this case included small"
		"patient size, concomitant antifungal therapy, extensive surgical disruption of"
		"the pleurae, and inappropriate paravertebral bolus administration. Postoperative"
		delirium was a diagnostic confounder. We discuss the potential causes and means
		of avoiding similar complications in the future.

TI	-	Eumycetoma presenting as a cerebellopontine angle mass lesion.
PG	-	516-9
AB	-	Eumycetoma in the cerebellopontine angle region is extremely uncommon with no
		case being reported as per an extensive review of the literature by the authors.
		The authors report a case of cerebellopontine angle eumycetoma in a young female
		managed by subtotal decompression and antifungal treatment. The pre-operative
		diagnosis of eumycetoma in this location is extremely difficult and the role of
		histopathology is very important to characterize this uncommon lesion. The
		prognosis of this bizarre pathology is dismal despite all treatment modalities as
		compared to the usual tumors of the cerebellopontine angle that generally have a
		favorable outcome.

AB	-	Eumycetomas are chronic infectious entities characterized by presence of mycotic
		"grains in (sub-)cutaneous tissues, after accidental inoculation of an exogenous"
		filamentous fungus in the skin. The lesions evolve towards painless pseudotumor
		of the soft parts. We report the original case of a Guinean woman exhibiting
		eumycetoma of the right foot. Both laboratory tests identified a dematiaceous
		"fungus, Exophiala jeanselmei, as the responsible infectious agent. A medical"
		treatment with voriconazole alone was sufficient to notice a substantial clinical
		improvement. This finding is unusual as E. jeanselmei is uncommon in
		"Guinea-Conakry, and as optimal treatment rather associate antifungal azoles and"
		surgical excision.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: We sought to present our results of topical intrabronchial
		installation of amphotericin B lipid complex (AmpB lipid). PATIENT AND METHODS: A
		deposit of fungal material was observed in a bilateral lung transplant recipient
		who experienced stenosis of the left anastomosis and have been fitted with a
		double endobronchial prosthesis. The deposit was adherent to the prosthetic
		"material, causing marked local laceration, risk of perforation, and exacerbation"
		"of the bronchial stenosis. Upon cultivation of a bronchial aspirate (BAS), we"
		"isolated Aspergillus fumigatus, Scedosporium prolificans, and Candida glabrata."
		Systemic antifungal treatment was begun with oral voriconazole (200 mg every 12
		hours) and inhaled AmpB lipid (25 mg once daily). The fungal deposit on the
		prosthetic material was treated by topical instillation of a solution of 25 mg
		"AmpB lipid before and after each therapeutic fibrobronchoscopy (FB), which was"
		performed weekly at 5 consecutive examinations. Tolerance was excellent. RESULTS:
		The improvement obtained after the procedure made it possible to withdraw one of
		the displaced prostheses. Subsequent cultivation for the fungi found in the BAS
		was persistently negative over a follow-up of 2 years. CONCLUSION: Topical
		intrabronchial instillation of AmpB lipid has proven effective and well tolerated
		for the treatment of localized fungal colonies. This use could be extended by
		protocol to FB in the early postoperative period after lung transplantation for
		antifungal prophylaxis.

PG	-	231-2
AB	-	Scedosporium apiospermum is a filamentous fungi that commonly causes cutaneous
		"infection. In certain circumstances, S. apiospermum can also cause invasive"
		"disease, which can involve the central nervous system (CNS). When the CNS becomes"
		"involved, treatment is difficult, therapeutic options are limited and the"
		prognosis is poor. Early identification and treatment can decrease the mortality
		rate. Here we present a case of brain abscess with chronic suppurative otitis
		"media, caused by S. apiospermum. This is the first such case report from Nepal."
		"We could identify the organism only post mortem. We could not save the patient,"
		probably due to delay in diagnosis.

PG	-	S8-S10
AB	-	"Mycetoma is a slowly progressive localised, granulomatous, subcutaneous tissue"
		infection common among adult males aged 20 - 50 years. The causing agents include
		both bacteria (actinomycetoma) and fungi (eumycetoma). This chronic infection was
		"described in literature as Madura foot and eventually mycetoma, due to its"
		etiology. Early clinical diagnosis before the appearance of sinuses and grains
		"(aggregates of organism surrounded by granulation tissue, which are discharged"
		from the draining sinuses) is difficult. Early diagnosis is important due to the
		therapeutic implications. Although biopsy and microbiological cultures provide
		definitive diagnosis. Delay in diagnosis may lead to amputation of the affected
		"part. The recently described ""dot-in-circle"" sign on magnetic resonance imaging"
		(MRI) is easy to recognise and highly specific. We present a case of
		histologically proven mycetoma with characteristic MRI features.

AB	-	We report two cases of solitary plasmacytoma of the lung. Computed tomographic
		scan disclosed in case A a solid tissue formation in a cystic pulmonary lesion
		and in case B a solitary nodule. Suggesting aspergilloma in A and pulmonary
		malignancy in B diagnostic thoracotomies were performed and the respective
		findings were resected. In both cases a diagnosis of plasmacytoma was made.
		Postoperatively multiple myeloma was ruled out. Solitary pulmonary plasmacytoma
		is a very rare condition and to the best of our knowledge plasmacytoma within a
		cystic lung lesion has not been described so far. After curative resection
		treatment the prognosis of these circumscript lesions should be excellent.

		filamentous fungus with low inherent virulence. Increasing numbers of cases of
		this infection have been reported probably related to the rising number of

		infection is rarely encountered in clinical practice. We describe a case of
		cutaneous infection caused by Scedosporium apiospermum in a subject with
		rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes mellitus who was submitted to long-term therapy
		with cyclosporin and corticosteroids. Histopathologic examination of a skin
		biopsy showed a granulomatous infiltrate with hyaline septate hyphae. Culture of
		"two skin biopsies taken at two different observations of the woman, 3 weeks"
		"apart, allowed isolation of Scedosporium apiospermum. Therapy with itraconazole,"

AB	-	A 29-year-old woman presented with multiple painful swelling with discharging
		sinuses over the scalp. Histopathological examination of the biopsy tissue was
		suggestive of actinomycotic mycetoma. Streptomyces spp. was isolated from blood
		culture. The patient was successfully treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
		and crystalline penicillin. This case is reported because of the rare occurrence
		of bacteremia by Streptomyces spp. secondary to subcutaneous actinomycotic
		"mycetoma. Moreover, an interesting association between successive two pregnancies"
		and occurrence of mycetoma of the scalp was observed in this case.

TI	-	Bilateral endogenous Scedosporium prolificans endophthalmitis after lung
		transplantation.
PG	-	370-3
AB	-	PURPOSE: To report a case of bilateral endogenous fungal endophthalmitis
		resulting from disseminated Scedosporium prolificans. DESIGN: Observational case
		report. METHODS: A 56-year-old woman with cystic fibrosis status post dual lung
		transplantation on chronic immunosuppressive therapy presented with acute graft
		rejection. Cultures of bronchial brushings revealed S. prolificans. Three weeks
		"after admission, the patient noted increased blurriness and a central scotoma in"
		her right eye. Dilated fundus examination revealed profound vitritis in the right
		"eye with hemorrhagic retinitis involving the macula. A peripheral, yellow"
		choroidal infiltrate with overlying retinitis and localized vitritis was present
		"in the left eye. RESULTS: Intravitreal antibiotics were initiated, and vitreous"
		cultures revealed S. prolificans. The patient ultimately succumbed to her
		disseminated disease. Pathologic examination of the eyes confirmed bilateral
		endogenous fungal endophthalmitis. CONCLUSION: S. prolificans is an opportunistic
		infection resistant to standard antifungal therapy that can result in endogenous
		endophthalmitis in immunocompromised individuals.

		osteomyelitis.
PG	-	425-30
AB	-	"Scedosporium apiospermum, the asexual anamorph of Pseudallescheria boydii, is a"
		ubiquitous saprophytic fungus that usually causes cutaneous/subcutaneous
		"infection but may manifest as an invasive disease, often in immunocompromised"
		"hosts. Following an extensive literature review, we think that this case"
		represents the first documented report of a primary infection of the spine in an
		immunocompetent patient. Despite extensive surgical debridement and itraconazole
		"therapy, the patient died of multisystem organ failure of unknown etiology. Our"
		case and three previously reported cases of P. boydii vertebral osteomyelitis
		highlight the importance of obtaining repeat cultures in patients with
		culture-negative vertebral osteomyelitis who fail to adequately respond to
		empiric standard antibacterial and/or antimycobacterial therapy. Combined
		surgical debridement and antifungal therapy have been required for eradication of
		P. boydii spinal infections in two previously reported immunocompromised
		"patients, although the optimal antifungal regimen for this infection has not been"
		established.

AB	-	Endogenous intraocular infection of fungal etiology is extremely rare in an
		"immunocompetent individual. Usually, an antecedent history of trauma, surgery,"
		intravenous drug abuse or an immunocompromized state can be elicited.
		Scedosporium apiospermum is a known cause of keratomycosis after traumatic
		implantation and can cause fatal disseminated infection in immunocompromized
		"patients. However, cases of S. apiospermum intraocular infection in"
		immunocompetent individuals have been very rarely reported in literature. We
		report here a case of an anterior chamber exudative mass due to S. apiospermum in
		an immunocompetent individual which was managed successfully with anterior
		chamber wash and intravitreal injection of voriconazole.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Dermatophytic pseudomycetoma is a subcutaneous fungal infection by
		Microsporum canis. AIMS: This work describes a case of dermatophytic
		pseudomycetoma in a Persian cat. PATIENT AND METHODS: A 3-year old female Persian
		"cat showing alopecia, scaling and ulcerated nodules throughout the body, with"
		"presence of ulcerated nodules with yellow granular discharges on the dorsum,"
		close to the tail. Mycological and histopathological examinations were realized.
		RESULTS: Diagnosis of dermatophytic pseudomycetoma was established. The cat was
		"treated with griseofulvin, and surgical excision was carried out. Response to"
		"therapy was effective during the first months, during which a reduction in nodule"
		"frequency was observed. However, despite maintaining the therapy levels, the"
		lesions relapsed and progressed to the point of causing the animal's death.
		CONCLUSION: The clinic evolution showed the progressive and recurrent character
		of dermatophytic pseudomycetoma.

TI	-	Noninvasive aspergillosis as a maxillary antrolith: report of a rare case.
PG	-	143-6
AB	-	Maxillary antrolithiasis is characterized by masses of tissue of endogenous or
		exogenous origin that calcify within the maxillary sinuses. Aspergillosis is a
		fungal disease in which the maxillary sinus is a primary site of infection.
		"Aspergillosis mycetoma, its noninvasive form, is the most prevalent modality of"
		the disease in the maxillary sinuses. In approximately half of the cases reported
		"in the literature, calcification of the fungal mycelia, which later became"
		"antroliths, was verified. This article reports a rare case of the accidental"
		discovery of a maxillary antrolith associated with noninvasive aspergillosis in
		an immunocompetent and asymptomatic 56-year-old woman. The diagnosis and
		therapeutic procedures used in treating the patient are discussed as well as the
		probable iatrogenic origin of the fungal pathology.

		retrospective observational study in a tertiary care hospital.
PG	-	267-71
LID	-	10.1016/j.ijsu.2011.01.002 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: The indications and the outcome of surgery for pulmonary aspergilloma
		remain highly controversial. This retrospective observational study was conducted
		"to study the clinical profile, indications, post-operative complications and long"
		term outcome of patients having pulmonary aspergilloma. METHODS: From January
		"2000 to October 2008, 52 patients underwent surgery for pulmonary aspergilloma at"
		our tertiary care institute. RESULTS: The group consisted of 32 males and 20
		females with a mean age of 39.3 ± 11.2 years. The most common indication for
		surgery was hemoptysis (96.15%). The underlying lung diseases were tuberculosis
		"(75%), bronchiectasis (5.76%), and lung abscess (5.76%). In one patient (2%),"
		concomitant ruptured lung hydatid cyst and an aspergilloma was present. The
		"procedures performed were lobectomy (n = 43), bilobectomy (n = 3). pneumonectomy"
		"(n = 3), segmental resection (n = 3). The post-operative mortality was 1.92% (one"
		patient). Overall complications occurred in 12 (23.07%) patients. The
		"complications included prolonged air leak (n = 6), bleeding (n = 3), empyema (n ="
		"1), repeated pneumothorax (n = 1), and wound dehiscence (n = 1). The mean"
		follow-up period was 38 ± 18.6 months. There was no recurrence of disease or
		hemoptysis. CONCLUSION: Pulmonary aspergilloma is common in developing countries
		like India in which there is high prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis. Surgical
		resection of pulmonary aspergilloma is effective in preventing recurrence of
		symptoms including hemoptysis. We recommend early surgical resection of
		symptomatic aspergilloma with reasonable complications. Pre-operative preparation
		"of the patients, meticulous surgical technique and post-operative chest"
		physiotherapy reduces the rate of complications. Complications may still occur
		"and are largely related to the underlying lung pathology; however, the long term"
		outcome is good.

AB	-	Nocardia pseudobrasiliensis is predominantly associated with invasive infections
		in immunocompromised patients. We report a case of disseminated mycetoma caused
		"by N. pseudobrasiliensis in a 57-yr-old woman with microscopic polyangiitis, who"
		was treated for 3 months with corticosteroids. The same organism was isolated
		"from mycetoma cultures on the patient's scalp, right arm, and right leg. The"
		phenotypic characteristics of the isolate were consistent with both Nocardia
		"brasiliensis and N. pseudobrasiliensis, i.e., catalase and urease positivity,"
		"hydrolysis of esculin, gelatin, casein, hypoxanthine, and tyrosine, but no"
		hydrolysis of xanthine. The isolate was identified as N. pseudobrasiliensis based
		on 16S rRNA and hsp65 gene sequencing. The patient was treated for 5 days with
		"intravenous ampicillin/sulbactam, at which time both the mycetomas and fever had"
		subsided and discharged on amoxicillin/clavulanate. This case highlights a very
		rare presentation of mainly cutaneous mycetoma caused by N. pseudobrasiliensis.
		This is the first reported case of N. pseudobrasiliensis infection in Korea.

PG	-	263-7
AB	-	Most episodes of fungal sinusitis in immunocompromised patients are caused by
		"Aspergillus species. To treat such infections, surgical debridement and"
		anti-fungal therapy have been recommended; it is also clear however that an
		adequate neutrophil count is important in controlling such infections. We report
		a case in which fungal sinusitis was shown to be due to P. boydii and in which
		the infection recurred over a period of 2 years during episodes of neutropenia in
		spite of vigorous surgical and medical therapy.

TI	-	Cushing's syndrome due to interaction between inhaled corticosteroids and
		itraconazole.
PG	-	46-9
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To report a case of an interaction between inhaled corticosteroids and
		itraconazole causing iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome and provide a review of the
		relevant literature. CASE SUMMARY: A 70-year-old white woman on long-term
		treatment with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids for asthma was diagnosed as
		having Scedosporium apiospermum infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissues.
		"As a result, she was treated with itraconazole for 2 months. She subsequently"
		developed Cushing's syndrome due to a probable cytochrome P450-mediated
		interaction between itraconazole and budesonide. She also had secondary adrenal
		insufficiency requiring prolonged treatment with replacement hydrocortisone.
		DISCUSSION: Budesonide is a potent glucocorticoid that is metabolized in the
		liver by the CYP3A4 isoenzyme to inactive metabolites. Itraconazole is a potent
		cytochrome P450 inhibitor. It can inhibit the metabolism of oral or inhaled
		"corticosteroids, producing cortisol excess leading to Cushing's syndrome and"
		adrenal insufficiency. An assessment of causality indicated a possible adverse
		interaction between itraconazole and budesonide. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of
		itraconazole and inhaled corticosteroids is increasingly being used to treat
		conditions such as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Clinicians need to be
		aware of the potential for an interaction between such a combination.

TI	-	Infectious posterior scleritis caused by Pseudallescheria boydii.
		Clinicopathologic findings.
PG	-	1312-6
AB	-	PURPOSE: The purpose of the study is to describe an unusual case of infectious
		posterior scleritis after excision of a pterygium. METHODS: The case history of a
		patient in whom anterior and posterior scleritis developed after excision of a
		pterygium is reviewed. Histopathologic findings are presented. RESULTS:
		Pathologic examination results of a scleral biopsy site and the eye showed
		extensive involvement of the posterior sclera with fungi that on culture grew
		Pseudallescheria boydii. The development of posterior scleral thickening and
		intrascleral abscesses gave the clinical impression of autoimmune posterior
		scleritis or possible tumor. Ultrasonography and computed tomography scan of the
		eye and orbit proved particularly helpful in following progression of scleral
		involvement. CONCLUSIONS: Pseudallescheria boydii is capable of causing an
		"infectious posterior scleritis, which can mimic autoimmune posterior scleritis."
		The use of systemic immunosuppressive agents contributed to this unusual clinical
		presentation. Progression of posterior scleritis in the face of apparent adequate
		immunosuppressive therapy always should suggest the possibility of tumor or
		infection.

AB	-	STUDY DESIGN: Case report and clinical discussion. OBJECTIVE: To describe a rare
		case of chronic spinal epidural abscess caused by Scedosporium prolificans in an
		immunocompetent patient. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: S. prolificans is an
		emerging multiresistant fungal pathogen that may cause a wide variety of
		"infections, whose severity depends of the patient's immune status. METHODS: A"
		35-year-old Brazilian man developed a 5-year chronic progressive paresis in lower
		limbs followed by sphincter dysfunction. Spinal magnetic resonance imaging
		revealed a thoracic-lumbar epidural mass that heterogeneously enhanced
		gadolinium. Spinal biopsy showed a chronic inflammatory process localized in
		epidural thoracic spine. S. prolificans was isolated in a specific culture.
		RESULTS: He was treated with endovenous voriconazole for 2 weeks followed by oral
		"voriconazole for 90 days. Three months later, a T9-T10 epidural mass was detected"
		"on a new magnetic resonance imaging. The abscess was drained, and the culture of"
		the material confirmed the persistence of infection by S. prolificans. A
		progressive paraparesis due to chronic meningo-myelitis was observed at a 6-month
		"follow-up. Although patient was treated with caspofungin, terbinafine, and"
		"voriconazole, no improvement was observed. CONCLUSION: S. prolificans can cause"
		chronic epidural abscess and spine infection in immunocompetent patients. The
		potential resistance of S. prolificans to antifungal agents should be borne in
		mind.

PG	-	447-54
AB	-	A 25-year-old black man had generalized tinea corporis for 19 years and had
		associated subcutaneous mycotic granuloma of the scalp and nape of the neck for
		17 years. The dermatophyte from the skin was identified as Microsporum audouinii
		and responded to oral griseofulvin treatment. Biopsy specimens of the
		subcutaneous nodules revealed yellowish granules containing masses of irregularly
		septated hyaline hyphae with frequent vesicles. This fungus differed only in
		gross colonial morphology from the M. audouinii isolated from the skin and has
		also been identified as M. audouinii. The subcutaneous nodules were treated and
		controlled by amphotericin B and are still under treatment.

TI	-	Beneficial effects of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in Nocardia brasiliensis
		soft-tissue infection.
PG	-	122-3
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To report the success of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in the treatment of
		Nocardia brasiliensis mycetoma. We believe this to be only the second report in
		the medical literature of hyperbaric oxygen therapy used in the therapy of
		nocardial disease. CLINICAL FEATURES: A 78-year-old man presented to a general
		hospital outpatient clinic after eight months with a painless swollen left foot.
		"There was no significant medical history, no trauma had occurred, and no foreign"
		"body had been detected. The dorsum of the foot had a discharging sinus, from"
		which N. brasiliensis was isolated. INTERVENTIONS: After unsuccessful treatment
		"with surgical debridement and high-dose antibiotic therapy, hyperbaric oxygen"
		therapy was administered in a multiplace recompression chamber (one hour of
		"treatment at 1.8 atmospheres absolute followed by a 30 minute ""ascent"" to surface"
		pressure). A total of 19 treatments were administered. OUTCOME: Successful
		healing of an N. brasiliensis mycetoma of the left foot. CONCLUSION: In this case
		"of N. brasiliensis mycetoma involving the lower extremity, the conventional"
		"management of surgery and antibiotic therapy was unsuccessful, and only with the"
		addition of hyperbaric oxygen therapy did clinical recovery occur.

PG	-	184-6
AB	-	A 13-year-old girl presented with multiple painless purulent ulcers with raised
		borders on the medial aspect of the sole of her right foot associated with
		inguinal lymphadenopathy for the past 4 years. There was history of local trauma
		at the site prior to the formation of ulcers. There were no other significant
		associated signs or symptoms. The patient was initially treated with multiple
		antibiotics with minimal improvement. Fungal cultures of biopsy specimens
		demonstrated the presence of colonies of Sporothrix schenckii thus confirming the
		diagnosis of sporotrichosis. Oral itraconazole at the dose of 100 mg twice daily
		was initiated with marked response at 4 weeks. This case demonstrated a rare
		morphological presentation of the lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis as mycetoma. The
		possible diagnosis of sporotrichosis should be kept in mind in such a clinical
		presentation not responding to antibiotics. Cutaneous sporotrichosis should be
		diagnosed and treated as early as possible because untreated cases may
		disseminate to cause visceral involvement with fatal outcome in immunocompromised
		patients.

TI	-	"The Madura foot: an ""innocent foot mycosis""?"
PG	-	242-8
AB	-	"With the increased movement of the world population, acquaintance with the"
		clinical picture of the Madura foot is of growing importance beyond its original
		endemic areas. The characteristic triad of symptoms consists of indurated
		"swelling, multiple sinus tracts with purulent discharge filled with grains and"
		localization at the foot. An increasing number of new etiologic agents are
		recognized today. For a better choice of therapy an adequate diagnostic procedure
		is essential ; a deep biopsy for histology appears to give a more substantial
		contribution to identification of the causal organism than culture. The treatment
		"which should be started early, is at first essentially a drug treatment. However,"
		"in spite of high expectations with regard to new antimycotic drugs, amputation or"
		"disarticulation is often inevitable even today, particularly when the lesion is"
		caused by Eumycetes. The first two documented patients with this disease in the
		Netherlands are described. They developed serious deformities of the lower
		extremity despite long-term use of antimycotic and antibiotic medication.

		complex tricuspid valve repair followed by fluconazole therapy.
PG	-	134-40
LID	-	10.1089/sur.2013.007 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Fungal valve endocarditis in children is an uncommon and lethal
		"disease. The risk increases with use of central venous catheters (CVC), total"
		"parenteral nutrition (TPN), and use of broad-spectrum antibiotics during the"
		"neonatal period. Due to high mortality, a combination of surgery and antifungal"
		therapy is usually recommended for treatment. METHODS: Case report and review of
		the literature. RESULTS: We present a case of an asymptomatic infant with
		multiple Candida tricuspid valve mycetomas. Complete cure was achieved by
		combined tricuspid valve repair and fluconazole therapy. We also review 26 cases
		of tricuspid valve Candida endocarditis in children published in the literature.
		CONCLUSION: From being uniformly fatal five decades ago to a current survival
		"rate of 64% to 100%, the prognosis of Candida endocarditis has changed"
		dramatically with the use of antifungal therapy alone or in combination with
		surgery. Our case re-emphasizes the role of valve-sparing debridement with repair
		of the native valve using autologous pericardium in combination with long-term
		antifungal therapy as a feasible option in managing tricuspid valve Candida
		endocarditis.

PG	-	212-7
AB	-	Systemic scedosporiasis due to the anamorph or asexual form Scedosporium
		apiospermum (Pseudallescheria boydii) has become an important cause of
		"opportunistic mycosis, especially in patients undergoing high-risk hematopoietic"
		stem cell transplantation. We report a case of rapidly progressive cerebellar
		hyalohyphomycosis due to Scedosporium apiospermum in an allogeneic marrow graft
		recipient receiving treatment for severe graft-versus-host disease. This fatal
		"breakthrough intracranial abscess, due to amphotericin B-resistant (minimum"
		"inhibitory concentration > 16 micro g/ml) mold, developed during the course of"
		systemic antifungal therapy given for multicentric pulmonary aspergillosis.
		"Despite treatment with high-dose Abelcet (10 mg/kg daily), free amphotericin B"
		was not detected in postmortem cerebellar tissue. A broad-spectrum triazole-based
		"agent (voriconazole/UK-109, 496--Vfend), and a novel fungal cell wall inhibitor,"
		"an echinocandin/pneumocandin analog (caspofungin/MK-0991--Cancidas), which"
		exhibit excellent in vitro activity against most clinical Pseudallescheria
		"boydii-Scedosporium apiospermum isolates, have recently become available in the"
		United States and may provide much needed treatment options for patients at risk.

		patient refused treatment and was lost to follow-up until he showed up 10 years
		later with numerous discharging large sinuses and abscesses on the upper right
		quadrant of the chest wall and in the right armpit. Roentgenograms revealed
		pleural masses. Histology was in keeping with the diagnosis of mycetoma.

PG	-	633-4
AB	-	Pseudallescheria boydii and its asexual state Scedosporium apiospermum is a well
		known opportunistic pathogen among immunocompromised patients. However it is rare
		in immunocompetent patients. The optimum management of this infection is still
		not clear. The new azoles may show better efficacy than amphotericin B and
		additional surgery may play a pivotal role. We report a case of Pseudallescheria
		boydii lung infection in an immunocompetent patient who had an old tuberculous
		cavity and presumed inhalational exposure. The case highlights difficulties in
		diagnosis which complicates the selection of antifungal agent/s and the need for
		aggressive surgical debridement.

TI	-	Primary renal candidiasis: fungal mycetomas in the kidney.
PG	-	57-9
AB	-	Fungal infections of the urinary tract have a predilection for drainage
		"structures rather than for the renal parenchyma. Of the causal factors, diabetes"
		"mellitus, immunosupressed states, AIDS and prematurity are those most commonly"
		"encountered. The case of a young, diabetic man whose chief clinical presentation"
		was dysuria is described. On further examination he was found to harbour fungal
		balls in the right kidney. Radiological manifestations of acute pyelonephritis
		were also present. Although primary renal candidiasis is often commensurate with
		"systemic fungaemia, he displayed none of the clinical features of disseminate"
		"infection and, hence, was treated conservatively with oral antifungal agents."
		"Fortuitously, spontaneous passage of fungal particulate matter in urine was later"
		reported.

TI	-	Periocular abscess caused by Pseudallescheria boydii after a posterior subtenon
		injection of triamcinolone acetonide.
PG	-	164-6
AB	-	BACKGROUND: A posterior subtenon injection of triamcinolone acetonide is an
		alternative to intravitreal injection in diabetic macular edema and is known to
		"have fewer vision-threatening complications. Here, we report a case of periocular"
		abscess following posterior subtenon injection of triamcinolone. METHODS: A
		62-year-old woman who had diabetic macular edema and disc neovascularization
		underwent a posterior subtenon injection of triamcinolone acetonide and
		panretinal laser photocoagulation. One month later a periocular abscess was noted
		in the inferotemporal area adjacent to the scleral wall. Pus was removed by
		"fine-needle aspiration, and microbiologic cultures identified Pseudallescheria"
		boydii. The patient was given systemic and subconjunctival treatment with
		"itraconazole. However, conjunctival infection and anterior chamber inflammation"
		"worsened, and another posterior subtenon abscess was found. RESULTS: Despite"
		"long-term systemic and topical itraconazole therapy, retinal detachment and"
		"vitreous opacity were shown on B-scan, and atrophic bulbi resulted. CONCLUSIONS:"
		Pseudallescheria boydii infection of the eye and orbit can result in a poor
		"visual outcome. Prompt surgical debridement and drainage of the abscess, along"
		"with appropriate antifungal therapy based on susceptibility testing, must be"
		mandatory.

PG	-	45-7
AB	-	Questions and controversies involving many aspects of medical mycology have
		increased in recent years. Case histories are described in which fungal infection
		causes unexpected and atypical problems. Molecular techniques of diagnosis need
		to be used alongside traditional culture methods. Increased drug use has led to
		genuine concerns and differing views regarding the definition and development of
		resistance by fungi. The use and value of combinational antifungal therapy and
		the employment of immunomodulatory agents concomitant with antimycotics have been
		"debated. Nonetheless, good standards have been developed in the testing of"
		"antifungal agents. These, together with the commercial viability of antifungal"
		"drugs and hence increased interest in their development, mean that although we"
		have entered the golden age of mycology we have also entered the golden age of
		antifungal therapy.

PG	-	233-6
AB	-	Scedosporium prolificans infections of normal hosts usually require extensive
		"debridement and sometimes amputation to effect cure, due to the intrinsic"
		resistance of this species to available antifungal agents. Newer agents have not
		"tested favourably. Variable results are obtained with voriconazole, and 100%"
		resistance is described with echinocandins. Itraconazole and terbinafine has
		offered synergy against various moulds including S. prolificans. In vivo success
		is reported with the azole/terbinafine combination in S. apiospermum pulmonary
		infection and Pythium insidiosum periorbital cellulitis. We report a case of
		"orthopaedic infection in a non-immunocompromised host with S. prolificans, in"
		which the combinations of itraconazole/terbinafine and voriconazole/terbinafine
		"showed synergy in vitro, and success was achieved without radical surgery, using"
		voriconazole and terbinafine.

TI	-	Modified Welsh regimen: a promising therapy for actinomycetoma.
PG	-	853-6
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Mycetoma has a worldwide geographical distribution which is extremely
		"uneven; however, it is a common disease in India and responsible for causing"
		significant morbidity. Treatment of this condition is often a challenge for the
		treating dermatologist. The authors report a promising therapy for patients of
		actinomycotic mycetoma. METHODS: This assessment series included 18 patients with
		"a confirmed diagnosis of actinomycetoma, and who had shown a poor response to"
		previous treatments. Patient received a combination therapy of the Welsh regimen
		(amikacin along with cotrimoxazole) to which rifampicin was added as a third
		drug. Clinical evaluation included radiology and laboratory investigations.
		"RESULTS: Sixteen patients out of 18 completed the combination therapy, which lead"
		to remission. Two patients were lost to follow-up. Of the 16 patients in
		"remission, no recurrence was observed during a follow-up period of up to 18"
		months.

PG	-	10-May
AB	-	Fusarium moniliforme was demonstrated to be the etiologic agent in an Italian
		"case of eumycotic mycetoma. The fungus produced white granules, which measured 80"
		X 133 by 212 X 478 microns. Their edges were entire or lobed and were surrounded
		by an eosinophilic homogeneous material. The hyphae comprising the granules were
		"not embedded in cement. The etiologic agent, first considered to be an Acremonium"
		"species, was restudied and identified as F. moniliforme on the basis that it not"
		"only produced chains of microconidia but also curved, multi-septate macroconidia"
		typical of the genus Fusarium.

LID	-	10.1136/bcr-2013-201813 [doi]
LID	-	bcr2013201813
AB	-	We report a case of cerebral aspergilloma in a 25-year-old immunoincompetent man
		admitted to a general intensive care unit. Monitoring of intracranial pressure
		"was instigated and revealed hour-long epochs of severe intracranial hypertension,"
		"despite a normal opening pressure, with decreases in cerebral perfusion pressure."
		We documented that this was associated with cerebral hypoperfusion by
		transcranial Doppler ultrasound. The present case illustrates that severe
		intracranial hypertension may evolve despite a normal opening pressure; it
		furthermore shows that continuous monitoring of intracranial pressure may be used
		to predict changes in cerebral haemodynamics in critically ill patients with
		neuroinfection.

PG	-	409-12
AB	-	The clinical isolates from biopsy specimen human subcutaneous nodule developed
		orange-colored and wrinkled colonies on Sabouraud's dextrose agar at 24 C for 2
		weeks. The isolates were aerobic and gram-positive. The bacteria were rod-shaped
		to coccoid and 1 x 5 microm in size. The assimilation tests revealed that the
		clinical isolate was identical to a reference strain of Nocardia veterana. A
		nucleotide sequence analysis of the 16S ribosomal DNA from the isolate and a
		reference strain of N. veterana showed 99.8% similarity. All data are consistent
		with the conclusion that the isolate in this human case of mycetoma is N.
		veterana.

PG	-	271-6
AB	-	Exophiala jeanselmei and Mycobacterium chelonae were isolated from cutaneous
		nodules in a 73-year-old man with mycetoma of the right lower leg. Further
		evaluation revealed CD4+ lymphocytopenia without evidence of HIV infection.
		"Antibodies to HIV 1/2, p24 antigen and HIV 1/2 (PCR) and reverse transcriptase"
		activity were not detectable. The patient was not a member of any HIV risk group.
		He had not previously undergone therapy or suffered from immunodeficiency. This
		case clearly demonstrates that infections with opportunistic moulds and/or
		atypical mycobacteria should be taken into consideration not only in patients
		with classical immundeficiency diseases but also in apparently healthy patients
		because infection with these agents can be the first sign of underlying
		immunodeficiency.

AB	-	Pseudallescheria boydii is a rare cause of mycotic infection. Factors
		"predisposing to systemic infection include traumas, immunosuppression, and near"
		"drowning. We report a case of multiple aneurysms caused by this hyalohyphomycete,"
		occurred after near drowning. The car driven by a 53-year-old woman plunged into
		"a canal in The Netherlands. After a 20-min-long submersion, the woman was"
		"rescued. At hospital, a severe aspiration of muddy water and a mycotic pneumonia"
		were diagnosed. Despite the immediate prescription of a long-term antimycotic
		"therapy and the initial good response, the patient died 4 months later. The"
		autopsy showed a mycotic aneurysm of the abdominal aorta and multiple ruptured
		mycotic aneurysms of the circle of Willis with fatal subarachnoid bleeding.

		"boydii, if adequate culture studies had been conducted. Unlike Aspergillus, P."
		"boydii is resistant to amphotericin B. Therefore, we emphasize the importance of"
		a correct diagnosis based on culture examination.

TI	-	Cutaneous pseudallescheria boydii infection in a renal transplant patient: A case
		report.
PG	-	8
AB	-	We describe the case of a 59-year-old male renal transplant recipient who
		"presented with a 1 month history of nodular, erythematous, and crusted lesions on"
		the anterior surface of the left leg. There was no history of trauma. The patient
		had no systemic signs or symptoms. A skin biopsy revealed evidence of a deep
		"fungal infection, with septate and branching hyphae amongst the dermal"
		"inflammatory infiltrate, but the culture was negative. Initial treatment with"
		itraconazole proved ineffective and new lesions appeared. New tissue samples were
		"obtained for culture, allowing the isolation of Pseudallescheria boydii. The"
		patient underwent surgical excision of the lesions combined with voriconazole 400
		mg/day for 2 months. After this period no new lesions appeared and the patient
		has remained without recurrence after 2 years of follow-up. Pseudallescheria
		boydii is an opportunistic fungus that can cause systemic infection mainly in
		"immunocompromised patients that manifests as pulmonary, osteoarticular, ocular,"
		"vascular, cutaneous or central nervous system disease. Resistance to therapy can"
		occur with infection progression and high mortality. Treatment with the
		"combination of an antifungal agent, mainly voriconazole, and surgery, when"
		"feasible, probably provide the best results in cutaneous infections."

PG	-	2425-7
LID	-	10.1016/j.transproceed.2008.07.030 [doi]
AB	-	"Pseudallescheria boydii and its asexual form, Scedosporium apiospermum, are"
		ubiquitous filamentous fungi that rarely cause central nervous system (CNS)
		"infection. Brain abscess caused by P. boydii is a highly lethal infection,"
		usually seen in organ transplant recipients who receive a number of
		immunosuppressive agents. We have presented a case of a 48-year-old man 6 years
		after renal transplantation who received methylprednisolone followed by
		antithymocyte globulin for treatment of acute cellular rejection. Eight weeks
		"later, he developed fever, headache, and left-sided hemiparesis. Further"
		investigation with magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed multiple
		ring-enhancing hypodense lesions with marked edema which were compatible with
		"brain abscesses. Following surgical drainage, multiple fungal elements were"
		initially described as Aspergillus species. The patient failed to improve and
		died from rapidly progressive infection despite treatment with amphotericin B.
		Later a diagnosis was finally made by the isolation of P. boydii in pus culture.
		"The specific diagnosis is difficult to rapidly make, because P. boydii mimics"
		other fungi morphologically in tissue sections and may produce infections
		clinically similar to other mycoses. Culture of the organism is required for
		definitive diagnosis. P. boydii infections are important complications of
		transplantation. They are difficult to treat due to resistance to amphotericin B.
		Physicians should consider P. boydii a possible cause of brain abscess in organ
		"transplant recipients, especially with heavy immunosuppressive agents. This is"
		the first case report of CNS infection due to P. boydii in a renal transplant
		patient in Southeast Asia.

PG	-	2378-81
AB	-	Neonatal fungal valve endocarditis is an uncommon and highly lethal disease. The
		ideal management strategy is still controversial. Current options include
		"antifungal chemotherapy and surgical intervention, the latter being often limited"
		by risks inherent with valve operations in low body weight infants. We present a
		case of a premature infant with multiple Candida tricuspid valve mycetomas.
		Eradication of infection was achieved by combined liposomal amphotericin therapy

TI	-	Fungal pathogens in etiology of septic shock in neutropenic patients with cancer
		(short communication).
PG	-	562-5
AB	-	"During the 3 years from 1989 to 1991, we evaluated the etiology of septic shock"
		cases and infection-associated mortality. A total number of 38 patients was
		"included in the study, according to the criteria for septic shock (SS),"
		"(Intensive Care Medicine Society, 1989). In 1989, P. aeruginosa and"
		"Enterobacteriaceae among the pathogens prevailed. In 1990 and 1991, S. aureus,"
		"enterococci and fungi were most frequent. From 8 patients with SS in 1990, the"
		shock was due to Candida albicans in 1 and to mucoraceae in 3 patients. In 10
		"patients examined in 1991, 8 cases of SS were due to Candida albicans,"
		"Aspergillus niger, Fusarium solani and Acremonium strictum. The decrease of the"
		incidence of shocks and increase of fungal etiology were found to be associated
		"with the use of quinolones in prophylaxis and cephalosporines, aminoglycosides"
		and vancomycine in empiric therapy in febrile neutropenic patients.

TI	-	Imaging findings of pulmonary infection caused by Scedosporium prolificans in a
		deep immunocompromised patient.
PG	-	47-9
AB	-	Scedosporium prolificans is an emerging fungus that causes rapid progressive and
		disseminated infections in immunodepressed patients. We present a case of a
		34-year-old woman with chronic myelogenous leukemia who received a bone marrow
		transplantation and suffered a sudden respiratory failure in +67 day. Chest
		radiographies showed growing bilateral patchy condensations. Computed Tomography
		depicted bilateral nodular condensation of alveolar space. S. prolificans was
		"detected from sputum, but the patient died 72 h later. Imaging findings of lung"
		"scedosporiosis are nonspecific, but CT may provide a prompter diagnosis and allow"
		to add newer antifungal treatments. This report presents the first imaging report
		of lung scedosporiosis.

TI	-	White grain mycetoma caused by a Cylindrocarpon sp. in India.
PG	-	4288-91
AB	-	We describe a case of white grain eumycetoma of the foot of an Indian male caused
		"by a slow-growing, poorly sporulating fungus that does not match any known agent"
		of this infection. Histologic examination of a biopsy tissue specimen showed
		"oval, lobular, white granules composed of hyaline, septate hyphae, and"
		thick-walled chlamydospores. Culture of granules from a draining sinus yielded
		"compact, very-slow-growing, poorly sporulating colonies producing a strong"
		reddish brown pigment that diffused into the medium. The fungus was identified as
		a Cylindrocarpon sp. based on the development of rare cylindrical conidia borne
		"from solitary phialides lacking collarettes, in addition to chlamydospores formed"
		singly or in short chains.

PG	-	198-200
AB	-	Maduromycosis is a chronic granulomatous condition caused by fungal infection and
		"is rarely encountered in Europe. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a"
		case of maduromycosis affecting the chest wall in the United Kingdom.
		Conservative excision and drainage of the lesion combined with ketoconazole
		treatment in a dose 400 mg daily for several months failed to cure the condition.
		"However, radical excision of the lesion combined with myoplastic repair of the"
		defect in the chest wall eradicated the disease. Maduromycosis can occur in the
		chest wall and should be suspected in the immigrant population from tropical and
		"subtropical areas. We recommend radical resection of similar lesions, combined"
		with prolonged treatment with an antifungal agent e.g. ketoconazole when the
		causative organism is madurella mycetomis.

PG	-	733-7
AB	-	This study presents the case of rapidly progressing pulmonary aspergillosis in a
		47-year-old woman who had healed cavitations of pulmonary tuberculosis in the
		right upper lobe. She had been treated for pulmonary tuberculosis seven years
		prior to admission. The initial manifestations of the disease on admission
		"included cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis, pulmonary infiltrate, and renal failure. As"
		anti-myeloperoxidase anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (MPO-ANCA) were
		"positive, she was diagnosed with ANCA-associated vasculitis and treated with"
		"corticosteroids. This treatment resulted in remission of the vasculitis. However,"
		she developed new pulmonary symptoms and an enlarged cavitary lesion associated
		"with the rapid formation of a fungal, ball-shaped shadow that was serially"
		observed by radiological analysis. Pulmonary resection was finally performed
		because of acute progressive respiratory failure due to massive recurrent
		hemoptysis. A subsequent pathological analysis revealed a mass of hyphae with
		"acute-angle branching, features consistent with Aspergillus, within the cavitary"
		"lesion, and she was diagnosed with pulmonary aspergillosis. The rapid development"
		of pulmonary aspergillosis associated with the formation of an Aspergillus
		mycetoma should be attributed to the loss of normal immune mechanisms due to
		immunosuppressive treatment.

TI	-	Pseudallescheriasis as an aggressive opportunistic infection in a bone marrow
		transplant recipient.
PG	-	207-9
AB	-	Pseudallescheria boydii is a low-virulence fungus that is the main causative
		agent of posttraumatic mycetoma in a nonimmunocompromised host. Immunocompromised
		patients are at high risk for locally invasive or disseminated Pseudallescheria
		"infection. However, aggressive opportunistic infections due to P boydii are"
		"reported infrequently because it morphologically resembles other fungi,"
		"especially Aspergillus species, on tissue histology; therefore, such infections"
		are not identified and treated properly. We report a case of disseminated P
		boydii infection in a patient following bone marrow transplantation. The identity
		of the fungus was not recognized until microbiologic culture results became
		available. Our case illustrates the importance of recognizing this fungus as an
		"opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients, as well as the need for"
		culture of biopsy material for proper identification so that appropriate therapy
		can be instituted.

PG	-	797-9
AB	-	Abdominal eumycotic mycetoma caused by Pseudallescheria boydii was diagnosed in a
		3-year-old male Siberian Husky. The dog was examined because of weight loss and
		"signs of depression. Initially, pyrexia was the only clinical finding. Antibiotic"
		"and corticosteroid treatment was ineffective. Two weeks later, the dog's appetite"
		"had decreased, it had vomited a few times, and the caudal portion of the abdomen"
		was sensitive to palpation. Hematologic and serum biochemical abnormalities
		"consisted of anemia, leukocytosis, hypoglycemia, hypoalbuminemia,"
		"hyperglobulinemia, and high alkaline phosphatase activity. One week later, the"
		"dog's condition continued to worsen, and testicular swelling was observed. The"
		dog was castrated. Microscopic examination of specimens obtained at surgery
		revealed pyogranulomatous periorchitis with mycetoma granules. Ketoconazole
		treatment was initiated and continued until the dog died one month later.
		"Necropsy revealed multifocal duodenal ulcers, with transmural pyogranulomatous"
		"enteritis, pancreatitis, and peritonitis. This case is unique because the"
		etiologic agent apparently entered via the intestinal tract rather than by
		contamination of an external wound.

AB	-	"We present a case of subcutaneous hyalohyphomycosis due to Acremonium recifei, a"
		"species whose habitat is probably the soil, first identified in 1934 by Arêa Leão"
		and Lobo in a case of podal eumycetoma with white-yellowish grains and initially
		named Cephalosporium recifei. A white immunocompetent female patient from the
		"state of Bahia, Brazil, with a history of traumatic injury to the right hand is"
		"reported. The lesions was painless, with edema, inflammation and the presence of"
		fistulae. Seropurulent secretion with the absence of grains was present.
		Histopathological examination of material stained with hematoxylin-eosin showed
		hyaline septate hyphae. A culture was positive for Acremonium recifei. Treatment
		"with itraconazole, 200 mg/day, for two months led to a favorable course and cure"
		of the process. We report for the first time in the literature a case of
		subcutaneous hyalohyphomycosis due to Acremonium recifei in a immunocompetent
		"woman. Treatment with itraconazole 200 mg/day, for two months, resulted in cure."

		artificial aortic graft.
PG	-	2117-9
AB	-	A 38-year-old man with Marfan syndrome underwent an aortic replacement with an
		artificial aortic valve at 27 years of age and an aortic graft at 31 years of
		"age. In 2011, he was diagnosed as having chronic necrotizing pulmonary"
		aspergillosis (CNPA). He developed a fever and an increased sputum volume and was
		admitted to the hospital in 2012. Contrast-enhanced CT showed an irregularly
		shaped nonenhanced structure in the aortic graft. He died on hospital day 31.
		"From the autopsy findings, we speculated that an infiltration by the CNPA lesion"
		into a pulmonary vein was followed by the hematogenous formation of a fungus ball
		in the aortic graft.

TI	-	Actinomycetoma by Nocardia brasiliensis in a girl with Down syndrome.
PG	-	9
AB	-	We describe the case of a 14-year-old girl with Down syndrome and a large
		cutaneous plaque localized to the right neck and shoulder that had enlarged over
		five years after a minor traumatic injury. The plaque was characterized by
		numerous inflammatory nodules and fistulae that secreted purulent discharge.
		Nocardia grains were identified and Nocardia brasiliensis was identified by
		culture. Histopathology examination showed a chronic inflammatory infiltrate with
		granuloma development. The treatment scheme was with Diaminodiphenylsulfone
		50/mg/d and Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole 800/160 mg BID. Therapy was continued
		"over 1(1/2) years, with a tapering dose. After 2(1/2) years of continuous"
		"treatment, clinical and microbiological healing was achieved."

PG	-	604-7
AB	-	A case of infection of the superior sagittal sinus with Petriellidium boydii is
		reported. This relatively common fungal pathogen rarely invades the central
		nervous system. Immunological compromise and poor personal hygiene seem to be
		common attributes shared by this patient and the 4 previous patients reported to
		have suffered invasion of the central nervous system by this organism. This
		report is unique in that it is the first demonstrating apparent hematogenous
		dissemination of this organism to the central nervous system.

PG	-	S42-5
AB	-	Phaeohyphomycosis caused by Phialophora parasitica is rare and it has never been
		documented in Thailand. The first two Thai cases of phaeohyphomycosis caused by
		"P. parasitica were recognized in early 1990 at Ramathibodi Hospital, Bangkok,"
		Thailand. Both patients had underlying diseases. The fungus developed in
		abscesses with pigmented mycelium at the lower extremity. Cultures from pus and
		tissue biopsies were positive for dematiaceous fungi. Light microscopic features
		suggested P. parasitica and which was illustrated by both scanning and
		transmission electron microscope. The first case was treated with itraconazole
		with a satisfactory initial response. The second case was successfully treated by
		surgical removal of the entire lesion.

TI	-	"Branched filaments no fungus, ovoid bodies no bacteria: Two unusual cases of"
		mycetoma.
PG	-	S170-3
AB	-	We describe a 58-year-old man presenting with necrotizing panniculitis of the
		lower right leg and a 64-year-old woman with a clinically similar lesion combined
		with pustular eruptions and subsequent ulceration on the forehead. In the first
		"patient, Giemsa staining showed small ovoid bodies and Grocott staining revealed"
		hyphae. Histology from the process on the forehead showed branched filaments in
		"the periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining. In the first case, Madurella"
		"mycetomatis, a fungus, was the pathogenic agent, whereas in the other case white"
		colonies of filamentous organisms resembling fungi could be cultivated that
		turned out to be the bacterium Nocardia brasiliensis. Since the initial clinical
		appearance of these two forms of mycetoma were almost identical and
		"histopathologic findings were inconclusive, only sophisticated microbiologic"
		work-up of material from lesional skin led to the correct diagnosis. In times of
		"global tourism, these unusual cases impressively document the necessity to become"
		more familiar with mycetoma to make accurate therapeutic decisions with effective
		"results, possibly saving a limb."

TI	-	Surgical treatment for a case of postoperative Pseudallescheria boydii
		endophthalmitis.
PG	-	98-101
AB	-	Pseudallescheria boydii (P. boydii) is an uncommon ocular pathogen which
		previously has been identified in only 10 of 905 fungal isolates identified by
		the Sid Richardson Microbiology Laboratory at the Cullen Eye Institute of Baylor
		"College of Medicine. Furthermore, only one case of postoperative P. boydii"
		endophthalmitis and four cases of endogenous P. boydii endophthalmitis have been
		reported. Three of the four patients with endogenous endophthalmitis died within
		4 weeks of diagnosis. We describe a second case of postoperative endophthalmitis
		due to this fungus. The infection was successfully eradicated following
		"vitrectomy, corneoscleral resection, and patch graft, in addition to intraocular,"
		"topical, and oral antifungal medication. Although in vitro sensitivities are"
		"variable, P. boydii is known to be relatively resistant to amphotericin B. This"
		points to the importance of proper cultures and sensitivities when treating cases
		"of suspected fungal endophthalmitis. Unfortunately, the patient's eye became"
		phthisical 6 months following the initial intervention.

		with high mortality and sometimes not feasible due to clinical conditions. We
		"report a case of an immunocompetent patient with multiple pulmonary mycetomas,"
		"suggestive for probable chronic aspergillosis, in which surgery was"
		contraindicated. The patient experienced a good response to long-term oral
		voriconazole therapy with remarkable clinical and radiological improvement at
		"three-month follow-up. In cases of probable chronic aspergillomas, when surgery"
		"is contraindicated, long-term antifungal therapy with voriconazole seems to be a"
		valid alternative option.

PG	-	412-4
AB	-	Mycetoma of the scalp in a 10-year-old boy is reported. This is the first report
		"of this infection in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. The causative agent,"
		"Actinomadura madurae, has already been described in the Kingdom and shown by"
		other workers to affect other parts of the body. The probable pathogenesis is
		discussed and the need to increase clinical awareness of the condition stressed.

TI	-	Successful treatment of multiple Pseudallescheria boydii brain abscesses and

PG	-	189-92
AB	-	RATIONALE: We report on a cerebral infection by Pseudallescheria boydii in a
		21-month-old boy after a near-drowning episode. MRI revealed multiple (> 60)
		intracerebral abscesses. METHODS: The surgical therapy included CSF drainage and
		microsurgical resection of one abscess for microbiological diagnosis. Antimycotic
		therapy included terbinafine and intraventricular caspofungin in addition to
		voriconazole. RESULTS: Systemic side effects of chemotherapy were not observed.
		"After placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, the boy was transferred to a"
		"rehabilitation clinic and improved neurologically. After 20 months, MRI"
		documented a continuing remission of the disease. CONCLUSION: Our case proves
		that an aggressive treatment should be undertaken and can be successful in CNS
		pseudallescheriasis.

PG	-	267-71
AB	-	The authors systematically analyze a series of 38 patients having a total of 40
		vitreous fluid cytology determinations. Nine of the 38 patients (23.7%) have
		"cytologic results diagnostic for, or at least highly suggestive of, a specific"
		disease process. These include two cases of bacterial endophthalmitis; two cases
		of fungal endophthalmitis; one case of vitreal amyloidosis; and four cases called
		positive for intraocular lymphoma. There are no vitreous fluid cytology
		determinations falsely positive or falsely negative for malignancy in this
		series. Intraocular lymphoma and the increasingly important role of vitreous
		fluid cytology examination in its diagnosis are discussed. The authors conclude
		"that a strong commitment to quality control concepts, including detailed clinical"
		"follow-up, is essential in order to develop clinician trust and help achieve"
		optimal patient care benefit from this valuable diagnostic modality.

PG	-	797-9
AB	-	A fatal case of pulmonary berylliosis in a 42 year old male is described. The
		patient was exposed to beryllium while working in a chemical plant over a 9 year
		"period, and presented two years after ceasing such employment. The berylliosis"
		was diagnosed on open lung biopsy in 1971. The patient was commenced on steriod
		therapy at that time. He suffered progressive dyspnoea from severe restrictive
		lung disease over the next 14 years. A chest X-ray of June 1985 revealed a lesion
		in the left upper lobe suggestive of a mycetoma. Before any therapy could be
		instituted he suffered a massive haemoptysis and died. Post-mortem examination
		revealed two large mycetomata in the right and left upper lobes. Parenchymal
		histology showed evidence of chronic inflammation with non-caseating granulomata
		and the cavity wall showed localized invasion by Aspergillus fumigatus. It is
		possible that the long term steroid therapy with multiple boosters of treatment
		may have contributed to the development of the mycetoma. This is the first case
		report known to the authors of a fatal aspergilloma in association with chronic
		berylliosis treated with steroids.

AB	-	Pseudallescheria boydii arthritis of the knee developed in a 32-year-old
		immunocompetent man 2 years after a compound patellar fracture contaminated with
		"soil. No other potential portal of entry was identified, suggesting that the"
		fungus remained latent for 2 years. Pseudallescheria arthritis often occurs after
		"a prolonged latency period, causing minimal symptoms that contrast with the"
		frequently severe radiological changes. Although this organism often shows
		"limited sensitivity to most antifungal agents, our patient achieved a full"
		recovery after surgical synovectomy and 6 months of itraconazole therapy (400 mg/
		d). This case illustrates the importance of testing for fungi in patients with
		"torpid arthritis, particularly when mild clinical symptoms contrast with severe"
		bone and joint destruction.

TI	-	Malignant fibrous histiocytoma resembling mycetoma.
PG	-	318-21
AB	-	A case of malignant fibrous histiocytoma resembling mycetoma is reported. We
		describe a patient with a draining purulent mass and localized swelling of the
		left ankle. The lesion's ulcerated surface produced purulent material that
		"contained black ""granules"" resembling those seen in mycetoma. Cultures revealed a"
		heavy growth of Staphylococcus aureus and no growth of fungi. Treatment with oral
		antibiotics resulted in resolution of the infection with persistence of the mass.
		Histopathologic examination of the mass was consistent with malignant fibrous
		histiocytoma. This case represents an example of a malignant lesion whose initial
		presentation was complicated by a bacterial infection resembling a mycetoma.

		Investigation of cytokine metabolism in PAP is warranted.

PG	-	3
AB	-	"We present a case of a 31-year-old male, a known patient with lepromatous leprosy"
		"with a type 2 lepra reaction, who presented with a slowly growing asymptomatic"
		swelling with multiple discharging sinuses over the forehead that developed over
		6 months. Smears of the serosanguinous discharge on Gram staining showed
		"Gram-positive branching filamentous bacilli, which on culture on blood agar"
		showed chalky-white colonies. Histology of the lesion showed suppurative
		granulomas with polymorphs surrounding characteristic grains. The isolate was
		identified as Nocardia nova by gene sequencing and the patient was started on
		combined antibiotic therapy that resulted in complete resolution of the infection
		"in six months. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of mycetoma"
		related to Nocardia nova in association with leprosy.

AB	-	A case of sphenoid sinusitis due to Pseudallescheria boydii is described in a
		52-year-old non-immunocompromised woman. Treatment should always involve surgical
		"drainage, and antifungal chemotherapy may be of benefit if there is histological"
		evidence of invasion of surrounding tissue. For P. boydii infection miconazole
		"should be the agent of choice, rather than amphotericin B. For this reason it is"
		important to obtain culture and histological examination of sinus contents if
		fungal infection is suspected.

		by Nocardia brasiliensis. We report a case of actinomycetoma in the arm by
		Nocardia brasiliensis disseminated to lung. Uncommon grains were observed which
		present outside peripheral filaments and also numerous filaments loosing the
		grains. These characteristics of the grains are due probably because for the long
		treatment with antibiotics of the patient. In situ antibiotic action against the
		microcolonies is discussed.

PG	-	398-400
AB	-	We report a case of a baby with Down Syndrome and history of a corrective surgery
		"for a duodenum stenosis, which was subjected to a parenteral nutrition with"
		central venous catheter. A two-dimensional color Doppler echocardiographic
		examination revealed a voluminous oval-shaped mobile inhomogeneous mass adhering
		to the tricuspid valve. The intraoperative pathology showed that it was a large
		fungal vegetation. The probable source of Candida Albicans was an infected
		intravenous catheter. We wish to remark the role of echocardiography in the
		diagnosis and choice of timing of surgery.

TI	-	Brain abscesses due to Pseudallescheria boydii associated with primary
		non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the central nervous system: a case report and
		literature review.
PG	-	272-77
AB	-	A 54-year-old man with primary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the thoracic spinal cord
		developed multiple brain abscesses caused by Pseudallescheria boydii. The patient
		had received radiotherapy and corticosteroid treatment before developing the
		"brain abscesses. Antemortem diagnostic evaluations were inconclusive, and"
		diagnosis was finally made from postmortem brain specimens by the use of
		histologic examination and isolation of the fungus in culture. The portal of
		"entry for the organism was unknown, but the abscesses were confined to the brain"
		alone. P. boydii should be considered as a possible cause of multiple brain
		"abscesses in patients with malignant lymphoma, especially after immunosuppressive"
		treatment with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. The literature on the rare
		occurrence of brain abscesses caused by this fungus is reviewed.

AB	-	Pulmonary mycetomas (fungus balls) caused by mucormycosis and aspergillus
		developed in 2 patients after aspiration pneumonia and septic lung infarction. No
		specific therapy was initiated and both fungus balls underwent spontaneous lysis.
		These patients and the descriptive literature of other patients with fungus balls
		secondary to acute lung damage suggest that mycetomas forming in acutely damaged
		but previously healthy lung tissue have a high incidence of spontaneous
		resolution. Therapy with antifungal agents or resectional surgery is not required
		unless hemoptysis or chronic suppurative infection develops.

TI	-	An Illustrative Report of Three Cases of Madura Foot with Diagnostic and
		Treatment Features.
PG	-	74-78
LID	-	10.13107/jocr.2021.v11.i11.2522 [doi]
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Madura foot is a rare infective granulomatous foot disease. The
		burden of this disease has significantly declined in recent years due to better
		"generalized living conditions. Hence, the diagnosis can be quite often missed by"
		the new generation orthopedic surgeon for other more similar conditions. Early
		diagnosis and prompt treatment is crucial for better outcome and limb survival.
		We here present the clinical picture of three such Madura foot cases. CASE
		"SERIES: In this study, three Indian males aged between 40 and 60 years of rural"
		background presented to our department with chronic multiple discharging sinuses
		of the foot. They were initially treated for several months in their local health
		"centers without any improvement. Finally, they came to our institution where they"
		were thoroughly inspected and underwent various investigations such as magnetic
		resonance imaging (MRI) and histopathological examination. They were referred
		"across various departments such as dermatology, general surgery and orthopedics,"
		and eventually got correct diagnosis. Treatment was promptly started with oral
		"itraconazole, an antifungal drug, and one patient undergoing additional surgical"
		debulking of the disease which lead to gradual healing of the disease as evident
		by disappearance of sinuses and return of normal skin in 6-12 months. CONCLUSION:
		"Madura foot is very characteristic, although it may mimic more prevalent"
		infectious conditions. The characteristic multiple discharging sinuses with
		"extrusions of sulphur granules and MRI findings of ""dot in circle"" should clinch"
		the diagnosis quickly. Medical therapy should be continued for at least 12 months
		even if there is resolution of disease in the early or mid-phase of treatment.
		Debulking of the disease will aid in early recovery and reduce abnormal swelling
		or appearance of the foot.

TI	-	Acremonium kiliense endophthalmitis that occurred after cataract extraction in an
		ambulatory surgical center and was traced to an environmental reservoir.
PG	-	222-7
AB	-	"During October and November 1993, four patients contracted Acremonium kiliense"
		endophthalmitis at one ambulatory surgical center. We hypothesized that the
		"source was environmental and conducted a matched case-control study,"
		"environmental evaluation, and observational studies. Case and control patients"
		"were similar in clinical characteristics. However, case patients all had surgery"
		on the first operative day of the week or had surgery significantly sooner after
		the operating room opened than did controls (a median of 46 vs. 150 minutes
		afterward; P = .03). An environmental review revealed the ventilation system was
		switched on 5-30 minutes before procedures began on the first operative day of
		"the week, and air was filtered before but not after humidification. Cultures of"
		the humidifier water in the ventilation system yielded A. kiliense phenotypically
		identical to isolates from case patients. Our data suggest that switching on the
		ventilation system each week aerosolized a reservoir of A. kiliense and caused
		infection of patients. We believe this is the first reported outbreak of fungal
		"endophthalmitis traced to an environmental source, and it underscores the"
		importance of utilizing established hospital infection control practices in the
		outpatient setting.

AB	-	The aim of our retrospective study is to report a case series of ocular
		"infections caused by a rare fungus, Scedosporium apiospermum, in a South Indian"
		population. Thirteen cases of culture-positive S. apiospermum infections
		diagnosed between January 2011 and March 2016 were included in this study. The
		"parameters evaluated were predisposing factors, treatment and final clinical"
		outcome. The most common mode of presentation was keratitis (84.6%) followed by
		sclerokeratitis (15.3%). The predisposing factors involved were unspecified
		"foreign body injury (30.7%), organic matter injury (15.3%), uncontrolled diabetes"
		"(7.6%), and recent manual small-incision cataract surgery (7.6%). Five cases"
		"(38.46%) had no predisposing factor. Of the 11 keratitis cases, nine (69.2%)"
		responded well to combination medical therapy while one case (7.6%) required
		therapeutic keratoplasty. One case was lost to follow-up. Both cases which
		presented with sclerokeratitis showed no response to medico-surgical treatment
		progressing to panophthalmitis and evisceration.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Scedosporium species and Lomentospora prolificans (Sc/Lp) are
		emerging molds that cause invasive disease associated with a high mortality rate.
		"After Aspergillus, these molds are the second filamentous fungi recovered in lung"
		"transplant (LT) recipients. AIMS: Our objective was to evaluate the incidence,"
		risk factors and outcome of Sc/Lp infections in LT recipients at a tertiary care
		hospital with a national reference LT program. METHODS: A nine-year retrospective
		"study was conducted. RESULTS: During this period, 395 LT were performed. Positive"
		cultures for Sc/Lp were obtained from twenty-one LT recipients. Twelve patients
		(incidence 3.04%) developed invasive scedosporiosis (IS). In 66.7% of the
		patients with IS the invasive infection was defined as a breakthrough one. The
		main sites of infection were lungs and paranasal sinuses. Most of the patients
		received combination antifungal therapy. The IS crude mortality rate after 30
		"days was 16.7%, and 33.3% after a year. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights"
		improved survival rates associated with combination antifungal therapy in LT
		recipients and underlines the risk of breakthrough infections in patients with
		allograft dysfunction on nebulized lipidic amphotericin B prophylaxis. In
		"addition to pretransplant colonization, acute or chronic organ dysfunctions seem"
		to be the main risk factors for IS.

		- A single center experience over 24 years.
PG	-	e13546
LID	-	10.1111/tid.13546 [doi]
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Scedosporium apiospermum and Lomentospora prolificans
		"(Scedosporium/Lomentospora) species are emerging, multi-resistant pathogens that"
		cause life-threatening illnesses among lung transplant (LTx) recipients. The
		current epidemiology and management in LTx are unknown. METHODS: We performed a
		retrospective single center audit of all sputum/bronchoscopy samples for
		Scedosporium/Lomentospora species in LTx patients over a 24-year period
		(1995-2019). Patients were diagnosed as colonized or with invasive fungal
		"disease. RESULTS: From a cohort of 962 LTx recipients, 30 patients (3.1%)"
		"cultured Scedosporium/Lomentospora (1.2%, 1.9%, respectively). There were no"
		"isolates from 1995 to 2013, with multiple yearly isolates thereafter. Nineteen"
		"(63%) cases were classified as IFD, and 11 (37%) as colonization. The median time"
		to first culture from transplantation was 929 days (Interquartile-range [IQR]
		263-2960). Most patients (63%) had received antifungals prior to the first
		positive culture of Scedosporium/Lomentospora for other fungal infection. The
		most common antifungal used for treatment of Scedosporium/Lomentospora was
		posaconazole (n = 16; 53%). Median duration of therapy was 364 days (IQR
		164-616). Treatment was associated with improved lung function over 6 months
		(median FEV1 increased from 1.3L[IQR 0.9-1.8L] to 1.8L[IQR 1.1-2.3] P = .05). Six
		"patients cultured Scedosporium/Lomentospora prior to transplantation, and no"
		survival disadvantage was seen as compared to our whole LTx cohort (P = .8).
		CONCLUSION: Our single center 24-year experience suggests that the incidence of
		Scedosporium/Lomentospora is increasing. Scedosporium/Lomentospora is typically
		"isolated several years after LTx, and requires prolonged anti-fungal treatment"
		that is usually associated with improved in lung function. Culture of
		Scedosporium/Lomentospora prior to LTx did not pose a survival disadvantage.

AB	-	PURPOSE: To assess the utility of image-guided transnasal endoscopic surgery for
		a variety of orbital diseases requiring decompression of at least one orbital
		wall. METHOD: A descriptive case series of consecutive orbital procedures
		requiring decompression of at least one wall. All procedures were performed using
		a transnasal endoscopic approach and an intraoperative image-guided LandmarX
		"system for anatomical guidance. RESULTS: A 3-year review yielded 17 cases,"
		"including 6 cases with compressive mucoceles, 4 neoplasms, 4 patients with"
		"proptosis secondary to Graves' Ophthalmopathy, 1 case of an intraorbital abscess,"
		"1 fungal mycetoma, and 1 hemangioma. These cases all had improved postoperative"
		clinical status without any serious complications. The LandmarX system was a
		valuable intraoperative tool in all 17 cases. CONCLUSIONS: The endoscopic
		transnasal approach to orbital decompression surgery allows for good
		visualization and is minimally invasive. Using this approach in conjunction with
		the LandmarX image-guided system allows for improved anatomical localization and
		provided good results in all cases.

AB	-	Infections in transplanted patients are still an important cause of morbidity and
		"mortality. Among them, fungal infections with pathogens have become increasingly"
		more prevalent in the last decade. We report the clinical course and management
		of disseminated Scedosporium apiospermum infection in a kidney transplant
		"recipient, with microbiological isolation of the fungus in cerebrospinal fluid"
		culture. S apiospermum is a fungus that is distributed worldwide and can be grown
		from soil samples or stagnant water. Disseminated infection is the most frequent
		"form of infection, with cerebral involvement in most cases, which leads to a very"
		high mortality (around 75%). Post-transplant renal infections require a thorough
		"evaluation. Specifically, a high suspicion index is necessary, considering"
		Scedosporium infection among the differential diagnosis of invasive fungal
		diseases in renal transplantation patients. It is essential to confirm the
		microbiological diagnosis for an adequate diagnosis and treatment.

AB	-	A previously reported case of cerebral infection due to Curvularia lunata is more
		fully described. Medical cure was apparently achieved after 30 months' treatment
		with amphotericin B. Success was achieved only when the drug was given in a dose
		"of 40 mg, three times per week, and was continued for six months after enhanced"
		computed tomographic scans no longer showed cerebral lesions. Immunologic studies
		suggested the infection was accompanied by an unexplained defect in cell-mediated
		immunity.

AB	-	"PURPOSE: To evaluate the prevalence, predisposing factors, and outcomes of"
		"bacterial and fungal scleritis. METHODS: We reviewed the clinical findings,"
		"therapeutic interventions, and visual outcomes of patients with suppurative"
		scleral inflammation without preceding microbial keratitis who had microorganisms
		isolated from scleral scrapings. DESIGN: Retrospective interventional case
		"series. RESULTS: Of 349 patients with scleritis diagnosed from 1999 to 2009, 6"
		adults (1.7%) presented with suppurative inflammation of the anterior sclera due
		"to Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2), Streptococcus pneumoniae (2), Staphylococcus"
		"aureus (1), and Scedosporium apiospermum/Pseudallescheria boydii (1). Each had"
		ocular surgery of the affected eye before presentation. Intraocular extension
		"occurred in 2 eyes. After local and systemic antimicrobial therapy, all improved"
		"without evisceration or enucleation, and 4 attained vision of 20/60 or better."
		CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial or fungal scleritis is an uncommon ocular infection that
		can belatedly follow anterior segment procedures. Antimicrobial therapy and
		surgical intervention can successfully control progressive suppuration and reduce
		vision-limiting complications.

AB	-	The genus Acremonium (formerly known as Cephalosporium) is a large polyphyletic
		"fungal genus that comprises approximately 150 phylogenetically distant species,"
		commonly isolated from the environment. Clinical cases concern mostly superficial
		"infections after traumatic inoculation, but there are reports of opportunistic"
		invasive infections in immunocompromised patients. Acremonium kiliense has been
		"described as a cause of mycetoma, keratitis, endophthalmitis, endocarditis, and"
		continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis. We describe an
		unusual cluster of possible catheter-related bloodstream infections due to this
		pathogen in patients who underwent haematopoietic cell transplantation.

TI	-	Treatment of a brain abscess caused by Scedosporium apiospermum and
		Phaeoacremonium parasiticum in a renal transplant recipient.
PG	-	484-9
AB	-	Cerebral mycosis is a significant cause of morbidity among immunocompromised
		populations. We present here a case of cerebral infection with Scedosporium
		apiospermum and Phaeoacremonium parasiticum in a 49-year-old renal transplant
		"recipient. Fourteen years after renal transplantation, the patient presented with"
		invasive pulmonary aspergillosis treated with intravenous liposomal amphotericin
		"B. The patient had clinical and radiographic improvement. However, 6 weeks later,"
		the patient presented with cerebral infection. Magnetic resonance imaging
		revealed multiple rim enhancing brain abscesses. Brain and cerebrospinal fluid
		cultures ultimately grew Scedosporium apiospermum and Phaeoacremonium
		parasiticum. The patient was treated with voriconazole for 6 months and had
		clinical and radiologic improvement. We believe this is the first reported case
		of co-infection of the brain with scedosporiosis and phaeohyphomycosis in a renal
		"transplant recipient, who had received intravenous liposomal amphotericin B."
		Voriconazole may represent a new therapeutic option for these simultaneous
		infections in the brain.

TI	-	Painful Lytic Lesions of the Foot: A Case Report.
PG	-	35-37
LID	-	10.5704/MOJ.1503.005 [doi]
AB	-	The presence of lytic lesions in the bones of foot raises a number of diagnostic
		"possibilities ranging from infection, inflammatory pathology to neoplastic"
		conditions. Although the radiological picture is not pathognomonic of any
		"pathology, clinical history and histopathological examination can help to clinch"
		the diagnosis. We present a case of multiple lytic lesions of the foot and
		discuss possible differential diagnoses. The patient was diagnosed as a case of
		madura foot and the lesions responded to surgical debridement and anti-fungal
		"treatment with a good functional outcome. Madura foot is an uncommon, chronic"
		granulomatous fungal or bacterial infection with a predilection in people who
		"walk barefoot. Although known for a specific geographical distribution, madura"
		foot should be kept as a possible diagnosis in patients presenting with lytic
		lesions of the foot due to population emigration across the world.

TI	-	Clinical outcome of cystic fibrosis patients colonized by Scedosporium species
		following lung transplantation: A single-center 15-year experience.
LID	-	10.1111/tid.12738 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Fungi of the genus Scedosporium are emerging pathogens responsible
		for severe infections in lung transplant recipients. These infections are
		associated with poor prognosis and some centers consider now Scedosporium species
		colonization as a contraindication to lung transplantation (LT) even though no
		published evidence demonstrates that Scedosporium species colonization is
		"associated with higher morbidity or mortality after LT. METHODS: Here, we aim to"
		describe characteristics and outcome of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung transplant
		recipients colonized with Scedosporium species in a single center over a 15-year
		"period. RESULTS: During the study period, 14 patients had scedosporial"
		"colonization reported. Only one patient, colonized before transplantation by"
		"Lomentospora prolificans, developed scedosporial disease. Among the eight"
		"patients colonized before transplantation by Scedosporium apiospermum complex,"
		the median survival was 1.92 year (range 0.21-12.5). All these patients except
		one became free of fungal colonization after transplantation with antifungal
		prophylaxis including voriconazole or posaconazole. For the five patients
		"colonized after LT, including two with L. prolificans, the median survival was"
		1.75 years (range 0.1-13); three of them are still alive. CONCLUSIONS: It appears
		to us that scedosporial colonization may not be a contraindication for LT in CF
		"patients, as long as S. apiospermum complex is involved and a life-long azole"
		prophylaxis prescribed.

AB	-	Peritonitis is an inflammation of the peritoneum that occurs in patients with
		end-stage renal disease (ESRD) treated by peritoneal dialysis. Fungal peritonitis
		is a dreaded complication of peritoneal dialysis. Curvularia lunata is known to
		"cause extra renal disease like endocarditis, secondary allergic bronchopulmonary"
		aspergillosis and endophthalmitis. This case report presents a case of continuous
		ambulatory peritoneal dialysis peritonitis with this disease and its management.
		"This case is of a 45-year-old man, presented with ESRD, secondary to diabetic"
		nephropathy. After 3 months of hemodialysis the patient was put on continuous
		ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Local Examination at catheter site showed
		skin excoriation and purulent discharge. Further peritoneal dialysis (PD) fluid
		analysis showed neutrophilic leukocytosis and diagnosis of Curvularia lunata PD
		peritonitis.

		recipients.
PG	-	75-81
AB	-	A prospective study on the microbes isolated from the alimentary tract in 120
		bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients (1991-1993) was undertaken to define the
		"spectrum of organisms isolated under antimicrobial prophylaxis, their temporal"
		"sequence of emergence, and the associated morbidity and mortality. Clostridium"
		"difficile (n = 20), isolated in the pre-engraftment and early post-engraftment"
		"periods (day 2-45 post-BMT), was the most common microbe recovered from stool of"
		"patients with diarrhea. In contrast to previous reports, no significant"
		difference in mortality was observed between patients with and without C.
		difficile isolated in stool. Two patients had neutropenic ileocecitis with
		concomitant bacteremia due to Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. One
		"patient was found to have astrovirus gastroenteritis (day 7), and Giardia lamblia"
		was recovered from the stool of another (day -7). Heavy growth of Staphylococcus
		aureus from direct smear-positive specimens was found from the upper airway of
		two patients with severe mucositis and complete dysphagia (day 12 and 23).
		Salmonella spp. of groups B and E were found in the stool of five asymptomatic
		patients at the time of conditioning. No specific organisms was recovered from
		"the endoscopic brushing of two patients with lower end esophagitis, three"
		"patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and three patients with perirectal"
		"cellulitis. During the post-engraftment period, five patients had documented"
		"cytomegalovirus gastroenterocolitis (days 34-97), one had Mycobacterium chelonae"
		"colitis (day 70), and another had nodular gastritis due to Acremonium falciforme"
		"(day 270). Overall, only 28% of patients with alimentary tract symptoms/syndrome"
		had specific pathogens isolated from clinical specimens. Differentiation of the
		causation of alimentary tract symptoms was often difficult because noninfectious
		"complications such as conditioning toxicity, graft-versus-host disease, and its"
		treatment often caused alimentary tract symptoms in addition to predisposed BMT
		patient to infection. The reluctance of obtaining tissue biopsy for ascertaining
		the importance of those potential alimentary tract pathogens often dictate the
		use of empirical treatment.

AB	-	Scopulariopsis acremonium is a species of saprophytic fungus not previously
		"reported to cause invasive disease in humans, although invasive infections from"
		other species of Scopulariopsis have been reported and are reviewed. Deep
		infection with this fungus is associated with a high mortality rate. Invasive

PG	-	159-63
LID	-	10.3341/kjo.2009.23.3.159 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: Postoperative endophthalmitis is a dreaded outcome of any intraocular
		surgery. Fungal endophthalmitis is a particularly severe complication that poses
		a significant threat of blindness. We experienced seven consecutive cases of
		postoperative fungal endophthalmitis stemming from a single local clinic in which
		extensive early intervention resulted in favorable final visual acuity. METHODS:
		The present study is retrospective observational case series of fungal
		"endophthalmitis. The initial case, as diagnosed by fungal culture, resulted in"
		"blindness. In the ensuing eight months, seven consecutive cases were referred to"
		our institution. All were presumed to be fungal endophthalmitis as the cases
		possessed similar inflammatory findings to the preceding case and occurred in the
		same environment. Extensive surgical and antifungal treatment was immediately
		"administered, including complete vitrectomy with removal of the intraocular lens"
		and lens capsule and Amphotericin B injections. RESULTS: Retinal infiltration was
		identified in three cases and the lesion site was photocoagulated with an
		endolaser. All cases were confirmed fungal endophthalmitis by culture (4 cases:
		"Candida parapsilosis, one case each: Fusarium, Acremonium, Candida tropicalis)"
		and five cases required secondary intraocular lens implantation. Final corrected
		visual acuity ranged from 20/20 to 40/200 by the Snellen chart. CONCLUSIONS:
		Early extensive surgical intervention and antifungal agent administration may
		result in favorable visual outcomes in patients with fungal endophthalmitis
		following cataract surgery.

		Patient.
PG	-	906-909
LID	-	10.4103/0028-3886.293486 [doi]
AB	-	Scedosporium apiospermum is a filamentous fungus causing a broad spectrum of
		clinical diseases especially in those who are immunocompromised. The common sites
		"involved are lungs, skin, sinuses, eyes, bones, joints, and central nervous"
		system (CNS). CNS is involved in invasive Scedosporiosis in the form of a
		cerebral abscess. An antecedent event of either near-drowning or history of some
		trauma is present in the majority of the cases where the patients' immune
		response remains intact. Prognosis is generally poor since the majority of the
		patients have coexistent medical morbidity. Surgical drainage followed by
		"adjuvant antifungal, i.e., voriconazole therapy offers the best possible chance"
		for survival in these patients. This case report discusses a rare event of brain
		abscess caused by S. apiospermum in an immunocompetent patient without any
		preceding precipitating factor.

		he became drowsy and developed right-sided hemiparesis. Magnetic resonance
		imaging of the brain revealed multiple irregular masses with associated edema
		consistent with fungal brain abscesses. Left parietal abscess was drained and he
		was started on voriconazole. His cyclosporine was stopped. Drained pus revealed
		fungal hyphae on potassium hydroxide stain and Scedosporium apiospermum on
		"culture. Unfortunately, the patient died after five days. Scedosporium infections"
		should be kept as a possibility in transplant recipients with disseminated
		"infections, especially with a brain abscess. Despite antifungal therapy and"
		"surgical drainage, mortality rates are high."

		Review and In Vitro Antifungal Activity of Hypochlorous Acid.
PG	-	1599-605
LID	-	10.1097/ICO.0000000000000639 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: To review the current literature describing cases of fungal keratitis
		and endophthalmitis after Boston keratoprosthesis (KPro) implantation and to
		characterize the antifungal activity of 0.01% hypochlorous acid against medically
		relevant fungi. METHODS: A literature review of fungal keratitis or
		"endophthalmitis in KPro patients from January 2001 to April 2015, and an in vitro"
		time kill assay characterizing the fungicidal activity of 0.01% hypochlorous acid
		"against fungi causing ocular infections. RESULTS: Fifteen publications,"
		"predominantly retrospective case series, were identified. Infection rates after"
		KPro implantation ranged from 0.009 to 0.02 fungal infections per patient-year of
		follow-up. The largest single-surgeon series reported an incidence of 2.4% for
		fungal endophthalmitis during a 10-year period. Causative organisms included both
		yeasts and molds. Outcomes were favorable if infections were caught early and
		treated appropriately; less favorable outcomes were reported in developing
		countries where fungal species are endemic and resources are limited. 0.01%
		"hypochlorous acid is rapidly fungicidal, reducing the number of viable yeast"
		cells or mold conidia by at least 99.99% within 60 seconds. The antifungal
		"activity extended to all molds (Acremonium kiliense, Aspergillus flavus,"
		"Aspergillus fumigatus, Fusarium solani, and Mucor indicus) and yeast species"
		(Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis) tested. CONCLUSIONS: Fungal
		infections remain a lifelong concern in patients after KPro implantation. There
		"is a growing need for a standard antifungal prophylaxis regimen, especially in"
		the developing world. The rapid broad-spectrum in vitro fungicidal activity of
		0.01% hypochlorous acid against all fungi tested makes it an attractive candidate
		as an antifungal prophylaxis in KPro patients.

		of Scedosporium species identification.
PG	-	486-497
LID	-	10.1093/mmy/myaa086 [doi]
AB	-	Scedosporiosis/lomentosporiosis is a devastating emerging fungal infection. Our
		objective was to describe the clinical pattern and to analyze whether taxonomic
		grouping of the species involved was supported by differences in terms of
		clinical presentations or outcomes. We retrospectively studied cases of invasive
		scedosporiosis in France from 2005 through 2017 based on isolates characterized
		"by polyphasic approach. We recorded 90 cases, mainly related to Scedosporium"
		"apiospermum (n = 48), S. boydii/S. ellipsoideum (n = 20), and Lomentospora"
		"prolificans (n = 14). One-third of infections were disseminated, with"
		unexpectedly high rates of cerebral (41%) and cardiovascular (31%) involvement.
		"In light of recent Scedosporium taxonomic revisions, we aimed to study the"
		clinical significance of Scedosporium species identification and report for the
		first time contrasting clinical presentations between infections caused S.
		"apiospermum, which were associated with malignancies and cutaneous involvement in"
		"disseminated infections, and infections caused by S. boydii, which were"
		"associated with solid organ transplantation, cerebral infections, fungemia, and"
		early death. The clinical presentation of L. prolificans also differed from that
		"of other species, involving more neutropenic patients, breakthrough infections,"
		"fungemia, and disseminated infections. Neutropenia, dissemination, and lack of"
		antifungal prescription were all associated with 3-month mortality. Our data
		support the distinction between S. apiospermum and S. boydii and between L.
		prolificans and Scedosporium sp. Our results also underline the importance of the
		"workup to assess dissemination, including cardiovascular system and brain."

TI	-	Pseudallescheria boydii (Anamorph Scedosporium apiospermum). Infection in solid
		organ transplant recipients in a tertiary medical center and review of the
		literature.
PG	-	333-48
AB	-	(Sca) is a ubiquitous filamentous fungus capable of causing invasive disease. We
		reviewed our electronic microbiology records and the English-language literature.
		Between 1976 and December 1999 we identified 23 solid organ transplant recipients
		"with Sca infection, 7 of which occurred between December 1987 and December 1999"
		"at our institution. Overall incidence was 1 per 1,000 patients, with a trend of"
		higher incidence in patients receiving lung transplants compared with other
		"transplant organs (p = 0.06). The 23 patients included liver (4), kidney (8),"
		"heart (8), lung (2), and heart/lung (1) recipients. Male to female ratio was"
		"19:4, and the mean age was 46 +/- 12 (SD) years. Fungal infection was diagnosed"
		"at a median of 4 months (range, 0.4-156 mo) after transplant. The clinical"
		"presentation included disseminated disease ( 8), skin lesions (3), lung disease"
		"(5), endophthalmitis (1), meningitis (1), brain abscess with or without extension"
		"to eye (3), fungal mycotic aneurysm (1), and sinusitis (1). Seven (30%) patients"
		"had intravascular infection, and 11 (48%) patients had central nervous system"
		involvement. Antifungal therapy was accompanied by surgical debridement in 9
		cases. Three additional patients were found to have airway colonization only and
		"received itraconazole prophylaxis, without evidence of disease. Of 22 patients"
		"with known outcome, 16 (72.7%) died. Five of 6 patients who survived had"
		"localized infections: skin lesions (n = 3), sinus fungus ball (n = 1), and"
		solitary lung nodule (n = 1). All patients with disseminated disease and 10 of 11
		patients with central nervous system disease died. An exception was 1 patient
		"with a brain abscess, successfully treated with voriconazole and surgical"
		drainage. Sca infection is rare but is associated with high mortality. Early
		"diagnosis by culture is important because Sca is resistant to amphotericin B,"
		routinely used in the empiric therapy of invasive fungal infections. Treatment
		with the combination of an antifungal and surgery may have a better outcome.
		Voriconazole promises to be an effective antifungal agent. Cultures positive for
		"Sca should not be ignored, and long-term antifungal prophylaxis in candidates and"
		transplant recipients should be considered.

AB	-	Mycetoma is a chronic granulomatous disease that is more common in tropical
		regions with predominant involvement of foot. Spinal mycetoma presenting as
		lumbar canal stenosis is extremely rare. We hereby present a case of fungal
		eumycetoma of vertebral column in a 42-year-old male who presented with chronic
		progressive low back pain and features of lumbar canal stenosis without any skin
		"swelling or discharging sinuses. The ""dot-in-circle"" sign, a highly specific"
		magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasonography (USG) sign of mycetoma has
		been described in the literature as a pathognomonic feature of mycetoma involving
		the musculoskeletal system. We describe the importance of characteristic imaging
		features with dot in circle sign in the diagnosis of eumycetoma of lumbar spine.

AB	-	PURPOSE: To describe the clinical features and outcomes of patients with
		culture-proven Pseudallescheria endophthalmitis in the context of previously
		"published cases. METHODS: A multicenter, retrospective, consecutive case series"
		was undertaken. Pathology records were reviewed for all patients with
		Pseudallescheria endophthalmitis on vitreous/aqueous cultures from June 1998 to
		"June 2013 throughout Queensland, Australia. RESULTS: Three females and 1 male"
		"aged 60 to 78 years were identified. All patients had endogenous endophthalmitis,"
		"had an underlying malignancy, and were from South East Queensland. Vitreous"
		cultures identified Scedosporium auranticum in two cases and Scedosporium
		prolificans and Scedosporium apiospermum in one case each. All isolates were
		sensitive to voriconazole. Enucleation was required in two patients. Two patients
		had final best-corrected visual acuities of perception of light and no perception
		"of light, respectively. CONCLUSION: Endophthalmitis caused by species of the P."
		boydii complex is a devastating condition with poor visual outcomes. It is a
		condition that is difficult to treat because of its variable antifungal agent
		resistance.

LID	-	e14396
AB	-	Acremonium species are saprophytic fungi that are rarely pathogenic in humans.
		"According to several reports, Acremonium species can cause various diseases,"
		ranging from superficial infections after traumatic inoculation in
		immunocompetent individuals to invasive infections in the immunocompromised. To
		"the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of brain abscess in an"
		18-year-old male caused by Acremonium species in Pakistan. A combination of
		"intravenous amphotericin B and oral voriconazole was administered to the patient,"
		"which resulted in marked clinical improvement. However, the recurrence of"
		fungiwas observed after three months of completion of the antifungal course. The
		purpose of this report is to alert clinicians regarding this pathogen and its
		ability to cause systemic disease.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: Detection of hyphomycetes of the Scedosporium apiospermum complex and
		Lomentospora prolificans (Sac-Lp) is not yet standardized. Prevalence rates in
		patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and the resistance pattern of these pathogens
		in Germany are unknown. METHODS: In a one-year prospective study 11 laboratories
		"used a selective medium for isolation of Sac-Lp, examining >11,600 respiratory"
		samples from 2346 patients with CF. Isolates were identified by molecular methods
		and tested for susceptibility to antifungal drugs. RESULTS: The prevalence of
		Sac-Lp in patients with CF in Germany varied from 0.0 to 10.5% (mean: 3.1%) among
		the clinical centres. The benefit of the selective medium SceSel(+) compared to
		standard media for fungi was documented for >5000 samples. High antifungal
		"resistance was detected in the S. apiospermum complex, and the multiresistance of"
		L. prolificans was confirmed. CONCLUSION: Microbiology laboratories should be
		aware of these resistant species in patients with CF and consider using a
		selective medium.

		"(e.g., Scedosporium apiospermum, Scedosporium prolificans, Paecilomyces spp.) was"
		evaluated in 30 cancer patients (1996-2002). Diagnostic criteria proposed
		previously for evaluation of aspergillaemia were used. Blood cultures positive
		for emerging saprophytic moulds represented 1% of all positive fungal cultures.
		One case of catheter-related fungaemia was excluded. The remaining 29 cases
		"consisted of true (n = 5), probable (n = 1), indeterminate (n = 7) fungaemia, and"
		contamination (n = 16). True fungaemia was seen only in leukaemia patients and
		allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipients. S. apiospermum and S. prolificans
		were the commonest causes of true fungaemia.

AB	-	"Mycetoma is a chronic, granulomatous disease of the skin, and subcutaneous"

TI	-	Management of postoperative Acremonium endophthalmitis.
PG	-	749-56
AB	-	PURPOSE: Four patients presented after cataract surgery with delayed-onset
		endophthalmitis caused by Acremonium kiliense with in vitro sensitivity to
		"amphotericin B. In all patients, ocular infection was recalcitrant to single-dose"
		intravitreous amphotericin B injection. The authors reviewed the management of
		endophthalmitis caused by A. kiliense and presented treatment recommendations.
		METHODS: The authors retrospectively evaluated a cluster of four patients with
		delayed-onset postoperative endophthalmitis after phacoemulsification with
		posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation. All patients underwent vitreous
		"sampling, intravitreous injection of amphotericin B, and systemic administration"
		of fluconazole. Pars plana vitrectomy was performed in all patients for
		management of either primary (1 eye) or persistent infection (3 eyes). Two
		patients with persistent infection also underwent surgical explanation of their
		posterior chamber intraocular lens. RESULTS: Worsening infection developed in
		three of three eyes that underwent vitreous aspiration with intravitreous
		injection 5 micrograms amphotericin B. These patients subsequently responded to
		vitrectomy followed by additional intravitreous amphotericin B injection. One eye
		underwent primary vitrectomy and intravitreous injection of 7.5 micrograms
		"amphotericin B. Although treatment of the initial infection was successful,"
		fungal keratitis developed in this patient 3 months after presentation. Visual
		"outcome was variable, ranging from visual acuity of 20/25 to no light perception"
		with follow-up of 2 years. Epidemiologic investigation suggested a common
		environmental source for the A. kiliense organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Single-dose
		administration of intravitreous amphotericin B was inadequate treatment for
		fungal endophthalmitis caused by A. kiliense. Vitrectomy with repeated
		intravitreous administration of amphotericin B may be necessary to eradicate
		intraocular function caused by this organism.

AB	-	Invasive fungal rhinosinusitis (FRS) is a potentially fatal illness requiring
		early diagnosis and aggressive treatment with surgery and antifungals. We report
		a case of chronic FRS in a recently diagnosed diabetic individual due to
		Curvularia lunata. Imaging revealed extension into the right orbit and right
		basifrontal lobe. This was further complicated by development of nosocomial
		mucormycosis which was attributed to voriconazole therapy. The patient responded
		"well to debridement and amphotericin B based therapy. To our knowledge, there are"
		"no reported cases of invasive FRS due to Curvularia lunata. Also, breakthrough"
		"mucormycosis on voriconazole therapy is rarely seen in non-malignancy,"
		non-transplant settings. The possibility of rare fungal infections (community and
		nosocomial) should be entertained in developing settings where fungal spores are
		ubiquitous.

PG	-	576-80

AB	-	Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients may suffer increased morbidity and mortality
		"through colonisation, allergy and invasive infection from fungi. The black yeast,"
		Exophiala dermatitidis (synonym Wangiella dermatitidis) has been found with
		"increasing frequency in sputum specimens of CF patients, with reported isolation"
		"rates ranging from 1.1 to 15.7%. At present, no diagnostic PCR exists to aid with"
		the clinical laboratory detection and identification of this organism. A novel
		species-specific PCR-based assay was developed for the detection of E.
		"dermatitidis, based on employment of rDNA operons and interspacer (ITS) regions"
		"between these rDNA operons. Two novel primers, (designated ExdF & ExdR) were"
		designed in silico with the aid of computer-aided alignment software and with the
		"alignment of multiple species of Exophiala, as well as with other commonly"
		"described yeasts and filamentous fungi within CF sputum, including Candida,"
		"Aspergillus and Scedosporium. An amplicon of approximately 455 bp was generated,"
		spanning the partial ITS1 region - the complete 5.8S rDNA region - partial ITS2
		"region, employing ExdF (forward primer [16-mer], 5'-CCG CCT ATT CAG GTC C-3' and"
		"ExdR (reverse primer [16-mer], 5'-TCT CTC CCA CTC CCG C-3', was employed and"
		optimised on extracted genomic DNA from a well characterised culture of E.
		"dermatitidis, as well as with high quality genomic DNA template from a further 16"
		"unrelated fungi, including Candida albicans, C. dubliniensis, C. parapsilosis, C."
		"glabrata, Scedosporium apiospermum, Penicillium sp., Aspergillus fumigatus,"
		"Aspergillus versicolor, Pichia guilliermondii, Rhodotorula sp., Trichosporon sp.,"
		"Aureobasidium pullulans, Fusarium sp., Mucor hiemalis, Bionectria ochroleuca,"
		Gibberella pulicaris. Results demonstrated that only DNA from E. dermatitidis
		"gave an amplification product of the expected size, whilst none of the other"
		fungi were amplifiable. Subsequent employment of this primer pair detected this
		yeast from mycological cultures from 2/50 (4%) adult CF patients. These two
		patients were the only patients who were previously shown to have a cultural
		history of E. dermatitidis from their sputum. E. dermatitidis is a slow-growing
		"fungus, which usually takes up to two weeks to culture in the microbiology"
		"laboratory and therefore is slow to detect conventionally, with the risk of"
		bacterial overgrowth from common co-habiting pan- and multiresistant bacterial
		"pathogens from sputum, namely Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia"
		"complex organisms, hence this species-specific PCR assay may help detect this"
		"organism from CF sputum more specifically and rapidly. Overall, employment of"
		"this novel assay may help in the understanding of the occurrence, aetiology and"
		"epidemiology of E. dermatitidis, as an emerging fungal agent in patients with CF."

AB	-	Scedosporium apiospermum is ubiquitous in the environment and is considered an
		emerging infection. Immunocompromised hosts can have a wide spectrum of diseases
		"ranging from cutaneous to disseminated disease that may involve pulmonary,"
		"central nervous system, or bone. Disseminated disease in immunocompetent hosts is"
		uncommon. Treatment of deep-seated infections is challenging because of the
		limited susceptibility of the Scedosporium species to all current antifungal
		drugs. We report a case of Scedosporidium apiospermum fungemia with a presumed
		pulmonary involvement in an immunocompetent patient. The fungemia was
		successfully treated with oral voriconazole and terbinafine.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: The pathophysiology of acne is complex and multifactorial. In recent
		"years, fungal infections have increased significantly. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of"
		this study was to evaluate the role of fungi in the etiopathogenesis of acne
		vulgaris. METHODS: This was a prospective case-control study. A total of 200
		individuals (100 with acne vulgaris and 100 without acne vulgaris) were enrolled
		in the study. Direct microscopic investigation and culturing of the samples were
		done according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute criteria.
		"Descriptive analyses, independent sample t-tests, and chi-squared tests were used"
		for statistical analysis. The subjects in the control group were paired by age
		and gender with the patients. RESULTS: Direct microscopic examination revealed
		hyphae in the samples of all subjects with acne and in the samples of four of the
		healthy controls. The cultures of 18 of the patients with acne vulgaris were
		"positive for the following: 6 with Aspergillus spp., 7 with Penicillium spp., 3"
		"with Cladosporium spp., 1 with Candida spp., and 1 with Acremonium spp. In"
		"addition, Candida spp. was observed in the cultures of two of the healthy"
		controls. CONCLUSION: We conclude that fungi may be involved in the
		etiopathogenesis of acne vulgaris.

LID	-	72
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Scedosporium apiospermum, which can usually be isolated from soil,"
		"polluted stream water and decaying vegetation, is increasingly recognized as an"
		opportunistic dematiaceous fungus. The mortality rate of infection in
		immunocompromised hosts is over 50%. S. apiospermum is commonly responsible for
		"dermal and epidermal infections (i.e., mycetoma) after traumatic penetration."
		CASE PRESENTATION: A 73-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital complaining
		of painful swelling and tenderness on the dorsum of the proximal left wrist and
		hand. The symptoms had persisted for approximately 2 months. A physical
		"examination revealed a 4 x 3 cm, poorly defined, erythematous papule, which was"
		"fluctuant, with pustules and crusts on the dorsum of the left hand. CONCLUSIONS:"
		We report a very rare case of tenosynovitis caused by S. apiospermum infection.
		We identified the infectious agent via molecular DNA sequencing. The infectious
		agent was initially misidentified as an Alternaria species by microscopic
		examination with lactophenol cotton blue (LPCB) staining. The infection was
		successfully treated with debridement and adjuvant fluconazole therapy.

PG	-	213-5
LID	-	10.4103/0972-2327.70878 [doi]
AB	-	A 51-year-old male was admitted in our institute following an episode of
		near-drowning. He later developed ventriculitis and cerebral ring-enhancing
		lesions. He died following a subarachnoid hemorrhage due to rupture of a mycotic
		aneurysm involving the right fetal posterior cerebral artery. Scedosporium
		apiospermum was isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid. Central nervous system
		"invasion by S apiospermum may present insidiously in near-drowning patients and,"
		"therefore, requires a high index of suspicion. In cases with the characteristic"
		"cerebral ring-enhancing lesions and concomitant ventriculitis, treatment should"
		be instituted while awaiting fungal culture. With this article we intend to alert
		"neurologists, intensivists, and physicians to this near fatal infection, as early"
		identification and prompt treatment with voriconazole may be life saving.

		abscesses by Scedosporium apiospermum in an immunocompetent patient. This rare
		fungus was isolated and identified by culture from the surgical tissue and was
		confirmed by Vitek MS and sequencing of the internal transcribed spaces region of
		rDNA. The patient is being treated with Voriconazole for the past 3 months with
		no recurrence of the abscesses.

TI	-	Allergic fungal rhinosinusitis due to Curvularia lunata.
PG	-	241-5
AB	-	We report a case of Curvularia lunata infection in an immunocompetent male with
		an initial diagnosis of suspected left side allergic fungal rhinosinusitis
		"(AFRS), treated surgically. He had a relapse of nasal polyposis and underwent a"
		surgical revision under local anaesthesia with endoscopic nasal polypectomy. The
		histological examination of the surgical specimen showed an inflammatory polyp of
		"the paranasal sinuses, with eosinophil and lymphocyte infiltration, but without"
		"evidence of fungi. However, Curvularia spp fungus grew in cultures of nasal sinus"
		drainage and bioptical specimens. The fungus was identified by DNA sequencing as
		C. lunata. The patient was then treated with itraconazole (200 mg BID for 4
		"weeks), mometasone furoate nasal spray (100 mcg BID for 6 months) and normal"
		saline nasal irrigations. At the last follow-up endoscopic evaluation after 19
		"month from treatment, the patient was symptomless and free from disease. No polyp"
		recurrence nor seromucous discharges were noticed. This first case of C.
		"lunata-associated AFRS reported in Italy, highlights the difficulty of this"
		diagnosis and the usefulness of molecular identification of the fungal species
		involved.

LID	-	10.1136/bcr-2019-233470 [doi]
LID	-	e233470
AB	-	Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common life-limiting autosomal recessive genetic
		disorder among Caucasian populations. The majority of CF cases are diagnosed in
		"childhood; however, increasing numbers of adults are being diagnosed with the"
		condition. We present the case of a 65-year-old Irish woman presenting with a
		chronic cough and a history of recurrent respiratory tract infections.
		"Staphylococcus aureus, Scedosporium apiospermum and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia"
		were grown from bronchoalveolar lavage raising suspicion for CF. Sweat testing
		"was negative; however, genetic testing revealed the presence of ∆F508 and R117H"
		"CF mutations, the latter mutation conferring a milder form of CF. The patient"
		commenced treatment with the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
		(CFTR) potentiator medication ivacaftor to good effect. Novel CFTR potentiators
		and modulators have significant potential to benefit morbidity and mortality in
		"this group. In this case, the microbiological results were key in pursuing"
		genetic testing and diagnosing CF.

AB	-	"Scedosporium apiospermum is a ubiquitous, saprophytic, filamentous mold that may"
		"cause localized, subcutaneous infections in immunocompetent hosts, but"
		disseminated infection in severely immunocompromised patients. This mold is often
		"highly resistant to multiple commonly used antifungal drugs. Even with treatment,"
		there is a high mortality rate. We present two patients with fatal disseminated

TI	-	Fungal maxillary sinusitis: a prospective study in a tertiary care hospital of
		eastern Nepal.
PG	-	195-8
AB	-	INTRODUCTION: The incidence of mycotic infections and the diversity of pathogenic
		fungi have increased dramatically in recent years. Fungal sinusitis should be
		"considered in all the patients with chronic maxillary sinusitis (CMS), especially"
		in association with certain clinical features that serve as clue to the
		diagnosis. Aspergillus is the most common fungal pathogen in maxillary sinus.
		METHODOLOGY: A total of 100 patients those who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria
		"(Lanza and Kennedy, 1992) for chronic rhinosinusitis were eligible for this open"
		level and randomized prospective study. Only those above 14 years of age were
		included. RESULTS: Fungal maxillary sinusitis was seen in 14% of all cases of
		chronic maxillary sinusitis in eastern part of Nepal. We identified Acremonium
		and Candida species as commonest fungi involved in fungal maxillary sinusitis
		(FMS). To the best of our knowledge this is the first such study conducted in
		eastern Nepal.

AB	-	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Rhinocerebral mycosis is a rapidly invasive infection in
		"diabetic patients with an unfavorable course. Herein, we report a rare case of"
		orbital cellulitis caused by Curvularia lunata following fungal rhinosinusitis in
		a diabetic male patient. CASE REPORT: A 35-year-old male with uncontrolled
		diabetes presented to the emergency department of our center with high-grade
		"fever accompanied by chills and rigors, severe diffuse headache, and projectile"
		vomiting with swelling and loss of vision in the right eye. The tissue sample
		"from surgical debridement showed pigmented hyphae; in addition, Curvularia lunata"
		"was isolated in culture. Imaging was indicative of orbital extension. Therefore,"
		the patient was diagnosed with fungal rhinosinusitis with orbital cellulitis. The
		"patient was subjected to extensive surgical debridement, along with antifungals."
		"Rhinosinusitis resolved; however, the loss of vision was irreversible."
		CONCLUSION: Orbital cellulitis is a very rare but life-threatening complication
		of fungal rhinosinusitis. Very few cases of orbital cellulitis following fungal
		rhinosinusitis have been reported in the literature. Early and prompt diagnosis
		can save the life of a patient.

AB	-	Cases of phaeohyphomycosis due to dematiaceous fungi have been reported in
		increasing numbers and diversity. The optimal roles of antifungal chemotherapy
		and surgical debridement in the management of these infections have not been
		determined. A case of acute cutaneous and subcutaneous phaeohyphomycosis due to
		"Curvularia lunata after an explosion at a chemical plant is reported, in which"
		the organisms may have been inoculated into the tissues by the force of the
		blast. No organisms were found by histopathologic examination or culture of
		excisional biopsy specimens taken 10 days after initiation of therapy with
		intravenous amphotericin B; the antifungal therapy may have eradicated the
		infection.

		Review.
PG	-	291-298
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-022-00619-8 [doi]
AB	-	Tinea nigra is a superficial fungal infection usually caused by Hortaea werneckii
		(H. werneckii). We report a special case of tinea nigra in an immunocompetent
		"child who developed a unilateral, rapidly growing pigmented lesion on her palm."
		"Interestingly, Curvularia lunata (C. lunata) was isolated from the lesion scrapes"
		and was identified by both morphological features and molecular biology methods.
		The lesion was completely cleared by topical naftifine hydrochloride and
		ketoconazole cream. We present-to the best of our knowledge-the first case of
		tinea nigra where the causative pathogen was identified as C. lunata. We
		therefore provide a brief literature review of previously reported cases of tinea
		nigra to broaden the knowledge of the potential causative pathogens. The
		"etiology, demography, clinical features, diagnostic methods, and treatment of the"
		reviewed cases are summarized and analyzed.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Fungal periprosthetic joint infections are rare. Acremonium
		osteoarticular infections are scarcely reported. Variable susceptibility to
		antifungal agents have been reported and optimal pharmacotherapy has yet to be
		established. Here we illustrate an Acremonium osteoarticular infection involving
		a prosthetic joint and present an antifungal regimen that had led to treatment
		success. CASE PRESENTATION: A 60-year-old female with a body mass index (BMI) of
		40 had left total knee arthroplasty done in 2012 with a cementless implant for
		"knee osteoarthritis. In 2019, the patient had asymptomatic, progressive"
		osteolysis with fracture and migration of the femoral component warranting
		"replacement. Eleven months later, the patient developed significant pain,"
		"redness, and swelling in the left leg and knee concerning for periprosthetic"
		joint infection that failed outpatient antibiotic treatment. Further
		investigation revealed infection by Acremonium species. A revision of the joint
		"was successfully completed, and the patient was placed on voriconazole for one"
		year. Subsequent cultures did not yield any fungal growth. CONCLUSION: While an
		optimal antifungal regimen for periprosthetic joint infections has not been well
		"established, voriconazole is a relatively safe and effective agent that can be"
		used as a long-term therapy. With variable susceptibility testing in reported
		"isolates, individualized antifungal susceptibility should be used to guide"
		therapy for Acremonium infections.

PG	-	295-308
LID	-	10.7589/2014-06-143 [doi]
AB	-	A wide range of systemic mycoses have been reported from captive and wild marine
		mammals from North America. Examples include regionally endemic pathogens such as
		"Coccidioides and Blastomyces spp., and novel pathogens like Cryptococcus gattii,"
		which appear may have been introduced to North America by humans. Stranding and
		necropsy data were analyzed from three marine mammal stranding and response
		"facilities on the central California coast to assess the prevalence, host"
		"demographics, and lesion distribution of systemic mycoses affecting locally"
		"endemic marine mammals. Between 1 January 1998 and 30 June 2012, >7,000 stranded"
		marine mammals were necropsied at the three facilities. Necropsy and
		histopathology records were reviewed to identify cases of locally invasive or
		systemic mycoses and determine the nature and distribution of fungal lesions.
		"Forty-one animals (0.6%) exhibited cytological, culture- or histologically"
		"confirmed locally invasive or systemic mycoses: 36 had coccidioidomycosis, two"
		"had zygomycosis, two had cryptococcosis, and one was systemically infected with"
		Scedosporium apiospermum (an Ascomycota). Infected animals included 18 California
		"sea lions (Zalophus californianus), 20 southern sea otters (Enhydra lutris"
		"nereis), two Pacific harbor seals (Phoca vitulina richardsi), one Dall's porpoise"
		"(Phocoenoides dalli), and one northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris)."
		"Coccidioidomycosis was reported from 15 sea lions, 20 sea otters, and one harbor"
		"seal, confirming that Coccidioides spp. is the most common pathogen causing"
		systemic mycosis in marine mammals stranding along the central California coast.
		We also report the first confirmation of C. gattii infection in a wild marine
		mammal from California and the first report of coccidioidomycosis in a wild
		harbor seal. Awareness of these pathogenic fungi during clinical care and
		postmortem examination is an important part of marine mammal population health
		surveillance and human health protection. Temporal-spatial overlap may be
		observed for pathogenic mycoses infecting coastal marine mammals and adjacent
		human populations.

AB	-	Fungal osteomyelitis of calcaneus is rare in immunocompetent adults. A case of
		fungal osteomyelitis of calcaneus in a 19 year old immunocompetent female without
		any history of trauma caused by Acremonium sp is presented. The patient was
		"treated with surgical debridement, autogenous iliac crest bone grafting and"
		"antifungal chemotherapy for 6 months. At latest follow up after 2 years, patient"
		is asymptomatic and the osteolytic lesion is healed with no signs of recurrence.
		This case report highlights a rare presentation of chronic painful calcaneal
		osteomyelitis with an osteolytic lesion.

		literature review.
PG	-	26-31
AB	-	Mycetoma is a chronic and progressive subcutaneous granulomatous infection
		"characterized by painless swelling and tumefaction, draining sinus tracts, and"
		purulent discharge. The term eumycetoma is used to describe an infection caused
		"by fungi, while an actinomycetoma is used to describe an infection caused by"
		filamentous bacteria. An accurate identification of the pathogen plays a vital
		role in the treatment plan as well as a positive outcome for the patient. In this
		"report, we present an elderly white female with an initial presentation of"
		"mycetoma masquerading as a squamous cell carcinoma. We also review microbiology,"
		"diagnostic modalities, and treatment for mycetoma."

LID	-	10.2147/IDR.S388166 [doi]
AB	-	This is the first report describing co-infection of Scedosporium apiospermum and
		Lichtheimia corymbifera caused by biogas inhalation in two people without
		underlying medical conditions. Two patients fell into the same pig manure pit at
		the same time while rescuing another patient (this person died in a few hours)
		and inhaled biogas. Both patients were diagnosed with pulmonary fungal disease
		and developed acute liver failure around Day 52. Their results were negative for
		"the 1,3-β-d-glucan test and weakly positive for the galactomannan test. They were"
		treated with amphotericin B and/or posaconazole without surgery. The patient in
		case 2 required amphotericin B deoxycholate aerosol inhalation to complete the
		treatment. Both patients recovered completely. For patients with mucormycosis
		"confined to the lungs who cannot tolerate intravenous drip amphotericin B,"
		increasing the dose of nebulised administration maybe a salvage regimen.

		Case Report and Mini-Review.
PG	-	257-64
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-015-9911-4 [doi]
AB	-	Scedosporium apiospermum is an ubiquitous fungus responsible for various
		infections in immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients. Ear infections are
		infrequent. We report an exceptional case of S. apiospermum external otitis
		complicated by temporomandibular joint arthritis. After 6 months of
		"antibiotherapy, diagnosis was established by mycological analysis of external"
		auditory canal and infratemporal fossae needle sampling. A satisfactory outcome
		was obtained after 2 months of voriconazole alone. We have reviewed 15 cases of
		S. apiospermum otitis. Seven of these patients were immunocompromised. Most
		common clinical presentation included a chronic external otitis lasting months or
		years before complication stage. Most common clinical features included recurrent
		unilateral otalgia (11/15) and purulent otorrhea (13/15). Diagnosis was often
		made at later stage (12/15) with local extension to bones and/or soft tissues
		(9/15) or cerebral lethal dissemination (3/15).The extremely low incidence of S.
		apiospermum otomycosis and its non-specific presentation results in a frequent
		diagnosis delay. A mycological investigation should be performed in case of
		persistent external otitis and/or osteolysis despite prolonged antibiotic
		treatment to prevent further extension of the disease.

AB	-	We report a case of catheter-related Scedosporium apiospermum soft-tissue
		infection. This ubiquitous filamentous fungus can cause human infection after
		traumatic subcutaneous implantation of its conidia or their inhalation in
		near-drowning cases. It has also been reported as an etiological agent in a
		growing number of hospital-acquired infections.

AB	-	"OBJECTIVES: To report a case of Acremonium keratitis treated with voriconazole,"
		"corneal collagen cross-linking, and corneal transplant. MATERIALS AND METHODS:"
		Case report. RESULTS: A 42-year-old woman who wore contact lenses daily was
		referred for refractory keratitis. Her main complaints were gritty sensation and
		"pain. At slit lamp biomicroscopy, an infiltrate on the inferior paracentral"
		cornea and an arcuate conjunctival ulceration were evident. The rest of the
		cornea was clear with no anterior chamber reaction. Scrapings from the corneal
		"ulcer showed Candida parapsilosis and Acremonium species, which were sensitive to"
		"voriconazole. Despite the administration of topical, systemic, and intrastromal"
		"voriconazole for 1 month, repeat corneal scraping was positive for Acremonium,"
		"and clinical appearance and pain did not resolve. Therefore, corneal collagen"
		cross-linking was applied. Although the pain resolved immediately after the
		"procedure, the lesion showed no improvement. After a month of cross-linking,"
		corneal transplant was performed for visual rehabilitation and treatment of the
		refractory lesion. The excised corneal button was negative for any
		microorganisms. CONCLUSIONS: Although corneal collagen cross-linking may be an
		"effective treatment for Acremonium keratitis refractory to medical therapy,"
		corneal transplant was required for visual gain and recovery.

		"factors were plants in ward (75%), prior therapy with broad spectrum antibiotics"
		"(70%), catheter insertion (70%), acute leukemia (65%) and neutropenia (60%)."
		"Before death, a definitive diagnosis was made in 40%, and a presumptive diagnosis"

		confirmed in all cases (100% of patients). Aspergillosis was the most common
		"invasive fungal disease (55%), followed by mucormycosis (15%), fusariosis (15%),"
		"and acremoniosis (10%). Of 20 patients, 8 (40%) were cured or improved after"
		"antifungal therapy with amphotericin B, ambisome and/or itraconazole; 8/20 (40%)"
		died of fungal infection and 4/20 (20%) of underlying disease with fungal
		infection. Even though the diagnosis was made and antifungal therapy started
		"before death in 15/ 20 (75%), invasive mold infection had a 60% overall mortality"
		in patients with malignant disease.

PG	-	400-406

AB	-	Maduramycosis or mycetoma is one of the chronic granulomatous diseases commonly
		seen in tropical regions. Microbiological cultures and biopsy are carried out for
		"the definitive diagnosis of the disease, but they are time-consuming methods. The"
		"present study aims to correlate clinical, radiological and pathological features"
		"in eumycetoma cases to emphasize the role of ""dot in circle"" sign leading to"
		early imaging-based diagnosis. Imaging plays an important role in early diagnosis
		"of mycetoma, which has therapeutic implications. ""Dot in circle"" sign is a"
		recently described sign in mycetoma cases on ultrasound (USG) and magnetic
		resonance imaging (MRI). We diagnosed four cases of eumycetoma based on clinical
		"and imaging features, which were confirmed with histopathology. The differential"
		"diagnosis, which may mimic this sign is also discussed. The ""dot in circle"" sign"
		is seen on both ultrasound and MRI. This sign is highly specific for mycetomas.
		Knowledge of this sign can help in early diagnosis of mycetomas preventing
		misdiagnosis and further complications.

AB	-	"Crude oil contamination of soils and waters is a worldwide problem, which has"
		been actively addressed in recent years. Sequencing genomes of microorganisms
		involved in the degradation of hydrocarbons have allowed the identification of
		"several promoters, genes, and degradation pathways of these contaminants. This"
		knowledge allows a better understanding of the functional dynamics of microbial
		"degradation. Here, we report a first draft of the 44.2 Mbp genome assembly of an"
		environmental strain of the fungus Scedosporium apiospermum. The assembly
		consisted of 178 high-quality DNA scaffolds with 1.93% of sequence repeats
		"identified. A total of 11,195 protein-coding genes were predicted including a"
		diverse group of gene families involved in hydrocarbon degradation pathways like
		dioxygenases and cytochrome P450. The metabolic pathways identified in the genome
		"can potentially degrade hydrocarbons like chloroalkane/alkene, chorocyclohexane,"
		"and chlorobenzene, benzoate, aminobenzoate, fluorobenzoate, toluene, caprolactam,"
		"geraniol, naphthalene, styrene, atrazine, dioxin, xylene, ethylbenzene, and"
		polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The comparison analysis between this strain and
		the previous sequenced clinical strain showed important differences in terms of
		annotated genes involved in the hydrocarbon degradation process.

TI	-	Invasive pulmonary infection due to Scedosporium apiospermum in two children with
		chronic granulomatous disease.
PG	-	1437-41
AB	-	Scedosporium apiospermum is an opportunistic fungus in humans. The incidence of
		"S. apiospermum infection in patients with acquired neutropenia (e.g., patients"
		receiving chemotherapy and bone marrow transplant recipients) is steadily
		"increasing. S. apiospermum has poor in vitro susceptibility to ""conventional"""
		"antifungal agents, rendering the management of infections complex. Patients with"
		"chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) are highly susceptible to fungal infections,"
		which are mostly due to Aspergillus species. We describe two children with CGD
		and invasive pulmonary infection due to S. apiospermum. Both patients were
		treated with antifungal therapy including azole derivatives (itraconazole or
		voriconazole) and surgical resection of infected tissues. These cases highlight
		that scedosporium infection can closely mimic aspergillus infection and should be
		considered in any case in which there is a failure to respond to appropriate
		"""conventional"" antifungal therapy. We also suggest that the emergence of this"
		pathogen may have been favored by long-term use of amphotericin B in both
		patients.

AB	-	Scedosporium apiospermum associated endocarditis is extremely rare. We report a
		case of a disseminated S. apiospermum infection with an invasive right atrial
		"mass in a 52-year-old male, 11 months after heart transplantation, referred to"
		our institution for an endogenous endophthalmitis with a one-month history of
		diffuse myalgias and fatigue. The patient had been supported two times with
		extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) during the first three postoperative
		months. The echocardiography on admission revealed a mass in the right atrium
		attached to a thickened lateral wall. The whole-body [(18)F]FDG PET/CT revealed
		"systemic dissemination in the lungs, muscles, and subcutaneous tissue. Blood"
		cultures were positive on day three for filamentous fungi later identified as S.
		apiospermum. The disease was refractory to a 3-week dual antifungal therapy with
		"voriconazole and anidulafungin in addition to reduced immunosuppression, and"
		palliative care was implemented.

TI	-	Topical and oral voriconazole in the treatment of fungal keratitis.
PG	-	151-3
AB	-	PURPOSE: To describe nine patients with fungal keratitis refractory to standard
		antifungal therapy whose condition was managed with voriconazole. DESIGN:
		Retrospective case series. METHODS: Chart review of patients with fungal
		keratitis who were treated with topical and oral voriconazole. RESULTS: Nine
		patients were treated. Two patients were contact lens wearers who used
		multipurpose cleaning solutions. Corneal isolates found were Fusarium (three
		"patients), Candida albicans (three patients), Alternaria (one patient),"
		"Scopulariopsis (one patient), and Scedosporium apiospermum (one patient). Nine"
		"patients were treated with topical voriconazole, and eight patients were treated"
		with oral voriconazole. Patients were treated topically for four to 16 weeks
		"(mean, 10 weeks) and orally for five to 17 weeks (mean, 10 weeks). One patient"
		was lost to follow-up. Two patients discontinued the topical voriconazole after
		"one day and four weeks, respectively, because of ocular burning. Of the seven"
		"patients who were treated with topical therapy and followed, five conditions"
		"healed. CONCLUSION: Voriconazole is a new, promising therapy for fungal keratitis"
		that is refractory to standard antifungal treatments.

PG	-	603-5
AB	-	We report the case of a 52-year-old male heart transplant recipient with a
		persistent localized subcutaneous infection by Scedosporium apiospermum. This
		form differs from the most common mycetoma by the absence of granules. The
		patient showed multiple nodules on the right hand that were surgically removed.
		"Concomitantly, he received oral itraconazole, but the infection persisted for two"
		"years, and several surgical interventions were necessary to eradicate the"
		infection. Our case demonstrates that a medical approach alone may be not
		sufficient to cure this fungal infection.

PG	-	207-211
LID	-	10.5582/ddt.2019.01060 [doi]
AB	-	The prevalence of tinea pedis (also known as athlete's foot) in Japanese workers
		as well as contamination of their footwear by pathogenic filamentous fungi were
		investigated. Health checks by a dermatologist at a factory located in the Kanto
		region (Japan) led to a clinical and morphologic diagnosis of tinea pedis in 9 of
		19 workers. Scales obtained from the feet and dust obtained from the protective
		footwear (safety shoes) worn daily in the factory were obtained from these nine
		subjects and tested using a mycological culture technique. Scales obtained from
		"six of the nine subjects indicated pathogenic filamentous fungi, not only"
		"Trichophyton spp., but also Acremonium, which causes symptoms similar to tinea"
		"pedis or onychomycosis. Similarly, culture of the dust obtained from the safety"
		"shoes yielded pathogenic filamentous fungi in six of the nine subjects, and in"
		four samples Trichophyton spp. was also identified. These findings suggest that
		cultivable Trichophyton spp. can be detected in approximately 40% of the safety
		shoes of workers with tinea pedis. The risk of reinfection by pathogenic
		filamentous fungi is likely increased by wearing dermatophyte-contaminated shoes.

		"patient, which was clinically diagnosed as lipoma. On fine-needle aspiration"
		"cytology, pus was aspirated, which showed septate branching hyphal elements. The"
		"pus culture on Sabouraud's dextrose agar yielded Scedosporium apiospermum, which"
		was identified based on its macroscopic and microscopic features. There are very
		few reports of scedosporiasis from India. The diagnosis of scedosporiasis is
		difficult and correct etiological diagnosis can help in better management of the
		patient.

AB	-	Risk factors for the association of Scedosporium in cases of cystic fibrosis (CF)
		"and its clinical implications are poorly understood. Clinical, lung function and"
		laboratory data of adult CF patients in Sydney (April 2008-March 2009) were
		prospectively analysed for such risk factors. Expectorated sputa were cultured
		for bacteria and examined for fungi using standard mycological and
		"Scedosporium-selective media, and by an internal transcribed spacer"
		region-targeted multiplex PCR assay. Scedosporium spp. (n = 4 each of
		"Scedosporium prolificans, Scedosporium aurantiacum and Pseudallescheria boydii/"
		Scedosporium apiospermum complex [non-S. aurantiacum]) were recovered from 12 of
		69 (17.4%) patients. Samples of 11 of the patients yielded isolates on
		Scedosporium- selective media (vs. 6 [8.7%] by non-selective culture) and one
		"additional patient was noted by PCR. Of these patients, 83.3% were co-colonized"
		"with other moulds, most frequently Aspergillus fumigatus. Colonization was not"
		"associated with best FEV₁/predicted, corticosteroid or antifungal therapies. By"
		"univariate analysis, patients with Scedosporium colonization were significantly"
		"less likely to be colonized with mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P = 0.025), while"
		prior therapy with antistaphylococcal penicillins was a risk factor for
		colonization (P = 0.045). Bacterial colonization and antimicrobial exposure
		"likely influence Scedosporium colonization, which is optimally detected with"
		selective media. Studies are required to confirm independent risk factors for
		Scedosporium colonization and to determine its impact on lung disease.

LID	-	e00691
AB	-	Although tuberculosis is a major underlying cause of pulmonary mycetoma due to
		"Scedosporium apiospermum, little is known about coinfection with nontuberculous"
		mycobacteria (NTM) and S. apiospermum. A 67-year-old man with NTM presented with
		recurrent haemoptysis. Computed tomography of the chest revealed pulmonary
		"mycetoma in the left upper lobe of the lung, and culture of bronchial washing"
		fluid yielded S. apiospermum. Oral voriconazole therapy ameliorated both
		"haemoptysis and mycetoma findings. As far as we are aware, this is the first"
		reported case of S. apiospermum lung disease in a patient with NTM but without
		tuberculosis. The possibility of S. apiospermum infection should thus be
		considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary mycetoma. Although S.
		"apiospermum mycetoma resembles aspergilloma, antifungal strategies for these two"
		"conditions differ, with the collection of culture specimens such as by"
		bronchoscopy being compulsory for accurate diagnosis and appropriate management
		of S. apiospermum infection.

TI	-	Genetic diversity among clinical isolates of Acremonium strictum determined
		during an investigation of a fatal mycosis.
PG	-	2623-8
AB	-	"Primarily saprophytic in nature, fungi of the genus Acremonium are a"
		"well-documented cause of mycetoma and other focal diseases. More recently, a"
		number of Acremonium spp. have been implicated in invasive infections in the
		setting of severe immunosuppression. During the course of routine microbiological
		studies involving a case of fatal mycosis in a nonmyeloablative hematopoietic
		"stem cell transplant patient, we identified a greater-than-expected variation"
		among strains previously identified as Acremonium strictum by clinical
		microbiologists. Using DNA sequence analysis of the ribosomal DNA intergenic
		transcribed spacer (ITS) regions and the D1-D2 variable domain of the 28S
		"ribosomal DNA gene (28S), the case isolate and four other clinical isolates"
		phenotypically identified as A. strictum were found to have <99% homology to the
		"A. strictum type strain, CBS 346.70, at the ITS and 28S loci, while a sixth"
		isolate phenotypically identified only as Acremonium sp. had >99% homology to the
		type strain at both loci. These results suggest that five out of the six clinical
		isolates belong to species other than A. strictum or that the A. strictum taxon
		"is genetically diverse. Based upon these sequence data, the clinical isolates"
		were placed into three genogroups.

PG	-	295-7
AB	-	The authors report on the case of a 57-year-old male who presented with poor
		vision of his right eye. He had right optic nerve atrophy secondary to neural
		compression by a mucocoele in the pituitary fossa. The patient underwent
		transphenoidal resection of the mucocoele. Microbiology revealed Curvularia
		lunata and Enterobacter aerogenes present in the specimen. He was treated with
		liposomal Amphotericin B and meropenem. Assessment of vision post-operatively
		demonstrated improvement in his visual acuity. On reviewing the published
		"literature, this case was found to be the first in which Curvularia had caused"
		optic neuropathy. There have been only five previously documented reports of
		Curvularia causing CNS infections. This case demonstrates the importance of
		obtaining a tissue diagnosis together with appropriate surgical and medical
		management in the treatment of invasive fungal disease.

TI	-	Use of voriconazole in treatment of Scedosporium apiospermum infection: case
		report.
PG	-	1436-8
AB	-	We report a case of disseminated Scedosporium apiospermum infection in a
		neutropenic patient with acute myeloid leukemia. Due to progression of the
		mycosis after 7 days of amphotericin B lipid complex therapy and to high
		"susceptibility of the mold to voriconazole in vitro, the patient was treated with"
		"intravenous voriconazole. After a few days of therapy, fever disappeared and skin"
		"lesions improved. However, the patient died after 1 month due to intestinal"
		"bleeding. Despite a negative outcome, this case seems to indicate a promising"
		role for voriconazole in the treatment of S. apiospermum infections.

TI	-	Delayed-onset fungal keratitis after endophthalmitis.
PG	-	258-62
AB	-	"PURPOSE: This study aimed to present two patients with delayed-onset, endogenous"
		fungal keratitis after treatment for fungal endophthalmitis after cataract
		surgery. METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed the clinical course of two
		"patients in whom deep stromal fungal keratitis developed 2 weeks and 3 months,"
		"respectively, after apparent successful aggressive therapy for fungal"
		"endophthalmitis. Before the onset of the keratitis, both patients underwent"
		"vitrectomies with intraocular injection of 7.5 to 10.0 mcg amphotericin B, as"
		well as treatment with systemic fluconazole and topical antifungal therapy. In
		"case 1, a pre-existing prosthetic intraocular lens and lens capsular bag were"
		"removed at the time of vitrectomy, whereas in case 2, the intraocular lens was"
		left in place and a posterior capsulectomy was performed. RESULTS: The keratitis
		"worsened in both patients, despite intensive systemic and topical antifungal"
		therapy. Both patients underwent therapeutic penetrating keratoplasties. In case
		"1, this resulted in successful resolution of the infection and no recurrences 3"
		months after the transplant. The corneal transplant was complicated by an
		expulsive choroidal hemorrhage in the other patient. Fusarium solani was cultured
		"from the initial vitrectomy specimen in patient 1, and although it was not"
		"cultured from the keratitis, septate hyphal elements were present on"
		histopathologic examination. The causative organism in case 2 was Acremonium
		"kiliense, which was cultured from both the original vitrectomy specimen and the"
		deep corneal stromal infiltrate. CONCLUSIONS: Fungal organisms may not be
		eradicated completely from eyes with endophthalmitis despite aggressive therapy
		and apparent initial successful treatment. These patients need to be monitored
		"for prolonged periods, and treatment should be reinitiated at the earliest sign"
		of recrudescence of infection.

TI	-	Molecular epidemiology of Aspergillus species and other moulds in respiratory
		samples from Argentinean patients with cystic fibrosis.
PG	-	867-873
LID	-	10.1093/mmy/myz133 [doi]
AB	-	"In cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, fungal colonization of the respiratory tract is"
		frequently found. Aspergillus fumigatus is the most frequently recorded and is
		associated with loss of pulmonary function and allergic disease (ABPA). The
		knowledge on prevalence rates of filamentous fungi in CF patients in Latin
		America is scarce. One hundred and seventy-six fungal isolates recovered from the
		upper respiratory tract of CF patients from Argentina were identified to species
		"by morphology and DNA sequencing. In total, 90% of CF patients were colonized by"
		"Aspergillus sp., followed by Exophiala sp. (14%) and Scedosporium sp. (10%)."
		"Among Aspergillus, six species complexes (Fumigati, Flavi, Terrei, Nigri, Usti,"
		"and Nidulante) and different cryptospecies were found. Among Scedosporium, three"
		"species were observed (Scedosporium apiospermum, Scedosporium aurantiacum and"
		Scedosporium boydii). All Exophiala isolates were identified as Exophiala
		dermatitidis. Rare filamentous fungi were also found. All cases of ABPA were
		associated to the presence of A. fumigatus. Mixed colonization with other mould
		"or rare fungi was observed in half of them. To our knowledge, this is the first"
		prospective study of mould species in CF using molecular methods in Latin
		"America. This study shows that Aspergillus sp., E. dermatitidis and Scedosporium"
		"sp. have a high frequency in CF patients from Argentina, and by far, A. fumigatus"
		was the most commonly cultured species. Continuous clinical surveillance is
		required to detect the emergence of new fungal pathogens and to detect resistant
		or difficult-to-treat species capable of chronic colonizing the airways and of
		hematogenous dissemination in case of lung transplantation.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Fungal granulomas of the central nervous system are rare and have a
		"high rate of mortality and morbidity, irrespective of treatment. The authors"
		report their experience of managing 66 patients during 15 years and discuss the
		"clinical, radiological, surgical, and pathologic findings. This series is among"
		the largest reported. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was
		"performed on patients with intracranial fungal granulomas (ICFGs), treated in the"
		"authors' institution, between January 1997 and May 2011. Only mass-forming"
		histopathologically proven ICFGs were included in this study. RESULTS: The age of
		"the patients ranged from 7 years to 67 years (mean = 32.3 years), and most"
		patients were in the third and fourth decades of life. The study population
		comprised 47 male and 19 female patients. The most common symptom was headache
		"(41 patients), followed by vomiting (16 patients) and blurring of vision (16"
		patients). Only 3 patients presented with fever. The duration of symptoms was
		less than 6 months in all cases and less than 3 months in 39 cases. Anterior
		"cranial fossa and frontal lobe was involved in 35 cases (54.5%), followed by"
		middle cranial fossa in 20 cases (30.3%). Three cases had granulomas in the
		"cerebellopontine angle. Three cases had multicompartmental involvement, and 4 had"
		multilobar involvement. Nine patients had predisposing factors for fungal
		"infection Based on clinical and imaging data, preoperative diagnosis of a"
		possible fungal lesion was made in 44 (some had only computed tomography imaging)
		"patients. All the patients were treated surgically, followed by antifungal"
		treatment with amphotericin-B and/fluconazole/itraconazole for a period of 6
		weeks. Eight patients had symptomatic recurrence of lesions 3-12 weeks after
		treatment and underwent reoperation. Six patients were lost to follow-up. Nine
		patients died in the postoperative period (within 30 days postoperatively).
		"Fifteen patients died during follow-up because of recurrent lesions, repeat"
		"surgery, renal failure, and unrelated causes. Overall mortality was 24 (36.3%)."
		"Poor neurologic status before surgery, emergency craniotomy, severe brain edema"
		"with mass effect, and opening of ventricles during surgery were associated with"
		poor outcome. Aspergillus species were the causative organism in an overwhelming
		"majority of patients (n = 52) followed by Mucor in 7 cases, Cladosporium in 3"
		"cases, eumycetoma in 2 cases, and maduramycosis and blastomycosis in 1 case each."
		"CONCLUSION: ICFGs have high rates of morbidity and mortality. Early diagnosis,"
		"radical surgery, and antifungal treatment for 6 weeks may improve outcome. Poor"
		"neurologic status of patients at the time of presentation, immunocompromised"
		"state, contamination of ventricular cerebrospinal during surgery, and renal"
		failure (attributable to amphotericin-B) are associated with poor outcome.

AB	-	A case of localized lung scedosporiosis is reported here that mimicked
		aspergilloma in an immunocompetent host. Through this case the importance of
		considering Scedosporium spp. in differential diagnosis of locally invasive lung
		infections and fungal ball is highlighted. As it is difficult to differentiate
		"Scedosporium from Aspergillus on clinical grounds, microscopy, radiology and"
		"histopathology, this case is further emphasizing the significance of the"
		definitive etiological characterization of Scedosporium through culture or
		"molecular diagnostic tools. Accurate identification of Scedosporium, surgical"
		resection and high-dose voriconazole has been associated with favorable outcome
		in most reported cases of scedosporiosis.

AB	-	We report a case of subcutaneous Pseudallescheria boydii/Scedosporium apiospermum
		complex infection occurring in a 77-year-old Japanese female farmer suffering
		"from interstitial pneumonia. Seven months prior to the current presentation, she"
		"noticed nodes on her right forearm after pulling up weeds, and the nodes grew"
		"larger. Two soft dome-shaped, protruded nodes ( 15 mm and 30 mm in size ) had"
		"fused together on the extensor surface of the right forearm. Yellowish-white,"
		rice-grain-sized pustules clustered on the surface. Histopathological examination
		of the skin specimen showed large and small abscesses surrounded by epithelioid
		granuloma; separate branching hyphae within the granulation tissue were stained
		"with PAS. No grains were observed. Fungal culture yielded fast-growing,"
		"grayish-white, fluffy colonies which were identified as Scedosporium apiospermum"
		(Clade 4) using sequence analysis of the β-tubulin gene. We also reviewed 28
		previously reported Japanese cases of P. boydii or S. apiospermum infection
		presenting with skin manifestations.

		Acremonium falciforme endophthalmitis with orbital and extra-orbital involvement
		following combined cataract and glaucoma surgery. CASE PRESENTATION: A
		68-year-old Caucasian man with glaucoma presented with endophthalmitis
		"characterized by pain, redness and impaired vision in the left eye fifteen days"
		after combined cataract and filtering surgery. He subsequently underwent a pars
		"plana vitrectomy, with vitreous sampling, silicone oil placement and"
		"intra-vitreal injection of antibiotics, but only after a second vitrectomy we"
		identified Acremonium falciforme as the causative agent for the endophthalmitis.
		"An antifungal systemic and topical therapy was started, but meanwhile the"
		infection extended to orbital and peri-orbital tissues. Following these
		"procedures, even if the eye went slowly in phthisis, we were able to limit the"
		further extension and circumscribe the orbital and extra-orbital involvement.
		"CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this report is the first describe Acremonium"
		"falciforme endophthalmitis with orbital and extra-orbital involvement, following"
		anterior segment combined surgery. Ophthalmologists and physicians should be
		"aware of the extension risk of a fungal panophthalmitis, but also to potentially"
		serious side effects related to systemic therapy.

PG	-	441-4
LID	-	10.1080/13693780802695470 [doi]
AB	-	Abstract This is a case of Scedosporium apiospermum skeletal infection in a
		10-year-old immunocompetent girl whose chief complaint was left knee swelling and
		pain. The child had a history of a bicycle accident two months before with a
		resultant deep penetrating trauma. Systematic administration of broad-spectrum
		"antibiotics for 10 days was used, with no clinical improvement. Magnetic"
		Resonance Imaging and arthrotomy of the affected joint revealed findings
		suggestive of osteomyelitis. Empirical intravenous antimicrobial therapy was
		instituted for a total of two months but one month after completion of
		antibacterial therapy the child returned to the hospital because of persistent
		"knee swelling and pain. Following a new arthrotomy, Scedosporium apiospermum was"
		isolated. The patient was cured with intravenous administration of voriconazole
		without any side effects and has no evidence of relapse after four years of
		follow-up.

AB	-	A case of colonization of a prosthetic mitral valve in a 73-year-old Spanish male
		by the fungus Acremonium strictum W. Gams is described. The valve was replaced
		due to paravalvular leak and severe insufficiency and the patient died of
		multiorgan failure. The identity of the fungus was determined by morphological
		studies and it was confirmed by the analysis of the ITS region sequence analysis.
		Molecular studies seem to demonstrate that A. strictum is a species complex. The
		case emphasizes the potential high risk of fungal infection for patients with
		prosthetic valves.

TI	-	Successful treatment of antifungal- and cryotherapy-resistant subcutaneous
		hyalohyphomycosis in an immunocompetent case with topical 5% imiquimod cream.
PG	-	521-6
AB	-	Hyalohyphomycosis is an unusual opportunistic mycotic infection where the tissue
		"morphology of the causative organism is mycelial. Etiological agents, which are"
		"not responsible for the otherwise-named infections like aspergillosis, are the"
		"species of non-dematiaceous hyaline hyphomycetes including Penicillium,"
		"Paecilomyces, Acremonium (formerly known Cephalosporium), Beauveria, Fusarium,"
		and Scopulariopsis. Several cases of Acremonium infection have been described in
		immunocompromised patients; however it can cause invasive disease in an
		immunocompetent person very rarely. Optimum therapy of Acremonium infection is
		unclear because of the limited number of reported cases and conflicting results
		"of therapies. Imiquimod, an imidazoquinoline with potent antiviral, antitumor and"
		"immunoregulatory properties, is currently approved for the topical treatment of"
		external anogenital warts and actinic keratosis. Imiquimod has also been found to
		"be effective for other virus-associated dermatologic lesions, including common"
		"and flat warts, molluscum contagiosum, and herpes simplex virus type-2 as well as"
		"for some cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis. We report herein, for the first time,"
		a case of unusually recalcitrant hyalohyphomycosis of the face due to Acremonium
		strictum successfully treated with topical 5% imiquimod in an immunocompetent
		"patient, who had failed to respond to various antifungals, including"
		"itraconazole, and cryotherapy."

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Ubiquitous fungi of the Scedosporium apiospermum species complex
		(SASC) cause various opportunistic infections. Posterior subtenon triamcinolone
		acetonide (STTA) injection is a standard therapy for intraocular inflammation and
		macular edema. We report a case of Scedosporium apiospermum infectious scleritis
		after a posterior STTA injection. CASE PRESENTATION: A 75-year-old man received a
		"posterior STTA injection to treat macular edema in his left eye. After 3 months,"
		he complained of ocular pain and hyperemia in his left eye. Examination showed a
		subtenon abscess in the site corresponding with the STTA injection. After
		"incising the abscess, the smear revealed numerous conidia-like structures."
		Although we suspected fungal infection and started topical voriconazole (VRCZ)
		"and levofloxacin, the inflammation of the eye worsened. Fungal culture revealed"
		"filamentous fungus growth. Subsequently, we added systemic VRCZ and performed"
		surgical debridement of the infected sclera and Tenon's capsule. Pathology of the
		sclera showed fungal hyphae. The antifungal susceptibility test revealed low
		"minimum inhibitory concentrations for micafungin, VRCZ and miconazole (0.06, 0.25"
		"and 0.5 μg/mL, respectively). After 2 months, the ciliary injection subsided and"
		"VRCZ therapy was stopped. However, subtenon abscess recurred 1 month after"
		discontinuation of topical VRCZ. Surgical debridement and topical VRCZ were
		"resumed, with the eye finally improving after 5 months of management. The fungal"
		species was identified as Scedosporium apiospermum sensu stricto morphologically
		and by DNA sequencing. CONCLUSIONS: This case was successfully treated by topical
		and systemic VRCZ and repeated surgical debridement. Infectious scleritis caused
		by SASC rarely develops after posterior STTA. SASC can produce conidia in the
		enclosed subtenon space. Late-onset infectious scleritis after a posterior STTA
		"injection suggests the presence of a fungal infection, including SASC, thereby"
		requiring extensive and prolonged medical and surgical treatment.

AB	-	Mycotic osteomyelitis is rare and occurs in immunocompromised patients after
		inoculation of the pathogen at a penetrating trauma site. Mycotic osteomyelitis
		"due to Scedosporium Apiospermum is extremely rare, with only 13 cases of septic"
		arthritis reported previously. Ours is only the third case of S. apiospermum
		osteomyelitis in an immunocompromised patient and the only patient with a
		histopathologic diagnosis from an amputation specimen. Recognition of this
		"pathogen may be delayed due to insidious onset and negative joint fluid cultures,"
		often requiring synovial or bone biopsies to establish the diagnosis. Delay in
		appropriate treatment may result in disseminating infection or even death.

TI	-	Fungal osteoarticular infections in patients treated at a comprehensive cancer
		centre: a 10-year retrospective review.
PG	-	621-6
AB	-	This study reviewed retrospectively the clinical characteristics of 28 cancer
		patients with fungal osteoarticular infections (FOAIs) between 1995 and 2005.
		Most patients (26; 93%) had haematological malignancies (19 had leukaemia); half
		(14) were allogeneic stem-cell transplant recipients. Twelve patients (43%) had
		severe neutropenia (< or = 100/mm3) with a mean duration of 65 days (range 10-500
		"days), and ten (36%) patients had received a significant dose of corticosteroids."
		"Most (19; 68%) FOAIs were caused by contiguous extension, while nine (32%) were"
		"associated with haematogenous spread. Pain, joint instability and local drainage"
		"were seen in 28 (100%), six (21%), and seven (25%) patients, respectively."
		Sixteen (57%) patients had symptoms for < 1 month. The sinuses (ten; 36%) and the
		vertebral spine (six; 21%) were the most common sites involved. Moulds were the
		predominant pathogens: Aspergillus fumigatus (two); non-fumigatus Aspergillus
		spp. (eight); non-specified Aspergillus spp. (three); Fusarium spp. (six);
		Zygomycetes (five); Scedosporium apiospermum (two); and Exserohilum sp. (one).
		Candida was the causative pathogen in four cases (including two cases of mixed
		"FOAIs). Arthritis and post-operative FOAIs were both uncommon manifestations,"
		occurring in two patients each. All patients received systemic antifungal therapy
		"(combinations in 20 cases), and 19 cases underwent adjunctive surgery. The crude"
		mortality rates (at 12 weeks) were 44% (9/20) in the patients who underwent
		surgery and antifungal therapy vs. 33% (2/6) in patients who received antifungal
		"therapy alone (p not significant). FOAI is a rare, yet severe, manifestation of"
		"localised or systemic mycoses, caused predominantly by moulds, and is seen"
		typically in patients with haematological malignancies.

AB	-	CLINICAL CASE: A 51 year-old immunocompetent male was referred due to presenting
		with a large corneal ulcer with hypopyon in the right eye. Topical amphotericin
		"B, fluconazole and moxifloxacin, as well as oral itraconazole were initially"
		"indicated. Following the report of mycotic structures on staining, topical"
		"natamycin was started. The result of the culture was reported two weeks later as,"
		"Scedosporium apiospermum (S. apiospermum), and topical voriconazole was then"
		"added. The response to treatment was very slow, and took five weeks after"
		"receiving triple therapy (natamycin, voriconazole and fluconazole) and one dose"
		"of intrastromal voriconazole, for the hypopyon to disappear. The final outcome"
		"was successful, achieving healing of the ulcer. The patient is waiting for a"
		corneal transplant. DISCUSSION: A microbiological study is essential in patients
		in whom fungal keratitis is suspected. The treatment of choice against S.
		"apiospermum is with voriconazole, but the combination of various antifungal"
		agents may be required.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Mycotic ocular infections caused by the Scedosporium apiospermum
		species complex are challenging to treat because of the delayed diagnoses and
		poor responses to antifungal drugs and surgical treatment. CASE REPORT: A case of
		a 69-year-old male patient with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and prior
		surgery on the right femur is described. In the 10 days prior to the ophthalmic
		"consultation he started with ocular pain, adding to a previous and progressive"
		loss of visual acuity in his right eye. The diagnosis of endophthalmitis of
		"probable endogenous origin was established. Despite medical treatment, the"
		"patient's condition worsened and, due to the imminent risks, an enucleation was"
		"performed. Smears of the enucleation tissue revealed fungal cells, and the"
		"cultures yielded a fungus belonging to the S. apiospermum species complex, which"
		was identified as Scedosporium boydii by morphological characteristics and
		sequencing of a PCR amplicon. CONCLUSIONS: A diagnosis of endophthalmitis of
		probable endogenous origin in the right eye was based on a previous right femur
		surgery. Potential risk to the patient led to enucleation.

		was established by the repeated isolation of the same fungal agent from vitreous
		"washing, acqueous fluid and intraocular lens samples and by its identification on"
		the basis of morphological and molecular features. The cases reported in this
		study emphasize the need for clinical microbiology laboratories to be prepared to
		face the diagnosis of uncommon infectious diseases such as exogenous fungal
		"endophthalmitis by Acremonium, and to enhance the awareness of surgeons and"
		clinicians of this occurrence.

AB	-	We report the first case of pulmonary scedosporiosis detected by next-generation
		sequencing (NGS) from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in a 67-year-old male
		with bronchiectasis and hematopoietic failure. Scedosporium apiospermum is a
		ubiquitous organism present in the environment with intrinsic resistance to many
		"antifungal agents. The patient developed respiratory failure, pulmonary"
		"consolidation, and septic shock shortly thereafter, and responded poorly to"
		antifungal therapy. This case highlights the combined application of NGS and
		traditional fungal culture in the clinical diagnosis of pulmonary invasive fungal
		disease. NGS is proposed as an important adjunctive diagnostic approach for
		uncommon pathogens.

PG	-	140-2
AB	-	PURPOSE: To report a case of pseudophakic endophthalmitis with secondary
		keratitis caused by Curvularia lunata. METHODS: A 40-year-old man presented with
		a fluffy mass in the anterior chamber with low-grade delayed postoperative
		inflammation in the right eye. RESULTS: The anterior chamber and vitreous
		aspirate demonstrated C. lunata. A large corneal infiltrate developed after
		"aspiration of the mass. Treatment with systemic, topical, and intraocular"
		"antifungal agents cleared the vitreous, but the cornea perforated. CONCLUSION:"
		Delayed low-grade infection with a fluffy mass in the anterior chamber after
		cataract surgery can rarely be a clinical presentation of dematiaceous fungal
		infection. Secondary keratitis may result after a diagnostic aspiration.

AB	-	PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to report a case of a 52-year-old man with a
		rare fungal endophthalmitis after penetrating ocular trauma with a fish hook.
		RESULTS: The patient was submitted to wound repair and hook extraction. Three
		"weeks after the trauma, a cataract extraction with phacoemulsification and"
		in-the-bag intraocular lens implantation was performed. After the development of
		"endophthalmitis, vitrectomy and lens explantation with positive culture for"
		Curvularia lunata were carried out. The infection was controlled with the
		administration of systemic itraconazole and intraocular voriconazole.
		CONCLUSIONS: The use of intravitreal voriconazole injection is a viable option in
		cases of Curvularia fungal endophthalmitis.

		the aortic valve and the aortic root. Because curative surgery was considered to
		"be extremely high risk, he was treated with antifungal drugs for nearly 7 years."
		Initial treatment with amphotericin B and ketoconazole was followed by long-term
		"treatment with terbinafine, an experimental allyamine derivative. No adverse"
		"effects were attributed to terbinafine. At surgery nearly 7 years later, the"
		"aortic valve ring and aortic root appeared to be uninvolved, and the valve was"
		"replaced uneventfully. To our knowledge, this is the first report of successful"
		treatment of curvularia endocarditis.

TI	-	Acremonium keratitis in a patient with herpetic neurotrophic corneal disease.
PG	-	107-9
AB	-	Fungi belonging to the genus Acremonium Link ex Fries 1821 are ubiquitous
		"environmental contaminants and soil saprophytes, but are infrequent pathogens in"
		humans. These filamentous fungi (previously known as Cephalosporium) are an
		"uncommon cause of mycotic keratitis. As in the case of other filamentous fungi,"
		corneal trauma with contaminated matter is the most frequent risk factor for the
		infection. We report in this paper a case of keratomycosis caused by
		"Acremoniumpotronii, in a patient with a history of herpetic keratitis. Medical"
		treatment with amphotericin B was unsuccessful and the infection eventually
		resolved with penetrating keratoplasty.

TI	-	Paranasal sinus mycoses.
PG	-	293-304
AB	-	The incidence of paranasal sinus mycoses (fungal sinusitis) varies widely with
		"higher frequency in Sudan, southwestern states of USA and north India, which have"
		hot and dry climate. The disease has been described as having four types:
		"allergic, non-invasive, invasive and fulminate. A possible fifth type:"
		non-invasive destructive may also exist. In a prospective study of 176 cases of
		"fungal sinusitis from our centre, on the basis of clinical, radiological,"
		histopathologic and mycologic findings the patients could be categorized into:
		"allergic (12), non-invasive without bone destruction (81), non-invasive"
		"destructive (16), chronic invasive (55) and fulminant (12) types. Except the"
		"fulminate variety, the disease is commonly found in young immuno-competent"
		population of rural areas. Aspergillus spp. are the commonest etiological agents
		though the importance of dematiaceous fungi in allergic fungal sinusitis has been
		stressed. Zygomycetes are common agents in fulminate type. In our series A.
		"flavus (80%) was the commonest isolate, followed by A.fumigatus (9.7%), Rhizopus"
		"arrhizus (6.3%) and Alternaria spp. (1.1%). Curvularia lunata, Apophysomyces"
		elegans and Candida albicans were isolated from one patient each. Different host
		and environmental factors may help in lodging the causal fungi in mucosal plugs
		of these patients. Fungal allergy is associated with all varieties of the
		disease. But it is not clear what determines the invasion of mucosa. Rabbit can
		be used as an animal model. Histopathology and radio-imaging techniques help to
		distinguish different types and delineate extension of disease process. Culture
		helps to identify the responsible etiological agent. The presence or absence of
		precipitating antibody correlates well with disease progression or recovery. For
		"effective management, non-invasive disease requires surgical debridement and"
		sinus ventilation only. But for invasive type the need of adjuvant medical
		therapy is recommended to prevent recurrence and further extension. Itraconazole
		was found to be most useful in our study to prevent recurrence. Patients with
		fulminate type require radical surgery and immediate chemotherapy.

LID	-	10.5301/hipint.5000205 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To illustrate that Acremonium and Penicillium species are being
		increasingly recognised in periprosthetic joint infections (PJIs). CASE REPORT: A
		47-year-old male with liver cirrhosis and bilateral hip hemiarthroplasties
		complained of persistent right hip pain. Bone scan was suspicious for right hip
		septic arthritis. Laboratory studies revealed an elevated erythrocyte
		sedimentation rate (ESR; 127 mm/h) and C-reactive protein (CRP; 16.171 mg/L). At
		surgery caseous necrosis with a yellowish appearance around the hip was noted.
		Intraoperative cultures were positive for Acremonium and Penicillium species 2
		weeks after inoculation. After 4 months of fluconazole monotherapy a successful
		"revision right total hip arthroplasty was performed, the patient is walking"
		without assistance at 1 year after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: We reported a prosthetic
		hip infection due to Acremonium and Penicillium species. Removal of the
		"prosthesis, antifungal therapy, and re-implantation after 4 months were"
		successful.

AB	-	PURPOSE: To describe a unique case of LASIK flap fungal keratitis confirmed by
		next generation sequencing. OBSERVATIONS: A 56-year-old female presented with
		refractory keratitis involving her LASIK flap 21 years after surgery. Confocal
		was positive for filamentous structures. The patient underwent immediate flap
		amputation followed by topical antifungal treatment. Corneal culture was positive
		for Acremonium sp. Metagenomic deep sequencing confirmed Acremonium as the
		primary source of infection and also identified Fusarium as a likely contributor
		of a mixed fungal infection. Sequencing also identified hay as the likely source
		of the infection. Treatment resulted in eradication of the infection. The
		patient's final best corrected visual acuity was 20/30 with rigid contact lens
		overrefraction. CONCLUSIONS: Metagenomic deep sequencing is a novel diagnostic
		tool that is increasingly being utilized for diagnosis of refractory keratitis.
		This case demonstrates the diagnostic potential of deep sequencing for
		identifying post-LASIK keratitis and reinforces the utility of LASIK flap
		amputation in the setting of tectonic flap instability due to keratolysis.
		IMPORTANCE: This case highlights several important clinical points for treating
		LASIK flap keratitis and highlights the emerging role metagenomic sequencing has
		in the diagnosis of infectious keratitis. This is first known case using next
		generation sequencing to diagnose a post-LASIK infectious keratitis.

TI	-	Acremonium and trichosporon fungal keratoconjunctivitis in a Leopard Gecko
		(Eublepharis macularius).
PG	-	928-932
LID	-	10.1111/vop.12700 [doi]
AB	-	A 6-year-old male leopard gecko (Eublepharis macularius) was presented with a
		2-year history of recurrent dysecdysis involving the ocular surface of both eyes.
		Ophthalmic examination revealed ocular surface desiccation and multifocal
		superficial ulcerative keratitis with patchy remnants of retained shed. Other
		abnormalities included stomatitis and mandibular and maxillary osteomyelitis.
		"Topical and systemic antibiotic therapy, oral vitamin A, and improved husbandry"
		conditions resolved the stomatitis and osteomyelitis but did not improve the
		ocular surface. Corneal cytology collected with a cytobrush revealed branching
		hyphae and budding yeast consistent with fungal keratitis. Fungal culture grew
		Acremonium sp. and Trichosporon sp. The addition of topical antifungal therapy
		"improved the ocular surface health, but the patient was euthanized 7 weeks after"
		initial presentation for persistent vomiting and dyspnea. Necropsy was declined.
		This case describes the first case of fungal keratitis caused by Acremonium sp.
		and Trichosporon sp. in a reptile.

TI	-	Suppurative Arthritis Induced by Scedosporium apiospermum and Mycobacterium
		fortuitum: a Case Report.
LID	-	10.7754/Clin.Lab.2020.200945 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Suppurative arthritis induced by Scedosporium apiospermum (S.
		"apiospermum) or Mycobacterium fortuitum (MF) was rare, and even more so when"
		"caused by a mixed infection of the two. In this paper, we report the rare case of"
		suppurative arthritis induced by S. apiospermum and MF. METHODS: A 46-year-old
		patient whose left knee was accidentally injured by a rotary tiller. His left
		knee joint was clearly swollen although debridement and suturing had been
		performed twice at a local hospital. Bacterial culture result was MF and S.
		apiospermum after admission. Definitive therapy (debridement combined with
		treatment using three antibiotics) was initiated. RESULTS: Although the fungus
		"reappeared when he tried to discontinue the drug, after the third debridement"
		"combined with treatment using three antibiotics for 8 months, the infection was"
		controlled and did not recur. CONCLUSIONS: This demonstrates that early
		bacteriological examination is essential. Treatment of fungus generally requires
		"a long course. However, course of medication should be related to the patient's"
		specific conditions and the implementation of the operation.

TI	-	Orbital apex syndrome secondary to a fungal nasal septal abscess caused by
		Scedosporium apiospermum in a patient with uncontrolled diabetes: a case report.
PG	-	649
LID	-	10.1186/s12879-017-2753-6 [doi]
LID	-	649
AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Orbital apex syndrome is a localized type of orbital cellulitis,"
		where mass lesions occur at the apex of the cranial nerves. Although nasal septal
		"abscess is uncommon, the organism most likely to cause nasal septal abscess is"
		"Staphylococcus aureus, and fungal septal abscesses are rare. Here we present an"
		extremely rare and serious case of orbital apex syndrome secondary to fungal
		nasal septal abscess caused by Scedosporium apiospermum in a patient with
		uncontrolled diabetes. CASE PRESENTATION: A 59-year-old man with a 1-month
		history of headache underwent consultation in an otolaryngological clinic of a
		general hospital. He was diagnosed with nasal septal abscess and was treated with
		"incisional drainage and 1 month of an antibiotic drip; however, his symptoms"
		persisted. The patient later complained of diplopia due to bilateral abducens
		"nerve palsy, and was then referred to the department of Otolaryngology - Head and"
		"Neck Surgery, Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital. The septal lesion was"
		"biopsied under general anesthesia, and S. apiospermum was detected using"
		polymerase chain reaction. The patient was treated with an antifungal drug and
		"surgical resection of the lesion was performed. Although the patient survived, he"
		lost his eyesight. CONCLUSIONS: This patient represents the second reported case
		of nasal septal abscess and orbital apex syndrome caused by S. apiospermum. If
		"not treated properly, septal abscess can be life-threatening and cause severe"
		"complications, such as ablepsia."

TI	-	Lethal systemic dissemination from a cutaneous infection due to Curvularia lunata
		in a heart transplant recipient.
PG	-	440-2
AB	-	"A 69-year-old male heart transplant recipient, being treated with Cell Cept, FK"
		"506 and methylprednisolone had multiple deep brown skin nodules and nodes, on the"
		upper right arm. Skin biopsy and culture detected a strain of Curvularia lunata.
		"The infection disseminated to the whole skin surface, oral mucosa, upper third of"
		the oesophagus and to the lungs. Therapy with antibiotics and antifungal drugs
		was ineffective. The patient died of sepsis. We did not find any other case of
		systemic dissemination from a skin infection due to C. lunata among heart

		education to prevent situations that would put them at risk for infection and to
		seek medical advice immediately for an early diagnosis and an effective therapy.

AB	-	A 64-year-old woman was referred to our clinic for the treatment of chronic
		"uveitis in her left eye, which had started two weeks after an uncomplicated"
		cataract extraction. She was treated with topical steroids with an initially good
		"response, yet she subsequently developed severe inflammation and plaque-like"
		"material around the intraocular lens, despite continuous steroid therapy. She"
		"underwent pars plana vitrectomy, smear and culture of the aqueous and vitreous"
		"fluids, and intravitreal antibiotic injection under the impression of"
		Propionibacterium acne (P. acne) endophthalmitis. As a result of the smear and
		"culture of the vitreous fluid identified as an Acremonium species, she was"
		"treated with intravenous amphotericin B injections for five days, followed by"
		"oral voriconazole administration. During the post-operative 18-month follow-up,"
		"she was stable without significant relapse of uveitis. In this case, the best"
		correction of visual acuity was an improvement from 20/40 to 20/20.

TI	-	Central nervous system aspergillosis: a 20-year retrospective series.
PG	-	116-24
AB	-	"Over the past 20 years at my institution, 71 patients with invasive necrotizing"
		aspergillosis have been encountered; 42 have shown central nervous system (CNS)
		involvement by autopsy (40) or surgical biopsy (2). Most non-CNS aspergillosis
		"patients had invasive disease confined to the lung, and only 2 with dissemination"
		to 3 or more organs did not have spread to the CNS. In addition to the expected
		"post-transplantation and hematologic malignancy cases, other risk groups"
		"identified included those with chronic asthma and steroid use, acquired"
		"immunodeficiency syndrome, thermal burn, hepatic failure, and postoperative"
		"infection. Unusual cases manifested with basilar meningitis, myelitis, proptosis"
		"caused by sino-orbital disease, or epidural and subdural Aspergillus abscesses."
		The extent of gross neuropathologic disease ranged from subtle abscesses to
		massive hemorrhagic necrosis causing herniation and death. In addition to the
		"expected hemorrhagic necrosis, extensive hemorrhage, focal purulent meningitis,"
		and subtle bland infarctions were also seen. Distinctive microscopic findings
		encountered included 1 case with numerous meningeal granulomas and multinucleated
		giant cells and 4 cases showing the Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon. During the same
		"period, single cases of cerebritis caused by morphologically similar fungi"
		"(Pseudoallescheria boydii [Scedosporium apiospermum], Scedosporium inflatum,"
		Chaetomium sp) were identified and were indistinguishable from CNS aspergillosis
		clinically and pathologically.

TI	-	Fatal Scopulariopsis infection in a lung transplant recipient: a case report.
PG	-	2301-4
AB	-	A case of a fatal Scopulariopsis infection is reported in a 63-year-old lung
		transplantation patient with a 7-week history of dyspnea that presented initially
		"with pericardial and pleural fluid. Because of a respiratory arrest, the patient"
		"was intubated and received positive pressure ventilation. Later, obstructive"
		shock developed due to a pericardial tamponade requiring pericardectomy and then
		urgent extracorporal membrane oxygenation. The working hypothesis was of
		disseminated cytomegalovirus infection because cultures from bronchoalveolar
		lavage and transbronchial biopsy specimens were positive. The pericardial biopsy
		"specimen showed fungal hyphae. After the patient died from the infection, the"
		fungus was identified as Scopulariopsis acremonium. This case report describes
		"the first case, to our knowledge, of an insidious Scopulariopsis acremonium"
		"infection in an immunocompromised lung transplant patient, underscoring the"
		"importance of a direct, invasive approach and early treatment with anti-fungal"
		therapy in immunocompromised patients.

TI	-	The importance of a proper aetiological diagnosis in the management of patients
		with invasive mycoses: a case report of a brain abscess by Scedosporium
		apiospermum.
PG	-	317-22
LID	-	10.1007/s11046-011-9436-4 [doi]
AB	-	Scedosporium apiospermum is a saprobic fungus responsible for many different
		"clinical manifestations. Although it affects mostly immunocompromised patients,"
		pulmonary and disseminated scedosporiosis have also been reported in
		"immunocompetent subjects. It often causes subcutaneous mycetoma, despite its"
		preferential tropism to CNS. The authors describe a fatal case of a S.
		apiospermum brain abscess in a 58-year-old female. She was affected by chronic
		liver disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and had been treated with
		"corticosteroid therapy for a long time. She recovered in a neurosurgery unit,"
		wherein TC scan and cerebral MRI revealed an expansive left temporo-parietal
		process with vasogenic oedema. A stereotactic puncture of the lesion was carried
		"out, and pus of brain abscess was evacuated. Empirical antifungal therapy was"
		initiated with liposomal amphotericine B based on the clinical suspicion of
		"Zygomycetes infection; after 3 days, posaconazole was added. The correct"
		aetiological diagnosis arrived too late and the patient was treated with no
		specific therapy. This fatal case confirms the necessity of having a fast and
		correct aetiological diagnosis to improve the patient's outcome.

		fibrosis.
PG	-	327-33
LID	-	10.1111/1469-0691.12323 [doi]
AB	-	Aspergillus terreus is a common soil saprophyte. After Aspergillus fumigatus and
		Scedosporium apiospermum it ranks third amongst the filamentous fungi colonizing
		"the airways of patients with cystic fibrosis. In this context, the clinical"
		presentation of A. terreus infection mainly corresponds to allergic
		"broncho-pulmonary aspergillosis. In the work presented here, we studied"
		colonization patterns of A. terreus in CF patients by genotyping using nine short
		tandem repeat markers. A total of 115 clinical isolates from respiratory
		secretions collected from five French CF patients were studied. The number of
		"isolates varied from 15 to 39 per patient, and the duration of the follow-up"
		"period ranged from 2 months to 7.5 years. Seventeen genotypes were identified,"
		corresponding to three distinct colonization patterns. The first colonization
		pattern consisted of a chronic colonization by one dominant genotype associated
		with few other genotypes found only incidentally. The second colonization pattern
		consisted of a prolonged colonization by two distinct genotypes detected
		simultaneously. The last pattern was characterized by multiple different
		genotypes that were present only transiently. These results demonstrate the
		importance of genotyping clinical isolates before making conclusions about
		chronic colonization of the airways in CF patients in the case of repeated
		isolation of the fungus.

PG	-	225-32
AB	-	A case of mycotic keratitis due to Curvularia lunata var. aeria is reported for
		the first time from India. Direct microscopic examination of the corneal
		"scrapings in KOH (50 g1(-1)), stained with lactophenol cotton blue, revealed"
		brown septate hyphae and the cultures were found positive for fungus. It was
		"identified as C. lunata (Wakker) Boedijn var. aeria (Batista, Lima and"
		Vasconcelos) Ellis (IMI 253204) and its growth was better at 28 degrees C than at
		"37 degrees C. In vitro, the fungus was most sensitive to amphotericin B followed"
		"by miconazole nitrate, clotrimazole and triphenyltin isoselenocyanate 4-picoline"
		which had the same activity. Lactones were least active and tolciclate and
		arnebins and inactive. The fungus produced experimental keratomycosis in the
		rabbit cornea and the infection severity as well as histopathological changes
		"were more pronounced in rabbits that received penicillin, streptomycin and"
		cortisone.

AB	-	Mycetoma is a chronic granulomatous disease that is more common in tropical than
		in temperate regions. Early diagnosis is important due to the therapeutic
		implications. Although biopsy and microbiological culture provide definitive
		"diagnosis, they are time-consuming procedures and may not be able to provide a"
		"definite diagnosis in cases of fastidious organisms. The ""dot-in-circle"" sign has"
		recently been proposed as a highly specific magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
		"ultrasonography (USG) sign of mycetoma, which may allow a noninvasive as well as"
		early diagnosis. We present a case of histologically proven mycetoma that
		demonstrated this sign.

PG	-	414-7
AB	-	"OBJECTIVE: To describe the first case, to the best of our knowledge, of"
		posttraumatic Scedosporium apiospermum (ScA) keratitis successfully treated with
		systemic and topical voriconazole. CASE SUMMARY: A 19-year-old man was admitted
		to the hospital with an incisive wound of his left eye and the cornea totally
		sectioned after trauma with a cutter used in gardening. Initial empirical
		"treatment was followed by systemic and topical voriconazole, and the eye did not"
		"have to be enucleated. Five months after the trauma, a penetrating keratoplasty"
		and chamber intraocular lens implantation was performed with a favorable visual
		"outcome. DISCUSSION: ScA keratitis is rare, but it must be suspected if a history"
		of ocular injury with contaminated objects exists. Among the antifungals
		"available to treat ScA keratitis, voriconazole has shown advantages such as the"
		lowest minimum inhibitory concentration and the availability of an oral
		formulation. CONCLUSIONS: Voriconazole shows promise as an effective alternative
		to conventional antifungals in the treatment of ScA keratitis. It is available
		"both as oral and intravenous preparations, which is a great advantage in these"
		lengthy infections.

AB	-	We present a case of cerebral Scedosporium apiospermum infection presenting with
		intestinal manifestations in a 64-year-old male patient on immunosuppression for
		"orthotopic liver transplantation. At admission, the patient's chief complaint was"
		chronic watery diarrhea and he was found to have colonic ulcers on endoscopy. His
		hospital course was complicated by a tonic-clonic seizure caused by a left
		"frontal brain abscess, with the causative agent being identified by culture. He"
		"was treated with lobectomy, high-dose intravenous voriconazole, and liposomal"
		"amphotericin with clinical, endoscopic, and histologic improvement. To our"
		"knowledge, S. apiospermum has not been previously described as a cause of"
		colitis. The septate branching appearance of the Scedosporium species is similar
		to the more common Aspergillus species. This case of gastrointestinal
		Scedosporium brings into question previously reported cases of isolated
		gastrointestinal aspergillosis diagnosed by histopathology. Clinical suspicion
		for S. apiospermum must be maintained in immunosuppressed patients presenting
		with neurologic and gastrointestinal symptoms.

PG	-	3251-3260
LID	-	10.12998/wjcc.v10.i10.3251 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Scedosporium apiospermum (S. apiospermum) is a clinically rare and
		"aggressive fungus mainly found in contaminated water, wetlands, decaying plants,"
		"stagnant water, and potted plants in hospitals. The lung, bone, joint, eye,"
		"brain, skin, and other sites are easily infected, and there is a marked risk of"
		misdiagnosis. There have been few case reports of infection by S. apiospermum of
		the lumbar vertebrae; most reports have focused on infection of the lung. CASE
		SUMMARY: An otherwise healthy 60-year-old man presented with a 4-mo history of
		"lumbosacral pain, stooping, and limited walking. The symptoms were significantly"
		"aggravated 10 d prior to hospitalization, and radiating pain in the back of his"
		"left lower leg developed, which was so severe that he could not walk. Movement of"
		"the lumbar spine was significantly limited, anterior flexion was about 30°;"
		"backward extension, right and left lateral curvature, and rotational mobility"
		were about 10°; tenderness of the spinous processes of the lumbar 3-5 vertebrae
		"was evident, and the muscle strength of both lower limbs was grade IV. Imaging"
		"suggested bony destruction of the lumbar 3, 4, and 5 vertebrae and sacral 1"
		"vertebra; in addition, the corresponding intervertebral spaces were narrowed and"
		the lumbar 5 vertebra was posteriorly displaced and unstable. Lumbar vertebral
		"infection was also noted, and the possibility of lumbar tuberculosis was"
		considered. We first performed surgical intervention on the lesioned lumbar
		"vertebrae, cleared the infected lesion, and performed stable fixation of the"
		"lesioned vertebral body using a lumbar internal fixation device, which restored"
		the stability of the lumbar vertebrae. Cytological and pathological examination
		of the lesioned tissue removed during surgery confirmed S. apiospermum infection
		"of the lumbar vertebrae; on this basis, the patient was administered"
		"voriconazole. At the 6-mo follow-up, efficacy was significant, no drug-related"
		"side effects were observed, and imaging examination showed no evidence of"
		recurrence. CONCLUSION: S. apiospermum infection can occur in immunocompetent
		individuals with no history of near drowning. Voriconazole is effective for the
		treatment of S. apiospermum infection of the lumbar vertebrae for which it is
		suitable as the first-line therapy.

TI	-	The spectrum of non-Candida fungal infections following bone marrow
		transplantation.
PG	-	78-89
AB	-	We evaluated a consecutive series of patients who underwent bone marrow
		transplantation (BMT) at a single institution between 1974 and 1989 for the
		occurrence of a non-Candida fungal infection in the first 180 days after BMT. Of
		"the 1186 patients, 129 (11%) patients developed a total of 138 significant"
		non-Candida fungal infections in this period. Eight patients had multiple
		"distinct infections. The most common isolate was Aspergillus spp. (n = 97),"
		"followed by Fusarium (n = 10), and Alternaria (n = 6). The 4 clinical subtypes of"
		"infections were minor skin or soft-tissue infections (n = 7), infections of a"
		"single organ or site (n = 61), disseminated fungal infection (n = 58), and"
		isolated fungemia (n = 12). The respiratory tract was involved in 95% of single
		"organ or site infections, and 84% of disseminated infections. Outcome was poor,"
		with only 18% of patients surviving. The cause of death was directly related to
		the non-Candida fungal infection in 66% of patients who died. Mortality rates
		were significantly higher in patients with either single-organ or site infections
		(41%) or disseminated infections (83%). The cause-specific mortality rate was
		"greatest following infections with Aspergillus, Chrysosporium, Fusarium, Mucor,"
		"or Scopulariopsis, in which there was a high potential for invasive disease and"
		"disseminated infection. In contrast, the cause-specific mortality rate was lowest"
		in infections which were either isolated fungemia or were localized and amenable
		"to surgical debridement, most often seen with those infections caused by"
		"Acremonium, Alternaria, Penicillium, and Saccharomyces. The spectrum of clinical"
		infections caused by these uncommon non-Candida fungal isolates both in our
		series and in the literature is reviewed. These unusual opportunistic fungal
		isolates are now gaining recognition in immunosuppressed patients such as the BMT
		"population, and have a significant impact on patient outcome. Effective therapy"
		of non-Candida fungal infections remains difficult. Early aggressive surgical
		debridement appears to be important in control of localized invasive infections.
		"Prolonged therapy with amphotericin B is the standard of care, although the role"
		of the newer antifungal agents is not yet well-defined. Ancillary roles may also
		be provided by granulocyte transfusions and the colony-stimulating factors.

TI	-	Clinical features of human infection with Scedosporium inflatum.
PG	-	1027-33
AB	-	We report on 17 Australian cases of human infection or colonization with
		Scedosporium inflatum. The spectrum of clinical manifestations was similar to
		that in infection caused by Scedosporium apiospermum. The patients were
		classified into three groups. Four immunocompetent patients who presented with
		"localized infections of a joint, nail bed, eye, or sphenoidal sinus made up the"
		"first group. Our first case, in a boy with posttraumatic septic arthritis,"
		responded to surgical drainage with amphotericin B followed by treatment with
		itraconazole. The other three cases were cured by surgery alone. The second group
		consisted of five immunocompromised patients who presented with disseminated
		infections in a variety of sites. Four of these patients did not respond to
		antifungal therapy and died. The fifth apparently responded to antifungal drugs
		after correction of his neutropenia. The third group included eight patients with
		asymptomatic colonization in the external ear (five cases) or respiratory
		secretions (three cases). The nine isolates of S. inflatum tested by both disk
		"and agar dilution methods were resistant to antifungal drugs. In our first case,"
		"which responded clinically to itraconazole, the MIC of this drug for the fungal"
		isolate was 25 micrograms/mL. Thus S. inflatum can cause a broad spectrum of
		human infections whose severity and prognosis depend largely on the host's immune
		status.

AB	-	BACKGROUND: Polymicrobial keratitis with fungus and bacteria can lead to
		"blindness and is challenging to treat. Here, we introduce a case of fungal"
		keratitis caused by two different strains in addition to definite bacterial
		"super-infection caused by an α-Streptococcus sp., and describe the importance of"
		"microscopic examination. CASE PRESENTATION: A 74-year-old woman, who had a past"
		"history of infection with leprosy, presented with conjunctival hyperaemia, pain,"
		and corneal opacity in her right eye. Under the presumptive diagnosis of
		"infectious keratitis, corneal scrapings were stained by various reagents and"
		inoculated on several agar plates. Microscopic findings of the scrapings revealed
		fungi and a small number of Gram-positive cocci. Multiple anti-fungal therapies
		with levofloxacin ophthalmic solution were administered. Although empiric
		"treatment was initially effective, keratitis recurred 10 days after its"
		initiation. Repeated corneal scraping revealed an abundance of Gram-positive
		"chain cocci and a small amount of fungi, resulting in the switching of an"
		antibiotic medication from levofloxacin to moxifloxacin and cefmenoxime.
		"Keratitis resolved gradually after the conversion. Stemphylium sp., Acremonium"
		"sp., and α-Streptococcus sp. were simultaneously isolated from the corneal"
		"scrapings. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of"
		"fungal keratitis caused by Stemphylium sp., and also the first case of"
		super-infection in the cornea caused by two different fungi and one bacterium.
		Microscopic examination of the corneal scrapings was beneficial in rapid decision
		of changing to appropriate drug according to the dominancy of pathogenicity.

AB	-	PURPOSE: To report the therapeutic efficacy of intracameral voriconazole
		injection in the treatment of fungal endophthalmitis resulting from keratitis.
		"DESIGN: Retrospective, single-institution, consecutive case series. METHODS:"
		Microbiologic and medical records were reviewed for patients with positive
		intraocular culture results or proven pathologic features for fungal organisms
		and clinically diagnosed fungal endophthalmitis resulting from keratitis. Ten
		eyes were treated with an intracameral injection of 100 microg voriconazole.
		"Clinical characteristics, treatment, and causative organisms were analyzed."
		RESULTS: Fusarium and Aspergillus were the most common causative organisms.
		Voriconazole was injected intracamerally from 1 to 8 times. Of the 7 patients who
		"received 5 or more repeat injections, 6 were caused by Fusarium and 1 by"
		Acremonium. In the remaining 3 patients who were administered 4 or fewer
		"voriconazole injections, the causative organisms were Aspergillus and Alternaria."
		CONCLUSIONS: Intracameral voriconazole injection may be an effective treatment
		for fungal endophthalmitis contiguously spreading from keratitis.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Chronic invasive fungal rhinosinusitis (CIFR) is a rare entity
		generally observed in immunodepressed subjects. The pathogen most frequently
		identified is Aspergillus spp. Imaging generally reveals invasive
		pseudoneoplastic features. We report a case of Scedosporium apiospermum
		(S. apiospermum) CIFR with an atypical clinical and radiological presentation.
		"CASE REPORT: A 72-year-old immunocompetent man presented with chronic headache,"
		neck pain and bilateral limitation of lateral gaze. Imaging revealed an isolated
		left sphenoidal lesion with marked bone changes and an extradural abscess over
		the clivus. Large endoscopic sphenoidotomy with type II rhinopharyngectomy was
		performed and the diagnosis of S. apiospermum CIFR was based on histological
		examination and fungal culture. The patient refused all medical treatment and did
		not present any signs of recurrence after 1 year of follow-up. DISCUSSION:
		S. apiospermum is a fungal species rarely isolated in CIFR. The present case was
		revealed by an atypical clinical presentation including isolated sphenoidal
		infection complicated by bilateral abducens nerve paralysis and extradural
		"abscess. Imaging was also unusual, revealing features of fibrous dysplasia or"
		bacterial osteomyelitis rather than the typical pseudoneoplastic appearance. The
		"patient was successfully treated by surgery alone, which may therefore be"
		sufficient treatment in immunocompetent subjects.

AB	-	Scedosporium apiospermum is a ubiquitous filamentous fungus that may infect
		immunocompetent patients after trauma and may cause severe and often fatal
		"infections in immunocompromised hosts. Here, we present the case of a 28-year-old"
		female with S. apiospermum infection on the left forearm that had developed while
		she was on long-term immunosuppressant therapy. Analysis of a skin biopsy
		specimen showed a mixed cell granuloma with hyaline septate hyphae. Culture of
		the abscess revealed S. apiospermum which was identified as S. apiospermum sensu
		stricto by sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer-1 region of ribosomal
		DNA genes. Resection of the eruption and oral itraconazole (100 mg day(-1))
		therapy for 4 months was effective in curing the infection.

AB	-	A fatal case of Scopulariopsis acremonium sinus infection in an allogeneic
		hematopoietic stem cell transplant patient is reported. Rapid vascular diffusion
		"of the fungus to the major head vessels was observed, which led to subsequent"
		repeated cerebral ischemia and death. The presence of hyphae in the right carotid
		wall might be considered an indirect sign of fungal blood diffusion in the
		absence of positive blood cultures. The infection developed during the course of
		"prolonged voriconazole prophylaxis, which was found to be effective in the in"
		vitro antifungal drug assay. This finding induced us to consider the capacity of
		"this drug to reach infected paranasal sinuses, and the need in cases such as this"
		of a combined systemic and local pharmacological therapy or a combined medical
		and surgical approach.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: Invasive rhinocerebral fungal infections are a difficult and often
		"fatal problem in children with hematologic malignancies, with increasing reports"
		of rare pathogens. We describe a case of congenital acute lymphoblastic leukemia
		"(ALL) and invasive fungal rhinosinusitis involving Acremonium and Phoma species,"
		"not previously reported in invasive pediatric fungal rhinosinusitis, and review"
		all published cases of human Phoma infections. METHODS: A literature and
		"institutional review for Phoma spp. was completed including patient demographics,"
		"infection site, immune status, treatment and outcome. RESULTS: A female neonate"
		with acute lymphoblastic leukemia presented with hyperleukocytosis and advanced
		invasive Phoma and Acremonium spp. rhinosinusitis. Despite aggressive medical and
		"surgical therapy, the disease progressed to a rhinocerebral infection with a"
		fatal outcome. Twenty cases of Phoma spp. were found in a complete literature
		"search, including 6 females and 14 males from 18 months to 77 years old."
		Infections were superficial in fifteen patients and involved deeper tissue in
		"five patients, with sites including cutaneous, subcutaneous and deep tissue sites"
		"(eye, lung, extremity deep tissue compartments). CONCLUSIONS: This case"
		highlights the risks and grave prognosis of fulminant invasive fungal
		"rhinosinusitis in the context of congenital leukemia, and the potential for rare"
		fungal species in neonates with immunosuppression.

AB	-	Changes in the spectrum of clinically important fungal infection have been
		observed in recent years. Acremonium species has been responsible for eumycotic
		mycetomas but has also been increasingly implicated in systemic fungal diseases.
		A case of Acremonium kiliense fungemia with proven involvement of the lungs in an
		allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell patient is reported. A high-resolution
		computed tomography scan of the lungs showed nodules in both lungs. Multiple
		"cultures of blood demonstrated narrow septate hyphae, cylindrical conidia, and"
		solitary tapering phialides and microconidia that remained grouped in slimy
		heads. The isolate was identified as A. kiliense based on its morphological
		characteristics and DNA sequence analysis. Susceptibility testing of the clinical
		"isolate was performed to four antifungal agents. Amphotericin B, fluconazole and"
		"itraconazole were found to be inactive in vitro against the isolate; however, it"
		"was found to be sensitive to voriconazole. This last drug was indicated, and a"
		high-resolution computed tomography scan of the lungs was normal after 10 days.
		"One year later, the patient was free of symptoms and her blood culture was"
		"negative for fungi. Thus, voriconazole was effective in treatment for"
		"life-threatening A. kiliense infections. In this work, we performed an overview"
		of worldwide clinical infections caused by A. kiliense.

PG	-	979-985
LID	-	10.1017/S0022215122000202 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: To present our case series and management of Scedosporium apiospermum
		"infections of the middle ear and mastoid, and review the current literature on"
		this rare yet potentially life-threatening condition. METHODS: Medical records of
		patients treated at the Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital for S apiospermum
		middle ear and mastoid infections between 2009 and 2019 were reviewed. A
		"literature search was conducted using PubMed, Medline and Cochrane Library"
		databases. RESULTS: Two patients were identified in our institution: a
		"62-year-old diabetic woman with otogenic skull base osteomyelitis, and a"
		12-year-old boy with unilateral chronic suppurative otitis media which developed
		after tympanostomy tube insertion. The persistence of otalgia and otorrhoea
		despite prolonged antibiotic treatment characterised these cases. Both patients
		"received voriconazole, and achieved disease resolution without complications. Ten"
		"relevant cases were identified after review of the literature. Despite treatment,"
		"there were three patient deaths, and four patients with otological or"
		neurological complications. CONCLUSION: The presence of a middle ear or mastoid
		infection refractory to appropriate topical and systemic antibiotics should
		prompt clinicians to consider a fungal infection. The role of surgical
		debridement in the treatment of S apiospermum infection of the middle ear and
		mastoid is equivocal.

AB	-	We describe a case of mycetoma caused by Actinomadura pelletieri with
		"simultaneous involvement of the spine, abdominal wall and retroperitoneal space"
		in a man who had suffered from 'Madura foot' 10 years earlier. The
		characteristics of this case were analysed and contextualized among those of
		other cases of mycetoma caused by other micro-organisms found through a review of
		the international literature. The rarity of the disease in industrialized
		countries and its possible atypical presentations may hinder a prompt diagnosis.
		Culture techniques that allow detection of slow-growing fungi and actinomycetes
		should be routinely used when dealing with tissue samples from patients from
		tropical and subtropical regions with chronic granulomatous infections.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Onychomycosis are caused by dermatophytes and Candida, but rarely by"
		non- dermatophyte molds. These opportunistic agents are filamentous fungi found
		as soil and plant pathogens. OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency of
		"opportunistic molds in onychomycosis. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 4,220"
		"cases with onychomycosis, diagnosed in a 39-month period at the Institute of"
		"Dermatology and Skin surgery ""Prof. Dr. Fernando A. Cordero C."" in Guatemala"
		"City, and confirmed with a positive KOH test and culture. RESULTS: 32 cases"
		(0.76%) of onychomycosis caused by opportunistic molds were confirmed. The most
		"affected age group ranged from 41 to 65 years (15 patients, 46.9%) and females"
		"were more commonly affected (21 cases, 65.6%) than males. Lateral and distal"
		subungual onychomycosis (OSD-L) was detected in 20 cases (62.5%). The microscopic
		"examination with KOH showed filaments in 19 cases (59.4%), dermatophytoma in 9"
		"cases (28.1%), spores in 2 cases (6.25%), and filaments and spores in 2 cases"
		"(6.25%). Etiologic agents: Aspergillus sp., 11 cases (34.4%); Scopulariopsis"
		"brevicaulis, 8 cases (25.0%); Cladosporium sp., 3 cases (9.4%); Acremonium sp., 2"
		"cases (6.25%); Paecilomyces sp., 2 cases (6.25%); Tritirachium oryzae, 2 cases"
		"(6.25%); Fusarium sp., Phialophora sp., Rhizopus sp. and Alternaria alternate, 1"
		case (3.1%) each. CONCLUSIONS: We found onychomycosis by opportunistic molds in
		0.76% of the cases and DLSO was present in 62.5%. The most frequent isolated
		etiological agents were: Aspergillus sp. and Scopulariopsis brevicaulis.

AB	-	We report the case of a 65-year-old immunocompetent woman who developed
		Scedosporium apiospermum keratitis after clear-corneal phacoemulsification. A 3.5
		"mm by 2.7 mm full-thickness stromal infiltrate, corresponding to the superior"
		"2.75 mm clear-corneal incision, was observed 44 days postoperatively. Treatment"
		"included preservative-free voriconazole 1.0% hourly, ofloxacin 0.3% 6 times a"
		"day, oral voriconazole 200 mg once daily, natamycin 5.0% hourly, dexamethasone"
		"0.1% 4 times a day, and ocular cyclosporine 4 times a day. After 4 months of"
		"treatment, the new vessels had regressed, the infiltrate had disappeared, and"
		residual deep scarring remained; the uncorrected distance visual acuity was 0.8
		"logMAR. To our knowledge, this is the first case of S apiospermum keratitis"
		following clear-corneal phacoemulsification. Another unusual feature is that
		"there were no risk factors for fungal keratitis, specifically no history of"
		"trauma, systemic illness, immunosuppression, or contact lens wear. FINANCIAL"

TI	-	Fungal sternal wound infection due to Curvularia lunata in a neonate with
		congenital heart disease: case report and review.
PG	-	735-40
AB	-	We describe a neonate with congenital heart disease in whom a sternal wound
		infection caused by the filamentous fungus Curvularia lunata developed following
		"cardiac surgery. Despite their widespread distribution in the environment,"
		Curvularia species rarely cause human infection. We also review the 43 cases of
		curvularia infection previously reported in the English-language literature; only
		four of these cases occurred in children. A wide spectrum of
		"infections--including keratitis, cutaneous infections, sinusitis, allergic"
		"bronchopulmonary disease, pneumonia, chronic ambulatory peritoneal"
		"dialysis-related infections, endocarditis and disseminated infections--have been"
		described. Curvularia is a pathogen that can cause disease in both
		"immunocompetent and immunocompromised hosts, although more severe and"
		disseminated disease occurs in patients with defective immune function. Surgery
		"alone usually is successful for treating locally invasive disease, although a"
		combination of medical and surgical therapy is necessary for treating
		disseminated infections.

AB	-	We present a case of long-standing unilateral cacosmia in a healthy 67-year-old
		man due to maxillary fungal infestation. Treatment with septoplasty had been
		attempted 10 years prior but no further investigation or management undertaken
		and symptoms continued. Subsequent MRI scan revealed significant opacification of
		the left maxillary sinus. This was readily amenable to treatment by balloon
		sinuplasty. This yielded viscous grey mucus which grew Scedosporium apiospermum.
		"The case highlights the need for careful investigation of olfactory symptoms,"
		"including blood tests to exclude systemic causes, endoscopy and imaging where"
		indicated.

LID	-	10.1007/s10792-013-9777-8 [doi]
AB	-	To report a rare case of severe fungal keratitis caused by Scedosporium
		"apiospermum, which was treated with a penetrating tectonic keratoplasty and"
		aggressive medical treatment. A 62-year-old woman with a history of soil
		contamination of the right eye while planting vegetables presented with a severe
		corneal abscess and ocular pain. The patient received medical treatment and
		underwent tectonic keratoplasty. Both corneal scrapings and the corneal button
		were evaluated microscopically. The samples were sent for aerobic and anaerobic
		bacterial and fungal cultures. Microbiological examinations showed S.
		"apiospermum. The isolate was sensitive to amphoterycine B, caspofungin,"
		"voriconazole, and resistant to fluconazole. No clinical improvement was achieved"
		"with topical voriconazole, vancomycin, ceftazidime, and systemic voriconazole. A"
		penetrating tectonic keratoplasty and lensectomy with continuation of anti-fungal
		therapy achieved satisfactory results. A fungal etiology should be suspected in a
		progressive and untreatable corneal abscess. Microbiological investigation is
		very important in early diagnosis. Despite early diagnosis and aggressive
		"treatment, in selected cases removing the infected tissue surgically is vital in"
		preserving the ocular globe and vision.

PG	-	e16891

LID	-	e16891
AB	-	Invasive fungal infections are being increasingly identified recently.
		Scedosporium is a significant cause of non-Aspergillus mold infection. It can
		cause disseminated disease in an immunocompromised host and localized pulmonary
		"infection in immunocompetent ones, especially in those with preformed lung"
		cavities. We present a case of scedosporiosis in an elderly female with
		bronchiectasis who presented with refractory pulmonary symptoms and infiltrates.
		The case emphasizes the need to keep the fungal infection in the differential
		diagnosis of refractory infiltrates in immunocompetent individuals without
		preformed cavities if they have bronchiectasis. Voriconazole monotherapy can be
		used as the first-line in proven cases of scedosporiosis.

PG	-	379-387
LID	-	10.1007/s10561-019-09776-5 [doi]
AB	-	To evaluate the characteristics of microbiological contamination in donor corneas
		"preserved for medium-term. A total of 82 donated corneas from June 1, 2014 to"
		"November 30, 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. The corneas were preserved in"
		cornea chambers medium-term solution at 4-8 °C for keratoplasty. After removal of
		"the central corneas for transplantation, the corneoscleral rims were put back"
		into the medium for 1 month at room temperature (20-25 °C). The suspicious
		contaminated storage solutions indicated with transparency or color change were
		examined with bacteria and fungi cultivation for strain identification. The data
		"collected included gender, age, procurement site and causes of death of donors,"
		and follow-up of recipients. Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft
		Excel and SPSS 24.0. Significance level was set at a P value < 0.05. The overall
		"pathogen positive rate was 9.8% (n = 8), including 7 (87.5%) fungi and 1 (12.5%)"
		"bacteria. They were 2 (2.44%) Fusarium, 2 (2.44%) Chromomycosis, 1 (1.22%)"
		"Candida albicans, 1 (1.22%) Aspergillus versicolor, 1 (1.22%) Acremonium species,"
		and 1 (1.22%) Enterococcus. 5 contaminated corneas were used for penetrating
		keratoplasty; although four out of five (80%) had not been given antifungal drugs
		"during more than 6 months following-up period, none of the recipients was"
		"infected with a graft. Donor age (P = 0.839), gender (P = 0.062), procurement"
		sites (P = 0.713) and cause of death (P = 0.711) had no statistically significant
		influence on the contamination rate. All donor corneas have a possibility of
		microbiological contamination. Strict tissue preservation protocol but not
		antifungal drugs following keratoplasty seems necessary to prevent graft
		infection.

PG	-	27-39
AB	-	Curvularia lunata is a saprobic dematiaceous mould that resides primarily in soil
		"(Ellis, 1966). Reports of human disease caused by this organism are rare but"
		"include: endocarditis, brain abscess, skin infections, onychomycosis, keratitis,"
		"pneumonia, disseminated disease, mycetoma, allergic bronchopulmonary disease, and"
		"one case of sinusitis. Since 1983, we have encountered five cases of paranasal"
		sinusitis due to C. lunata. None of the patients suffered from known immunologic
		disorders or underlying debilitating diseases. These five cases are presented and
		the literature of human phaeohyphomycosis caused by Curvularia spp. is reviewed.

PG	-	340

LID	-	340
AB	-	BACKGROUND: We present a case of fungal keratitis caused by
		"Scedosporium apiospermum, which is a rare agent. Case description A 34-year-old"
		Caucasian male patient was admitted to our clinic with complaints of pain and
		blurred vision in the left eye. The patient had a history of wearing contact
		"lenses for 3 years. According to the Snellen chart, the patient's visual acuity"
		"was 20/20 and counting fingers at 30 cm, for right and left eyes, respectively. A"
		3 × 3 mm corneal abscess at the center of the cornea with hypopyon in the
		"patient's left eye was observed. After the patient was hospitalized, fortified"
		gentamicin and fortified cefazolin drops were started 24 times per day.
		"Intravenous fluconazole 1 × 800 mg loading, 1 × 400 mg maintenance dose,"
		intravenous vancomycin 4 × 500 mg and intravenous cefoperazone + sulbactam
		2 × 2 g treatments were started. We observed S. apiospermum in the corneal
		"scraping sample, which the identification was performed by combined phenotypic"
		characteristics and matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization time-of-flight
		mass spectrometry on the sixth day of treatment. The drops were revised as
		"fortified vancomycin, ceftazidime, and voriconazole drops 24 times per day."
		Intravenous voriconazole 2 × 6 mg/kg loading and 2 × 4 mg/kg maintenance dose
		"treatments were started. Three weeks later, left eye visual acuity increased to"
		"20/40, and the corneal abscess regressed. On second-year follow-up, his visual"
		acuity increased to 20/25 for the left eye and the cornea was transparent.
		CONCLUSION: Scedosporium group is an opportunistic filamentous fungus that is
		"very rarely seen and causes severe keratitis infections. In the literature, to"
		"the best of our knowledge, three cases of keratitis due to S. apiospermum after"
		"contact lenses were reported, and all were treated with penetrating keratoplasty."
		"In this case, unlike the others, only medical treatment was applied. In cases"
		"with suspected fungal keratitis, medical treatment should be started without"
		"waiting for the culture result, the findings should be followed and penetrating"
		keratoplasty should be performed in the case of no response to treatment.

PG	-	1921-4
LID	-	10.2147/OPTH.S25697 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: To describe the imaging appearance of Scedosporium apiospermum (S.
		apiosermum) endophthalmitis in an immunocompetent female who underwent high
		resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits and showed subchoroidal
		abscess on diffusion-weighted imaging. METHODS: WE HIGHLIGHT UTILITY OF MRI
		"SEQUENCES: diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), apparent diffusion coefficient"
		"(ADC), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and contrast-enhanced"
		magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) in the detection of a subchoroidal abscess
		and characterization of the inflammatory change of the uveal tract. Vitreous
		culture grew S. apiospermum. CONCLUSION: Fungal endophthalmitis is a rare but
		"aggressive process. Clinically, it can mimic other disease entities such as"
		"neoplasm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case that describes the"
		CT and MRI imaging findings of S. apiospermum endophthalmitis. We emphasize the
		use of DWI and ADC sequences in the detection of subchoroidal abscess.

AB	-	Cutaneous fungal infections can result in disastrous episodes if improperly
		"diagnosed and treated, especially in immunosuppressed patients. Although"
		dermatopathologists are highly familiar with some filamentous fungi - such as
		Aspergillus and Zygomycetes - they are not so aware of other less common species.
		We report a case of ocular infection by Scedosporium apiospermum that started as
		conjunctivitis and resulted in Phthisis bulbi and subsequent exeresis of the left
		eye. We describe some of the main morphological features of the fungus as well as
		the important morphological clues for the differential diagnosis with some
		"similar species, such as Aspergillus, Scopulariopsis, Fusarium, Paecilomyces and"
		Zygomycetes.

AB	-	INTRODUCTION: Peritonitis associated with fungal species Curvularia lunata seldom
		"occurs with only five cases reported in the literature, all in middle-age"
		patients with comorbidities undergoing dialysis. CASE REPORT: A 21-year-old
		female who was referred to surgical oncology OPD with a diagnosis of ovarian
		"malignancy, based on raised cancer antigen 125 (CA 125) and suspected"
		tubo-ovarian mass (TOM) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A review of the MRI
		"showed a pelvic collection with TOM, suggestive of infective pathology. Fungal"
		culture and mass spectroscopy of the cystic collection identified the presence of
		Curvularia lunata. She was treated with oral itraconazole which showed
		"symptomatic improvement and radiological response. In the follow-up period, the"
		"patient developed chest wall swelling, aspiration and geneXpert® revealed"
		"multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis, and treatment was started. CONCLUSIONS:"
		Unusual causes of TOM and raised CA 125 should be kept in mind when dealing with
		"young patients, as the possibility of epithelial ovarian cancer in this age is"
		very low.

PG	-	1804-10
AB	-	"Two cases of human fungal infections caused by members of the genus Phialemonium,"
		a genus proposed by Gams and McGinnis (1983) for fungi intermediate between the
		"genera Acremonium and Phialophora, are presented. The first case was a"
		phaeohyphomycotic cyst on the foot of a renal transplant recipient. The fungus
		was detected by direct examination and histopathology and was recovered by
		"several procedures over 4 months. It was flat, glabrous, and white becoming"
		yellow with the production of a diffusible yellow pigment; it had conidiophores
		that were mostly solitary and lateral and terminal phialides and adelophialides
		with distinct collarettes producing cylindrical to curved conidia. The isolate
		"resembled both Phialemonium dimorphosporum and Phialemonium curvatum, although"
		its characteristics were more consistent with those of the latter. The second
		case was peritonitis in a renal transplant recipient. The fungus was
		"white-to-cream colored and yeast like, but later became black with a green"
		"diffusible pigment, and produced obovoid conidia; it was easily identified as"
		Phialemonium obovatum. Difficulties encountered in the identification and
		"taxonomy of members of this genus highlight the need for standardized conditions,"
		"e.g., potato dextrose agar culture incubated at 24 to 25 degrees C for"
		"morphologic comparisons, to control significant variations due to culture"
		conditions.

TI	-	Scedosporium apiospermum infection after near-drowning.
PG	-	412-21
AB	-	Scedosporium apiospermum and its teleomorph (sexual form) Pseudallescheria boydii
		"are ubiquitous saprophytic fungi, which under specific conditions, such as"
		"near-drowning, may cause therapy-refractory and life-threatening infections. We"
		reviewed 22 cases (eight children and 14 adults) of S. apiospermum infection
		after near-drowning reported in the literature including an additional paediatric
		case from our institution. Scedosporiosis after near-drowning was associated with
		"high mortality (16/23, 70%) even in immunocompetent hosts. It affected mainly"
		young (mean age 24 years) and immunocompetent (83% with no apparent immune
		defect) males (male to female ratio 2.5 : 1). Scedosporiosis after near-drowning
		was a slow progressive disease (mean survival time 87 days) involving virtually
		"all body organs. However, central nervous system (CNS) dissemination predominated"
		"(21/23, 91%) presenting mainly as multiple brain abscesses (15/23, 65%). All 23"
		patients showed preceding clinical and/or radiological evidence of lung disease
		indicating the mode of invasion. Diagnosis was delayed (median time to diagnosis
		"28 days) and was made by culture (16/23, 69.5%) or culture and tissue examination"
		"(7/23, 30.5%). The majority of the patients (20/23, 87%) received antifungal"
		treatment and underwent neurosurgery. While the optimal treatment remains
		"undefined, the most recent reports indicated voriconazole as a potentially"
		effective option. Better knowledge of scedosporiosis after near-drowning could
		lead to improved intervention and ultimately to more favourable outcome.

TI	-	Clinical utility of a panfungal polymerase chain reaction assay for invasive
		fungal diseases in patients with haematologic disorders.
PG	-	331-9
LID	-	10.1111/ejh.12078 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVES: Invasive fungal diseases (IFDs) are life-threatening events in
		"patients with haematologic disorders, and the spectrum of the aetiological"
		pathogens continues to expand. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical utility
		of a panfungal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the management of IFDs
		in such patients. METHODS: We prospectively analysed 273 consecutive blood
		samples from 64 risk episodes in 51 patients with haematologic disorders at high
		risk for IFD who were treated at our hospital between April 2007 and October
		2010. RESULTS: PCR-positive results were obtained in 18 of 64 risk episodes
		"(35.3%). IFD was documented in 14 episodes (21.9%, 9 probable IFDs and 5 possible"
		IFDs) according to the revised criteria of the European Organization for Research
		and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group. PCR was positive in all of these 14
		"episodes, and in 4 of the 50 episodes with no IFD category. Sensitivity,"
		"specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of our"
		"assay were 100%, 92%, 78% and 100% respectively. A considerable number of fungi"
		(44.4%) that are less common than Aspergillus and Candida species were positive
		"by PCR. Molecular diagnoses of Cunninghamella species, Aspergillus ustus,"
		"Fusarium species, Scedosporium apiospermum, Rhodotorula species and Rhizopus"
		species were beneficial in selecting suitable treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Our
		panfungal PCR approach allows for the highly sensitive and specific detection and
		"identification of a wide spectrum of fungal pathogens, which provides"
		"indispensable information for managing IFDs, especially refractory or"
		breakthrough IFDs during antifungal therapy in high-risk patients with
		haematologic disorders.

TI	-	Allergic fungal sinusitis secondary to dermatiaceous fungi--Curvularia lunata and
		Alternaria.
PG	-	32-9
AB	-	Allergic fungal sinusitis is a newly recognized entity consisting of a
		pansinusitis with allergic mucinous infiltrates in all involved sinuses. The
		disease process itself is very different from all other types of rhinosinusitis.
		Pathophysiologically the disease is a combination of both IgE-mediated and
		antibody-antigen reactions to the specific fungal antigens. Here we present two
		cases of allergic fungal sinusitis--one caused by Curvularia lunata species (an
		"ubiquitous soil fungi), another caused by Alternaria. Only one other case of"
		allergic fungal sinusitis caused by curvularia in which extensive immunologic
		testing was done has appeared in the literature. No reports of alternaria causing
		allergic fungal sinusitis have appeared in the literature. Diagnostic criteria
		for allergic fungal sinusitis include radiologic evidence of pansinusitis in an
		atopic individual; findings at surgery of allergic mucin; positive fungal
		"cultures; and specific immunologic testing, including both humoral and cellular"
		arms of the immune system. Treatment options for allergic fungal sinusitis are
		"discussed and include surgery alone, surgery and steroids, or steroids alone. The"
		"role of allergy immunotherapy injections remains to be defined. In general,"
		"fungal infections--and especially phaeohyphomycosis--are very rare, but appear to"
		"be increasing in frequency, especially in the paranasal sinus region."

		report.
PG	-	4-Nov
AB	-	Eumycetoma is a mycotic disease caused by saprophytic soil fungi that are usually
		inoculated through minor injuries. A case of mycetoma in a Brazilian farmer aged
		71 years is reported. This patient presented erythema and edema on the dorsal
		surface of the left hand with multiple crusted and cicatricial lesions. No
		macroscopic grains were observed. The histopathological findings showed grains
		consisted of numerous hyphae which stained well with Gomori-Grocott method. This
		material obtained by cutaneous biopsy was submitted to culture on Sabouraud's
		medium and the colonies were identified as Fusarium solani. The radiological
		studies revealed bone osteolytic lesions and the ultrasound showed pseudocysts
		and fistulae at the site of this infection. The patient was treated with oral
		ketoconazole with a good clinical response.

AB	-	Members of the Fusarium solani species complex (FSSC) are causing the majority of
		the fusariosis in humans. Disseminated fusariosis has a high mortality and is
		"predominantly observed in patients with leukemia. Here, we present the case of a"
		"fatal infection by a Fusarium strain with a degenerated phenotype, in a patient"
		with acute lymphatic leukemia. Multiple nasal and skin biopsies as well as blood
		"cultures yielded fungal growth, while in direct and histopathological examination"
		of biopsy material septate hyphae were visible. Initial colonies were white with
		"slimy masses with microconidia reminiscent of Fusarium/Acremonium, but with"
		conidiospore production directly on the hyphae. Multi-locus sequence typing
		discerned a pionnotal-morphologically degenerated-colony of the recently
		recognized F. petroliphilum as etiological agent. The culture returned to a
		typical F. solani species complex morphology only after several weeks of growth
		in culture. Antifungal susceptibility tests indicate amphotericin B as best drug
		for this FSSC member rather than any of the azoles or echinocandins.

TI	-	Scedosporium apiospermum: A Rare Cause of Aggressive Orbital Apex Syndrome.
PG	-	e3743
LID	-	10.7759/cureus.3743 [doi]
LID	-	e3743
AB	-	Orbital apex syndrome (OAS) is a localized orbital cellulitis at the orbital apex
		that can cause vision loss from optic neuropathy and ophthalmoplegia involving
		"multiple cranial nerves. Herein, we report a rare and rapidly progressive case of"
		OAS secondary to fungal pansinusitis caused by Scedosporium apiospermum in an
		immunocompromised patient following the extraction of abscessed teeth. A
		48-year-old man with diabetes mellitus who had failed to adhere to his treatment
		"presented with complaints of a right-sided headache and toothache for two weeks,"
		with nausea and vomiting for two days prior to presentation. The patient was
		treated for septic shock secondary to the dental abscesses. Non-contrast brain
		computed tomography (CT) showed no significant intracranial abnormalities other
		"than pansinusitis. Four days later, dental extraction was performed. The patient"
		reported progressive painless blurring of the vision in his right eye following
		the dental extractions and was referred to the ophthalmology department.
		Subsequent examinations revealed decreased optic nerve function and
		"ophthalmoplegia in his right eye and dental caries in the upper molars, with a"
		mucopurulent discharge from the right sphenoid region. The clinical diagnosis was
		OAS. Pus near the orbital apex was drained surgically. Methicillin-resistant
		Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from the pus and a nasal swab. Tissue culture
		from the septal wall yielded S. apiospermum. The patient's condition
		"deteriorated, despite intensive antibiotic and antifungal treatment and repeated"
		surgical debridement. The disease progressed rapidly to his left eye. Sixty-seven
		"days after the inital presentation, his visual acuity (VA) of both eyes was"
		classified as no perception of light (NPL). The patient discharged himself from
		the hospital (at own risk discharge) and subsequently failed to attend a
		scheduled appointment in the ophthalmology clinic. If immunocompromised patients
		"present with OAS, fungal infections should be ruled out. Prompt and aggressive"
		treatment using a multidisciplinary approach is mandatory in cases of potentially
		life-threatening and vision-threatening fungal infections.

TI	-	Case of femoral pseudarthrosis due to Scedosporium apiospermum in an
		immunocompetent patient with successful conservative treatment and review of
		literature.
PG	-	400-409
LID	-	10.1111/myc.12739 [doi]
AB	-	"Scedosporium apiospermum is a ubiquitous filamentous fungus, commonly found in"
		"soil, sewage and polluted waters. It is rarely pathogenic but can cause a broad"
		"spectrum of clinical diseases, which can be localised or disseminate to distant"
		organs. The disseminated form of the disease is mostly seen among
		"immunocompromised patients. However, some rare cases of disseminated disease have"
		been reported in immunocompetent individuals. Treatment of these infections is
		"challenging because of their natural resistance to many antifungal agents. Here,"
		we report the case of a 57-year-old immunocompetent patient diagnosed with
		"femoral pseudarthrosis due to S. apiospermum, despite having no obvious clinical"
		"sign of infection. Previously, the patient had undergone four iterative femoral"
		surgeries following a road traffic accident which occurred 20 years before.
		"During its last surgery for pseudarthrosis, no clinical or biological signs of"
		infection were present. Per operative samples tested positive for S. apiospermum.
		The patient was successfully treated with oral voriconazole during 6 months with
		an excellent tolerance. We also provide a review of literature on bone and joint
		"infections due to Scedosporium spp. (S. apiospermum, Scedosporium boydii and"
		"Scedosporium aurantiacum), discussing the evolution of their management and"
		outcome which seems to improve since the use of voriconazole.

AB	-	Extensive fungal infections of the paranasal sinuses are most often associated
		"with immunocompromised patients or poorly controlled diabetics. Seldom do young,"
		otherwise healthy patients present with advanced disease destroying bone and
		compressing the dura and frontal lobe posteriorly. A case of eosinophilic fungal
		rhinosinusitis which grew Curvularia lunata in culture is reported. Bone
		destruction can be common as an expanding inflammatory mass pushes and weakens

		"reconstruction, and medical management. Our experience with the disease and our"
		approach is reviewed.

		case.
PG	-	321-3
AB	-	A forty-year-old man underwent an allogeneic BMT from his HLA identical sister.
		"GvHD prophylaxis was done with cyclosporine (CyA), methotrexate and prednisone"
		(PDN). On day +90 extensive GvHD was noted and higher doses of immunosuppressive
		drugs alternating CyA with PDN were initiated. Patient's follow-up was
		complicated by intermittent episodes of leukopenia and monthly episodes of
		"sinusitis or pneumonia. One year after BMT, the patient developed hoarseness and"
		nasal voice. No etiologic agent could be identified on a biopsy sample of the
		"vocal chord. Upon tapering the doses of immunosuppressive drugs, the patient had"
		worsening of chronic GvHD and was reintroduced on high doses of cyclosporine
		"alternating with prednisone on day +550. Three months later, GvHD remained out of"
		"control and the patient was started on azathioprine. On day +700, hoarseness and"
		nasal voice recurred. Another biopsy of the left vocal chord failed to
		demonstrate infection. Episodes of sinusitis became more frequent and
		"azathioprine was withheld 3 months after it was started. One month later, the"
		patient had bloody nasal discharge and surgical drainage of maxillary sinuses was
		performed. Histopathology showed hyphae and cultures grew Scedosporium
		apiospermum. Itraconazole 800 mg/day was initiated. The patient developed
		progressive respiratory failure and died 15 days later.

PG	-	272-6
AB	-	The diagnosis of fungal keratitis can be difficult and is often delayed. The
		distinction between moniliaceous and dematiaceous (pigmented) keratomycoses is
		not commonly possible on clinical examination. We report a case of a Curvularia
		lunata fungal keratitis in a 40-year-old patient who presented with diffuse brown
		pigmentation throughout the ulcer bed. Histologic staining and growth on
		Sabourad's dextrose agar demonstrated the brown pigmentation characteristic of
		this pigmented fungus. We call attention to this clinical pigmentation as a
		helpful clue in the detection of dematiaceous fungal keratitis.

AB	-	We report on a case of scedosporiosis in a 72-year-old German woman. Her disease
		started with a purulent ulceration of unknown course at her left foot. Soon after
		onset of oral antibacterial therapy she needed in-hospital treatment because of
		an acute pneumonia. The infection progressed despite the application of different
		antibiotics. Microscopic examination of tracheal fluid revealed fungal hyphae and
		"therefore treatment with itraconazole was initiated. However, the patient"
		"developed renal failure, required mechanical ventilation and finally died in"
		treatment-resistant septic shock. Post-mortem Scedosporium apiospermum was
		cultured from lung tissue taken during autopsy. This is the fourth case of human
		infection caused by Scedosporium species diagnosed in our laboratory during the
		last 4 years.

AB	-	A 40-year-old kidney transplant male recipient was hospitalized for chronic
		abscess of the right foot in a context of immunodepression. The patient came from
		Djibouti and was in Belgium for a few days. He presented a right foot with a
		swelling localized on the first metatarsophalangeal joint which was excoriated
		(Figures 1 and 2) and was self-treated ineffectively with various local
		antiseptics for several months. He was in the operating room for an open biopsy
		done by plantar and dorsal approach to confirm the fungal infection. Treatment
		was not started with oral itraconazole because of the good evolution of the
		"lesion. Pain diminished after a few days, and the patient was able to walk after"
		a few weeks.

		tuberculosis in a renal transplant recipient.
PG	-	259
LID	-	10.1186/1471-2334-14-259 [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Renal transplant recipients are at high risk of developing multiple
		"infections, often concomitantly because of their immunocompromised status. Post"
		renal transplant infections are often elusive and require extensive evaluation
		for proper diagnosis and treatment. A high index of suspicion is required and an
		attempt should be made to confirm the microbiological diagnosis from each site
		involved to rule out multiple infections. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a
		"50-year-old female, a renal allograft recipient who presented with left"
		"hemiplegia, esophageal ulcers and fever 3 months after her transplant. Esophageal"
		biopsy revealed Cytomegalovirus (CMV) inclusions and the whole blood quantitative
		CMV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was positive. Neuroimaging showed a brain
		"abscess, stereotactic biopsy from which revealed Scedosporium apiospermum on"
		fungal culture. Her tacrolimus and mycophenolate were stopped and she was managed
		"with intravenous ganciclovir and voriconazole. With these measures, she showed"
		"marked improvement in her general and neurological condition. Two months later,"
		she developed recurrence of fever with dry cough. Radiological investigation
		"revealed a cavitating lung lesion, a needle aspiration from which demonstrated"
		acid-fast bacilli. She was started on antituberculous treatment. With these
		"measures, she recovered completely and maintained good graft function despite"
		being on only prednisolone 10 mg once a day. CONCLUSION: Although CMV disease is
		"not uncommon in the first three months post transplant, Scedosporium is a rare"
		"cause of brain abscess. On the other hand, tuberculosis is common in transplant"
		"recipients, especially in developing countries, like India. However, this is the"
		"first case report of occurrence of these three infections in the same patient,"
		demonstrating the importance of a good microbiological work-up from each site
		involved in immunosuppressed subjects.

		prospective study.
PG	-	125-8
AB	-	The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of causative
		"non-dermatophytic filamentous fungi in onychomycosis. Totally 1,222 (1,222 x 3 ="
		"3,666) samples of nail scrapings from 1,146 patients (from 76 patients two"
		specimens: both from finger- and toe-nails) with prediagnosis of onychomycosis
		"sent to the Mycology Laboratory from the Clinic of Dermatology, Ege University"
		"Hospital, Izmir, Turkey, July 2001-December 2003, were prospectively studied with"
		conventional mycological procedures. The set criteria for the diagnosis of
		onychomycosis due to non-dermatophytic molds were: (1) Observation of fungal
		"elements in 15% KOH-preparations made from nail scrapings, (2) growth of the same"
		mold in all three consecutive cultures of the specimens taken three times from
		"the same patient with one-week intervals, (3) no growth of a dermatophyte or"
		yeast in three consecutive cultures. As agents of onychomycosis molds were
		"detected in 33 (9%), dermatophytes in 175 (48%), yeasts in 150 (41%), and mixed"
		"(two different fungi) in 8 (2%) patients. In cases of mold onychomycosis, 11"
		(33%) had finger-nail and 22 (67%) toe-nail infection; 25 (76%) were female and 8
		(24%) male; and 27 (82%) were above 40 years of age. The agents of mold
		"onychomycosis, in order of frequency, were Aspergillus niger (7), Acremonium spp."
		"(6), Fusarium spp. (6), Ulocladium spp. (4), sterile mycelia (2), Alternaria sp."
		"(1), Aspergillus flavus (1), Aspergillus fumigatus (1), Aspergillus terreus (1),"
		"Cladosporium sp. (1), Paecilomyces spp. (1), Scopulariopsis sp. (1) and"
		"Trichoderma sp. (1). In conclusion, this study showed that non-dermatophytic"
		molds were responsible for nearly 10% of onychomycoses cases attending the
		"dermatology outpatient clinic of a university hospital in Izmir, Turkey. Since"
		"molds are common contaminants in the laboratory, cultures from consecutively"
		taken nail scrapings should be made and carefully evaluated in order to diagnose
		"a ""mold onychomycosis""."

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Scedosporium apiospermum, an opportunistic and filamentous fungus, is"
		a rarely seen ocular entity that is difficult to identify and heal. We report a
		challenging case of S. apiospermium keratitis and discuss the treatment
		modalities in light of previous studies. CASE PRESENTATION: A 30-year-old Turkish
		farmer with a history of contact lens misuse presented to our clinic with a
		painful corneal abscess and severe vision loss in his left eye. S. apiospermum
		was identified by spectrophotometric analysis. The patient was successfully
		"treated with therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty, but was resistant to"
		fluconazole and amphotericin B and susceptible but unresponsive to voriconazole.
		CONCLUSION: S. apiospermum keratitis should be considered in the differential
		diagnosis of immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients with history of
		"ocular trauma and contact lens use, especially those who do not respond to"
		treatment.

AB	-	"BACKGROUND: Dermatophytes are the main cause of onychomycoses, but various"
		non-dermatophyte filamentous fungi are often isolated from abnormal nails.
		OBJECTIVE: Our aim was the in situ identification of the fungal infectious agent
		in 8 cases of onychomycoses which could not be cured after systemic terbinafine
		"and itraconazole treatment. METHODS: Fungal DNA was extracted from nail samples,"
		and infectious fungi were identified by restriction fragment length polymorphism
		(RFLP) of amplified fungal ribosomal DNA using a previously described PCR/RFLP
		assay. RESULTS: PCR/RFLP identification of fungi in nails allows the
		"identification of the infectious agent: Fusarium sp., Acremonium sp. and"
		"Aspergillus sp. were found as a sole infectious agent in 5, 2 and 1 cases,"
		respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Fusarium spp. and other non-dermatophyte filamentous
		fungi are especially difficult to cure in onychomycoses utilising standard
		treatment with terbinafine and itraconazole. PCR fungal identification helps
		demonstrate the presence of moulds in order to prescribe alternative antifungal
		treatments.

AB	-	Infections caused by the Scedosporium genus have become recognized as a fatal
		"complication after lung transplantation in Europe and Australia, but the reports"
		have been rare from Asian countries including Japan. We present a case of
		pneumonia caused by a mixed infection of Scedosporium apiospermum (SA) and
		Lomentospora prolificans (LP) that developed after augmentation of
		immunosuppression for chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) after lung
		transplantation. A 13-year-old man underwent bilateral lung transplantation for
		"pulmonary hypertension. One year after surgery, he was treated with a series of"
		augmented immunosuppressive therapy for severe acute rejection and subsequent
		"CLAD. Three months following the first steroid pulse therapy, his serum"
		β-D-glucan elevated without any sign of fungal infection by other tests. The
		serum β-D-glucan once returned to a normal level by empirical administration of
		"micafungin; however, the patient's condition worsened again by discontinuation of"
		"it. He did not recover by restarting micafungin, and computed tomography (CT)"
		scans eventually demonstrated new infiltrates in his lung field 6 weeks after the
		elevation of serum β-D-glucan. Microscopic findings of transbronchial lung biopsy
		"specimens showed filamentous fungi, and the culture of bronchoalveolar lavage"
		fluid revealed the growth of SA and LP. Despite subsequent voriconazole
		"administration, he died 14 days after the start of voriconazole. Early and"
		aggressive inspection including bronchoscopy should be performed for the
		"diagnosis of Scedosporium infection in immunocompromised patients, even if CT"
		scans and sputum culture show no evidence of infection.

LID	-	10.1097/ICO.0000000000000172 [doi]
AB	-	PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to report the first case of polymicrobial
		fungal sclerokeratitis caused by infection with both Scedosporium apiospermum and
		"Aspergillus cibarius, and notify the medical community of the possibility of"
		infection caused by A. cibarius in humans. METHODS: A 78-year-old woman presented
		to a medical practitioner with epiphora and a purulent discharge in her left eye.
		"After concurrent administration of topical antibiotics and systemic steroids, her"
		"symptoms worsened, and she was referred to the Tokushima University Hospital."
		"Because of suspected fungal infection, microscopic examination and cultivation of"
		both corneal and scleral scrapings were performed. RESULTS: Fungi were observed
		"on microscopic examination, and S. apiospermum was isolated only from the sclera"
		in the early stage of the clinical course. Although administration of an adequate
		medication regimen comprising topical and systemic antifungal drugs resulted in
		"an improvement in the sclera, keratitis persisted, and the infected sclera was"
		"melted. After scleral transplantation, administration of systemic caspofungin and"
		high concentrations of voriconazole solution eye drops resulted in a gradual
		improvement in keratitis. A strain of filamentous fungus was isolated from the
		"cornea 6 weeks after the cultivation on a Sabouraud agar plate, and it was"
		identified as A. cibarius. CONCLUSIONS: A. cibarius may infect human tissue.
		Coinfection of the cornea and the sclera with 2 different species of fungi is
		likely to follow a complex clinical course.

PG	-	1
LID	-	10.1186/s12907-017-0040-5 [doi]
LID	-	1
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Mycetoma is a chronic granulomatous infectious disease caused by
		filamentous bacteria or by fungi. The disease is endemic in certain tropical and
		subtropical areas of the world but can be found elsewhere posing sometimes a
		diagnostic challenge for clinicians. CASE PRESENTATION: A 65-year- old man
		"presented with a right foot swelling evolving for 25 years. During that time,"
		several diagnosis and treatments have been made without any improvement. The
		"disease spread to bones, and misdiagnosed as Kaposi's sarcoma. Transtibial"
		"amputation has been performed, and the histopathological examination revealed"
		finally the diagnosis of eumycotic mycetoma. The patient recovered well after
		surgery and orthopedic prosthesis was prescribed for him. CONCLUSION: Mycetoma in
		non endemic areas is usually misdiagnosed and mismanaged leading to unnecessary
		and inappropriate surgery. Health practitioners should be aware of that fact in
		order to provide an accurate management.

LID	-	10.1016/j.jpra.2021.10.010 [doi]
AB	-	Infections caused by opportunistic fungal organisms such as Scedosporium spp.
		have been increasingly recognized over the last few decades. Most affected
		"patients are immunocompromised or critically ill, but Scedosporium spp."
		"infections have also been described in immunocompetent patients, such as"
		localized disease from direct inoculation or in near-drowning events. We describe
		a case of a patient with no known underlying immune impairment who experienced
		significant infection with Scedosporium apiospermum at both sites of breast
		"augmentation. Once identified, the choice of therapeutics can be challenging"
		given the intrinsic resistance and variable activity of different antifungal
		"agents; however, other factors also impact the outcome of this infection such as"
		"the host immune status. Thus, both the recognition and treatment of Scedosporium"
		infections can be challenging.

TI	-	"Onychomycosis in white line disease in horses: pathology, mycology and clinical"
		features.
PG	-	27-35
AB	-	This paper describes onychomycosis in horses and reports the pathological
		"findings, associated fungi and incidence of concurrent white line disease. In"
		"addition to these observations, relevance between post mortem and clinical"
		findings of onychomycosis are discussed in 3 necropsied horses. Samples were
		collected from 100 hooves from a total of 51 Thoroughbreds suffering from white
		"line disease. Of these, 15 hooves from 13 horses were also complicated with"
		severe hoof wall fissure formation. Preparations from the same samples were used
		both for histopathology and for culture to identify the associated fungi.
		Onychomycosis was diagnosed when it could be confirmed histologically. Fungal
		identification was based on morphological characteristics in culture and the
		associated fungi were determined by comparison with culture morphology. As a
		"result, 10 samples collected from horses were diagnosed as suffering from"
		onychomycosis. Seven of these showed complicating severe inner hoof wall fissures
		"and the soil fungus Scedosporium apiospermum or the teleomorph of this fungus,"
		"i.e., Pseudallescheria boydii, was isolated. The fungus was found to be"
		"ubiquitous in the fissure cavities, the terminal horn of the white line and the"
		terminal horn-like laminae of the metaplastic white line-like tissue. It can be
		concluded that onychomycosis frequently causes white line disease and/or makes it
		"worse. Associated with deterioration of the submural condition, the main"
		"associated fungus for onychomycosis in this series, was Genus Scedosporium and"
		the most susceptible region was the terminal horn of the hypertrophied white line
		and/or the terminal horn-like laminae of the metaplastic white line-like tissue.

TI	-	Disseminated ochroconis gallopavum infection in a renal transplant recipient: the
		first reported case and a review of the literature.
PG	-	415-23
AB	-	Ochroconis gallopavum is a potentially fatal dematiaceous fungus causing
		opportunistic infections in immunocompromised hosts. We report the first case of
		"disseminated O. gallopavum infection in a 13-year-old renal transplant recipient,"
		"which involved the brain, lung and spleen. He was treated with amphotericin B,"
		"itraconazole and voriconazole, a new antifungal agent first used to treat such an"
		"infection. Besides antifungal treatment, all immunosuppressive agents were"
		stopped and automated peritoneal dialysis was resumed. The initial infection was
		under control with both clinical and radiological improvements after treatment.
		"However, the patient later acquired Acremonium spp. peritonitis; he failed to"
		"respond to high-dose amphotericin B, and finally succumbed. A total of 13"
		"reported O. gallopavum human infections, including the one described here, are"
		reviewed. The most common site of involvement is the brain and the crude
		mortality rate is up to 46%. As the disease is potentially lethal in
		"immunocompromised hosts, empirical antifungal coverage should be considered in"
		post-renal transplant recipients with suspected brain abscess. Early biopsy of
		lesion for histopathological and microbiological diagnosis would be essential in
		managing such cases.

AB	-	Voriconazole is a broad-spectrum triazole antifungal used to treat invasive
		fungal infections. It is commonly used prophylactically in immunocompromized
		"patient cohorts, including transplant recipients. Diffuse periostitis is a very"
		rare complication of chronic voriconazole use. It is associated with diffuse bone
		"pain, elevated serum alkaline phosphatase and fluorine levels. Characteristic"
		"imaging findings include periosteal thickening with a dense, nodular, irregular"
		and often bilateral pattern. We describe the case of a 71-year-old female who
		presented with multifocal bone pain six years following double lung
		transplantation. Her post transplantation course had been complicated by a life
		"threatening episode of sepsis secondary to Scedosporium apiospermum, a rare"
		invasive fungal infection following which lifelong prophylaxis with oral
		Voriconazole was commenced. We discuss the characteristic clinical and imaging
		manifestations of this rare condition.

PG	-	253-9
AB	-	We report a case of endogenous endophthalmitis due to a sporodochial-forming
		species of Phialemonium curvatum. The infection led to the enucleation of the
		"affected eye, but there was no evidence of systemic dissemination. The isolated"
		"P. curvatum produced aggregates of phialides, many occurring on coils or in"
		"verticils, which eventually develop into sporodochia. The initial and"
		post-enucleation isolates revealed they were identical to strains of P. curvatum
		from Israel causing disseminated disease in patients practicing intracavernous
		autoinjections for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. The reported case had
		unusual clinical and microbiological features. Despite the route of acquisition
		"and the lack of systemic antifungal therapy, the infection did not spread beyond"
		"the eye. The morphology of the phialides aggregates was also unique, and the"
		distinction between Volutella and Acremonium is discussed. This case expands the
		"spectrum of infections due to Phialemonium species, and reveals a novel way of"
		developing fungal endophthalmitis.

LID	-	3
AB	-	Medicopsis romeroi phaeohyphomycosis is increasingly reported in
		immunocompromised patients living in or originating from tropical and subtropical
		areas. We report a case of subcutaneous phaeohyphomycosis caused by M. romeroi in
		a 56-year-old Malian woman residing in France for 20 years. She developed a small
		nodule on her dominant hand's ring finger 15 months after starting
		immunosuppressive medications for paraneoplastic dermatomyositis. A first
		surgical debridement was followed by a local recurrence. Despite a second
		"surgical excision combined with posaconazole treatment, the infection recurred"
		one year after antifungal therapy discontinuation. A wide excision was performed
		"again, and antifungal therapy was resumed and maintained for six months,"
		resulting in the absence of relapse during the 18 months following the surgery.
		"This case highlighted the high risk of relapse in immunocompromised patients,"
		suggesting the need for long-term follow-up and prolonged antifungal treatment
		following surgical excision in cases with sustained immunosuppression. The
		literature review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines and included 51
		scientific publications. A noteworthy predominance of the subcutaneous
		"phaeohyphomycosis presentation was found in immunocompromised patients, whereas"
		eumycetoma had been reported in apparently healthy individuals. A combination of
		complete excision with antifungal treatment seemed to confer the best outcome.

		(CAPD).
PG	-	425-9
AB	-	Peritonitis is a frequent complication in patients with chronic renal failure on
		continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) treatment. The aim of this study
		"was to know the prevalence of fungal peritonitis on patients undergoing CAPD, and"
		to determine the antifungal susceptibility pattern of the identified isolates.
		Samples of the peritoneal dialysis fluid from 165 patients on CAPD treatment with
		peritonitis manifestations were submitted to mycological study (direct
		"microscopic examination, culture and antifungal susceptibility test). Ten Candida"
		"isolates were identified, being C. albicans and C. parapsilosis the most common"
		"species. From isolates obtained, three species (C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, and"
		C. guilliermondii) presented itraconazole resistance while C. glabrata was
		resistant to both itraconazole and ketoconazole. Aspergillus fumigatus was
		associated to peritonitis in three cases and Acremonium sp. in two.

AB	-	Tracheoesophageal vocal prostheses (TVP) in laryngectomized patients commonly
		"deteriorate due to overgrowth by yeasts, particularly Candida species. We"
		describe the first case of colonization of such devices by a member of the
		Fusarium solani species complex in a patient with a history of glottal carcinoma.
		"Three isolates, from three prostheses, were found morphologically consistent with"
		the traditional picture of F. solani. Ribosomal sequence analysis showed that the
		"isolates belonged to a distinct, as yet apparently unnamed phylogenetic species"
		"within the F. solani species complex. This species, one of two distinct genetic"
		types (genotype 2) traditionally considered part of the plant-pathogenic subtaxon
		"Fusarium solani f. sp. radicicola, has not previously been identified as an agent"
		"of human or animal disease, although it is closely related to a known etiologic"
		"agent of mycetoma, an Acremonium-like species recently renamed Fusarium"
		falciforme. Sequence and multisatellite M13 polymorphism analysis revealed no
		distinctions among the case isolates. Production of cyclosporine was detected for
		all three case isolates.

		voriconazole after failure of natamycin.
PG	-	1139-42
LID	-	10.1345/aph.1M008 [doi]
AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To report successful management of Scedosporium apiospermum
		(previously known as Monosporium apiospermum) keratitis with topical voriconazole
		as monotherapy. CASE SUMMARY: A 54-year-old previously well woman presented to
		"the emergency department with a painful, injected right eye. There was no history"
		"of trauma or use of contact lenses. On examination, the right eye was estimated"
		to have visual acuity of hand movement. Slit lamp examination detected a 2.5 x
		"3.5 mm dense, central corneal infiltrate with overlying epithelial defect. The"
		eye had mild corneal edema with anterior chamber inflammation. Microbiology
		testing revealed S. apiospermum as the primary pathogen. Hourly administration of
		"topical natamycin 5% resulted in initial improvement in visual acuity to 20/50,"
		"with reduction in the size of the central infiltrate. However, 1 month later, the"
		"eye infection relapsed, with recurrence of epithelial defect (3.1 x 3.1 mm) and"
		decline in visual acuity to 20/100. Antifungal therapy was switched to topical
		"voriconazole 1%, administered every 2 hours. Vision improved to 20/30 within 5"
		"days, and the central defect had completely re-epithelialized within 1 week."
		DISCUSSION: Treatment of S. apiospermum keratitis remains inadequate. A high
		natamycin minimum inhibitory concentration is necessary to treat S. apiospermum
		"infection, which may explain the persistence of central infiltration despite"
		ongoing therapy. The combined use of topical and oral voriconazole for the
		"treatment of S. apiospermum keratitis has been reported. However, this is the"
		first report of a successful clinical experience using topical voriconazole
		without oral therapy to manage S. apiospermum keratitis. This eliminates some
		"disadvantages associated with oral voriconazole such as high cost, potential"
		"significant toxicity, and drug interactions. CONCLUSIONS: The voriconazole 1% eye"
		"drop used alone is a promising, cost-effective, safe option for managing fungal"
		"keratitis, even that caused by S. apiospermum. It may have a larger role to play"
		than simply that of adjunctive therapy.

		related to Exophiala eye infections.
PG	-	566
LID	-	10.1186/s12879-020-05294-y [doi]
LID	-	566
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Subtenon injection of triamcinolone acetonide (STTA) has been widely
		adopted in the clinical setting of ophthalmology and its infectious complications
		"are rare. However, orbital abscess following STTA has been reported in seven"
		"cases. Furthermore, although eye infections due to Exophiala species are"
		"uncommon, there have been 19 cases to date. E. jeanselmei, E. phaeomuriformis, E."
		"werneckii, and E. dermatitidis have been reported to cause human eye infections;"
		"however, to the best of our knowledge, orbital abscess caused by E. dermatitidis"
		has not yet been reported. We describe the first documented case of fungal
		orbital abscess caused by E. dermatitidis following STTA. We also review the
		"related literature of orbital abscess following STTA, as well as eye infections"
		caused by the four Exophiala species. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was a
		69-year-old Japanese woman with diabetic mellitus. She had a macular oedema in
		"her right eye, which occurred secondary to branch retinal vein occlusion. An"
		orbital abscess caused by E. dermatitidis occurred 4 months after the second STTA
		"for the macular oedema, which was successfully treated by a surgical debridement"
		and systemic administration of voriconazole. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings in the
		patient and from our literature survey caution ophthalmologists to the fact that
		"STTA can cause fungal orbital infections, especially in diabetic patients."
		"Furthermore, surgical treatment is one of the most important risk factors."

		variotii.
PG	-	711-3
LID	-	10.1111/j.1365-4632.2012.05761.x [doi]
AB	-	BACKGROUND: Hyalohyphomycosis is a rare opportunistic fungal infection caused by
		"saprophytes of genera such as Fusarium, Paecilomyces, Scedosporium, Penicillium,"
		"Scopulariopsis Acremonium, and similar fungi. The literature includes only one"
		previous report of Paecilomyces variotii human infection and very few reports of
		subcutaneous mycosis caused by any of the hyalohyphomycosis group of fungi.
		"METHODS: We report an instance of fungal infection in a 50-year-old woman, known"
		"to have diabetes, who presented with multiple raised lesions on the upper back of"
		"two years' duration. Dermatological examination revealed a 20 × 22-cm, swollen,"
		"indurated area on the upper back with multiple violaceous, exophytic nodules on"
		the surface. RESULTS: Microscopy from pus and tissue smear revealed septate
		branching fungi. Periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain was positive for fungal
		elements. Culture on three occasions yielded P. variotii. Slide culture mounts
		showed septate hyaline hyphae of P. variotii with elongated phialides
		demonstrating bulbous bases and tapering apices attached to the conidiophores.
		"The patient was treated with itraconazole, to which she responded well."
		CONCLUSIONS: This is the first reported case of subcutaneous hyalohyphomycosis
		caused by P. variotii. It appears that this relatively rare fungal pathogen may
		be starting to assert itself as an important cause of infection in humans.

AB	-	STUDY DESIGN: Case report. OBJECTIVE: We report a rare case of fungal vertebral
		osteomyelitis in a tsunami survivor of the Great East Japan Earthquake. SUMMARY
		OF BACKGROUND DATA: Fungal vertebral osteomyelitis due to Scedosporium
		apiospermum (S. apiospermum) is extremely rare. We describe the case of a
		45-year-old male who developed vertebral osteomyelitis by S. apiospermum 1 month
		after near drowning in the huge tsunami after the Great East Japan Earthquake.
		METHODS: The patient was treated with a combination of percutaneous
		posterolateral endoscopic debridement and antifungal therapy. The case was
		"evaluated with radiography and computed tomography, and his white blood cell"
		count and C-reactive protein level in serum were measured 20 months after
		initiation of treatment. RESULTS: The patient had no low back pain and both white
		blood cell count and C-reactive protein had remained normal. Radiographs and
		computed tomography of lumbar spine demonstrated sclerotic change of endplates
		and spur formation bridging the L3 and L4 vertebral bodies. CONCLUSION: We report
		a rare case of the fungal vertebral osteomyelitis caused by S. apiospermum. If a
		patient develops severe back pain after a near-drowning episode in dirty water
		"such as a swamp or a river, the clinician should be suspicious of the possibility"
		of fungal spondylitis by S. apiospermum.

TI	-	Multiple rare opportunistic and pathogenic fungi in persistent foot skin
		infection.
PG	-	208-18
AB	-	Persistent superficial skin infection caused by multiple fungi is rarely
		"reported. Recently, a number of fungi, both opportunistic and persistent in"
		nature were isolated from the foot skin of a 24-year old male in Malaysia. The
		"fungi were identified as Candida parapsilosis, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, Phoma"
		"spp., Debaryomyces hansenii, Acremonium spp., Aureobasidium pullulans and"
		"Aspergillus spp., This is the first report on these opportunistic strains were"
		co-isolated from a healthy individual who suffered from persistent foot skin
		infection which was diagnosed as athlete's foot for more than 12 years. Among the
		"isolated fungi, C. parapsilosis has been an increasingly common cause of skin"
		infections. R. mucilaginosa and D. hansenii were rarely reported in cases of skin
		"infection. A. pullulans, an emerging fungal pathogen was also being isolated in"
		"this case. Interestingly, it was noted that C. parapsilosis, R. mucilaginosa, D."
		hansenii and A. pullulans are among the common halophiles and this suggests the
		association of halotolerant fungi in causing persistent superficial skin
		infection. This discovery will shed light on future research to explore on
		effective treatment for inhibition of pathogenic halophiles as well as to
		understand the interaction of multiple fungi in the progress of skin infection.

PG	-	354-61
AB	-	We reviewed 15 cases of culture-proven corneal superinfections in 15 patients
		(eight men and seven women ranging in age from 41 to 86 years) with recurrent
		herpes simplex keratitis. The factors that appeared to increase the risk of
		"superinfection were the presence of an epithelial defect (found in all 15 cases),"
		"a history of recurrent herpetic keratouveitis (found in ten cases), and the use"
		of topical corticosteroids (found in 13 cases). Eight of the 15 patients were
		"taking antibiotics at the time the superinfections were diagnosed, indicating"
		that topical antibiotics do not provide sufficient protection. Gram-negative rods
		"were found in six cases (Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia"
		"marcescens, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, and Achromobacter sp.)."
		"Gram-positive organisms, often in association with another infecting agent, were"
		"found in six cases (Staphylococcus epidermidis, three cases; S. aureus, two"
		"cases; and Streptococcus sp., two cases). Fungal superinfections were found in"
		"three cases (Cephalosporium acremonium, Candida albicans, and Aspergillus"
		"fumigatus, one case each). Mycobacterium cheloni was found in two cases."

TI	-	Unusual aspects of allergic bronchopulmonary fungal disease: report of two cases
		due to Curvularia organisms associated with allergic fungal sinusitis.
PG	-	1240-8
AB	-	We report two cases of allergic bronchopulmonary fungal disease (ABPFD) caused by
		Curvularia sp and associated with allergic fungal sinusitis (AFS). Curvularia
		lunata was cultured in one case and Curvularia senegalensis was cultured in the
		"other. Based on these cases and a review of the literature, we discuss unusual"
		clinical and pathologic features that can occur in ABPFD. Unusual clinical
		"aspects of ABPFD include associated AFS, absence of asthma, progression to"
		"Churg-Strauss angiitis and granulomatosis, concomitant hypersensitivity"
		"pneumonitis, and underlying cystic fibrosis. Atypical pathologic features that"
		"may occur in ABPFD include follicular bronchiolitis, xanthomatous bronchiolitis,"
		"limited tissue invasion, fungus balls, and association with unusual fungi."
		Prominent follicular bronchiolitis and xanthomatous bronchiolitis were misleading
		histologic features in one of our cases and led to a delay in recognition of the
		diagnosis. Both patients presented primarily with AFS; ABPFD was detected
		subsequently. This suggests that a small subset of patients with AFS may be at
		risk for ABPFD. The goal of this review is to increase awareness of unusual
		clinical and pathologic manifestations of ABPFD. It is hoped that this will
		"result in accurate diagnosis and proper therapy, especially for patients who"
		present with atypical features. Unusual fungal species should be considered in
		patients who have clinical findings compatible with ABPFD but who do not
		"demonstrate immunologic reactivity to Aspergillus sp, especially Aspergillus"
		"fumigatus. In addition, ABPFD should be considered in patients with AFS who"
		develop new pulmonary lesions.

TI	-	Recurrent fungal keratitis and endophthalmitis.
PG	-	558-60
AB	-	PURPOSE: To report a case of recurrent fungal sclerokeratitis and endophthalmitis
		with a very successful outcome due to aggressive combined surgical and medical
		therapy. To discuss the management of this potentially devastating infection.
		METHODS: A 65-year-old man presented with 6 months of left eye redness and
		"irritation after injury from organic matter propelled from an airboat. Initially,"
		"he had been treated with foreign body removal, antibiotics, and steroids. He was"
		diagnosed with reactive sclerokeratitis at presentation and was treated with
		"steroids. However, when he did not improve, cultures were obtained and Acremonium"
		species filamentous fungi was identified. Despite treatment with appropriate
		"topical and systemic antifungals, his fungal sclerokeratitis progressed to"
		endophthalmitis. Two therapeutic penetrating keratoplasties (PKs) with iridectomy
		and intraocular amphotericin B were necessary to eradicate the fungal infection.
		RESULTS: Visual acuity was restored to 20/25-3 with correction 9 months after
		initial presentation. There was no recurrence of fungal infection after the
		second therapeutic PK. CONCLUSION: The possible reasons for recurrence of fungal
		infection are discussed. The role of timely and aggressive medical and surgical
		intervention for fungal sclerokeratitis and endophthalmitis in restoring
		excellent vision is emphasized.

TI	-	Voriconazole in the treatment of invasive mold infections in transplant
		recipients.
PG	-	408-13
AB	-	Mortality due to invasive mold infections in solid organ transplant recipients is
		"very high despite therapy with amphotericin B, including lipid formulations."
		"Voriconazole is a triazole with a good activity against molds, including"
		"Aspergillus spp. and Scedosporium spp. Experience with voriconazole is limited,"
		but preliminary results in patients with these infections are promising. Reported
		here is the experience with voriconazole administered on a compassionate-use
		basis to five patients with invasive mold infections: four solid organ recipients
		and one patient with an autoimmune disorder. Four patients had invasive
		"Aspergillus fumigatus infection (3 lung infections, 1 abdominal infection) and"
		one had invasive ocular Scedosporium apiospermum infection. The MIC of
		voriconazole was < or =1 microg/ml for all isolates (NCCLS performance standards
		"for microdilution assay, proposed standard M38-P). Voriconazole was administered"
		"as primary therapy in a patient with Scedosporium infection and, in patients with"
		"Aspergillus infections, after persistence of positive culture despite a"
		cumulative dose of 3 g of a lipid formulation of amphotericin B. Voriconazole was
		"administered for a median time of 80 days (range, 60-90 days). No visual"
		"disturbances were observed, but one patient presented a moderate increase in"
		liver enzymes. An increase in the levels of immunosuppressive drugs (tacrolimus
		or cyclosporine) was detected in all patients during coadministration with
		voriconazole. A clinical response was observed in all patients (complete
		"response, n=3; partial response, n=2), and a microbiological response was"
		"observed in all but one patient. Furthermore, a good relationship between the MIC"
		of voriconazole and outcome was observed. Voriconazole is an effective and safe
		therapy for treatment of invasive mold infections in solid organ recipients. To
		"avoid toxicity with this drug, however, the dosing of immunosuppressive drugs"
		must be reduced.

AB	-	OBJECTIVE: To report the successful treatment of external ventricular-drain
		(EVD)-associated infection due to vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE)
		with intraventricular daptomycin and intravenous linezolid. CASE SUMMARY: A
		64-year-old white male with a complicated medical history was admitted to the
		neurosurgical unit with Scedosporium apiospermum meningitis and hydrocephalus
		"requiring management with a right and left EVD. On day 28, cerebrospinal fluid"
		cultures from the right EVD grew VRE. Despite initiation of intravenous
		"linezolid, cultures from the right EVD remained positive. Intraventricular"
		daptomycin 5 mg daily was initiated and administered into the right EVD for 7
		days. Cerebrospinal fluid was collected from EVD outputs and analyzed for
		daptomycin concentrations. VRE in cultures from the EVD cleared after 1 day of
		therapy and no adverse effects were noted. Right and left EVD daptomycin
		concentrations were discordant throughout therapy by at least a 3-fold
		difference. First-dose peak and trough daptomycin concentrations in the
		"cerebrospinal fluid were 112.2 and 1.34 μg/mL, respectively, for the right EVD"
		"and 37.4 and 0.37 μg/mL, respectively, for the left EVD. Daptomycin accumulation"
		was evident after 3 days of therapy. DISCUSSION: Varying doses and frequencies of
		intraventricular daptomycin have been reported effective for VRE ventriculitis.
		Intraventricular drug distribution may not be homogeneous throughout the central
		"nervous system. Therefore, daptomycin minimum inhibitory concentration for VRE,"
		"cerebrospinal fluid communication throughout the central nervous system, EVD"
		"output, and the potential for drug accumulation should be considered when"
		selecting a dose and frequency. CONCLUSIONS: Intraventricular daptomycin may be
		an option for EVD-associated VRE infections that do not respond to conventional
		therapy. Intraventricular daptomycin 5 mg is a reasonable initial dose in adults
		"with VRE ventriculitis, based on our experience in this patient."
